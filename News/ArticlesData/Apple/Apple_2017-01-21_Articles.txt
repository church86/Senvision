The FTC has charged Qualcomm with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of baseband processors used in cellular phones. Here is Qualcomm's full statement: ----- “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. ----- Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Menu Home Cars Technology Gaming Entertainment Sport From The Press X Home Technology Apple AirPods – 10 Cool Facts You Didn’t Know Apple AirPods – 10 Cool Facts You Didn’t Know Petar Mitrovic | Technology | If you plan to purchase new Apple AirPods or you have already got a pair just like thousands of other people, we are going to show you some very cool features, which you might be unaware of. When the AirPods went on sale, many believed that they are too expensive, but as you will see, it is worth it to pay that amount of money for these earphones. 10. AirPods and Bluetooth device The majority of people seems to believe that AirPods can be paired only with iPhones and iPads because of the fact that they use special wireless technology enabled by the W1 chip. The W1 is here so that you can connect your AirPads more easily with the Apple devices, but in its core, AirPods can actually be paired with any Bluetooth device. 9. AirPods’ remaining charge In order to see how much charge your AirPods have left, they need to be connected to your iPhone. While connected, open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom and then go over to the music tab. There, you will be able to check the battery status of your AirPods. Source:bgr.com 8. AirPods’ remaining charge on the battery widget Also Read: Google Home VS Amazon Echo There is another way for you to see how much battery is left in your AirPods. You just need to add the battery widget to the widgets page of your device and with one tap and one swipe you will see the battery status. If you added battery widget, but you cannot find it on the list, all you need to do is tap the “show more” link and you will find it there. 7. AirPods’ remaining charge by opening the case next to your iPhone If you own the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and you want to check the remaining charge, you can do it in a really simple way. The only thing you need to do is open the case next to your phone and you will see this: 6. AirPods’ remaining charge on your Apple Watch Also Read: Apple AirPods - Deal You Shouldn't Miss If you have an Apple Watch you can also use it to see the battery status of your AirPads. When your earphones are connected to your iPhone, go to the home screen of your Apple Watch and just swipe up from the bottom. Next thing you need to do is just tap the battery button. 5. Rename your AirPods Go to the Settings on the iPhone and then tap Bluetooth. After that find the “i” icon, select it, and then you will see the “Name” field on the next page. 4. AirPods’ double-tap function can be changed The section that is named “double-tap on AirPods” is located on the same screen within the AirPods settings. You can set your double-tap to play, pause, answer or hang up and this can be used instead of Siri. The double-tap option can also be turned off completely. 3. Transferring voice calls automatically Source:indabaa.com If you want to transfer your voice calls from the iPhone to your AirPods automatically, you can do it by finding the “Automatic Ear Detection” in the Settings app and toggle it on. When this option is on, you can forward a voice call from your device to your earphones by putting only one in your ear. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 - News and Updates 2. Adjusting volume via Apple Watch’s digital crown You can adjust the volume on your AirPods, and you can do it with your Apple Watch. Go to the Music app on the Apple Watch and all you need to do is twist the digital crown in either direction. Note that the music needs to be streaming to your AirPods in order for this to work properly. 1. AirPods contactless wireless charging doesn’t exist Although so many people believe that the charging case comes with contactless wireless charging, this is not correct. The AirPods are really cool, but the metal tip at the bottom of each is used to touch charging contacts when the AirPods are in the case, so they are not here just to improve the design and the looks of it.

This might finally be changing later this year, as a new rumor suggests that the upcoming iOS 11 will have FaceTime supporting group video calls. While we’re still several months away from iOS 11’s likely debut at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, a group call feature would have FaceTime catching up with rival platforms such as Skype and Google Hangouts. The report of this rumor comes from the Israel-based website The Verifier, which admittedly doesn’t have a track record when it comes to Apple news. However, the site says it has heard from “several people familiar with iOS development,” and that some of the work on iOS 11 is being done in Israel. As for FaceTime’s group video calling feature itself, it’s said that it will support up to five users at once, with calls able to be started from group conversations in iMessage. With iOS 10’s focus on overhauling iMessage, introducing long-missing features such as stickers, apps, and animations, it’s easy to see Apple upgrading FaceTime in a similar, social-heavy manner. We’ve heard very little about iOS 11 details, so this rumor should be taken with a grain of salt. However, group video calls have long been a request of iOS and macOS users, so if this turns out to be true, it will make plenty of people happy.

Now, the chipmaker has responded by saying Apple’s claims are “baseless” and encourages “regulatory attacks.” Here’s Qualcomm’s full statement: “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. Up until 2016 with the iPhone 7, Qualcomm was the sole supplier for the LTE chips found in the iPhone. With the latest iPhone, in addition to Qualcomm, Intel began manufacturing LTE chips for the iPhone. Apple says that Qualcomm forced the company to use its chip and pay back a percentage of the phone’s selling price in return to access its patents.

OTOH, after reading both articles, Apple may actually have a point as Qualcomm is well known for attacking anyone and everyone like a patent troll, but in their case they own something like a third to half the patents to most everything electronic you use every day! (And they did develop them.) The most telling example of how extreme it is is that Qualcomm and others’ patents are why the Chinese developed TD-LTE. At the end of the day, though, it’s all about the pot calling the kettle black.

It's been another thrilling week across the tech world, with a seemingly endless torrent of news, insights and spicy rumors pouring in at a relentless pace. But as always, 7 Days is here to brief you on what's been happening, with a handy walkthrough of the week's top tech news. Our journey begins this week in the United States, where AT&T revealed that it had quietly terminated its 2G mobile network at the beginning of the year. Bad news for those still using their original iPhones. Image: BBC News Shortly before Donald J Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the Electronic Frontier Foundation set out its agenda to fight for the rights of citizens under the new administration, as they believe that privacy, digital freedoms, and accountability over mass surveillance are all under threat. Image: Rudaw.net Meanwhile, a report published this week highlighted the threat of ISIS, terrorists of the so-called Islamic State, using commercial drones as delivery mechanisms to drop bombs and grenades on targets remotely. China is planning to build its first prototype of an exascale supercomputer this year, capable of a quintillion operations per second. (That's a lot of zeroes.) Image: United Nations University As computing power grows, and computing devices become ever more ubiquitous, the problem of e-waste is continuing to increase. The United Nations highlighted the problem this week, noting that e-waste in east and southeast Asia has risen by 63% in the last five years. Over in the UK, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced a new version of its hugely popular micro-computer. The Compute Model 3 is ten times more powerful than the original version, and includes 1GB of RAM and a 1.2GHz processor, but costs no more than $30. Earlier this week, BT announced a new 'junk voicemail' service for landline phones to tackle the rise of nuisance calls, calling it the first of its kind in the UK. Rival service provider TalkTalk later told Neowin that BT's claim was nonsense, and that TalkTalk been providing a near-identical service for the last three years. BT then went on to give its customers the middle finger, as it announced another wave of phone and broadband price increases - for the third time in just 16 months. One consumer telecoms advice service described the price rises, and BT's weak justification for them, as "absurd". There was more bad news for Brits as Apple raised its App Store prices by 25% due to the weakness of the pound sterling against the US dollar, which followed the UK's decision to exit the European Union in its 'Brexit' referendum last year. Apple is reportedly preparing to launch new 12-inch MacBooks with Intel's latest 7th-generation processors and up to 16GB of RAM, while the MacBook Pro line will also get a processor refresh, and the option of 32GB of 'desktop-class' RAM. It's been a dreadful week for processor giant Qualcomm. Apple is suing the company, claiming that it has 'withheld' nearly $1 billion in payments "as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them". It followed a probe by the US Federal Trade Commission, which led the FTC to announce that it is suing Qualcomm for alleged anti-competitive practices and 'bullying' tactics against manufacturers in the mobile industry. After the collapse of Cyanogen in recent weeks, its spiritual successor, Lineage OS, outlined its plans to bring its operating system to over 80 devices, promising weekly updates with support for Android Marshmallow- and Nougat-capable devices. It looks like the first two devices to launch with Google's new Android Wear 2.0 OS on board will be from LG. The new smartwatches are expected to debut alongside the official launch of the OS next month. Just two months after its launch, Google has slashed 38% off the price of its Daydream View virtual reality headset. The extraordinary length of the discount - around five weeks - has led to speculation that sales of the device have been less than stellar. Android One is Google's initiative to offer capable and well-specced smartphones at low prices. The program was initially intended for emerging markets, but Google later admitted that it had "not delivered to expectations". Now, it seems that the company is planning to launch Android One in the United States. Earlier this week, ZTE announced a beta program for its ZMax Pro, apparently preparing to upgrade the handset from Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow to Android 7.0 Nougat. But the company later clarified that it does "not have any plans to push Android Nougat" to the device, and said the beta is intended to help it improve its existing software. But plenty of other devices are getting a taste of that sweet Nougat goodness: Android 7.0 heads to Huawei's Honor 8 Nvidia Shield TV gets Nougat update, including 4K support Months late, Nougat available for unlocked HTC One A9 HTC 10 and One M9 will get Android 7.0 in Europe this month Sony rolls out Android 7.0 to the Xperia Z5 family, the Xperia Z4 Tablet, and the Xperia Z3+ Lenovo Moto Z to get Nougat next month; Z Play upgrade coming in March Android 7.0 reaches Galaxy S7 and S7 edge in the UK Samsung also announced the list of its Galaxy devices which are confirmed to get the Android 7.0 update in the first half of this year. Curiously, some Galaxy S7 and S7 edge owners have reported that after installing the Nougat update, their screen resolution had defaulted from Quad HD to the lower Full HD. No need to panic though - there's an easy fix for that. The Galaxy Note7, of course, won't be upgraded to Android 7.0, as Samsung has recalled all of those devices around the world. The company will finally announce the findings of its investigation into the issues that caused some of its Note7 handsets to catch fire and explode, in a global livestream on January 23. Sources say that Samsung is expected to reveal that the problem was related to the devices' batteries. I'm shocked. Shocked. Samsung might be interested in new technology developed by researchers at Stanford University, with 'self-extinguishing' capabilities that can automatically put out a lithium-ion battery fire in just 0.4 seconds. Meanwhile, Samsung launched its new Galaxy C7 Pro, a premium mid-range handset with a Snapdragon 625 SoC, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage... and a liquid cooling system. For some reason, the device will also ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, rather than Nougat. HMD Global's first Nokia-branded Android phone went on sale on Thursday, and sold out within just one minute. HMD said that the "next exciting chapter in the Nokia consumer story" will be revealed next month at Mobile World Congress. Microsoft was awarded a patent this week for a foldable mobile device that can open up into a larger tablet-style device, fuelling rampant speculation over its 'Surface phone' plans. It also requested the renewal of a 2010 patent for a device with multiple displays that can separate into two separate devices. It's pretty obvious that Microsoft's Windows phone range is reaching the end of the line, particularly when you see examples like its UK store, where every Lumia model has been out of stock for weeks, and even months in one case. And yet, after all stocks of its Windows 10 Mobile range were depleted in the US - and its Lumia 650 was even removed from the store completely - the company suddenly found some more stock of its devices earlier this week. Acer's Windows 10 Mobile flagship, the Liquid Jade Primo, has also been removed from the Microsoft Store in the US, just six months after going on sale there. Alcatel's flagship-class IDOL 4S with Windows 10 launched exclusively on T-Mobile in November, but received an 8% price cut last week. This week, an unlocked model went on sale on the Microsoft Store in the US, followed by Canada a few days later. Almost three months after they were unveiled in the US, Microsoft's Surface Mouse and Surface Keyboard went on sale in the UK and Germany this week. However, there's no sign yet of the new Surface Ergonomic Keyboard in those markets. And amid rumors that it's planning to launch new versions of both devices in the coming months, Microsoft slashed 15% off select Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 models in the UK. It's been offering similarly chunky discounts on the two devices in the US for several weeks. Microsoft released its first firmware update for its new Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC on Tuesday - but as usual, it didn't bother to tell anyone what was in the update until over 24 hours later. It was a similar story for the Surface Pro 4's latest firmware update, with a changelog arriving long after the rollout began. *sigh* Microsoft also released a new Windows 10 Insider Preview, build 15014, for PCs and phones in the Fast ring. Thankfully, Microsoft is much better at detailing release notes for its Windows previews; you can find the fixes and known issues for PCs here, and those for phones are available here. However, there was some less welcome news in its announcement. The Apps Corner feature will be removed from Windows 10 Mobile in the Creators Update; and the promised My People experience - which was touted as a major feature at its Creators Update announcement event last year - has been delayed until the Redstone 3 update arrives in late 2017. Intriguingly, Microsoft is also bringing e-books to the Windows Store. Microsoft is also said to be working on a single, unified, 'adaptive shell' for Windows 10, which will be able to scale the OS across all types of device, rather than developing and maintaining separate shells for Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One, and other devices. The new Composable Shell isn't expected to arrive for a while, but it certainly raises some interesting questions about Microsoft's plans for Windows 10's future. However, Microsoft attracted criticism this week, as it emerged that the company is now inserting pop-up ads - masquerading as 'user tips' - for its products in Windows 10. On Thursday, Microsoft announced that it will end its support for the original Windows 10 release, Version 1507, in March. It's also bringing the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Version 1607, to the Volume Licensing Service Center later this month. After launching its Windows 10 Enterprise subscriptions last year, priced from $7 per user per year, Microsoft is now allowing those companies to "upgrade their Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs and devices to Windows 10 at no additional cost." The timing of that announcement was interesting, coming shortly after a Microsoft blog post encouraging businesses to upgrade to Windows 10, as it stated that Windows 7 "does not meet the requirements of modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments". Microsoft highlighted upcoming changes to its Office 365 platform in the coming months, some of which "may require admin action". It also announced new Office 365 features to support US Government Community Cloud Customers. It finally brought Office Lens to Apple's iPad too, as well as integrating Office Lens functionality into its productivity suite on Android devices, along with other new features. Microsoft announced its acquisition of Swedish company Simplygon, to boost its '3D for everyone' ambitions. It officially launched its HoloLens mixed reality headset in Japan, while it emerged that HoloLens has also been in testing with the Royal Australian Air Force. Fitness-tracking app Runtastic became the latest to ditch its support for Windows phones, citing the platform's low number of users. And Minecraft - which is owned by Microsoft's Mojang division - is also ending its development on Windows phones. And there was bad news for owners of Microsoft's Band 2 as well. Microsoft will no longer support use of its wearable device with Cortana on Android devices - a feature that it introduced just seven months ago. Earlier this month, two prototypes of Razer's stunning triple-display gaming notebook, Project Valerie, were stolen from its booth at CES 2017. The stolen devices briefly appeared on sale in China, priced at $21,700. If you're a fan of both gaming notebooks and games consoles, you might be interested in taking a closer look at this rather wonderful Xbox One S laptop. Last week, Microsoft announced details of its Xbox One Creators Update. A few days ago, we got our first glimpse of the changes on the way in a short video. A range of new games launched on the Xbox One this week, including Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Mega Battle, I Am Bread, and more. You can find out about more the new arrivals here. Microsoft also added three new Xbox 360 games to the list of those playable on the Xbox One through its backward compatibility program. Capcom confirmed that Resident Evil VII: Biohazard will support Microsoft's Xbox Play Anywhere program, so you'll be able to buy the game once and play it on both your Xbox One and Windows 10 PC. And Xbox Live Gold subscribers can now get Back to the Future: 30th Anniversary Edition with a huge discount, of up to 75%. The long wait for Super Mario Run on Android devices will soon be at an end. The mobile game will finally come to the Google Play Store in March. After Nintendo announced launch details of its new Switch hybrid gaming console last week, further details have emerged in recent days: Two million units will be ready for launch day If you want a Joy-Con Grip that keeps your controllers charged while you use them, you'll have to pay more You won't be able to keep that monthly 'free game download' There will be no media streaming apps for the Switch Switch will let you capture and share screenshots of your gameplay - but not video One of the most anticipated games for the new Switch console is Super Mario Odyssey, which brings the much-loved character to the metropolis of 'New Donk City'. However, a mash-up parody video has brought Mario to Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City, which includes the disturbing sight of the world's most famous plumber in a strip club. But alas, our journey around the tech world must come to an end - and this week, it does so in spectacular fashion. An irate customer - who wasn't entirely satisfied with the service she had received at a T-Mobile store in Palm Springs, Florida - returned the day after her initial visit to make her displeasure clear. However, rather than file a complaint with the manager, she allegedly smashed her car into the store, causing thousands of dollars' worth of damage, and injuring at least two employees. She told police that she was having a "bad day". No kidding. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Vlad Dudau published his review of the Elephone S7, an affordable Android handset that... has a few drawbacks. There's certainly a lot to like about the device, but there may be too many downsides to justify buying one. Shreyas Gandhe shared his review of Xiaomi's Redmi Pro, a high-end handset with dual rear cameras and a whopping ten-core processor. But did the device manage to match its remarkable spec sheet to an impressive performance in the real world? Robbie Khan put the Belkin Boost Up 15W Wireless Fast Charging Pad through its paces - but if you're considering buying one, you should definitely read his review, or you may end up disappointed... And Timi Cantisano shared his first impressions of the Honor 6X, which recently launched in the United States. Starting at $249, it certainly looks good on paper, and in the flesh, but what's it like to use? Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Apple is expected to unveil iOS 11 some time in 2017.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple it seems, will be finally introducing the group video calling for FaceTime with iOS 11 according to new rumors. The Verfier, an out of Israel technology blog, claims that Apple is planning to include the highly requested feature in FaceTime with iOS 11, to be released later in 2017. The blog cites people familiar with the process. "The next update, iOS 11, will include several new features, one of which is able to make a call multi-user video service FaceTime. According to information reaching the site, the next update for the iOS operating system 11, will be more Update 'social' that will put an emphasis primarily on chats on iMessage and FaceTime (translated)," notes the blog. Apple or any other report has not supported the Verfier reports so far. The report also claims that the group calling feature will be initiated in iDevices by updating the iMessage on the iOS platform. The group calling feature on FaceTime will supposedly support calling of up to five members. Currently, FaceTime supports only two users and has been doing that since its inception and introduction to the world back in 2010. Group video calling isn't a new concept that has been proposed recently to Apple. Back in 2015, popular sitcom Modern Family did show group FaceTime in one of its Apple-related episodes. Other video calling apps like Skype and Google Hangout have long integrated the group calling feature in their systems, although Google's latest video calling app DUO supports single user-to-user calling like FaceTime. Apple Sued Because Of FaceTime FaceTime already courts a lot of trouble as Apple has been slapped with a lawsuit that claims that a serious road accident occurred in Texas in 2014 due to FaceTime.   The lawsuit cited that Apple intentionally did not implement a patented technological feature in iPhones, which would have locked down FaceTime and prevented the user from deploying it while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," stated the complaint against Apple. During Christmas eve 2014, James and Bethanny Modisette were traveling on Interstate I-35 along with their two children, Isabella and Moriah. Another car slammed into the Modisette's car gravely injuring both children. Although both the kids were rushed to the nearby hospital, the little girl succumbed to her injuries and was declared dead. The accident took place because apparently, the driver in the other car was distracted by FaceTime, which was still running when the rescuers came to the accident scene. With Apple looking to integrate group video calling with the arrival of iOS 11, iDevice owners have much to look forward to. It is being predicted that Apple will reveal its iOS 11 and all other major updates at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 (WWDC), which is scheduled to be held in early June.

Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’.. Flow will suggest music based on your listening habits. You can also play unlimited playlists, tune into the radio and catch up on the news or sports, create your own playlists, and generally listen to some of the world’s leading musical icons. The Deezer app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. blinkbox Music A very basic app, blinkbox Music is an app specifically for android users.

It's widely rumored that Apple will be moving to a curved OLED display for its next generation iPhone. To accommodate the flexible OLED panel, Apple reportedly needs to make changes to the current 3D Touch sensor. Apple may switch to a film sensor from the current FPCB sensor in order to provide better 3D Touch user experience, as a film sensor offers higher sensitivity. Also, we expect the new OLED iPhone will come with a flexible OLED panel. To avoid deforming the form factor of the flexible OLED panel from touch operation pressure, a metal structural part will be placed under the film sensor to provide more robust structural support. Another feature rumored for Apple's new iPhone is a Touch ID sensor embedded into the display. Kuo says that the "under glass" design of the current sensor doesn't meet the requirements of "under panel" placement and so Apple is developing new Touch ID technology for the new iPhone "to complement its full-screen (zero bezel) form factor design and to enhance transactions security". Apple is purportedly aiming to switch from a capacitive type system to an optical type. Ultimately, Apple is allegedly planning to switch to a facial recognition system. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution." Judging by the bio-recognition patents that Apple has applied for, we believe it is leaning toward facial recognition technology rather than iris recognition. However, we note that the technical challenges of facial recognition include: (1) algorithms; (2) hardware design; and (3) the build-out of a database for verification and authentication, which could be time consuming. As such, before Apple can fully replace the fingerprint system with facial recognition, a combination of the two steps of bio-recognition could be a valid solution for enhancing transactions security. We've been hearing reports for some time that the 10th anniversary iPhone will be a major update. It will purportedly have a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display. Another report claims that the device would be a clear piece of glass with a next-generation OLED screen. More recently, Apple is said to have be equipping the phone with wireless charging and a 3D camera. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Now, a new report from Macotakara claims that we’re nearing the March 2017 opening of the center… The report says that Apple’s  R&D center in Japan will be its “first technical development site” in the area. The center is said to come in at 25,000-square-meters and be a central point for new product developments. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga praised Apple’s new R&D in a recent interview, saying that things like Apple’s development represent a huge opportunity for Japan and could trigger a bigger chance of other companies to do the same. Suga says “From now on, this will be the site where new products will be released not only within Japan but also to the world. Things like this bring us such a huge dream.” and expressed his expectation “for the establishment of the Apple site to trigger a big chance.” The research and development center is set to open in March.

Along with millions of music files, you can also share and download video files, images, and whatever other media which the app supports.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

It seems like it has compatible with all the versions. YouTube Music We all know YouTube. This app, however, is a tiny bit different to the great website. With this app, you get “A YouTube built just for music”. Basically, this form of YouTube cuts out the non-music videos, leaving you with only the music. There are ads just like the actual website, but it’s worth the short ads to use this great app. With this app you can also create personalised stations which will adapt to your likes over time.

Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend Apple-Qualcomm war: Chinese company sued for $1 billion over unfair royalties Apple alleged in its lawsuit that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in payments as retaliation for its co-operation to authorities. Raymond Ronamai   January 21, 2017 20:47 IST An Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016Reuters Apple has sued major mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of "charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." It came a few days after the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against the Chinese company claiming that its certain business practises are in violation of US competition law. The Cupertino giant alleged in its lawsuit that Qualcomm withheld nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for its co-operation with South Korean authorities in their investigation on the company. [READ: Qualcomm slapped with US antitrust suit for unfair trade practices] "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," said Apple in a statement. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." "To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," it added. Apple went on to say that its "disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty" for years has left it with no other option but to take up the legal course. However, Qualcomm has termed Apple's allegations as baseless. The company's executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in the statement that "Apple has intentionally mischaracterised our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program." Qualcomm run into trouble earlier this week after the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against it in the US District Court in the Northern District of California, accusing it of using its strong hold in mobile phone chips industry to obtain unfair licensing terms.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Daily Dealer Wine Club Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror DC Trawler Send a Tip Tech ‘First Billionaire In Hip Hop’ Dr. Dre Celebrates Beats Headphones Sale To Apple [VIDEO] Giuseppe Macri Tech Editor Giuseppe Macri12:20 PM 05/09/2014      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 4183535 After news broke late Thursday that Apple is working on a $3.2 billion deal to buy Beats Electronics, the developer behind the popular headphones of the same name, company co-founder and hip hop producer Dr. Dre, appeared in a video online and declared himself “the first billionaire in hip hop.” Actor Tyrese Gibson was apparently celebrating with Dre in the producer’s studio following the reports, and posted the video to his Facebook page. “They need to update the Forbes list,” Gibson said in the video referencing the magazine’s list of the world’s richest people, and described Dre as having joined the “billionaire boys club.” “In a big way — understand that,” Dre followed up. “The first billionaire in hip hop.” Though the expletive-rich video appears to show Dre celebrating the deal, he doesn’t explicitly reference or confirm the news. The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Shop by phone and leave wallet at home... soon 5:00 AM Sunday Jan 22, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print ANZ Banking Group ASB Bank Limited Bank of New Zealand Banking Business Mobile Phones Shopping Technology BNZ Android Pay works the same way as contact less cards. Photo / supplied Carrying a wallet full of credit and debit cards may soon be a thing of the past as more consumers sign up to pay-by-phone technology. The uptake of consumers signing up for Apple Pay, Android Pay and ASB Virtual has led to banks touting the products saying it will not be long before shoppers can leave wallets at home. The free apps use the phone the same way as contactless cards - by holding the phone close to the terminal. Transactions under $80 do not require the phone to be unlocked but purchases over that amount require a pin or thumbprint. Users will need an iPhone 6 or later or an Apple Watch to use Apple Pay, an android phone for Android Pay or a Samsung phone for ASB Virtual. Consumer NZ spokesperson Sue Chetwin said there were sure to be some security breaches - but didn't think the risk was any greater than carrying a walletful of cards around. "As long as people are careful with their phone it seems like the new technology is a lot safer. "It is more convenient for consumers so I think it is a good thing." Chetwin said fradulent use of phone technology was protected in the same way as contactless cards and stolen credit cards. "The technology has improved so I believe it is probably safer than cards," Chetwin said. Continued below.

"Our existing customers have loved it ... with increased interest around mobile payments and how they can easily set up their money on their mobile." Bullock said there was also interest from new customers wanting to access Android Pay. Around 40 per cent of the new users fell into the 20-29 year age group. "It's really proving a useful addition to how [young people] pay." Bullock said the technology made shopping faster and more convenient. "I believe we are getting closer to when you will be able to leave your physical wallet at home." He said the technology was safe with a unique token created to verify and approve each payment limiting card numbers and details being passed on. More than 90 per cent of transactions were for $80 or less. ANZ chief executive New Zealand David Hisco said more than 50 per cent of ANZ Visa transactions were contactless. "Adding Apple Pay ... will make it fast and convenient for more customers to securely make everyday purchases wherever there is a contactless terminal," he said. Like Android Pay the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, or on Apple servers. Instead, a unique number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored on the device. Apple Pay also allows customers to purchase goods online without a credit or debit card. ASB said it was keeping a watchful eye on developments with Apple Pay but in the meantime offered customers ASB Virtual. The product worked in the same way as Apple Pay but was only for use with Samsung phones. Meanwhile even children are moving toward cash-less saving and no longer have to wait for parents to stump up cash for chores. Ten of thousands of Kiwi Kids have signed up for ASB's cash-less money box Clever Kash. The yellow elephant, reminsicent of popular Kashin money boxes of the 1980s, is paired with a mobile app and bank account. ASB product Clever Kash allows parents to "swipe" money from their account to the child's account - savings are displayed on on a screen on the elephant's tummy. Photo / ASB Whenever a parent wants to give a child their allowance or earnings, they can transfer between accounts and then swipe virtual coins to show how much they're transferring. The screen on Clever Kash's tummy keeps count and shows the child's progress towards their savings goals. ASB chief executive Barbara Chapman said parents had struggled to teach their children the value of money because physical notes and coins were seen and touched less often. How it works • Download the free app from either GooglePlay or the Apple Store • You will need an android device for Android Pay or an Apple Watch, iPhone 6 or later for Apple Pay • The phone is linked to an account with an available balance • As long as the Android screen is lit you can make a payment up to $80 when holding the phone up to a contactless terminal. Apple Pay requires a thumbprint or code. • Android Pay requires a thumbprint or code for purchases over $80 • The phone will buzz with a message to tell you the purchase has been accepted - Herald on Sunday Read more by Kirsty Wynn Email Kirsty Wynn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The Dow is likely to reach the 20,000 threshold in the weeks to come (if it hasn't happened already). But is this important and what does it portend for your financial future? The Dow, short for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is the most followed financial number regarding the U.S. stock markets. Whether you tune into NPR or Fox News, the media all seem to agree on at least on one thing: the Dow is the most important measure of the performance of the U.S. stock market. Given its prominence, it's natural to assume that if the Dow is up that means the stock market did well, and if it falls that it did poorly. The truth is that what we call the Dow is a 19th Century relic that has arguable relevance to our financial lives. Have you been ignoring news of the Dow 20,000? That may be the best approach. Here's why. You are almost certainly not invested in the Dow. Take a look at your latest retirement plan statement. Are you invested in the Dow? After all a target retirement fund invests in hundreds if not thousands of individual stocks. You may have a total stock market or S&P 500 fund in your investment mix. Those funds certainly hold stocks that are included in the Dow, but the Dow only includes 30 stocks. Yes the most widely followed stock index in the world is derived from the stock prices of only 30 U.S. companies. Advertisement The way the Dow is computed defies logic. The Dow is one of the few indices that is computed as a price-weighted index. I know this point sounds boring and arcane, but stay with me here. The higher the price that a given stock has, than the more weight it has in the Dow. Apple is the largest public company in the U.S. by market capitalization, which is the value of the company as set by the stock market. Today the market values Apple as a $640 billion company with a stock price of $120. Another Dow component company, Goldman Sachs, has a price of $234. Because it has fewer outstanding shares than Apple, even though Goldman's price is higher, the company is valued at $90 billion. Because its price is higher, Goldman has roughly twice the impact on the Dow than Apple does. Perhaps even more absurd is 3M having a weight almost six times that of GE in the Dow, even though GE is worth twice as much. The Dow includes very few companies. More than 50 percent of the Dow index is made up of ten stocks: Goldman, 3M, IBM, UnitedHealth Group, Boeing, Home Depot, McDonalds, Apple, Travelers, and Chevron. You shouldn't U.S.e the performance of ten stocks as a proxy for the U.S. stock market. At one point last month Goldman was responsible by itself for a 320 point increase in the Dow in the post-election rally. There is much more than U.S. large company stocks. Most of us are not invested exclusively in U.S. large company stocks. A diversified portfolio should be invested in most cases from 20 to 50 percent in bonds. In contrast with the surging Dow, bonds had a subpar quarter to end the year as market watchers concluded that we were likely to see interest rate increases in the years to come. Intermediate term bonds were down 2.5 percent for the quarter according to Morningstar while long government bonds lost 11.8 percent. Also, foreign large companies declined 2.2 percent. So the many blended target date funds that include these categories were actually down for the quarter. This can be hard to hear after reading weeks of headlines of a buoyant Dow. What should you do? Other than wishing that the Dow wasn't publicized so widely, the best approach is to not react when the Dow soars and when it declines. Your portfolio is much more than the Dow, and for the most part that's a good thing.

The current Touch ID is a capacitive sensor, KGI believes the company will supplant it with a new optical fingerprint sensor as well as facial recognition sensors. The optical sensor is necessary for Apple to execute its vision for a zero-bezel iPhone, currently rumoured for iPhone 8. KGI’s report says that the ‘under glass’ design of current fingerprint recognition components used in the iPhone do not wholly meet the requirements of a full-screen form factor iPhone. As such, Apple will want to move to an ‘under panel’ system. This means abandoning the capacitive technology Apple acquired with the purchase of AuthenTec in 2013 and moving to an optical-type sensor. However, optical fingerprint sensors will have to be compatible with the signal interference of flexible OLED panels (expected to debut with iPhone 8) and it makes production much more difficult. KGI says that the optical sensor is still in early development stages, so it doesn’t sound like it is going to debut with the iPhone 8 this year. To date, Apple’s Touch ID Home Button has existed in two versions: the original sensor which debuted with iPhone 5s and a 2x faster second generation sensor included since the iPhone 6s. Independent reports about the next major iPhone, coming in the fall, claim that Apple will integrate the Home Button into the screen to reduce the bezels on the front. Some form of face recognition technology has also been rumored to be part of the iPhone 8 tentpole features. KGI says that Apple is leaning towards full-face recognition rather than biometric iris recognition. Eventually, the firm believes Apple will rely solely on face recognition for authentication and unlock, eliminating the Touch ID sensor entirely. The timeline for this is not clear and again seems to be far in the future. For the time being, KGI says Apple will rely on a combination of fingerprint and face detection sensors, rather than fully supplanting the latter with the former. It’s worth noting the report does not tie its commentary with any particular Apple product, so even if other rumors are swirling about face recognition for iPhone 8, KGI is not necessarily endorsing that sentiment at this stage. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

January 21 AAPL: 120.00 0.22 Qualcomm responds to Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit, says claims are baseless and Apple ‘misrepresented facts’ Benjamin Mayo - Jan. 21st 2017 7:36 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Late on Friday, Apple announced that it would be suing Qualcomm for approximately $1 billion due to a dispute over patent royalties. Qualcomm licenses many wireless patents as well as being a modem supplier for the iPhone. Naturally, Qualcomm is rejecting Apple’s claims of misconduct and will fight the case. In a statement, it said the claims are baseless and Apple has ‘intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations’. Although full details about what has happened are yet to come to light, Apple is arguing that Qualcomm is charging royalties on technologies they do not have a claim to own, and barred Apple from sourcing certain phone parts from other suppliers. It also alleged that Qualcomm held an almost $1 billion payment as ransom in a legal investigation. Apple says that the company charges five times more for patent royalties than every other cellular patent license agreement it has, combined. Unable to reach a conclusion about what is a fair and reasonable royalty rate, it is bringing the case to the courts. Here’s Qualcomm’s full statement in reply, in which it definitively opposes everything Apple says and claims Apple is actively encouraging attacks on its own business as well as misrepresenting facts. “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. Apple used Qualcomm modems in every iPhone exclusively, until the iPhone 7. Apple sources some of its cellular modems for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus from Intel, perhaps foreshadowing a disagreement between the companies. The legal process for this case will likely drag on for years, unless Apple and Qualcomm can resolve their differences out of court.

Analysts believe that this new variant of the classic iPhone will feature an entirely new display. Not only will this be larger than previous iPhone models, but it will also incorporate OLED technology and feature a wraparound design. Image source: Apple designer – YouTube Research note predictions Each of these ideas have been proposed by Apple experts previously, but there is a new solidity to the latest rumors considering that they have been suggested by a major analyst in a research note. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company believes that there will be a “feature-rich launch” of three iPhone variants later this year, with two iPhone 7S handsets supplementing this new iPhone X design. However, Cowen and Company also states that Apple will face technical challenges in delivering the 5.8-inch version of the smartphone, with the analysis of the company pointing to low part yields and availability for vital components. OLED expected for iPhone 8 The two iPhone 7S models will essentially supplement the existing iPhone 7, meaning that 4.7 and and 5.5-inch handsets should be expected. However, Cowen and Company also believes that Apple could be about to include OLED technology in the smaller version of the next generation iPhone as well. This will be dependent on the ability of Samsung to supply a sufficient quantity of the technology, as well as the consumption of Apple’s existing LCD inventory. In order to deliver these new design elements, the iPhone 8, or iPhone X, will utilize the “fixed flex” screen. This was previously used in the now sadly defunct Galaxy Note 7, and has been a common aspect of recent Samsung releases. If the OLED display is delivered as anticipated then it had previously been expected that numerous key components will be embedded into the display of the device. This would enable an edge-to-edge front panel in the iPhone 8 to eliminate bezels completely. Thus, such features as the iPhone 8 earpiece, FaceTime camera and Touch ID fingerprint sensor could be moved in the next generation. However, Arcuri rejected this notion, suggesting instead that Apple could decide to switch to Synaptec’s optical-based fingerprint reader for the new Touch ID sensor. Arcuri believes this to be the only workable solution for detecting a fingerprint through the screen of a smartphone at present. One technical difficulty for Apple with implementing this technology, though, is the fact that it is not currently being sampled to device manufacturers at this time. This would call into question whether or not it would be possible to deliver the technology in sufficient quantity for the iPhone 8. This will certainly be a major consideration for the consumer electronics giant, as it is notable that it does not currently hold a patent for such technology. Intel and Qualcomm cited Meanwhile, as Apple makes preparations for its next generation smartphone, it is believed that the corporation will continue to source iPhone cellular modems through Intel and Qualcomm. However, there have been media reports that Intel units have experienced difficulties, meaning that Apple may lean more heavily on Qualcomm this time out. This could be complicated by the ongoing lawsuit being carried out by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, alleging that the company has acted with impropriety when selling modems previously. Arcuri also anticipates that Apple will embrace facial and gesture recognition in the iPhone X at least, with a laser sensor being utilized in order to deliver this technology. Arcuri believes this will also require an infrared sensor near the front-facing camera, while wireless charging will also debut in the iPhone range this time round. The report did not go into details on any of these aspects of the Apple mobile, but they are all expected to materialize nonetheless. Morgan Stanley sees sales dip Ultimately, the analyst predicts a feature-rich launch with three iPhone models, which will be entirely necessary if the latest sales information is to be taken into consideration. Respected financial services company Morgan Stanley believes that sales of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be significantly lower in 2017 than was previously expected. However, it is not all bad news for Apple, as Morgan Stanley believes that this can largely be attributed to the release of the forthcoming iPhone 8. The financial sector analyst suggests that the next generation iPhone 8 will reduce Apple’s anticipated iPhone 7 sales, but that this will have minimal impact on the overall position of Apple in the marketplace. Morgan Stanley indicates its assessment that the tenth anniversary iPhone will be so mouth-watering for consumers that this will attract outstanding sales for Apple. Overall, the financial picture for Apple in 2017 is one of challenging first and second quarters, with the release of the iPhone 8 improving the situation of the company towards the end of the year. Apple will heed this message with interest, no doubt, and this could influence the strategy of the company in the coming 12 months. In particular, it will be intriguing to see what the Cupertino-based company has in store for the Apple Watch range in 2017. Spec upgrades and VR In order to attract people to the iPhone 8, Apple is also expected to upgrade the specs of the device, aside from its fancy new display. Early rumors have particularly focused on the potential virtual reality capabilities of the smartphone, with VR becoming increasingly important in the contemporary technology climate. Sales of the PlayStation VR unit have been encouraging for Sony, and it seems that virtual reality could finally be ready to make the market breakthrough that has been anticipated for decades. With Apple wishing to manufacture an iPhone that delivers virtual reality compatibility, there will be pressure on the Californian corporation to upgrade the resolution of the display. This would seem to make perfect sense if Apple is also to embrace OLED, and could lead to the first ever quad HD mobile from the market leader. It all adds up to an exciting Apple iPhone 8 launch later this year.

Apple uses Qualcomm products in its mobile devices to work with telecommunication networks. Technology giant Apple sued mobile chip producer Qualcomm in San Diego federal court Friday for $1 billion (934 million euros) for charging unfair royalties on innovations on the iPhone, Apple's popular mobile phone. In an email to French press agency AFP, Apple charged that "to protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." In the 100-page complaint, Apple stated Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple's fingerprint identification system on recent versions of the iPhone, as well as larger storage capabilities on the mobile phones, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm rejected Apple's claims. "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world…by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," said Qualcomm executive vice president Don Rosenberg in a statement. Apple uses Qualcomm products in its iPhones and iPad tablets to work with telecommunication networks.  Qualcomm in trouble The Apple suit comes three days following the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit stating Qualcomm imposed unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Apple also noted Qualcomm's license terms in its suit. Qualcomm called the FTC suit "significantly flawed." Qualcomm is in hot water in South Korea as well, as regulators in the Asian country imposed a fine of over $850 million against the San Diego-based Qualcomm in December for violating the country's antitrust laws. Qualcomm is fighting this decision. Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead told AFP that the antitrust suits against Qualcomm may cause rival chip producers to gain ground. "I think Apple is not comfortable in feeling that they have only one source and are taking this opportunity to go after Qualcomm," said Moorhead. "Qualcomm is being looked at on every continent on the planet; this is probably, strategically, the right time for Apple to do this," Moorhead added. Qualcomm shares fell 2.4 percent and Apple shares edged up just below 0.2 percent Friday. kbd/kl (AFP, AP) Watch video 02:05 Share South Korea fines Qualcomm Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Uyo7 South Korea fines Qualcomm DW recommends China imposes record anti-trust fine on US tech firm A Chinese government watchdog has found a US chipmaker guilty of violating anti-monopoly regulations.

Apple accused Qualcomm of monopolising the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is based. Apple also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future. Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $63 at the close in New York. Apple rose less than 1 per cent to $120. “It is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing programme.” Qualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Legacy Standards “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensers we have agreements with combined.” The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision. Antitrust Investigations Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. Patent Royalties The US Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 17 filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from the separate licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not. One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells — measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars. Companies collaborate to develop industry standards so that the devices can communicate with each other. Since they have the ability to ensure their inventions get included in the standards, they pledge to license on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm has breached that pledge by refusing to license its patents to Intel Corp., a rival chipmaker that’s been providing some chips to Apple for the past year, according to the complaint. Bullying Accusations Apple accused Qualcomm of bullying it, threatening to withhold chip supply, forcing it to agree not to challenge Qualcomm’s patents and using Apple innovations to help its competitors. Much of the money Qualcomm collects on the iPhone or iPad is paid by third-party manufacturers who pass along the cost, according to the complaint. Apple said Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because those manufacturers “have no incentive to negotiate.” Apple said it’s not allowed to see those agreements, and believes Qualcomm gets paid multiple times on the same device. Since Qualcomm won’t give Apple a direct license, it instead agreed to give Apple a rebate — money that it’s now withholding. The case is Apple Inc v.

Opinion | 07 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (98) Tell Us Your Mac Automation Stories by Adam C. Engst The news that Apple had laid off Sal Soghoian, who has been a fixture in the world of scripting and automation for decades, hit hard at MacTech Conference back in November. Although Sal hasn’t been making as many public appearances as he used to in the days of Macworld Expo, his indefatigable efforts to promote user automation inside and outside Apple have had wide-ranging impact. Sal worked tirelessly within Apple to encourage support for AppleScript and Automator (among much else), and to ensure that Apple apps provided the necessary scripting dictionaries and Automator actions. He was long a champion for the user, believing that users know best what they need to do and that automation technologies were essential for enabling users to create and streamline their own workflows. What should we make of Sal leaving? Apple didn’t lay him off specifically, it instead eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies. It’s my understanding that multiple groups within Apple wanted to hire Sal afterward, but Apple was under some sort of hiring freeze that prevented him from migrating within the company. So it doesn’t look as though Apple was trying to get rid of Sal personally, which is good. What’s less good is that it would appear that Apple doesn’t see the need for having a position that evangelizes user automation. A 9to5Mac reader sent email to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to ask that Apple not kill AppleScript and Automator, and was told “We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS!” Federighi’s response prompts the question of whether Apple’s future actions will bear out his statement. It may be overreaching to read too much into his precise words, but “intent” is an aim or a plan, not a guarantee. And “support” can mean “maintenance mode” rather than “advancing the state of the art.” Regardless, eliminating Sal’s position isn’t a step in the right direction. Sure, Apple could have plans to replace AppleScript and Automator with super secret magic unicorn technologies, but based purely on what the company has done and said, it’s hard to believe that. It wasn’t always like this. The reason AppleScript survived the purge of products and technologies after Steve Jobs returned was that Jobs understood the importance of automation to key Apple markets, like publishing, finance, and TV and film, not to mention the enterprise and IT worlds. These industries live and die by custom workflows based on AppleScript and other automation technologies built deep into macOS. Jobs personally approved the inclusion of Automator in OS X, and he enabled and supported adding AppleScript as a development language to Xcode. And it was because of his support that Apple’s automation team went on to develop AppleScript/Objective-C, script libraries, and JavaScript for Automation. But the Apple of today is an entirely different company, focusing as it does on the iPhone and iOS. Even so, it’s obvious to anyone who uses iOS that there is still an important role for automation. I can tell Siri to “Change ‘Floating’ to 8 AM” to adjust the time of my wake-up alarm, but I have no way to automate the five taps necessary to play the audiobook we listen to every night in the Hoopla digital library app. Five wasted taps every night isn’t the end of the world, but if you can’t automate the little stuff, you certainly can’t automate the big stuff. If Apple’s seeming indifference toward automation worries you because you rely on scripts, macros, workflows, and more to get your work done quickly, effectively, and accurately, here’s what I’d like you to do. Leave a comment on this article outlining how you depend on Mac automation tools in your job. If there are too many examples to fit in a single comment, just focus on those that are the most important to you. I’ll compile all the comments and publish them as a future article, and I’ll also send a copy to Craig Federighi and Apple CEO Tim Cook so they see concrete examples of why we need these automation technologies to continue to evolve. To kick things off, here’s my most important bit of automation. When it comes time to publish a new or updated Take Control title, I start with three versions of the book: a PDF, an EPUB, and Mobipocket file. A copy of each must be stored in several locations on our internal file server and uploaded both to our Web server and to Amazon S3. Plus, the uploaded versions must be renamed precisely according to an algorithm that’s replicated on our server, so the site can update itself and serve the correct files based on the presence of properly named uploads in the right directories. When I used to do this by hand, it took 15–20 minutes, and I ran the risk of renaming a file incorrectly or uploading to the wrong directory. (And making a mistake meant that I had to spend even more time figuring out what I’d done wrong and fixing it.) Now that I have a series of Automator workflows performing these tasks for me, it takes me just seconds to initiate the uploads, and there are never any errors. So that’s my automation story — tell us yours! Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of Automating Your Mac If you use copy and paste, you’re taking advantage of an important shortcut. But did you realize that the Mac offers dozens of shortcuts that make tedious tasks quick, accurate, and repeatable? Author Joe Kissell reveals OS X’s many shortcuts and examines the utilities that go further, offering concrete examples and long lists of possibilities.   READERS LIKE YOU!

It's just pure magic how I can get first and third party apps to collaborate to do just about anything. For instance, I can have the Finder duplicate/rename 300 screenshots, send them to Pixelmator to crop, and then Transmit to upload to my server. It's just a pain in the neck to do it by hand and honestly, it's nothing short of magical having all these apps work together to complete my task for me. Reply Tommy Weir  2017-01-09 14:05 I have a custom naming approach for all files on my system. And every year, they are sorted into relevant groups and archived off using the automator actions which the developers of DevonThink Office Pro provide. It's a simple thing, a folder is monitored, files are imported and tagged. But the knowledge that the organisation is done and it's consistent year in and year out. I can't tell you what that means for my peace of mind in my business. 2. My son uses folder actions all the time, resizing images, converting and renaming them for different use cases, it's like his party trick for employers while he's studying in Boston College. 3. I use a combination of Automator, Hazel and Keyboard Maestro together with some scripts I picked up online to keep my computer organised. These various tools move files around to their rightful folders, rename files to my standardised system, save email attachments and move them to the right folders, clear up strays that land here or there, archive off application installers and delete old files that are backed up and not in use for some time. Reply Chuck Shotton  2017-01-09 15:03 Well, in a nutshell, most of the Web industry on Mac OS in the early days of the Internet would not have existed if not for Sal's work with AppleScript, AppleEvents, scriptability/recordability of applications, AppleEvent Dictionaries, the Script Editor, and the concept of scripts as runnable applications. Every external extension created for MacHTTP or WebSTAR, Userland Frontier, and all of the other HTTP servers on the Mac depended exclusively on these technologies. It was how applications talked. It's still how they should talk, but Apple (NeXT) seems to have never embraced it as they should have. Even the newest incarnation of MacHTTP, MacHTTP-js, depends on a slew of AppleEvents to do its job. Let's hope this great legacy isn't lost just because it doesn't work on iOS... Reply Anthony Reimer  2017-01-09 15:39 I use AppleScript and Automator for automating actions in the Finder. Some common things I have created that I use at work: • Clean the desktop of shared computers. • Automate server connections. • Take any downloaded dmgs and move them to an Installers folder automatically (using Folder Actions). • A service that opens the current URL in a specific browser (e.g., if a page needs Flash, open it in Chrome). I also use it as an integral tool to integrate with FileMaker Pro. (e.g., export text data from FileMaker to a file, have BBEdit clean it up, then upload that edited file to a web site using Fetch — AppleScript + FileMaker scripting can make this a single step for the user). The Mac Admin community is all about automation for both the efficiency that comes from it and the consistency of result. While Python and shell scripting are core to that automation, I know I still put Automator and AppleScript to use on a regular basis. Reply Anonymous   2017-01-09 15:51 For 16 years now approximately 15 times a year I do financials based on a series of companies. The workflow I've created reduces 21 pages of reports to a readable 4 and about 90 minutes of my time to 20. That's roughly 16 * 15 * (90-20) = 16,800 minutes or 280 hours or 35 work days or 6 work weeks of my life. That's time with family, time doing other work things, time that I am not simply throwing down the hole of clicks and points. Thank you for HyperCard, AppleScript, Automator and anything else Apple can provide to give me more time! Reply Paul Ellis  2017-01-09 16:21 Which Mac automation stories? Back in the day, when I regularly had tasks that merited automation, I used QuickKeys. Nowadays I use Hazel for the few regular automated file-handling tasks I have. I've found that on those comparatively rare occasions when I have a repetitive task that could do with automating, Automator invariably lets me down. It's quicker to complete the task manually rather than trying to bully Automator into action. Here's an example: automating iTunes playback. I leave iTunes running when away from my house for an extended period, to stop the place appearing to be empty. A few years ago I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to use Calendar to automate playback, but then found the Calendar events I created didn't 'travel', but had to be created afresh every day. I can no longer be bothered with this palaver: I simply remote in with Teamviewer and manually toggle playback. Welcome to C21 Mac automation, conspicuously lacking in usability and utility. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-09 16:33 One of the hardest things with automation is picking the right tool. For what you describe, I'd use Keyboard Maestro, which can really easily play random music from iTunes at specific times. Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:31 I work at a small newspaper and we depend on AppleScript. The most important is one AppleScript that creates working pages from a master InDesign file. It applies the right styles, sets the date of the edition on each page, sets the page numbers and saves a copy to disk with an appropriate, dated filename. This was written almost 5 years ago and has prevented many mistakes, not least with incorrect dates going to print! Previously staff would duplicate an old page — risky for many reasons. On the other end, we use AppleScript to reliably produce the PDF files for use by our printers, custom settings and all. Other things we’ve done with AppleScript include scripting BBEdit to fix common mistakes in stories, retrieving and setting weather forecasts, TV listings, football fixtures & scores, creating the barcode (and checking it is correct — an occasionally major problem before). Newer stuff is often in Python but with an AppleScript interface. Code here: https://github.com/ppps Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:21 Oh, and that's just AppleScript. There's all sorts of stuff we do with Hazel and Python scripts run as LaunchAgents (through Lingon). Our newsroom is an all-Mac office and on occasion in the past a member of staff has suggested buying cheaper Windows machines. Alongside the longevity of Macs (most of ours are almost 10 years old), automation is always the big reason I give for why we would be worse off. My understanding is that bigger newspapers have software written for them to handle this stuff, which we could never afford. Mac automation technologies have enabled us to do it ourselves in-house. Reply Mike Warren  2017-01-09 17:57 I'm so old I remember when the whole reason for having a computer was automation . I consider AppleScript a programming language. I've created programs for record keeping, budgeting, a foreign language dictionary, flash cards. I use AppleScript for a daily email message to my partner (it pulls info from flat-file databases, Calendar.app; assembles a message, sends it via Mail.app, saves it as my Safari home page.) I have so many little scripts and Keyboard Maestro routines that I feel hopeless when I have to use someone else's Mac. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:00 Keyboard Maestro, with an accompanying mix of Apple Script and shell scripts, is a wonderful glue for web applications with lacking APIs. After a recent migration between institutional repositories (for academic publishing) hundreds of full text files where missing because of a bug in the new systems import script. There were no APIs for uploading new files to existing records in the system, and some manual steps were required in the upload form, but the automation tools allowed me to reduce each process from maybe 30 error prone clicks in both of the applications and Finder to about three clicks per record. It saved me several hours of tedious work. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:12 Another error in the same migration required me to verify the order of attached files in both of the systems, also for a few hundred items. By automation I could with a single keyboard shortcut navigate to the next item in a list of IDs, find the record in both of the systems, then open all attachments in order in new windows and tile them on the screen in two columns allowing me to see differences at a glance. If in order, a new click got me to the next item, else I could handle the error before moving on. Reply Thomas Tempelmann  2017-01-09 18:54 As a developer (for apps such as Find Any File, iClip and iBored), I recently have started using Automator and AppleScript to assist my customers when they have some technical troubles and are not too computer-savvy. I have scripts to collect files I need to look at, fetch system information, email them to me, or copy, move and delete files to fix some of their setups. And just the other day I used AppleScript to verify a slow memory leak in one of my apps, which required 1000s of mouse moves. With AppleScript, it took me 15 minutes to write the code, then have it perform its task for about one hour to cause the issue that otherwise took users days or even weeks to run into. A few hours later, and I managed to identify and fix one of the most obscure bugs I had for a long time in my app. Also, I'm happy to have spent the money on Script Debugger, which makes writing AppleScripts much less of a pain, indeed :) Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 19:43 Currently my main automation use is somewhat indirect. To tolerate Mail.app at all, I've found Mail Tags and Mail Act-on to be indispensable. They do a lot of automating for me by greatly expanding the filter tests and actions available, and by allowing for single key actions such as moving selected messages to a folder without having to drag through the folder tree. Since I run a majordomo server and several mailing lists, intricate mail sorting is a lifesaver. In the past, I used Quickkeys to remap the keyboard and add macros to music software such as Finale. Saved me hours a week and a lot of frustration. I'm planning to dive into Keyboard Maestro soon, partly to improve the modern Finder window handling train wreck. which costs me at least an hour a week in getting windows back where they're supposed to be. Reply gastropod  2017-01-12 22:21 I entirely forgot the services I created with Automator a few years ago to do routine exif handling. Automator calls on exiftool to show all metadata in BBEdit, strip all metadata, strip all but a few exif/iptc fields, alter GPS data, etc. Not only do they save some effort when used, they save the time it takes to periodically check the exiftool docs, since it has so many options I can never remember them. It's also much easier than the command line to do things to an ad hoc file selection. Reply Naomi Pearce  2017-01-09 19:49 Early in the days of Automator, Sal made a comment, something about it changing the way applications work together where you don’t have to learn the application, just find the action for the feature you want it to do. I looked at him sideways and thought, “yeah, right, okay buddy.” Some time later, I had worked on a proposal for several days (days because it involved a fair amount of PR-101 that had been requested), finished it, print-to-.pdf and sent it off. I followed up on it the next day and Andy Taylor of MacSpeech, Inc. said “well, yes, he’d received the Executive Summary and looked forward to the rest of it.” Wait, what?! Print-to-.pdf was something one took for granted, particularly from Word, and I opened the document and sure enough, it had not printed the whole document to .pdf, just the first page. I could get it to print page 1, or print from page 2-on, but not the whole document. Minutes were ticking by, and panic ensued. I was screwed. Or was I? I remembered what Sal had said about Automator and fired it up. I clicked on “workflow” to create a workflow. I used the search and found an action to combine PDF pages and dragged it over. Clearly, it needed to know what PDF pages to use to combine, so I found an action to Get Specified Finder Items and dragged it on top to make that happen first. Then I found an action to open the result up so I could see it (open finder items, I think it was called), and dragged that action below Combine PDF Pages. That’s all I could think of needing to do, so I dragged the page-1-only document and page-2-on document into the first action, and hit run. No more than 15 minutes after I first thought “what?!”→ just like magic → problem solved. And I never learned the applications, just found the actions for what I wanted to do. I’ll be darned. Wow! Only on a Mac. Reply Walt Jump  2017-01-09 20:21 I use Automator to routinely download specific files from government databases, rename them, and move them to specific folders for use by my FileMaker databases. This saves me at least 1-2 hours a day. I also use a program by someone who accesses the PTO databases and provides one file for data obtained from multiple databases by the use of Apple script and Automator. Reply Douglas Mobley   2017-01-09 21:08 The museum where I volunteer has a project to digitize old newspapers to aid the searching of them. The workflow, in simplistic terms, consists of photographing each page, processing the pages through Photoshop, and finally OCRing the images into newspaper issues. I had been using Photoshop actions to automate one step of the process but I was able to improve my productivity (measured as pages per hour completed) by more than 50% in the last year, using AppleScript to automate the workflow. Creation of folders and renaming of files is handled by Applescript control of Finder, and the processing of the page images through Photoshop is handled with AppleScript. I have used Automator to record and then understand what system events to include in my Applescript. Reply valm1  2017-01-09 21:10 The ability to adjust things in order for them to suit your needs is a first requirement for computers. That is why I liked Apple from the 1980s, and that is why I stopped using them 20 years later. I still have an iPad, but only two, maybe three apps are actually very useful. The rest is either buggy, full with ads or just plane useless. And the user cannot do a thing about it, unless you jailbreak the thing. No updates for individual apps either, so we are stuck with a buggy iOS emailer. I have never lost so many emails - many days of work. Never been so disappointed with Apple - a total waste of money and, especially, of my time. Reply Jeff Porten   2017-01-09 21:23 I think I've been writing AppleScripts for as long as the language has existed, and I've done a great deal of professional consulting doing one-off AppleScripts for my clients. I'd be lost without it. Most common use cases: 1) an AppleScript that cleans up and organizes my Desktop icons according to a custom grid, grouping them by color tag. 2) a randomizer selection when I have a group of files to read or movies to watch, picks "some item in the current folder". 3) any application missing a keystroke; i.e., I have dozens of one-line AppleScripts mapped to Quicksilver launch keys, so I can hit control-command-3 and label a Finder item yellow. (Then there's "comment and label yellow", which uses the yellow label to remind me that an item has a Finder comment.) Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-09 23:16 I've used Macs since 1986, and our family has owned more than 15, along with assorted iPods and iPhones. With Apple's recent neglect of the Mac lineup, AppleScript is pretty much my last remaining reason for staying loyal: if they take that away, there's little reason for me to stay on the reservation. And if my computer isn't a Mac, there's not much reason for my next phone to be an iPhone. I have a fairly elaborate Home Automation system that is totally based on AppleScript and the XTension program. I love how it makes it easy to control and modify the behavior of the system. I've thought for years that an enhanced version of Automator could finally—finally!—make Home Automation accessible by mere mortals. In my opinion this is a gigantic missed opportunity for Apple. I'm frankly very worried. There are so many signs that Apple has lost its soul chasing shiny iObjects. Reply chrischram@gmail.com  2017-01-09 23:23 I have several Photos libraries on two different disks. I use an Automator app, with a bit of embedded AppleScript, to wrangle these libraries and let me select which one to open. I use AppleScript to collect the data from my weather station and upload it to my web space. It's more reliable than the software that came with the station. I also use AppleScript to massage the weather data and import it to a Numbers spreadsheet. Reply Jake  2017-01-09 23:47 I book several music venues in NYC. I book 100-200 acts per month. I rely heavily on automation, mostly with Keyboard Maestro, AppleScript, a bit of automator, TextExpander, and now also with Better Touch Tool to create app-specific touchbar buttons which trigger my applescripts. For those in doubt about the touchbar, I find it to be the best tool Apple has come out with in years. It's an amazing launcher for all my macros, and I have MANY. It's very powerful! I have actions that add confirmed events to the calendar (BusyCal), send confirmation emails at specific dates/times (much of which is because of a powerful CLI utility called iCalBuddy), resize and reformat images automatically, update web calendars with band descriptions, pictures, links, etc...basically everything I do relies on Mac automation in one form or another. It literally turns hours of work into minutes and allows more music to happen in New York. For me, automation is the best part of using a Mac! Reply Firitia  2017-01-10 01:21 Making netboot images requires automater (or system imaging utility which is just a shell around it). Over history the reability of it has been dubious. In 10.12.2 it is not working: the image source (sierra installer) cannot be found, even if you manually select it. In 10.12.1 it could be found, but the programm crashed anyway when trying to make the image. In 10.12.0 it was working. In 10.11.5 also. But it crashed in 10.11.4, 10.11.3, 10.11.2. Working in 10.11.1 and 10.11.0, but not 10.9.5, and so forth with the ups and downs into the times of the past. (Perhaps I mistake some version numbers, and with some versions it appeared to work on one but not on another computer, but the general idea remains.) In addition to that, when you save a workflow for next time, that next time trying opening it either opens, or it does not at all, or it just crashes the program. Reply Jon Gotow  2017-01-10 00:37 Another developer chiming in here (I'm the author of Default Folder X, App Tamer, Jettison, HistoryHound, and a bunch of other stuff going back nearly 30 years). I use AppleScript in 3 primary ways: 1. For automating processes in my own business, including email parsing and message handling, and software development and testing. 2. For customer support, sending AppleScript applets to customers to help them fix problems or collect debugging information. Having someone run an AppleScript is far more reliable than trying to walk them through a set of steps. 3. Integrating my software with other developers' products. As an example, Default Folder X can detect when Path Finder, a popular Finder substitute, is running and ask it to perform various tasks instead of the Finder - which is exactly what Path Finder users want it to do. That wouldn't be possible (or would be much harder) without AppleScript. Reply DeeAnne Lau  2017-01-10 00:52 AppleScript is used in many of the programs that I use! I am really appalled. I use it to tailor my spam controller program, SpamSieve. I have a Repetitive Motion Injury plus a pinched nerve in my neck. Being able to use scripts to control the Finder or web actions have saved me from much pain. I use A Better Finder Rename applets and use Automator to make contextual services that can be triggered by keystrokes. I use Script Debugger, also, to help me understand the underlying aspects of scripts as I compile them and look for problems. I still rely on some of Dougs Applescripts for iTunes to do things in that (frustrating) program. I use Hazel to manage organization of my downloads and printer folders. I am retired, but I still use my Mac for financial management, communications, learning, and recreation. I rely a lot on AppleScript and Automator. Reply paule  2017-01-10 01:16 I use automator to do mass re-namings of files of photos I take for my son's football team. I estimated once that using automator saves me about 45 minutes per week -- and reduces the error count to zero. Over 14 rounds of footy, that's nearly 11 hours of saved effort. I know I could write a shell script to do the same thing, but Automator makes it easy for me to do (it's been over a decade since I last wrote a shell script!) Reply Felix Deimel  2017-01-10 04:21 I'm using parts of AppleScript to allow users of my professional remote management app, Royal TSX to automate keyboard input. This can range from having a password automatically entered to complex scripts that inject values from their associated connections or credentials. The 10.12.2 update made this completely unreliable as uppercase characters or special characters appearing anywhere in the text can completely mess up the casing. Sometimes it's correct, but it's completely unpredictable and the frequency of errors is very high. I've posted a radar and TSI about this but have yet to hear back from Apple. Here's a copy of the bug report: https://openradar.appspot.com/29182929. One of my customers posted a +1 kind of radar for this here: https://openradar.appspot.com/29825727 If anyone around here is affected by this as well I'd appreciate you "duplicating" my radar. Coincidentally this bug started to appear just around the time Sal left. Make of that what you will... Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-01-10 06:03 I am not a coder. I know of the existence of Automator, Applescript, javascript, shell scripts and other bizarre animals but am not knowledgeable at writing them. But I find using them to be useful, fun and good for my marriage. When I decided to also implement bootable clones for backup, I attached all clones to my wife's iMac and cloning is done from my MacBook Pro by authenticated traffic. This gives comfort and protection against ransomware affecting the MacBook Pro. I had disks mounted and making noise all day. My wife rightfully pointed to noise and energy bill: a perspective for divorce. But my MacBook Pro's clones are all sitting attached to the iMac, away from CCC and its easy to use automation tools. So I found on the internet "Mount" and "Eject" Applescripts, adapted them to my needs and, to trigger them, use a timer software (Task Till Dawn). Thus these drives are only mounted and doing noise one hour per day, around midnight. Marriage saved ! Thank you Applescript ! Reply Andy Lietz  2017-01-10 08:07 We're a prepress and printing house and we use AppleScript all the time to automatically typeset and alter layouts in InDesign with data from Excel and FileMaker. AppleScript is the "glue" that binds it all together and one of the major reasons we're on the Mac. But as a programming language, AppleScript feels more and more old-fashioned now compared to, say, Python or Ruby. I've met Sal at MacWorld and especially admire him for persuading Adobe to put good AppleScript support into InDesign. It's very sad to see him (and, it seems, Apple's support for automation) leave the company. Reply Bill Cheeseman  2017-01-10 08:26 I was a trial lawyer specializing in major environmental, financial and intellectual property litigation in a large law firm.

Reply Charles Butcher  2017-01-10 09:26 For me, AppleScript as a way for non-programmers to tie applications together is probably the most important differentiator for MacOS. I've been loyal to Apple since my first Quadra 800, but if they abandon AppleScript I'll probably move to Windows or plain UNIX. I run my freelance business on FileMaker Pro. AppleScript lets me create calendar events and to-dos straight from FileMaker, use BBEdit to clean up text from within another application, scan and OCR documents straight to DEVONthink, and a host of other small tasks that over the years must have saved me many hundreds of hours. Sure, AppleScript can be a pain to write, and I've never got on with Automator. But the fact that so many apps support AppleScript, even if only in limited or idiosyncratic ways, is a real achievement. People say the Mac has been "dumbed down"; I've been OK with this so far, but losing AppleScript would be a big blow to professionals. Reply John Cooper  2017-01-10 09:47 I use Keyboard Maestro for window management, application launching, and text expansion, and A Better File Rename for mass renaming of files. I probably use automation a lot less than I could, but if Keyboard Maestro in particular were to go away (because the technology underlying in becomes unavailable), that might be the nail in the coffin for my use of the Mac, frankly. Reply Frank Remsen  2017-01-10 09:55 I have built a few amazing scripts to automate a lot of my InDesign work, which helps me separate my design files to PDF and then upload them via transmit to an FTP server. I have many more scripts that help me post content to my blog via Applescript automatically while I sleep. I have scripts that create tags for t-shirts I create and sell online. I have finder folder creators built from Applescript. Applescript is an indispensable technology and it needs to stay in the Mac OS. I have also created a petition to save Applescript at https://www.change.org/p/apple-keep-mac-user-automation-such-as-applescript-automator-in-mac-os-x?source_location=topic_page Reply David  2017-01-10 10:01 I’ve been using AppleScript to automate all sort of things for a very long time. I am in academia, so I’ve mostly developed scripts to automate or help with my teaching and with my record keeping. Initially with Excel, I’ve created a script that would create an Excel spreadsheet formatted and with all the formulas to compute grades putting the precise dates I would teach excluding the holidays. And this would be created by me just copying the webpage where the roster of students for the course is. Then, to take attendance I would use a script that would prompt me with the student name and I would just say “present” or “not here” to have the appropriate mark entered in the sheet (“P” or “A”). Macs had the ability to work with voice command I believe since v 7.5 (my earliest Mac OS version) via the SpeechRecognitionServer. Same thing wold work for entering grades (my office mate decided on a Mac after witnessing me doing both the grades and attendance). After that, I would create from each of my student a web page with his/hers record. I could have 1 or 1000 students and the pages would be created in a flash. I would ftp ( using the Terminal app) to my site and name every file according to their location. Then, to enter grades in the (brain dead) software the College uses to get student grade, AppleScript with Safari and Javascript and I automatically put grades attendance status and last class attended by having an AppleScript that reads the Excel or Number (the one I prefer) spreadsheet data. At the college, at one point the Math Department was creating final exams for remedial level Math courses by getting questions from a 2000+ problems from a MS Word document. This document was divided in various sections. These exams were made by randomly selecting one question from each section. It was a long and laborious process. I was asked to help and from then on we would get all (7 per semester) exams created in less than a minute. They would come already formatted ready for printing. Using Smile, from Satimage (Satimage.fr an AppleScript based developer tool) I have created various QT movies that helped me with teaching, Pre-Calculus trigonometry, Calculus differentiation and integration, statistics distribution, etc. I have created Mathematical libraries for all kinds of Mathematics operations, including Matrix algebra and Statistics Library to help me teach Statistics (much faster and easier to access than R or other scientific software). Using AppleScript and a Mac Mini server Apple could easily disrupt the Education Market by simplifying everyone’s life. It would be cheaper and error free, very likely also more secure and private, without violating any law (FERPA). But hey, who wants to make a ton of money anyway? I’ve created an (AppleScript) app that everyday puts the APOD (apod.nasa.gov) as a background picture of my desktops (I’ve many). I’ve created a script that would search and display the lyrics of the current iTunes song. I use AppleScript to organize my folders, I use AppleScript to apply rules to my incoming Mail. I use AppleScript to generate and save passwords. I use AppleScript… Yes, I would say that Mac automation is the single most important reason I use Macs (actually, now most of my extended family uses Mac because of me). So, yes, Apple should support Mac Automation, because each automation user implies in many others that follows.

Reply Sam Reichberg  2017-01-10 11:36 Sorry, but "hiring freeze" sounds like BS, coming from the most valuable company in the universe and affecting one of its most valuable members. It sounds more like the work of an efficiency expert accountant lurking in the background. Axing automator does not seem just like an isolated incident. It probably reflects the strategic view that Apple computers (including smartphones and tablets) should serve a menu of isolated self-sufficient apps (except for Apple's own apps, of cour$e). Nothing can be further from truth. Switching among multiple apps does not just requires a bunch of extra clicks. Cumulatively it is debilitating and interferes with even the desire to use the appliances. The approach should be just the opposite: make multi-app automation easy and use will skyrocket. Reply Gavin Eadie  2017-01-10 12:25 Wow! A lot of responses, maybe mine's already in there but .. I use AppleScripts for various Finder conveniences. One I rely on daily creates a alias, on the Desktop, to a new folder created in Dropbox every midnight. The folder is named for the date and each day I drop any new material I want to keep into that "today" folder. The script is kicked off by launchd at midnight (+1 minute) and every time I log in. It's not a big deal but I suspect I wouldn't have the personal rigor to do this manually every day. Having set this up fourteen years ago (Dropbox added more recently), I rely on its convenience and the historical record it provides. Reply Aaron Priven  2017-01-10 13:30 Without automation, we couldn't do all kinds of the work we do at AC Transit creating bus stop signs and schedules. Having said that, I would love to stop using Applescript and use either Adobe's Javascript implementation, where we're just scripting Adobe apps, or Apple's Javascript for Applications, where we're also scripting other apps. Applescript, the language (as opposed to AppleEvents and the other underlying technologies), is really hard to work with.

From their actions alone, Occam's Razor suggests that they are phasing out the Mac and OS X no matter what they say. The writing is on the wall. That being said, Applescript is one of the main reasons I own a Mac. I have written hundreds of scripts to make my life easier. Two I would pick to highlight are a Software Marketing and Tracking System and a Dead Man Monitoring System. The Software Marketing and Tracking System uses Applescript, Filemaker, and Mail to automatically track software trials, purchases, channels of distribution, etc. Incoming emails are automatically processed to log purchases, issue serial numbers, create a customer database, and track trial installations. The whole system is driven by email arrivals and requires no manual intervention. This has saved man-years of manual effort. The Dead Man Monitoring system is described in the next post Reply Steve Cunningham  2017-01-10 16:15 (Continued from previous post) The Dead Man Monitoring system is for a paralyzed patient who cannot communicate. It guarantees that help will be summoned if someone doesn't enter the patient's room every two hours. Since I am the sole caregiver, if anything were to happen to me the patient would die of dehydration before anyone found her. The system uses a motion sensitive camera to track entrances and exits from the patient's room. When detected, the camera places a message in a folder which triggers the Monitoring script to log it and reset the Dead Man Counter. The Monitoring Script also runs automatically every two hours and, if there has been no activity, initiates a series of alarms and notifications, first locally and then to a list of external responders. A schedule for which hours are monitored during the day can be set and changed as well as the list of responders. Everything is done with Applescript. The system runs on a UPS protected Mac Mini and uses Launch Agents to monitor itself for failures.

My favourite, but not that impressive, was converting 1400+ files from Excel into an online web help. Half a day of scripting and about an hour of runtime and the whole thing was finished. That's kind of the point. If you can't automate tasks, then it ceases to be a computer. I have no great love of Applescript, but I do think Apple Events was a truly great innovation. My hope is that Swift will provide a way to work directly with Apple Events, without resorting to horrid workarounds. The sooner the better. Reply Nick Morris  2017-01-11 10:42 This would be a great loss. Although I am not a huge fan of AppleScript (I find the syntax annoying and at times impenetrable - I also don't like the lack of good debugging tools) I have nonetheless used it, and Automator, for years for a wide range of tasks. At present, I use a combination of AppleScript and Automator to blog from my Mac and to produce eBooks. I have scripts and folder actions that: • Post Evernote notes to my Wordpress blog (yes, I could use Postach.io, but they have been somewhat unreliable of late) - this requires some PHP in the AppleScript • Pass Evernote notes to Scrivner for eBook production • Pass images from an Evernote note back to Evernote as individual notes for posting to Instagram • Resize images for blog posts • Resize images for posting to Twitter One of the most fun scripts I had (and I found this on the Internet and adapted) automated Keynote to send out a tweet when a slide was shown. The tweet contained the text in the speaker notes for the slide. This script caused a lot of confusion as the audience couldn't work out how I was presenting and tweeting at the same time! Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-11 12:42 I don't think Apple management is considering the "Reverse Halo Effect" that Brent Simmons wrote about: http://inessential.com/2016/11/21/the_reverse_of_the_halo_effect The idea is that with Apple discontinuing or failing to update so many products (like Airport Wi-Fi routers and external displays), a lot of people who once automatically bought Apple's solutions because they could be depended upon to "just work" are forced to look elsewhere. And if you're looking at other monitors, why not other computers? Why not other phones? The walls around Apple's painstakingly constructed (and very profitable) garden are crumbling, and it won't end well. The likely demise of AppleScript and Automator are, well, another break in the wall.

I'm a photographer and one of my favorite workflows that I have created involves launching an application, called PostHaste, every time I insert a SD with fresh new photos, in my mac, this creates automatically a folder on the server that is renamed with the contents of the clipboard, previously copied from the latest event in my calendar. After this, a new Finder window is prompted to the foreground revealing the newly created folder, next to it Image Capturehas been launched allowing me to drag and drop the new photos into the new folder window. My photos then are automatically renamed by Hazel. Reply Patricia Pfitsch  2017-01-11 16:17 My husband and I run a small transcription business. Our clients are production companies who send us raw film footage they’ve taken for documentaries. We create a written transcript of the film by transcribing what they hear and see—then we we send the transcript to the client. Our clients are usually under a tight deadline so it’s crucial that we can create the transcript fast—often we need to transcribe hours of film and get the transcripts to the client within a twelve-hour period. That kind of speed depends on using AppleScript to create shortcuts for names and other words and phrases that are repeated continually in the dialogue. (You’d be amazed at how many times people say ‘you know’ in conversation.) We also use AppleScript to start and stop the film while we’re transcribing. AppleScript is the key to our success and without it we’d be out of business!

Reply Emmanuel Levy  2017-01-12 05:10 We at quomodo.com have developed a Web Server environment where XML + Applescript somehow are used instead of the widely used mySQL + PHP. Main advantage is, XML is both the database language and the web page language. Thanks to that environment, we are able to develop enhancements and new features way faster and more freely than if we used the usual mySQL - PHP framework. A specific — yet, very simple — cgi sends the http requests to our AppleScript hub (Smile), which in turn sends the hard stuff to some osax (mainly, XMLLib.osax). A herd of Smile apps handle up to 100 requests a second (approximate — I did not measure recently). Our DIY web site system works wonderfully for 50,000+ sites maintained by 100,000+ admins.

And when I switched from my previous note manager to Evernote, I wrote an AppleScript that transferred my old notes, nicely categorized.

Reply Mark Leslie  2017-01-12 11:51 I work for a global sports apparel brand, and we could not match the speed of the marketplace without Applescript and MacOS automation technologies. Many years ago when we first implemented large automated workflows, we absorbed two successive years of +20% increases in product SKUs without the need to scale up existing production art team staffing. Not only that, but the very significant decreases in user errors (typos, component placement, file naming) reduced previously typical rework while freeing proofing efforts to be more focused on essential product details. In all aspects of our business - product creation, preparation of manufacturing visual spec documents, color management, merchandising materials / catalogs, product photography - Applescript and deep cross application connections drive our capabilities. Data from corporate data stores are piped to drive workflows and assign metadata attributes to assets. We use hot folders on servers to drive MacOS purpose built “appliances” running as asset creation engines. Assets created in this way are then transferred to other servers for delivery to another art team. With everything we have in place, and all the successes we have achieved, we still regularly discover new opportunities for automation. I can’t foresee any end to how we can harness the deep reach and power of Applescript, Apple Events, and scriptable applications.

Soon after I started I began seeing opportunities to improve the department's efficiency by writing AppleScripts to automate many tasks that are done repeatedly in the department. From simple scripts to automatically create job folder structures (use many times a day by every department member) to more complex ones that automate processes and interactions with Excel, Acrobat and InDesign. I've even written a basic imposition program for InDesign with AppleScript. These scripts save untold man-hours over the course of a year. It will be a sad day if this ability is ever removed from MacOS. Reply Joern Dyck  2017-01-14 16:43 I once had the task to open and save 5.000 videos on a remote Xserve. Because back then, QuickTime files would only play in a browser after the file was loaded completely. (Today everybody expects that the video starts to play after the first few Bytes have been loaded.) Apple provided a way to prepare old videos for this: just open the file and save it again with the QuickTime Player, unaltered. But nobody can manually open 5.000 files in the QuickTime Player and save them again. With AppleScript, you just iterate through all files in the folder, open them one by one with QuickTime Player and save them again. It's a few lines of code, and the poor Xserve would be busy for some nights. (Because AppleScript is happy to work at night). I have solved many problems like this with AppleScript. Rarely gets AppleScript the credit that it deserves. Reply Chris  2017-01-17 11:24 I provide workflow support to some non-technical artists and creative professionals.

Automated many workflows over the years that preflight InDesign layouts, update links, create press-ready PDFs, automatic FTP transfer of files, also scripts which convert and archive files into organized files and folders which adhere to strict naming conventions. I have automated workflows for our Mobile apps group where print layouts are re-purposed for mobile and online web applications. These automated workflows save hundreds if not thousands of manual work hours to the point where if for some reason a script stops working there is a cry and backlash from the staff who refuse to go back to the old manual workflows.

Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-17 14:10 A key feature of AppleScript, which is largely overlooked or mocked, is that it's _accessible_ to non-programmers. The most overlooked feature (or failure to realize the value and necessity) of AppleScript seems to be the ability to communicate with numerous disparate applications within a single body of code to accomplish a complex task. Many prep-press technicians (pre-press primarily in the earlier days) have to "just get things done" any way they can and AppleScript EMPOWERS them to do that. We always use straight AppleScript, never use Automator. AppleScript, for me, _IS_ "Why Mac"?" - it's about being agile. If Apple kills the Mac, they';ve killed our automation. If they kill off AppleScript, they've lost future Mac sales. Much of what we wrote in the mid 90's can still be wrangled with in order to update as needed because the platform has remained stable. If Apple shifts gears on us, they've largely negated the advantages and efficiencies we've enjoyed since 1994. I work for a large commercial printer. Over the last 22 years we have used AppleScript to: 1. Construct entire print production workflows 2. Convert numerous file types to preferred file types 3. Create files for output on systems that were "not Mac compatible" 4. Automate (pre-press) near-line archive storage system retrievals (system 1) (46 GB's in the late 90's!) 5. Automate the archival of and then the retrieval of said near-line archived files (system 2) (over 50TB and counting) 6. Convert proprietarily built EPS files to more output-friendly EPS files using Illustrator 8 & "Scripz" 7. Generate web previews for a web-based print ordering system 8. Batch modify file names from digital cameras 9. Convert exported metadata (XMP files) from Lightroom to other text file formats 10. Work around bugs in Illustrator 8 by reading/altering/re-writing EPS files (late 90's) 11. Convert PMS colors in EPS files to either Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, or Black using Illustrator 8 with "Scripz" then Illustrator 9. 12. Create HTML table-based reports from various data sources 13. We were able to build an AppleScript/QuarkXPress-based automated imposition system that we used for over 10 years (late 90's) 14. Creating and populating Quark files from text files then generating several different forms of EPS and/or PS files based on output requirements, delivering them to remote servers 15. Exchange data with AS/400 via FTP with Fetch and raw text processing (2000) 16. Mount/dismount server volumes 17. Before iTunes existed, I built my digital jukebox using SoundApp and FileMaker - controlled by AppleScript 18. Automate the retrieval of, response to and attachment processing of incoming emailed orders using Entourage (since 2006-ish) 19. Automate the construction of a monthly auto trader magazine using Quark 4 and GraphicConverter, a more free-flow layout (not just dropping images in static locations) with flush-bottom columns, thousands of vehicles in less than an hour, hands-off (2000-2005) 20. Remove the necessity for pre-press operators to use the Finder to create jobs in Quark (v3 - v4) which involves creating a folder structure based on an invoice number, opening the desired Quark template (from thousands), saving it in the new folder, and updating slug lines in the document 21. Automatically check for and copy/install various files and/or folders (pre- OS X) 22. Automate the conversion of Quark files to InDesign including update fonts 23. Automate the extraction of table data from Word and data from Excel, manipulate and save as tab-delimited text files. 24. And numerous other utility scripts to manipulate, machinate and export text 25. Automated file copiers/movers based on an input control text file - part of our imposition proofing system built on-the-fly because something else in the workflow changed and we had to adapt while maintaining productivity. Reply Argyl Dickson  2017-01-17 14:44 We produce hundreds of short video files ranging from as short as 5 or 10 seconds to 5 or 6 minutes. The project architecture we put these assets in requires a .jpg file for the opening video frame and the ending video frame otherwise there is a flash during the start or end. It would sometimes take an hour or more to open up each video file and save out a still frame from the front and end of the video. So I wrote a script that we can now drop hundreds of files on and generate start and end frame .jpg files with the proper name modification and what would normally take sometimes hours is literally done in less then a minute. This is just one example of how applescript has saved me and the clients I work for hundreds of man hours through automation. Reply Carlos Ysunza  2017-01-17 15:07 We are a Photography/Graphic Design studio based in Mexico City, we are just 4 people working with 8 Macs and a very important part of our business depends entirely on AppleScript. We make a cosmetic catalog each month for one of our client, which is an international enterprise and a very important part of the process is completely automated using AppleScript. For the second biggest client, we build a complex print system combining a big data base in FileMaker, Photoshop and Epson plotters all of it is controlled 100% with AppleScrip. Of course we us AS for other no so big but time consuming projects in our every day work. Without the use of AppleScripting automation on the Mac would be impossible to do all this jobs with so little personal; for us is vital technology. Reply David Popham  2017-01-17 18:43 I use AppleScript mainly to automate InDesign and Illustrator, and the big advantage it has over JavaScript is how multiple applications can be tied together in a single script. Data from an Excel spreadsheet can be cleaned up in BBEdit then used to create a graph in Illustrator which can be placed in an InDesign document. Among the things I've done: - created more than 200 country profile sheets containing 13 tables and 13 charts - created a font management system - saved a company that I worked for from having to pay thousands of hours of labor for simply clicking a mouse (opening InDesign files and turning on/off certain layers, checking in/out files in vjoon K4) - processed thousands of Illustrator files for press - reformatted thousands of Word labels for my sister-in-law's real estate business Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:26 In my company we use AppleScripts in our own work every single day, and we often write scripts to help our customers with their various and unique problems. The time saved is enormous. A few examples: when we make appointments, my office manager clicks on the event in the calendar, then triggers a script (via DragThing) that creates emails that go to the customer and to me. The script also sends a text message to my phone. Each day, a script runs at 8:01 AM on my office manager's Mac, scanning the calendar for appointments the next business day. Emails are automatically sent to remind the customers of their appointments. The emails are all exactly as I want them-- never a mistake-- and they go out automatically. I wrote a script for a plastic surgeon. She has a form for new patients on her website. The results of the form are returned in an email. When those emails arrive, the receptionist clicks on them, then runs a script that reads the data and creates a new contact in Contacts. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:58 The script also creates a record in FileMaker, then prints a PDF for the doctor with all of the information presented in the layout she prefers. AppleScript ties apps together, giving a real 1 + 1 = 3 effect. Mail, Calendar, Contacts, FileMaker-- and many others-- can be part of a system held together with AppleScript. I write scripts for my customers who use InDesign and they save a ton of time with them. And, they get great results. For example, a picture on a page needs a caption below. I've written a script that get the width of the picture, then makes a text box the width of the picture and offset a standard amount vertically, then sets the style of the text in that text box to "caption style" (and creates the style if it is not present). It then groups the picture and the caption box, so they can be moved without messing up their relative positions. I'm not the best AppleScripter but I'm able to write scripts that I and my customers use to great advantage. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:59 I think of AppleScript as the Mac's "secret weapon." I love using it to make someone's life a little (or a lot) better. Reply James  2017-01-18 08:07 I use Applescript in our work environment for almost everything. From art preparation, to book creation, to ebook conversion, to file validation, to file distribution. Applescript drives our video management, MathML creation, and cover creation. The cost savings with Applescript are the sole reason my team's work has not been outsourced. The creation of chapter-level ebooks alone saves $1m a year in external costs, and is faster and more accurate than what a vendor can provide. Our Applescript driven page layout system has topped 1.2 million pages and keeps our costs well below industry rates. Simply put, without Applescript and the Apps which whole heartedly support it (like InDesign), my team's output would be a mere fraction of what it is while costing much more. Reply Olle Westbergh  2017-01-18 09:39 Oh no. We rely on Apple automation technologies a lot in our company workflows. If they are eliminated we would be forced to move from OS X to Linux or Windows… Reply Henry Domke  2017-01-18 13:57 AppleScript has been essential for automating some of the tedious parts of file preparation for my art business. The custom application created by Automated Workflows has saved me many hundreds of hours of work. Ray Robertson and Ben Waldie used AppleScript to create the application that keeps us running. It also has reduced errors. Please continue support for automation technologies! Yours truly, Henry Henry F Domke Henry Domke Fine Art Nature Art for Healthcare www.henrydomke.com Reply Larry McMunn  2017-01-18 17:08 In 1993 I bought a new product called AppleScript. I took a chance on it because it promised me — a graphic designer and artist — the ability to automate a lot of my page layout tasks without learning to program. Within two years, in 1995 I was able to partner with one of the largest mutual funds in the world to produce documents using this technology. Over the years, we added more and more financial companies to our client list producing quickly and efficiently tens of thousands of pages annually for these clients. 22 years later we are still using the core ideas and concepts developed back then. The success of our company would not have been possible without the power and flexibility of AppleScript. These documents get typeset and assembled automatically from many sources. Only the power of AppleScript will let us integrate this variety of data sources into a cohesive workflow. Some of these documents are developed from as many as 25-30 data sources. And these varied data sources come from text files, Word Docs, Excel workbooks, and a variety of databases from Filemaker to 4D to giant mainframe entities. Reply Eric Geoffroy  2017-01-19 11:53 It's the one ring that rules them all. With AppleScript I can control the Finder, web javascript, Python, bash. Many of my automated solutions use a diverse toolbox. Instead of a bunch of disconnected scripts, I am able to use AppleScript to push and pull data from these and other programming languages all controlled by a master script. Windows, Linux, and iOS do not have this. It's one of the few unique things Macs can do. Windows has copied everything else that used to make the Mac special. The time savings in automated solutions is huge. I've measured some of our old manual processes that take 2-6 hours and introduce human error. These same tasks have been reduced to 20 minutes. The ratio is 30:1 in some cases. I used to worry my company would make us use switch to PCs which would have destroyed our workflows. I fought against Microsoft Windows for years. Now I fear what Apple itself will do. Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-19 11:54 Agreed - Apple is becoming their own worst enemy (and ours). Reply Ash  2017-01-19 17:57 A computer that can't be programmed by the end user isn't a computer, it's a toaster. I use Applescript all the time, to reorganize files, crop photos in batches, convert text files into spreadsheets and vice-versa, and to prepare text files for publication. I would hate to lose Applescript - it is the reason I love my Mac. Reply alldritt  2017-01-19 18:01 As the developer of Script Debugger (AppleScript editor/debugger), I have a mountain of automations for my business. I have build automations which compile Script Debugger, collect release notes from our bug tracker, manage software versioning and perform software uploads. As a one-man shop, I need these things to be done quickly and correctly. Back when I did this by hand, there were always errors. I have bug tracking automations that process crash reports and customer support emails in various ways. I have email marketing automations. The list goes on and on. Automation makes it possible for a tiny organization like mine to accomplish what it does. At a personal level, I have many automations for day-to-day life. For instance, my local library sends email confirmations when I borrow books, CDs and DVDs. I have an AppleScript to process these emails and create Reminders for when each item is due back to the library. Reply Hanaan Rosenthal  2017-01-20 17:26 When I was 21 my wife and I had $2500 in the bank. With not even a high-school education I quit my job delivering candy, bought a used Mac II for $2,435, and called myself a Mac Consultant. Within a few short years I was using AppleScript for automating workflows for NYT, Fidelity Investments, Reuters and other large clients. I was not merely improving workflows, I was creating products that could not exist without automation. For example, the financial page and weather charts in the daily NYT paper, which are still being generated daily using my AppleScripts to this very day. Reply Mark  2017-01-23 08:08 I'm not a developer, I work in feature film post production. Since our projects are highly sensitive, all video shared across departments has to be heavily watermarked & individually marked per the recipient. This can be done inside Media Composer, but its clunky, slow, relatively manual & ties up the editing system. I was able to learn & write an AppleScript application which takes Quicktime files & creates FFmpeg commands to convert them to our required formats along with multiple burnins - names, dates, timecode's, even cutting off frame handles using filename data. Many variables are automatically read from the source files. AppleScript then formats all this data for the FFmpeg filters. Drop Quicktime files, choose presets, press encode. The formatted FFmpeg 'jobs' are split into batches and sent to the Terminal for batch processing. All this happens in the background, film editing work continues. The time savings are enormous. Hours per day. AppleScript is indispensable for us. Reply Apta  2017-01-23 23:50 I use an AppleScript for the Mail app to automatically grab the raw source of spam messages and send an email reporting the spam to Spamcop. It's very tedious to do that manually and, when there is so much junk mail to report every day, I would give up if it weren't for AppleScript. Reply Ray Robertson  2017-01-24 10:12 Part I: Above, several of my clients and AppleScript Pro alumni have described very cool automated solutions. So I’m discussing Mac automation in general… Like many others, I got my first computer because I wanted to avoid dull, repetitive, manual tasks. Then I realized that although I was accomplishing more on a Mac at work I was still repeating many manual steps every day. The market demands that commercial software must appeal to tens of thousands of users in order to be successful. Consequently, no software does exactly what we need for our own work. To move beyond that, I started making shortcuts with macro utilities to drive the UI, but otherwise my only choice would have been to become a full-fledged programmer and write my own apps from scratch. Reply Ray Robertson  2017-01-24 10:12 Part II: Mac automation technologies like AppleScript and Automator provide a “middle way” solution which bridges that gap. I can customize existing applications to do exactly what I need to get done, without creating an entire program from the ground up. AppleScript’s English-like syntax and Automator’s puzzle-piece interface are often derided by traditional programmers. But it is a great solution for people working in deadline-driven production environments, where a user may only be able to focus on automation a few hours a month. In the publishing world, the automation potential is huge. Often a six-week process can be reduced to a couple of days. Companies really need these types of customized solutions, and Mac automation is often the only answer. App extensions must, again, appeal to thousands of users, and while saving some time they end up requiring users to go through the same manual steps every day. Reply Ray Robertson  2017-01-24 10:12 Part III: We must also remember that AppleScript in the hands of an experience script is a rapid development environment. One of my first clients had an IT staff of 40 people, with one group dedicated to text automation and another dedicated to images. Using a Windows platform, major new automation implementations would typically take six months, but not be able provide full automation. Enter AppleScript, where my development would typically take two weeks and be crucial to the workflow. And fixing last-minute problems where other technologies fell short? Typically a day or two. We need these automation technologies to continue because they remain a major advantage to the Mac platform, saving companies huge amounts of money every year, and making the lives of so many users much less tedious. ### Reply Anon  2017-01-24 10:28 I work as a developer on macOS for a large, multinational packaging design company. Amongst other things, I write AppleScripts to automate the laborious parts of the work. When I automate something, I estimate how much time we save per use, then log every use in a database. Its then relatively simple to calculate how much was saved by each app every year. Last year AppleScript based solutions saved us well over £100k. And that's quite puny compared to my old employers' stats. The fact that we can do this is what keeps up buying Macs. If we couldn't, then Windows would start looking like an attractive option to some. As it is, we can say, "Hey! Don't go to Windows or you'll lose £100k plus a year!". Pretty persuasive. I know AppleScript has some pretty big flaws. If you have to get rid of it then so be it, but only if its replaced by something better. Reply Hank Roberts  2017-01-24 16:20 I asked at NASA how to download the full earth imagery from DSCOVR http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and one of the scientists there sent me an Automator script I can run that goes to their archive and collects new pictures.

The lawsuit comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US sued Qualcomm over alleged anticompetitive practices to maintain a monopoly in the semiconductor market for mobile phones. Qualcomm denied the allegations in a statement, saying the FTC's "central thesis", i.e. that the firm withheld processors to gain exclusive licensing agreements, is "wrong". Related: MWC 2017 Now, Apple, which uses numerous Qualcomm patents in its iPhone range, has filed suit in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of withholding $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple claims the San Diego-based chipmaker withheld the rebates because of the Apple's involvement in an investigation carried out by South Korea's anti-trust regulator, the Fair Trade Commission. The regulator fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) in December for allegedly violating competition laws. Qualcomm has responded to Apple's allegations in a written statement, in which it says the claims are "baseless", and that the company has "intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented." Apple alleges Qualcomm neglected to pay the promised rebates as a response to it's compliance with South Korea's Fair Trade Commission's investigation. Related: iPhone 8 As Reuters reports, the company states in its lawsuit: "Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused." But Qualcomm accused Apple of attempting to turn regulators against the company in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Apple's lawsuit also alleges that Qualcomm overcharged the company for use of its chips and patents. As the firm states in its lawsuit: "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," Qualcomm is the owner of several essential patents in the CDMA (code division multiple access) and LTE (long-term evolution) mobile standards, many of which were used in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The firm charges mobile companies royalties for use of the patents, providing Apple with GSM and CDMA-enabled iPhone 7 modem chips, which were used in the US handsets. In its response to Apple's lawsuit, Qualcomm says it "welcome[s] the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court." WATCH: What's the no.1 smartphone in the world?

Apple usually shows off a preview of a brand new iOS every June at its Worldwide Developers Conference so we might have a while to wait before it's confirmed. Of course unlike Google, Apple updates all of its iOS apps (including FaceTime) at the same time as the mobile operating system itself. The rumor comes via Israeli site The Verifier, and isn't the most rock solid of sources. Apple does have engineers working in the country though, so it's possible that the insiders speaking to The Verifier are the real deal. Group call me, baby Irrespective of the validity or otherwise of the rumor's source, it would be difficult to believe that Apple isn't working on adding group calling to FaceTime at some point in the future, letting users video chat in groups rather than just one-to-one. It's a feature that's now live in young messaging upstarts such as Facebook Messenger, as well as long-lasting apps such as Microsoft's Skype and Google's Hangouts. If  group calling doesn't come to FaceTime soon, Apple risks using some precious market share. While the source of the rumor might be questionable, we think the chance of group calling arriving in FaceTime is very likely - and WWDC 2017 would be the perfect stage to show it off to the world. Can you remember everything that happened at WWDC 2016?

Apple may switch to a film sensor from the current FPCB sensor in order to provide better 3D Touch user experience, as a film sensor offers higher sensitivity. Also, we expect the new OLED iPhone will come with a flexible OLED panel. To avoid deforming the form factor of the flexible OLED panel from touch operation pressure, a metal structural part will be placed under the film sensor to provide more robust structural support.Kuo also believes Apple is developing a new Touch ID technology for its next iPhone "to complement its full-screen (zero bezel) form factor design and to enhance transactions security". According to Kuo, the existing "under glass" design of fingerprint recognition doesn't meet the requirements of full-screen form factor designs, therefore an "under panel" placement is required. As a result, Kuo says Apple aims to switch from the current capacitive-type to an optical-type system. Despite the technology still being in the early stages of development and the fact that OLED panel makers will have to provide bespoke designs for the system to work, Kuo believes Apple has the bargaining power to request the customizations. Notably, Kuo believes the fingerprint recognition system will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" for enhanced security. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution." Judging by the bio-recognition patents that Apple has applied for, we believe it is leaning toward facial recognition technology rather than iris recognition. However, we note that the technical challenges of facial recognition include: (1) algorithms; (2) hardware design; and (3) the build-out of a database for verification and authentication, which could be time consuming. As such, before Apple can fully replace the fingerprint system with facial recognition, a combination of the two steps of bio-recognition could be a valid solution for enhancing transactions security. Assuming the technological challenges are not too great and adoption this year isn't too soon, Kuo suggests Apple's new system will usher in a "paradigm shift" for the application of biometric identification in smartphones. Kuo's latest report builds on previous predictions regarding this year's "10th anniversary" iPhone, which is expected to feature a radical redesign with an embedded home button in an edge-to-edge display, a glass body, and potentially wireless charging. Previous rumors suggesting the iPhone 8 could include advanced biometric features like facial recognition or iris scanning have pointed to the possibility that they could also power augmented reality camera functions.

Whoops, I was too late Rating: 12 Votes twolf2919 3 days ago at 07:46 am Facial recognition in a smartphone is a solution looking for a problem. In addition to being much more difficult than fingerprint sensing (beards, glasses, lighting, even the angle at which you hold the phone all can affect recognition accuracy) the payoff just isn't there, in my opinion. Suppose all the technical challenges are overcome - what do you end up with? A phone you first have to hold up to your face to unlock it - whereas with the fingerprint sensor the phone can be unlocked on the way up out of your pocket. For this reason, if Apple does adopt face recognition, to me it's a sign they've run out of ideas - resorting to what's really a gimmick to try and get a few more gadget freak customers. Rating: 11 Votes Dave245 3 days ago at 06:22 am Kuo just makes up stuff as he goes, doesn't he?

Rating: 10 Votes Chupa Chupa 3 days ago at 05:56 am The best feature will be the built-in yearly disappointment for the babies around here. Disappointment, no. Left unenthusiastic, yes. The problem is we are encouraged to upgrade annually but tech doesn't move that fast. So of course the "next year's" model is only going to be incremental and unexceptional. Also it's not surprising that MR readers have imaginations bigger than reality can provide so expectations are larger than that of the general consumer.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple sues Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman January 20, 2017: 5:43 PM ET The original iPhone almost looked like this The world's largest company is suing one of its suppliers for effectively holding it hostage. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) filed a lawsuit Friday against Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30), accusing it of charging "excessive royalties" and withholding payments in retaliation for Apple cooperating with South Korean regulators that are investigating the chip supplier. Qualcomm, which provides crucial chips used in the iPhone, allegedly charges Apple an unfair amount to to license its cellular patents, according to the lawsuit. Apple is also seeking nearly $1 billion in rebate payments, which it claims have been wrongfully withheld. The previously agreed upon rebates were conditional on Apple putting Qualcomm chips in its products and not pushing litigation that accused the chip maker of unfair licensing practices. "To protect this business scheme, Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple said in a statement about the lawsuit provided to CNNTech.

Regulators in South Korea fined Qualcomm roughly $850 million last month for forcing phone manufacturers into unfair patent licensing agreements in order to get its modem chips. Apple's lawsuit comes the same week as the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust complaint against Qualcomm for using its position in the market to push "onerous and anti-competitive supply and licensing terms" on cellphone companies. Qualcomm "maintains a 'no license, no chips' policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cellphone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms," according to the FTC complaint. Reps for Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Qualcomm's stock closed down more than 2% Friday following the lawsuit.

Could tax reform turn into a big payday for shareholders of the tech giant? Find out what dividend investors should expect this year. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 21, 2017 at 8:02AM The success of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made many investors rich, and throughout most of the tech giant's history, dividends played a tiny role. Recently, though, Apple has embraced dividends, and now, some income-hungry investors look to the iPhone maker for its quarterly payouts as well as its potential for stock-price increases. With tax reform proposals that could unlock some of Apple's overseas cash stash, Apple might be in a better position than ever to consider a dividend boost this year. Let's look more closely to see if Apple is likely to raise its dividend in 2017. Image source: Apple. Dividend stats on Apple Current Quarterly Dividend Per Share $0.57 Current Yield 1.9% Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend Increases Five years Payout Ratio 27% Last Increase May 2016 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to ex-dividend date. Apple's dividend history is short but sweet Like many tech stocks, Apple was slow to jump on the dividend bandwagon. The company paid a small dividend during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but it stopped making those payments in 1995 and left shareholders with a 17-year period during which they received nothing in dividends from Apple. In 2012, Apple restored its dividend, setting a quarterly payout of about $0.38 per share when you adjust for the 7-for-1 split the tech company made in 2014. That worked out to a yield of a bit less than 2% and a payout ratio of about 30% of Apple's earnings at the time, which was in line with what many other technology companies had done with their dividend policies. Since then, Apple has rewarded dividend investors with payout boosts every year. Increases of 15% and 8% came in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and subsequent increases have been roughly 10% each year. Along the way, Apple has become one of the biggest payers of dividends in the stock market, routinely sending more than $10 billion in capital back to shareholders every year through its quarterly payouts. AAPL Dividend data by YCharts. Yet not everyone was happy about Apple's emergence as a dividend giant. Even when the dividend first began in 2012, some saw the move as a sign that Apple's days as a growth stock had come to an end. Fears arose that Apple would begin to resemble worse-performing mature tech stocks, despite the success of its budding lines of mobile devices. What's ahead for Apple? If nothing else, the fact that Apple has achieved the largest market capitalization of any stock in the market has reduced its future growth potential to some extent. Yet the iPhone maker has continued to increase its free cash flow, securing funding necessary for its double-digit percentage dividend increases each year. Some criticize Apple's failure to deliver revolutionary innovations in recent years, but the company has effectively taken advantage of still-strong demand for its mobile products and has sustained customer loyalty with incremental evolutionary changes to the devices over time. Indeed, even with its dividend hikes over the years, Apple's payout ratio has fallen slightly, now resting in the mid- to upper-20s as a percentage of earnings. If Apple were to decide that its growth potential had in fact slowed, it would be natural to pay a higher proportion of income to shareholders as dividends, and that could bring a big jump in yield to the stock. Finally, the potential for tax reform could prompt a different approach to dividend policy. Currently, Apple keeps considerable amounts of cash overseas in order to avoid repatriation taxes. With the incoming Trump administration considering tax cuts to encourage businesses like Apple to bring capital back to the U.S., the Cupertino-based tech giant might take advantage of such provisions and boost the amount it returns to shareholders. Will Apple raise its dividend in 2017? For now, Apple remains squarely in growth mode, and so a typical 10% increase would bring the quarterly dividend up to $0.63 per share. At current prices, that would push the yield slightly above the 2% mark, keeping pace with recent stock-price gains. The tech giant has made a habit of announcing its annual dividend increases in late April, and there's no reason to expect a departure from that practice in 2017. The only serious question is whether any future change in tax policy could prompt a response from Apple in accelerating its dividend growth going forward. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Apple.

Even a quick search online will bring up consumers reeling with frustration against the stubby cable. But, of course, every part of every product created by companies like Apple and Samsung will have had countless hours spent on their design. So the length of the cable is unlikely to be a design flaw. So how long is it? The standard cable you receive in your sleek minimalist white box is one metre long. Despite being advised not to, many of us will use our smart phones in bed. A standard Ikea bed and mattress is about 70cm high. If you have you phone plugged into a standard plug near the floor the only way you are going to be able to read plugged in phone is to lie right on the edge of your bed. The same is true for desks. Unless you are lucky enough to have sockets halfway up the wall behind your desk you are probably charging your phone on the floor. Not end of the world - but frustrating. As one user says: "I cannot sit at my desk which is 10ft from the wall and sit in my chair and hold the phone to my ear without sliding my chair closer to the wall and leaning towards the wall." How does the iPhone compare to other phones? The Samsung Galaxy comes with a 50 per cent longer charger as standard at 1.5 metres. Google's new phone, the Pixel, comes with two cables. The standard plug charger is the same as the iPhone but it does come with a one-metre USB-C to USB-C charger also. So why is it so short? We approached Apple to ask how they had decided on the length of their cable. They seemed confused about why we're asking. The company tends not to respond to enquiries about products outside official releases. However there are thousands of Apple discussion forums online, many of the threads have company staff commenting on them, that may hold the answer. Writing on the Q and A website Quora, former Apple employee Mark Steiner said: "The product design team studies everything. The accessory cables, in particular, are studied, researched, tested and produced to be at 'the ideal' length for the majority of uses. "This includes from the back of an iMac, or the side of a MacBook to a spot on your desk. Or from the wall power outlet behind your bedside table to your bedside. Or from your kitchen counter power outlet to a spot on the counter. "This is all determined with the intention that you have the fewest number of 'loops' or 'tidy-ups' possible. If the design team had their way, the cable would be infinitely elastic; in fact, if they truly had their way, there wouldn't be a need for a cable, period. "There is also a degree of 'conservation of effort'. Instead of devoting a considerable amount of time and resources to producing three or four different lengths of cable, in eighteen different colors (because, invariably, somebody always wants black or pink), with all the packaging and merchandising variables to support them, you just trust that one of your partnership manufacturers will produce them for you." Software engineer Anthony Yeh suggests a longer cable would be impractical. "It is probably because they are trying to keep the design as minimal as possible, which is a theme that shows throughout their product line," he said. "For many people and many uses, the typical six-foot long charging cable used by other manufacturers is just too much. It is a pain to carry in a bag; you either have to spend time winding and unwinding it every time, or spend time untangling it. "When using it with a computer, you usually only need to get from one point on your desk to another. With a six-foot USB cable, I have to wind it up and the coil takes up a lot of area on my desk." So what should you do if you want a longer cable? To avoid stating the obvious let's assume you have considered just unplugging the phone. Your best option is to buy a longer cable. Unfortunately for you this could involve shelling out the same as most people's monthly phone contract. Apple's 2m version of the cable is £29. Obviously are alternatives out there but you must be very careful they are reputably made and the correct spec. There has been a significant increase in fire service call outs due to dodgy knockoff chargers and cables. Another way round it is to use a portable charger and have your phone plugged into that.

Name: Subject: Message: (Update: Qualcomm responds) Qualcomm getting sued by Apple for $1 billion Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 54 1148 12 Update: Qualcomm has officially responded to Apple’s accusation, rejecting it and claiming Apple has “intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations” and adding that “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world”. Get your popcorn kids, we might just have a new Google vs Oracle cat fight on our hands.  This article originally appeared on our sister site, Tab Times Apple is engaging in a new patent royalty war against mobile chip maker Qualcomm. In a newly filed lawsuit, Apple claims that Qualcomm charges the company for patents that “they have nothing to do with” and even says Qualcomm has tried to withhold payments it is supposed to make to Apple. See also: Qualcomm charged by US government with anti-competitive practices 7 days ago According to a statement sent by Apple to media outlets, this lawsuit claims Qualcomm collects money “for no reason” on features that Apple launched, “such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few.” Apple claims Qualcomm’s use of what Apple calls “older, legacy, standards” as the basis for its patents and royalties has caused Apple to get hit with “at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” Furthermore, when Apple decided to work with government law enforcement agencies in their own investigations of Qualcomm, Apple claims Qualcomm decided to withhold nearly $1 billion in payments to the company. Apple is now seeking about $1 billion in damages. Earlier this week, Qualcomm got hit with charges by the US Federal Trade Commission, claiming the company has been engaging in anti-competitive practices surrounding its baseband processor products. Qualcomm has denied the FTC charges but as of this writing it has yet to respond to Apple’s lawsuit.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile CIRP finds fewer Android users are switching following iPhone 7 release Zach Epstein @zacharye January 19th, 2017 at 2:23 PM Share Tweet We’ve already established that the narrative from certain tech blogs ahead of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch last year was ridiculous; Apple’s new smartphones are anything but “boring.” The company’s latest iPhone lineup might look a great deal like the iPhones that came before them — and the iPhones that Apple released in 2014, as well. Inside, however, these new handsets are different beasts entirely. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the most powerful smartphones in the world by a landslide, and they feature displays that one expert has called “visually indistinguishable from perfect.” They’re water-resistant, they have great battery life compared to rival models, and they have some of the best cameras in the business. According to a new report issued by a reputable market research firm, however, Apple’s latest iPhones haven’t drawn Android users away from Google-powered phones anywhere near as much as previous iPhones have. Don't Miss: How to enable the ‘dark mode’ feature hiding in your iPhone browser right now Chicago-based Consumer Intelligence Research Partners on Thursday released its quarterly report on iPhone sales trends, and the firm’s findings for the December quarter were mixed. On the plus side, CIRP’s digging determined that the flagship iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus accounted for a higher percentage of iPhone sales during the holiday quarter than their predecessors did in the year-ago quarter. According to CIRP, 72% of all iPhone sales in the US were iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus models. Meanwhile, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus accounted for roughly 68% of iPhone sales in the December quarter a year earlier. CIRP found that 40% of all iPhones sold in the US market were iPhone 7 models, while an estimated 32% where the larger and pricier iPhone 7 Plus. “In the first full quarter of availability, the flagship iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models accounted for a slightly higher percentage of iPhone sales than the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus did last year,” CIRP cofounder Josh Lowitz said. “The entry level iPhone SE had a smaller share of sales than the similarly positioned 5S did a year ago, and the most expensive iPhone 7 Plus garnered a larger share than the 6S Plus did in the same quarter a year ago. The shift to newer, more expensive phones suggests that Apple could see an uptick in average selling price for iPhones, at least based on US market dynamics.” CIRP’s research suggests that 16% of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus buyers upgraded from either an iPhone 6s or an 6s Plus, while 37% upgraded from an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. The firm found that only 15% switched from an Android phone to an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus in the December quarter, which is down sharply from the estimated 29% who switched from an Android phone to the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus in the same quarter a year earlier. “The new 7 and 7 Plus models attracted mostly loyal iPhone owners, rather than Android owners,” Lowitz’s partner and cofounder Mike Levin said. “Only 15% of 7 and 7 Plus buyers switched from an Android phone, consistent with the 14% of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus that came from Android in the same quarter last year. This continues the trend of new iPhone models attracting mostly repeat iPhone buyers. The lower-priced, one year-old models, attract a higher percentage of Android switchers, but on a smaller base. Interestingly, the entry-level iPhone SE has a very small Android switcher constituency, but is somewhat effective in attracting first-time smartphone buyers.” Of note, CIRP’s findings are based on a survey of only 500 Apple customers. While Apple never reports iPhone sales mix, some of the research firm’s past estimates have been in line with several Wall Street analysts’ estimates, while others have varied substantially.

More by Mike Elgan Why 'invisible smart glasses' are the... 7 things Silicon Valley needs to stop... Why Apple will make smart glasses Software is eating the food world It's easy to dismiss the speculation that Apple is working on smart glasses. It's hard to picture Apple selling smart glasses. But it's also hard to picture them not doing it. If smart glasses become a popular and mainstream consumer electronics category, Apple will almost be required to enter the market as a fiduciary responsibility to Apple shareholders. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] Consider the plight of poor Apple. Smartphone margins are shrinking. The tablet market is flabby. Smartwatches aren't panning out as a mainstream platform. Apple TV is still not going to bring in huge profits. So Apple has to adapt and keep up with the evolution of consumer technology to continue to dominate the market as well as secure its growth. Also, the choice of smartphone in the future may be dictated by the use of smart glasses. If mainstream smart glasses require an Android phone, Apple could lose market share. What's certain is that Apple is working on smart glasses. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was thinking about entering the "digital glasses" market. That report was based on anonymous sources, who said Apple is considering glasses that would go on sale next year and "show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality." ODG ODG's R-8 smart glasses give you what looks like a 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front of you. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. Apple would never make anything like this. The Financial Times reported early last year that Apple was building a large team focused on augmented and virtual reality, and had poached employees from Microsoft and Lytro. Intriguingly, Apple has made some augmented reality-based company acquisitions. Apple bought PrimeSense, which makes the sensor technology in Microsoft's Kinect. They also nabbed augmented reality startups Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient and Flyby. AR-related patents by Apple go back a decade. And tech blogger and evangelist Robert Scoble posted a rumor on Facebook that Apple may be working with Carl Zeiss on smart glasses. (I told you about Carl Zeiss Smart Optics technology in this space a year ago.) All that planning, thinking and spending may pay off for Apple when smart glasses go mainstream. And when I say mainstream, I mean totally mainstream. What if nearly all glasses were smart glasses? The company that makes your glasses is getting 'smart' The signs of the mainstreaming of augmented and mixed reality are everywhere. The biggest one yet happened earlier this week when French lens giant Essilor merged with Italy's eyeglass behemoth Luxottica in a $53 billion deal that will result in the world's largest glasses company, to be called EssilorLuxottica. Wait, Essilor? Luxottica? These aren't exactly well-known companies in tech circles. Let me introduce you. Essilor is the world's largest maker of corrective lenses. The company is strongly focused on research and introduced the world's first branded progressive lenses. You also may have encountered Essilor on its retail sites, FramesDirect.com and EyeBuyDirect.com. Your optometrist definitely has. The company runs the MyOnlineOptical e-commerce site for eyecare professionals. Essilor also unveiled last year a prototype of an augmented reality system for the visually impaired called MyEye, which enables any text to be read, converted to text and then read aloud to the wearer. And you're probably already a big Luxottica customer. The company sells under most of the mainstream brands you're familiar with, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Giorgio Armani, Brooks Brothers, Bulgari, Burberry, Chanel, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, Polo Ralph Lauren, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Versace and many others. And you've likely shopped at Luxottica stores, including Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Glasses.com and others. So the world's biggest lens company is merging with the world's biggest frame company. Here's the best part: Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnières told the media that the purpose of the merger was innovation in "connected glasses," and the ability to deliver them "extremely fast to consumers through all the stores of the world and all [our] networks," according to the Financial Times. I'll refer you to the list of brands and stores above. That's where the world's largest eyeglasses company plans to deliver smart glasses, and fast. What's wrong with today's smart glasses? While lots of companies explore what's possible with the technology, and what's desirable among consumers, the field is really wide open for Apple and EssilorLuxottica. Consider what's out there. We all know about the splashy, high-end, mixed reality projects, including Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap's big project. And, recently, we learned a lot more from CES. A San Francisco-based company called Osterhaut Design Group (ODG), which already sells successful industrial AR smart glasses, this month unveiled a sub-$1,000 pair for consumers called the R-8. The glasses connect to an Android phone via Bluetooth LE. The company claims that the glasses show two 720p screens that look to the wearer like one 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. This is a great example of what's happening in the market generally. Current consumer smart-glasses products are either too high-powered and therefore bulky, too expensive, too ambitious or too narrowly focused -- for example, on sports performance. The Sony SmartEyeGlass, GlassUp UNO and Factory 4.0, Epson Moverio BT-300, Jins Meme, Recon Jet, Optinvent Ora-2 Professional Smart Glass, CastAR, LaForge Shima, Oakley’s Radar Pace and HiAR Glasses all fall into these categories. They're all too much on the face to be worn around all the time. Another emerging category are so-called smart glasses that measure brain waves. Safilo Group, which is the company behind Dior, Fendi and Hugo Boss glasses, is developing ordinary looking glasses that measure brainwaves, then send that data to an app where users can monitor their moods. Finally, of course, there is the already thriving enterprise smart glasses market. Chinese computer and smartphone giant Lenovo launched new smart glasses at CES. The company's Glass C200 product comes with a pocket unit that connects the glasses via high speed LTE mobile wireless. I told you about Osterhaut Design Group's consumer announcement. They also announced an R-9 for enterprises. We've been hearing about Vuzix's M300 Smart Glasses for enterprise for quite a while, but the product should go on sale this month. Why the market is wide open for Apple All the bulky, goofy, expensive smart glasses on the market now may find niches in gaming, drone-control, enterprise and other uses. But they won't go mainstream, and therefore won't change how we use our mobile devices. I wrote in this space about Vue glasses, which use bone-conduction audio and blinking lights to deliver communion with a smartphone and thereby deliver smartness. They offer neither screen nor camera. But they do offer one feature that makes them more mainstream than all the other products I told you about: They can pass for regular glasses. They also demonstrate a core feature of smart glasses that just about everyone overlooks. It turns out that glasses are a perfect place to deliver audio interaction -- a microphone and bone-conduction audio. Because glasses can hold a bigger battery, glasses are better than earbuds for interaction with a virtual assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant or Cortana. They can be worn all day, every day. They keep the ears unobstructed. And the battery can last for days between charges. For that reason alone I believe smart glasses are inevitable. Any subtle integration of a screen -- perchance a camera -- is frosting on the cake, so to speak. The weird thing about wearables is that they're fashion, with all the attributes of customization and personal identity associated with fashion. The tech sector has proved that it's not really up to the challenge of offering compelling fashion designs in wearables. But Luxottica is a fashion company. And, let's face it, Apple is too. Apple demonstrated as much with its Apple Watch, which comes in a dizzying variety of types, faces and bands. I think the world of mainstream smart glasses is coming. These glasses will have to look just like regular prescription glasses and sunglasses. And you'll be able to order them as a check-box item whenever you get your regular glasses. When you think of smart glasses as ugly, bulky and dorky like today's smart glasses, it doesn't seem like Apple would enter the market. But when you realize that tomorrow's smart glasses will look like ordinary glasses, that they'll be mainstream consumer devices, and that they'll be luxury fashion goods, it's clear that Apple will definitely want to get a share of the market.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

It seems like it has compatible with all the versions. YouTube Music We all know YouTube. This app, however, is a tiny bit different to the great website. With this app, you get “A YouTube built just for music”. Basically, this form of YouTube cuts out the non-music videos, leaving you with only the music.

Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

The Cupertino-based tech giant has several great gadgets set to be released this year. One of these is the much awaited iPad Pro 2. Many tech fans are wondering though whether the upcoming iPad Pro 2 release will spell the end of the iPad Air for Apple. Many Apple fans have been waiting for the iPad Air 3 which is the next generation in the iPad Air product line. The iPad Air 2 was released way back in 2014 which is why the iPad Air 3 release is already long overdue. iPad Pro 2 Release While Apple has not really given a reason why the iPad Air 3 has not yet launched, the iPad Pro 2 release could have something to do with it. According to Macworld UK, the iPad Pro 2 will be launched in March. However, there is no word yet however as to the release of the iPad Air 3. John Solinap | The Bitbag The iPad Pro 2 could very well render the iPad Air obsolete. The thin and light tablet category or Apple has been placed in a tough spot as the other iPad versions have become thinner and more lightweight. The original iPad Pro was a 12.9-inch behemoth while the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was a smaller, mainstream device. Apple could make the iPad Pro 2 even smaller and thinner though which will make it very similar to the iPad Air product line. Apple is not only rumored to be considering changes to the iPad Air. There are also rumors that the MacBook Air product line could likewise find itself being killed off. With Apple being able to add powerful hardware into a smaller devices, the “Air” product line could eventually find itself being redundant. While there is still no official word on whether Apple will not release the iPad Air 3 anymore, more news will surely surface in the coming months. Be sure to check back here soon to find out more about the iPad Pro 2, the iPad Air 3 as well as on the other great gadgets releasing soon.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews Google Pixel review Pixel perfect? By Damien McFerran Published 21/01/2017 When Google announced the Nexus One back in 2010 it marked an important turning point for the company's Android mobile operating system. While Google's vision had always been different to Apple's - the aim being to create an OS standard that other hardware manufacturers could support, like Microsoft's Windows platform on computers - what was badly needed was a standard-bearer; a handset that would get a "pure" version of the OS and serve as a benchmark for others to imitate. The Nexus program was exactly that; Google worked with hardware partners like HTC, Samsung, LG, Motorola and Huawei to create a new Nexus device every 12 months, each of which would get Android updates before any other phone. Unsurprisingly, the Nexus line quickly became very popular with dedicated Android users tired of the awkward custom UI skins and annoying bloatware so common on the majority of handsets. At the end of 2016 however, Google decided to kill off the Nexus name. While this might seem like a rather extreme move, the company's next flagship phones - the Pixel and large-screen Pixel XL - are Nexus devices in all but name. What has changed this time around is Google's approach; while the firm was happy to allow hardware partners to shape previous Nexus offerings in their own image, the Pixel has been designed from the ground up by Google itself, with HTC drafted in to handle production. However, you won't see HTC's logo anywhere on the casing - instead, there's a large "G", which leaves you in little doubt regarding which company is responsible. Shedding such a famous name might seem like a foolhardy venture, but there's another reason for Pixel - Nexus devices have had a reputation for offering cutting-edge tech at mid-range prices, but Google now wants to compete with the higher end of the market; in short, it wants to the Pixel to be a match for the iPhone and Galaxy S range. That means powerful internals, premium materials and - of course - a price tag in the region of £700, SIM-free. Google isn't trying to undercut its rivals this time around; it wants to create a handset that has the prestige of an iPhone - and it has succeeded. Google Pixel specs The first Android handset to be designed by Google inside and out, the Pixel features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 chipset, an evolution on the 820 seen in many of 2016's most notable flagships. The 5-inch AMOLED screen offers a full HD resolution, while storage comes is 32 and 128GB variants. There's no means of adding in more memory however, and the handset lacks any kind of water or dust resistance. Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm Weight: 143g Chipset: Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 Processor: Quad-core (2x 2.15GHz Kryo plus 2x 1.6GHz Kryo) Graphics Core: Adreno 530 RAM: 4GB Screen: 5-inch 1080p AMOLED capacitive touchscreen Storage: 32/128GB Primary Camera: 12.3-megapixel primary, 8-megapixel secondary, 2160p30, 1080p30/60/120, 720p240 video Connectivity: 4G, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC, USB Type-C Gallery: HTC may have handled production but it's Google's name that takes pride of place on the back of the Pixel. The design language apes the iPhone but there are original elements, too; the two-tone back panel being perhaps the most divisive. Buy Google Pixel from Amazon In fact, at first glance it feels like Google has been a little too literal when it comes to imitating the success of the iPhone; the Pixel shares a lot of design language with Apple's handset. The rounded sides, 2.5D curved screen edges and notable antenna bands look like they've been lifted from the iPhone 6 series. However, it's fair to point out that there's little scope for design innovation in the mobile arena these days, and the Pixel does has come with some noteworthy differences. The two-tone design of the back is sure to divide opinion; the bottom half is metal while a glass panel sits at the top, encasing the camera module and fingerprint scanner. Elsewhere, there's a 3.5mm headphone socket on the top edge while the bottom has a USB Type-C port and a single speaker. The power button and volume rocker are on the right-hand side, and the Nano SIM tray on the left-hand side. Irrespective on how you feel about Google's design choices, the Pixel feels like a premium phone - it's just a shame that it's not waterproof. 2016 was the year that Apple finally embraced this feature after years of it being the sole preserve of Android handset makers such as Samsung and Sony, and for the Pixel to lack such a selling-point is unfortunate, though not a deal-breaker. Like the Nexus 5X and 6P before it, the Pixel's fingerprint scanner is mounted on the rear of the device rather than on the front (as it is on Apple and Samsung's phones). It's easy to argue the merits of both; on the Pixel, your finger naturally rests on the back on the handset and this allows you to unlock it from the moment it emerges from your pocket. However, you can't unlock the device when it's lying face-up on a flat surface, and in that respect a front-mounted scanner is arguably preferable. Placement aside, the scanner here is fast and accurate - perhaps even more so than the iPhone 7's. You can wake the device and unlock it with a single touch, and it's so responsive you may even find yourself accidentally turning on the Pixel just by brushing your fingers across its back. Flipping the Pixel over reveals a rather blank front, another consequence of having the fingerprint scanner on the rear. Mercifully the moment the phone is awake this area springs to life thanks to the gorgeous full HD AMOLED screen. Pin-sharp, bold, bright and packing striking contrast, it's easily one of the phone's strongest features, and because it's AMOLED - black pixels are effectively turned off and therefore consume no power - the phone benefits from Android's "Ambient Display" feature that shows the time, date and any pending notifications you have without you having to wake the device itself. This feature kicks in when an email, text or any other alert is fired, or when you pick up the phone. You can also double-tap the screen to trigger it if the handset is resting on a flat surface. GFXBench's Manhattan test is a hard workout for the GPU, but the reality is that few games actually test cutting-edge graphics power these days. Google Pixel iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Mi5 LG G5 Nexus 5S Geekbench Single-Core 1687 3000 3306 2171 1918 2077 1263 Geekbench Multi-Core 4187 5330 5345 6465 4616 4135 3436 3DMark Graphics 31766 63668 62595 32404 27463 31787 22074 3DMark Physics 18641 15267 15231 17730 18913 21268 12641 3DMark IceStorm Unlimited 27468 37352 37015 27370 26639 28639 18934 GFXBench T-Rex 93.0 120.1 122.4 87.0 72.0 86.0 38.0 GFXBench Manhattan 49.0 62.3 63.2 29.0 25.0 31.0 16.2 Nexus phones have traditionally featured quite beefy internal tech and the Pixel looks to continue this commendable trend. At its core is the Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821, a quad-core chipset which is comprised of 2.15GHz Kryo and 1.GHz Kryo cores working in pairs, while an Adreno 530 graphics processor handles the visuals and 4GB of RAM keeps things ticking over. While the 821 is an incremental update on the existing 820 - which appeared in the Galaxy S7, Xiaomi Mi5 and LG G5 - it does bring a slight performance boost, as illustrated by benchmark tests. Numbers aside, the user experience is - on the whole - a smooth one; there are the traditional moments of lag when Android has too many plates in the air at once, but these are few and far between. By and large, the Pixel really flies regardless of what task you choose to push in its general direction. Google's own phones are always the first to get new Android updates, and the Pixel is of course no exception. Android Nougat made its debut on the device and - at the time of writing - has been updated to version 7.1.1. Nougat marks a quite notable evolution of Google's mobile OS, with visual and UI changes felt pretty much everywhere you look. Swiping from left to right reveals your Google landing screen, previously known as Google Now. This is very similar to what has gone before, but Google's Personal Assistant has been given a real boost. Holding down the home button opens the assistant, which is now capable of engaging in human-like conversation and delivering replies that relate to previous questions. Ask about the weather, and the assistant will reply with a witty comment like "You may want your raincoat" as well as providing on-screen detail about precipitation and temperature. You can then ask "What about this weekend?" and get weather info for that period. You can ask what movies are showing locally, where to eat and much more besides. The more you use Google Assistant, the more it learns about your everyday needs and activities, offering a more tailored approach, but if you're uneasy about Google digging into your search and web history, you might be less enamoured. Gallery: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 makes short work of 3D games, offering a smooth experience. The AMOLED display brings games to life, and support for Google's Daydream VR standard will make the Pixel even more appealing to players. The only downside is the placement of the speaker, which is too easy to cover with your hand. Buy Google Pixel from Amazon Google has made some welcome cosmetic changes to Android which make the whole UI feel more fresh and alive. The app drawer icon is gone, and instead you have to swipe up from the bottom of the display to see your installed applications. The Google search bar - a common feature on Android phones from the start - has now been replaced by a pop-out widget in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, our favourite change relates to wallpapers, as superficial as that may sound; Google has introduced "Live Earth" images which leverage data from Google Earth and present a full 3D image for your phone's screen. When you unlock the device this image slowly shifts, and swiping between home screen changes perspective. The shot of a high-rise building in Tokyo's Shinjuku district is especially striking, as is the Pantheon in Rome. Hopefully Google will add more of these special wallpapers in the future. Elsewhere, there are now long-press pop-up menus on app icons which allow you to quickly jump to a task without having to actually open the app - a feature borrowed from the iPhone which uses 3D Touch to achieve the same functionality. Gaming on the Pixel is as you'd expect; smooth and enjoyable. We put the phone through the usual tests, trying a mixture of complex 3D titles such as Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8: Airborne and Warhammer 40K: Freeblade, and the handset passed with flying colours. The impact of such graphically-rich offerings is notably enhanced by that punchy AMOLED screen; colours really pop and the deep contrast is striking. The only downside with gaming on this handset is the positioning of the mono speaker; it's too easy to accidentally cover it with your hand, muffling the audio. It's worth noting that the Pixel is the first phone to come with support for Google's new Virtual Reality standard, Daydream. Sadly we're weren't able to test this aspect as we don't have access to a headset, but adopting Samsung's Gear VR approach - where the cost of entry is subsidised by using the phone as the "guts" of the headset - is a clever idea on Google's part, and as more Android handset makers include Daydream support we can expect to see interest in mobile VR skyrocket. When it comes to mobile photography, Google's Nexus range didn't have the best reputation. Google would come out with the same platitudes regarding how the camera on this year's Nexus was "the best ever", but more often than not the results were disappointing; software that was lacking in features and shot speed that was left in the dust by Apple and Samsung's efforts. It would seem that these issues may have been the fault of the disconnect that existed between Google and the companies creating the Nexus devices, as the Pixel is packing some of best photographic talents yet seen on an Android device - and no, those aren't Google's words, but ours. Fast to snap and boasting excellent low-light performance, the camera on the Pixel is effortlessly the best to come on a Google-made flagship handset. While the camera app can sometimes (but not often) take a second or so to boot up, focus time is on par with that of the iPhone 7 and image quality is impeccable. Low-light shooting is also impressive, with the Pixel able to pull off a decent image even in a room with very few sources of illumination. The main rear-facing camera has a 12.3 megapixel resolution, f2.0 aperture and both phase detection and laser auto focus. Another welcome feature is Google's deployment of HDR; it's enabled by default but doesn't slow down your image capture; instead, HDR is applied in the background, allowing you to keep taking shots with having to wait. HDR+ is also included, but using this does incur a slight wait. Video capture tops out at 4K, 30fps, and quality is excellent. All in all, this is comfortably the best camera to ever ship on a phone bearing Google's name, and is certainly comparable to the sensors seen in the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7. How Football Manager 2017 is making football fans panic about Brexit It's coming home, it's coming. On to the less exciting stuff, the Pixel's 2770 mAh battery offers decent but hardly stunning stamina. Getting through an entire day was never an issue during our review period, but the next morning a full charge was definitely required. Thanks to the fact that the Pixel has a true USB Type-C connection rather than old-school USB to USB Type-C lead - something many other manufacturers ship with their phones - charging time is super-swift. Storage options are 32GB and 128GB, with the latter coming at a notable premium. There's no means of expanding storage - something which is present on the Galaxy S line of phones - so you may find the 32GB model to be a little restrictive in terms of space, even if you make use of Google's many cloud-based storage options such as Google Photos, Google Music and Google Drive. Finally, the Pixel's call quality is superb, even when speaking in busy environments with a lot of background noise. Google Pixel: the Digital Foundry verdict Google's previous Nexus devices were excellent, and combined impressive tech with a pure Android experience, making them the phones of choice for seriously dedicated fans of the OS. However, they were rarely perfect in every way, with aspects like camera performance and build quality proving to be somewhat disappointing. With the Pixel, Google has made a bold attempt to not only give its flagship parity with premium rivals, but also have full control over every aspect of the software to hardware. The result is comfortably the most accomplished mobile phone to ever carry the Google logo; HTC - which handles manufacturing - has done an excellent job here but it's clear that Google's hand was guiding the project from inception to final production. Lack of waterproofing and expandable storage are the only genuine causes for complaint; in every other respect, this is perhaps the best Android phone ever produced, although we're sure that title will be passed on fairly quickly as Google's hardware partners release their 2017 flagships. Even so, they have a solid template to imitate in the Pixel. Google Pixel review unit kindly provided by Mobile Fun. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

With the iOS 8.4 release later this year we could see the first real strike back from Apple as the company slowly responds to the streaming dominance of Spotify. Advertisement Two years ago Apple tried to edge in with iTunes Radio, but it is not a true Spotify replacement. After that learning lesson Apple purchased Beats and we are learning more about the plans to deliver a new streaming music service inside an upcoming iOS 8 update, likely before the iOS 9 release. Read: Spotify Tips & Tricks iTunes Radio already offers one big advantage over Spotify and any other music streaming service. Users can use Siri to start listening to a station, but there is no way to use Siri to control Spotify because Apple does not open access to other developers. The odds are good that as an Apple branded Beats app, it could come with Siri support. The iOS 8.4 release could bring a new Beats inspired iTunes streaming service to take on Spotify. Last month rumors surfaced about the iOS 8.4 release, telling users that the focus is on delivering a Beats Music like streaming service to users to allow Apple to better compete with Spotify. Advertisement We expect to see the iOS 8.4 release in the coming months ahead of iOS 9. Apple is well into testing the iOS 8.3 update, including public users testing the service. Catch up with the latest information about the iOS 8.4 release and the new Beats Music like service that we should see soon. Coming with an iOS 8.4 Release In early February 9to5Mac outed an iOS 8.4 update on the roadmap and detailed the possibility that it will include the new Beats Music streaming service as part of an integrated music experience that could take on Spotify’s dominance. It’s important to note that this report only claims Apple is considering the launch of a new streaming service based on Beats as part of the iOS 8.4 update. It is possible that Apple will need to delay the launch into a bigger iOS 9 release depending on how fast the service come together and negotiations with music labels. We expect to see an iOS 8.3 release date in the near future, but there isn’t a good timeline for the iOS 8.4 release date yet. The next major event from Apple is expected in June to announce iOS 9. It is possible that Apple will host an event before this to show off the new Beats Music or iTunes streaming service, or that the company will talk about it at WWDC 2015 in June and announce the iOS 8.4 release at this event. Advertisement If this new service is not part of iOS 8.4 it may not arrive until Apple delivers the iOS 9 release this fall. Beats is “Spotify with Jimmy juice” “Spotify with Jimmy juice.” A new report in The New York Times explains a new approach to Apple’s music streaming service that will go head to head with Spotify. Instead of putting the new service in the hands of engineers, the NY Times reports that Apple is placing a musician as the head of the project. That doesn’t mean Trent Reznor is coding the new service, but musicians will have an important role in the creation of the new Beats Music or iTunes streaming service. The NY Times calls this a, “collaborative effort between Mr. Reznor and other Apple and Beats employees, including Jimmy Iovine.” Apple will reportedly count on Jimmy Iovine to lead the charge. s_bukley / Shutterstock.com The report says that the Beats Music name may disappear as part of the overhaul that will include curated playlists and an Apple-like minimal design. “One music executive involved in the negotiations described this part of the new iTunes as “Spotify with Jimmy juice.”, reports the NY Times, referring to the Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine. No Free Music from Apple iTunes Radio offers a free music streaming option with ads, and an ad-free experience with iTunes Match, but you can count on a paid subscription for this new service. In the latest report we learn that Apple tried to negotiate a lower monthly rate to undercut Spotify’s $9.99 a month price, but without the same dominance in music Apple could not land this price. The NY Times report also states there will be no free option, which is music to the ears of music executives. Exclusives Will Draw You to Apple’s Streaming Service How will Apple convince users to switch from Spotify to iTunes and the new Beats based service? The answer is simply exclusive albums. Apple plans on exclusives like the Beyoncé album to draw fans. A.RICARDO / Shutterstock.com In this latest report from the NY Times we learn that, “Mr. Iovine, who reports to Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of software and Internet services, has been leading aggressive talks to secure prominent album releases that will be exclusive to Apple.” Read: How to Listen to Taylor Swift on Spotify Apple scored success with the self-titled Beyoncé Album in 2013, but the exclusive only lasted a week before physical copies arrived and now you can stream these songs on Spotify as part of Beyoncé Platinum on Spotify, though it took almost a year to arrive.  iTunes vs Beats vs Spotify When this new service arrives it will likely come with a revamped iTunes Radio that aims to help users discover new music or listen to the hits from their region, like a radio station that isn’t owned by Clear Channel. The new Apple Streaming Service may not ship with the Beats Music name, which makes sense if Apple plans to pull it into the main iTunes experience. Read: Spotify Review Although all of this could change it looks like iTunes Radio could still compete with the free version of Spotify and the new Beats Music replacement will compete with Spotify with a full featured streaming service that lets users choose the albums and songs they want to hear. Spotify now offers free and paid options and a family plan that includes a discount. If Apple includes the new streaming service in iOS 8 Family Sharing users could get a huge deal, but it would be surprising if Apple was able to include streaming for everyone in your house with one $10 subscription. 9 Features We Want from the iOS 9 Release Siri That Works With Other Apps   1 / 9 Siri can open other apps, but it cannot control them in the ways we want. In ISO 9 we want Siri to move beyond opening Spotify or Nest and into allowing developers to connect to Siri for controls. Read: 41 Siri Tips & Tricks Ideally iOS 9 could allow users to say, "Hey Siri, play Daft Punk on Spotify," and users could listen to the music they want in the app that they want. Apple may choose to keep Siri controls to iTunes, iTunes Radio and maybe Beats, but that doesn't mean we'll like it. The options are endless, but we would definitely use Siri to turn on Hue Lights, control the Nest thermostat and many other apps if Apple opened up support.   1 / 9 2 Responses 08/28/2015 Joserblack Reply ggh my buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63 every hour on the laptop .

But there's a snag, the blasted cable is too short! Opening a new phone box to find a charger cable that is slightly shorter than a bootlace sweet is common these days - but why? Firstly, you are not alone! Even a quick search online will bring up consumers reeling with frustration against the stubby cable. But, of course, every part of every product created by companies like Apple and Samsung will have had countless hours spent on their design. So the length of the cable is unlikely to be a design flaw. Are the cables really that short? Firstly we need to establish if the iPhone cable is actually short. So how long is it? The standard cable you receive in your sleek minimalist white box is one metre long. Despite being advised not to, many of us will use our smart phones in bed. A standard Ikea bed and mattress is about 70cm high. If you have you phone plugged into a standard plug near the floor the only way you are going to be able to read plugged in phone is to lie right on the edge of your bed. The same is true for desks Unless you are lucky enough to have sockets halfway up the wall behind your desk you are probably charging your phone on the floor. Not the end of the world - but frustrating. As one user says: "I cannot sit at my desk which is 10ft from the wall and sit in my chair and hold the phone to my ear without sliding my chair closer to the wall and leaning towards the wall." How does the iPhone compare to other phones? The Samsung Galaxy comes with a 50% longer charger as standard at 1.5 metres. Google's new phone, the Pixel, comes with two cables. The standard plug charger is the same as the iPhone but it does come with a one-metre USB-C to USB-C charger also. So why is it short? We approached Apple to ask how they had decided on the length of their cable. They seemed confused about why were asking. The company tends not to respond to enquiries about products outside official releases. However there are thousands of Apple discussion forums online, many of the threads have company staff commenting on them, that may hold the answer. Writing on the Q and A website Quora, former Apple employee Mark Steiner said: "The product design team studies everything. The accessory cables, in particular, are studied, researched, tested and produced to be at 'the ideal' length for the majority of uses "This includes from the back of an iMac, or the side of a MacBook to a spot on your desk. Or from the wall power outlet behind your bedside table to your bedside. Or from your kitchen counter power outlet to a spot on the counter. "This is all determined with the intention that you have the fewest number of 'loops' or 'tidy-ups' possible. If the design team had their way, the cable would be infinitely elastic; in fact, if they truly had their way, there wouldn't be a need for a cable, period. "There is also a degree of 'conservation of effort'. Instead of devoting a considerable amount of time and resources to producing three or four different lengths of cable, in eighteen different colors (because, invariably, somebody always wants black or pink), with all the packaging and merchandising variables to support them, you just trust that one of your partnership manufacturers will produce them for you." Software engineer Anthony Yeh suggests a longer cable would be impractical. "It is probably because they are trying to keep the design as minimal as possible, which is a theme that shows throughout their product line," he said. "For many people and many uses, the typical six-foot long charging cable used by other manufacturers is just too much. It is a pain to carry in a bag; you either have to spend time winding and unwinding it every time, or spend time untangling it. "When using it with a computer, you usually only need to get from one point on your desk to another. With a six-foot USB cable, I have to wind it up and the coil takes up a lot of area on my desk." So what should you do if you want a longer cable? To avoid stating the obvious let's assume you have considered just unplugging the phone. Your best option is to buy a longer cable. Unfortunately for you this could involve shelling out the same as most people's monthly phone contract. Apple's 2m version of the cable is £29. Obviously are alternatives out there but you must be very careful they are reputably made and the correct spec There has been a significant increase in fire service call outs due to dodgy knockoff chargers and cables. Another way round it is to use a portable charger and have your phone plugged into that. Happy charging! MORE NEWS: Firefighters called to Slade Road, Ilfracombe to tackle chimney...

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

This year will see the humble 3.5mm port removed from a lot more devices. Last year I wrote about how Apple's decision to drop the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 meant the beginning of the end for the humble 3.5mm port, and I gave it a decade until the port was extinct. What's interesting is that when I made that prediction many breathed a sigh of relief because ten years is a long time in tech, and that it would be years before Android hardware OEMs began taking away their beloved connector. I never said anything of the sort. Even before the iPhone 7 was released, and it wasn't yet clear whether Apple had dropped the port, I wrote the following: "... if Apple drops it for the iPhone and the iPad, other companies won't be able to resist copying the move. Oh, sure, they might hold out at first, but eventually, they will all follow suit." Well, it's already started to happen, and the snowball is gathering momentum. Not only is the headphone jack gone from the latest iPhone, but the HTC Bolt, Moto Z, and LeEco smartphones have already eradicated the jack, and rumor has it that Samsung's decided to do the same with its upcoming flagship Galaxy S8. As to why everyone will drop the headphone jack, here are the top reasons: Apple's started doing it The components cost money, and also adds to the assembly costs That hole allows dirt, dust, water, and random pocket schmoo to get into the device I predict that by the end of 2017 all of the top of the line smartphones will not have a headphone jack, and that it will pretty soon afterwards be regarded by most consumers as a sign of a "budget" device.         LATEST STORIES (3) Syrian Army Troops Pounding Terrorists' Positions with Rocket Fire, Southeast of Aleppo Iraq's Military Troops Complete Control over Eastern Mosul Iraq's 99 Days of Battle for Eastern Mosul Nukes Without Conscience: America Told Britain to Keep Trident Test Failure a Secret Iran, Russia, Turkey Agree on Devising Mechanism to Ensure Syria Ceasefire Muqtada al-Sadr: US Embassy Move Means Declaring War on Muslims EXCLUSIVE: Several ISIL Military Training Camps Destroyed in Western Anbar Province Political Activist: US Distrustful of Saudi Arabia Jordanian Parties Warn US against Plan to Move Embassy to Occupied Jerusalem Iraq: Army Wins Back More Regions in Northern Mosul Syrian Army Inches Closer to Turkish Troops near Al-Bab Analyst: Syrian Army May Enter Militant-Held Idlib without Military Operation Kadyrov Confirms Chechens Serving as Russian Military Police in Aleppo Damascus: Syrian Army Recapturing Own Territories, Not on Offensive Asqar Farhadi's "The Salesman" Nominated for 2017 Oscar Syrian Army Troops Pounding Terrorists' Positions with Rocket Fire, Southeast of Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian Army soldiers continued their operations to cut off ISIL's lines of supply from Raqqa to Aleppo, capturing several villages Southeast of Aleppo province.

According to a CNET report, in a lawsuit on Friday, Apple alleged the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. "Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate," the report added. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the CNET report added, quoting the statement. Meanwhile, Qualcomm called Apple allegations "baseless." "Apple has intentionally mischaracterised our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing programme," Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm Executive Vice President and General Counsel, said in a statement: "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [South Korean Fair Trade Commission] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg added. Apple designs the processors in iPhones and iPads but buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Earlier this week, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of maintaining a monopoly over chips for cellular phones through a "no license, no chips" policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms. That policy imposed "onerous" supply and patent-licensing terms to extract high royalties from cell phone makers and weaken competitors, the commission said. "Qualcomm recognised that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors," the FTC statement said. "Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors," it added. Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND) denote a voluntary licensing commitment that standards organisations request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Qualcomm refuted FTC's charges, saying that the lawsuit was based on "flawed legal theory." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong," the company was quoted as saying in a CNET report.

Apple is asking India for a long list of financial concessions that includes a 15-year tax exemption on imports of materials and components. Apple aims to set up their manufacturing units in India because the tech giant aims to boost India’s business scenario and at the same time sees the country as a fast growing smartphone hub. Apple wants to boost business in India as the country of 1.3 billion becomes the fastest growing smartphone market and sales flatten in the US and China. Meanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the country for the first time in May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. -Reuters Tagged Apple Qualcomm Inc Post navigation Previous Previous post: Shakib magic cleans out New Zealand middle order Tweet Related Posts Dr Mukhtar Ahmad appointed as HEC Chairman PTI expresses reservations on NA122 results Sharjeel criticises Imran Khan over indecent language Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

The 100-page complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple's fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. "Qualcomm's recent effort to cover its tracks - by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators - underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme," the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Besides cooperating with the FTC's investigation, Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting. Shares in San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. fell $1.56, or 2.4 percent, to close Friday at $62.88. Those of Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, ended up 22 cents at $120.

Hamburg, Germany, January 21, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Apple’s digital wallet solution, Apple Pay, has been in the spotlight since its initial launch in the USA in October 2014. The digital wallet profile from yStats.com dives into a comprehensive description of the solution, including its main features, coverage, adoption and usage data. The publication details the evolution of Apple Pay from a pure smartphone wallet to a robust digital payment method for in-store, online and mobile purchases. The geographical expansion of Apple Pay is also shown, covering the month-by-month growth from one to thirteen markets by the end of 2016. Among the specifics revealed about Apple Pay is its reliance on encryption and user authentication via Touch ID or pass code for secure payment transactions. Furthermore, Apple Pay’s profile from yStats.com cites varying numbers of participating banks, financial institutions and payment processors in different countries. Finally, examples of merchant adoption of the Apple Pay service are provided, including companies from retail, E-Commerce, travel, energy and restaurant segments.

According to a CNET report, in a lawsuit on Friday, Apple alleged the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. "Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate," the report added. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the CNET report added, quoting the statement. Meanwhile, Qualcomm called Apple allegations "baseless." "Apple has intentionally mischaracterised our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing programme," Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm Executive Vice President and General Counsel, said in a statement: "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [South Korean Fair Trade Commission] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg added. Apple designs the processors in iPhones and iPads but buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Earlier this week, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of maintaining a monopoly over chips for cellular phones through a "no license, no chips" policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms. That policy imposed "onerous" supply and patent-licensing terms to extract high royalties from cell phone makers and weaken competitors, the commission said. "Qualcomm recognised that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors," the FTC statement said. "Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors," it added. Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND) denote a voluntary licensing commitment that standards organisations request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Qualcomm refuted FTC's charges, saying that the lawsuit was based on "flawed legal theory." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong," the company was quoted as saying in a CNET report. --IANS na/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

"The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the CNET report added, quoting the statement. Meanwhile, Qualcomm called Apple allegations "baseless." "Apple has intentionally mischaracterised our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing programme," Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm Executive Vice President and General Counsel, said in a statement: "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [South Korean Fair Trade Commission] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg added. Apple designs the processors in iPhones and iPads but buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Earlier this week, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of maintaining a monopoly over chips for cellular phones through a "no license, no chips" policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms. That policy imposed "onerous" supply and patent-licensing terms to extract high royalties from cell phone makers and weaken competitors, the commission said. "Qualcomm recognised that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors," the FTC statement said. "Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors," it added. Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND) denote a voluntary licensing commitment that standards organisations request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Qualcomm refuted FTC's charges, saying that the lawsuit was based on "flawed legal theory." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong," the company was quoted as saying in a CNET report. --IANS na/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Apple is suing Qualcomm for $1 billion in damages from unfair patent practices.  The suit filed January 20 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California was widely reported by Reuters and other sources. In a press statement quoted in a Forbes article, Apple said, “after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts.” Companies hate to go to court. It’s expensive and business details they would prefer to remain confidential get revealed to the public. But as growth slows, the pressure for profits rises so it was perhaps just a matter of time before royalties became a battleground. Apple claims Qualcomm’s rates were exorbitant. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,” it said in the statement Forbes quoted. It claims Qualcomm withheld “nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them.” The Reuters story refers to those “payments” as “rebates,” a word that echoes money Microsoft allegedly paid to OEMs in the heyday of the PC. Those payments were said to be considerations for marketing programs promoting its Windows operating system. The Qualcomm “retaliation” Apple alleges presumably points to the recent decision by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) to fine Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won (nearly US$1 billion), after a two-year investigation. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple," the Reuters story says, quoting Apple’s lawsuit. Forbes added that the lawsuit Apple says “even upgrading something like the iPhone's memory -- from 128GB to 256GB -- would result in Qualcomm collecting a larger royalty.” The Apple suit is the latest of several to land on Qualcomm’s doorstep. Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against Qualcomm, seeking a court order against what it alleges are unfair licensing practices for its cellular baseband patents. The complaint alleges among other things the company “precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016.” The FTC’s action came less than a month after the KFTC fined Qualcomm, charging unfair patent licensing practices. The KTFC and FTC levied similar charges of failing to license standards-essential patents to competitors and forcing customers to agree to unfair terms. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million as part of a settlement over patent disputes in China. The deal also cut royalty rates Qualcomm was charging in China. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm, a Reuters report said. Qualcomm has vigorously defended its positions in each of these cases. In its most recent response it said, “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” The court processes will take years and may never reach final conclusions about who was right or wrong. One thing clear to me is the industry no longer has the stomach for big royalty payments. Gartner projects smartphones will grow 4.8% this year, their slimmest expansion to date. Most of the growth is in price sensitive mid- and low-end models, it said. An IHS forecast says local OEMs are on a tear in China, one of the world’s largest and fastest growing markets, where Apple’s market share was projected to decline about 5% in 2016 (see chart below). Market watcher IHS forecasted Apple's share of the China smartphone market fell 5% in 2016. (Image: IHS) I’m not faulting Apple or trying to litigate the case in the press. I expect even as these cases play out much of what really happened will remain secret. A review of the FTC’s complaint shows several redacted passages. My point is that in good times Apple would not have brought this suit. But these are not good times, they are the start of very tough times that call for tough decisions. The smartphone has become one of the single largest drivers of the semiconductor industry. But its days in that role are numbered. Gartner’s forecasts the smartphones’ share of the semiconductor pie will peak this year at 25.4% and their overall amount of chip revenue will max out at $97.7 billion in 2018. This is a warning sign the party is nearly over for everyone in the supply chain invested in the mobile market. The smartphone is a wonder, and it has given birth to a wealth of technologies that are among other things paving a road to the Internet of Things. Apple, Qualcomm and the other companies who helped create this segment deserve their due—and they have gotten much of it from a frothy market in the past few years. Now they are fighting over the last few luscious scraps. It’s a fascinating and somewhat ugly battle. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: FTC Slaps Qualcomm with Suit iPhone 7 Sports Intel, TSMC Korea Fines Qcomm Nearly $1B IBM Leads as U.S. Patents Rebound Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Pot.

According to a CNET report, in a lawsuit on Friday, Apple alleged the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. "Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate," the report added. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the CNET report added, quoting the statement.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

After four years with Apple, the Limerick native went on to spearhead some of the world's leading manufacturing and industrial goods companies in Ireland, Britain and US - including Tellabs, Stryker, Lufthansa Tecknik and Precision Castparts Corp (PCC) in the United States. The latter had a turnover of almost $10bn annually, 3,000 staff and 10 thriving factories across the globe. Although Mike, his wife Gill, and their young family were settled in Philadelphia, when an opportunity to take the reins at Bord na Móna (BnM) arose in 2015, the Quinns knew it was time to go home. Sitting down with the Farming Independent at BnM headquarters in Newbridge, Co Kildare, the CEO says he has no regrets and is fully committed to making the iconic, semi-state company bigger and better than ever. Less than a year into his tenure, BnM announced plans to cease harvesting energy peat and to turn the ship towards new sustainable businesses by 2030. These include: renewable energy development, domestic fuels, biomass development, resource recovery, horticulture, eco-tourism, and community amenities. Although the transition has faced environmental challenges recently, Mr Quinn is confident biomass fuel will completely replace peat supplied to BnM power plant at Edenderry, and also the two ESB peat-using plants, at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge, within that time-line. "Year one was getting used to the company, last year was nailing down solid actions and the next three years are about implementing and delivering our plan," said Mr Quinn, who studied in Dublin City University, Cranfield University in Britain and at the University of Michigan. Also Read ‘The longer you keep it bottled up the worse it’s going to get’  Irish rugby star Jack McGrath said dealing with his brother’s suicide was incredibly tough. Sponsored by He is acutely aware of the importance of BnM in heartland communities. "Peat harvesting has been going on for 80 years. We've a duty of care to the midlands. I visit all the sites regularly. There are 2,400 employees but when you consider the families, towns and villages that rely on the plants, that increases fourfold. We won't see Google, Facebook or Silicon docks down in the midlands so there is a huge dependency on BnM going forward," he said. Although last year, Edenderry co-fired almost 400,000 tonnes of biomass, Mr Quinn says it will take up to five years for a domestic biomass supply chain to develop. He addressed misconceptions of biomass power. "We don't cut down trees to burn in the plants, that's a complete misconception and very frustrating. We use sawmill residues, by-products of wood production, saw dust, bark that has been stripped off the tree, that's what we burn," he said. While domestic supply grows, BnM plan to import wood pellets - made of brash and the tops of trees - from the south east of the US. "Wood pellets are the second lowest carbon emitter of fuels across the globe used in power generation. The plan is to import from the US until we have our own supplies. Pellets today are trading at between €110-130 a tonne and we'll be very competitive with that," he said. Mr Quinn - who revealed that he also spent time earning a crust as a silage contractor -admitted that the company is also looking at Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Africa for wood chip. But he insisted that BnM is committed to importing one less tonne for every tonne it can get domestically. "We're not in the import game long-term. Our long-term goal is to be self-sufficient from the island of Ireland. So be it in private forestry, energy crops like willow, fast growing trees like eucalyptus - that is where we are going with the project," he said. However, on BnM's horticulture side, Brexit is a concern. "Irish peat is regarded as world class. We're the largest supplier in the UK for grow meal for gardens and we've taken a good hit on our profits from exchange," Mr Quinn said. He said Ireland should remain in the EU. "We'd be insane to leave. We're an export-orientated country and our place is within the EU. We're in a very good place now because we're the only English speaking country left. We will be a beachhead for investment," said Mr Quinn, who also believes the US will boom under President Donald Trump. "Rightly or wrongly, I think it's a good time for the US and I think Irish companies may benefit from that," he said, adding that the future was bright for BnM. "We've got such a strategic asset in our 200,000ac land-bank. Ourselves and Coillte are the biggest landlords in the country. I'm inundated with requests to access it. This transformation will set BnM up for the next 30 years,"he said.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 per cent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm hit with US antitrust suit In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Nokia sues Apple for infringing patents On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 per cent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

The 100-page complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple’s fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. “Qualcomm’s recent effort to cover its tracks — by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators — underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme,” the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 Billion over royalties, Qualcomm says Apple’s claims are baseless Apple has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm saying that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. This comes days after Qualcomm was sued by US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for anti-competitive practices relating to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,” said Apple In its lawsuit, Apple said: Qualcomm broke its promise and has breached its FRAND commitments. Qualcomm illegally double-dips by selling chipsets that allow mobile telephones to connect to cellular networks and then separately licensing (but never to competitors) the purportedly necessary intellectual property. By tying together the markets for chipsets and licenses to technology in cellular standards, Qualcomm illegally enhances and strengthens its monopoly in each market and eliminates competition. Then, Qualcomm leverages its market power to extract exorbitant royalties, later agreeing to reduce those somewhat only in exchange for additional anticompetitive advantages and restrictions on challenging Qualcomm’s power, further solidifying its stranglehold on the industry. All of this has been forced on Apple because the iPhone and the iPad have required Qualcomm chips. In a statement Apple said: Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts. Qualcomm has denied this saying that Apple’s claims are baseless. In response to Apple’s claims, Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated, said: While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information.

Apple filed a lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices, and of withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with antitrust authorities in South Korea. Qualcomm has been under fire around the world by regulators for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers. Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, California, where Qualcomm is based. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after sales declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” Antitrust Investigations In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision. Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 17 filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phonemakers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. The chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not. One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells -- measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Apple Inc filed a USD1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the US government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's USD23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some USD1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at USD62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm USD854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a USD975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at USD36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

A couple of days ago the FTC filed a lawsuit against the chip maker alleging that it has engaged in unfair patent licensing practices, and today it's Apple's turn to sue Qualcomm. Apple's lawsuit has to do with what it claims are excessive royalties charged by Qualcomm for use of basic cellular standards that it contributed to developing in the past. Furthermore, Apple says that once it began cooperating with South Korean authorities in their antitrust investigation of Qualcomm, the chip maker withheld $1 billion in retaliation. Here's Apple's full statement on the matter: For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts. Apple wants roughly $1 billion from Qualcomm as compensation for this behavior. Qualcomm hasn't yet commented on Apple's allegations and lawsuit.

The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits." Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple's phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

The 100-page complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple's fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. "Qualcomm's recent effort to cover its tracks by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme," the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Besides cooperating with the FTC's investigation, Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting. Shares in San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc.

For the most part they still are, although in recent years their announcements no longer come as a surprise a specs, details, and sometimes even photos of products are leaked ahead of their official announcement. However those leaks might not come quite as easy in the future. According to a report from Nikkei, they have heard from their sources that Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn will reportedly open a new facility in China. This new facility is said to help with Apple’s building of prototypes, and it seems that it is also located near Apple’s upcoming R&D center in Shenzhen, China. What this means is that with the proximity between Apple and Foxconn, there might be less hands involved with the handling of Apple’s products, which in theory should help reduce the chances of leaks in the future. Of course whether or not this happens remains to be seen, but we guess if it helps, why not? When asked to confirm the report, Apple pointed Nikkei towards Foxconn who unsurprisingly declined to comment. Interestingly enough Apple’s R&D center was meant to help them work closer with their partners in China, although a recent report quoted US President Donald Trump as saying that apparently Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had “eyes open” to move iPhone production to the US.

"The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras ... the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the California-based giant said in a statement.  "Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," the statement added.  The lawsuit filed in a federal court in comes three days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of antitrust violations.  "Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors," the FTC said Tuesday in a statement.  The chip maker was also fined 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) in December by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission for alleged antitrust violations.  The South Korean agency argued Qualcomm forced mobile phone companies into unfair licensing deals by signing them into patent license contracts, refused to supply chips to firms that did not accept terms and limited competitors’ access to certain technologies.  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision in South Korean High Court. The dominant San Diego-based company manufactures chips that enables cell phones to connect to cellular networks that use CDMA technology.  The firm also receives licensing fees for cell phones that use the technology, including Verizon, the U.S.'s biggest cellular network.  Related apple Legal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.

By India Ashok January 21, 2017 04:38 GMT Apple has also accused Qualcomm of blocking Apple from choosing to switch to another chip supplierReuters Apple has reportedly filed a $1bn (£807m, €934m) lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm over licensing practices. Apple's lawsuit follows a similar suit filed against the firm by the US Trade Commission, which alleged the firm of employing anti-competitive tactics. Apple has reportedly alleged that Qualcomm demanded unfair terms for its technology, escalating the two firm's already contentious and tenuous relationship. Apple filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that Qualcomm overcharged for chips and sought "onerous, unreasonable and costly" terms for patents. Apple has also accused Qualcomm of blocking Apple from choosing to switch to another chip supplier, the Wall Street Journal reported. Apple also alleged that Qualcomm refused to pay around $1bn in promised rebates because Apple cooperated with South Korea's anti-trust regulators over their probe into Qualcomm's licensing practices. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit, Reuters reported. Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg deemed Apple's allegations "baseless". "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits." In its lawsuit, Apple also claimed that Qualcomm made it obligatory for Apple to exclusively use its chips in iPhones from 2011 to 2016. This claim is also contained in the FTC's complaint against Qualcomm. Apple also claimed that Qualcomm began withholding its rebates, informing Apple that it had forfeited nearly $1bn in rebates by cooperating with the Korea Trade Commission. Apple used Qualcomm's chips until its latest iPhone 7 model in September 2016. Moor Insights & Strategy founder Patrick Moorhead told IBTimes UK, "This is a very serious matter for Qualcomm. This lawsuit has no firm black and whites, full of shades of gray. On one hand we have Qualcomm, who everyone would agree invested the most and is the first to market with 3G, 4G and now 5G technologies. "On the other we have Apple who thinks they are being charged too much, charged the wrong way as a per cent of the phone price, and that Qualcomm forces contract terms that's limits their ability to use competitive product. Right or wrong, with all this global pressure, I would expect that Qualcomm's global licensing prices would decline. With Qualcomm's impending NXP acquisition, all this could be a moot point, as Qualcomm's business becomes more diversified."

The 100-page complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple’s fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations.

Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. “Qualcomm’s recent effort to cover its tracks — by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators — underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme,” the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Besides cooperating with the FTC’s investigation, Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting. Shares in San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. fell $1.56, or 2.4 percent, to close Friday at $62.88. Those of Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, ended up 22 cents at $120.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter By Diane Bartz and Stephen Nellis Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

These charges echo those filed days earlier by US antitrust regulators. Apple said in the court filing that it has been overcharged 'billions of dollars' by its chip-making partner's 'illegal scheme.' The company also claimed Qualcomm owes it a billion dollars, but is refusing to pay due to Apple cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators looking into the company. In its court filing, Apple said it has been overcharged 'billions of dollars' by Qualcomm's 'illegal scheme' 'For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,' Apple said in an email statement. 'To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them.' Qualcomm rejected Apple's claims, saying the iPhone maker 'intentionally mischaracterized' agreements as well as the value of the company's technology.

'We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court.' The suit claims Qualcomm built a business model that charges raised royalty fees every time Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices. The suit claims Qualcomm built a business model that charges raised royalty fees when Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices The charges say that Qualacomm believes it has the rights to charge these raised royalties by claiming legacy technology. 'Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,' Apple said.  Apple noted that Qualcomm's business practices have come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in many countries. The company has asked for a jury trial, and for Qualcomm to the company what it owes plus giving up excessive royalties. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as 'significantly flawed,' arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong The Apple suit came three days after the US Federal Trade Commission filed in federal court claiming Qualcomm abused its market power in as part of its 'unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors.' Baseband processors are are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as 'significantly flawed,' arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. South Korea's anti-trust watchdog last month slapped Qualcomm with a record fine exceeding $850 million for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chip-sets used in mobile phones.  Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. The company knows of the antitrust tide rising against Qualcomm and would like to help provide room for rival chip-makers to flourish, perhaps letting Intel improve its position, according to analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. 'I think Apple is not comfortable in feeling that they have only one source and are taking this opportunity to go after Qualcomm,' Moorhead said, referring to the mobile device modems. 'Qualcomm is being looked at on every continent on the planet; this is probably, strategically, the right time for Apple to do this.' While the legal case alleges exclusionary contracts and the idea of being overcharged for licensing, it may well be powered by Apple wanting to ramp up competition to Qualcomm so it can negotiate better deals, the analyst said. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices.

"The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras ... the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the California-based giant said in a statement. "Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," the statement added. The lawsuit filed in a federal court in comes three days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of antitrust violations. "Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors," the FTC said Tuesday in a statement. The chip maker was also fined 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) in December by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission for alleged antitrust violations. The South Korean agency argued Qualcomm forced mobile phone companies into unfair licensing deals by signing them into patent license contracts, refused to supply chips to firms that did not accept terms and limited competitors’ access to certain technologies. Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision in South Korean High Court. The dominant San Diego-based company manufactures chips that enables cell phones to connect to cellular networks that use CDMA technology. The firm also receives licensing fees for cell phones that use the technology, including Verizon, the U.S.'s biggest cellular network.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter By Diane Bartz and Stephen Nellis Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

Today, Apple is now suing the company for $1 billion. Even if you are only mildly interested in smartphones or other mobile devices, chances are you've heard the name Qualcomm before. Its technology can be found in a variety of different products on the market today and it also holds many patents for various cellular technologies. So it comes as no surprise that brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, and more rely on Qualcomm a great deal not only for its chips but also licensing deals. As mentioned previously, the FTC found that Qualcomm had been conducting some odd business, granting special rebates to companies like Apple in return for exclusively using its technology in its products. The problem stems from Qualcomm attempting to strong arm those same companies and penalizing them if they chose to work with other companies by not issuing the aforementioned rebates. This is the official statement that was provided by Apple to the media: For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts. Qualcomm will undoubtedly protect itself to the best of its ability, but this will more than likely become a very curious case that will unfold during the course of the year.

Apple filed a lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices, and of withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with antitrust authorities in South Korea. Qualcomm has been under fire around the world by regulators for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers. Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, California, where Qualcomm is based. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after sales declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” Antitrust Investigations In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision. Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 17 filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phonemakers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. The chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not. One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells -- measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars.

Could our wearables, in the form of an Apple Watch, someday provide a complete analysis of our blood? Predict a cold? Detect and diagnose a disease or illness? All that may not be far off. The blood analysis laboratory of the future. One of the features of modern tech is that projects that start off at a basic level and succeed almost always advance in ways that seem predictable and inevitable. This week, I want to focus on the practical, realtime benefits of a medical wearable that’s several generations beyond the current Apple Watch. Here’s a good starting point via Jonny Evans. “Your Apple Watch is Going to Become Your Personal Physician.” Author Evans makes some great points, but I want to elaborate myself. AI + Miniaturization = Future I have noted recently that CBC blood tests that used to require sending blood to a distant lab with big machines can now be done in a doctor’s office on a machine the size of a large bread box in just a few minutes. How long until your Apple Watch is able to conduct a complete, non-invasive, blood analysis? I mention this because I’ve read about a technique that allows for the measurement of blood sugar in a person’s sweat. If that can be done, there may be ways in the future, not yet envisioned, to get even more detailed information about the blood non-invasively. And, therefore, create a very thorough profile of a person’s health. Early on, some of this technology may start off as larger equipment in the home. That equipment transmits information about blood measurements to our iPhone for analysis and integration into other health data. But, I think, eventually, the “blood lab” will move into the wearable itself. Taking this a step further,  Siri or an IBM/Watson-like AI analysis of all that data could lead to the elimination of general practice physicians. Only when we need surgery would we have to visit a specialist. And that specialist will be a very precise, very competent AI robot. Your Apple Watch tells you your pulse today, but a lot more is coming. “If we can dream it, we can do it.” (Walt Disney.) Next page: The news debris for the week of January 16th.

That would be the sort of thing that would get me to get an AppleWatch. You mentioned the CBC Blood Test. Sorry but I immediately wondered why the Canadian Broadcasting Company needed blood tests. Yes that iTunes thing would be bloody annoying. However I just can’t believe Apple would ship it like that. Even THEY have to know that sometimes people are offline. This had to be a beta glitch that won’t appear in the final product. January 20, 2017 at 6:43 EST PM Lee Dronick January 20, 2017 Yeah, that iTunes thing would be a PR disaster. January 20, 2017 at 8:42 EST PM MacFrogger January 21, 2017 The fact that your perspiration has the same glucose concentration as your serum has been known for a long time, and the idea of developing a watch that monitors glucose concentrations non-invasively based on this was first pursued by a start-up co (Cygnus) in Redwood City CA many years ago. It was specifically targeted towards diabetics for obvious reasons – who wants to prick themselves with a lance to get enough blood to do a glucose test? I know all this because a good friend worked there – they even successfully launched a product called the Glucowatch. It has since been discontinued for reasons that I don’t know; you can read about it here: http://www.mendosa.com/glucowatch.htm Of course that’s all the Glucowatch did – with new tech and miniaturization, I’m sure it could be done more effectively and with a much smaller footprint. The Glucowatch did require consumables (enzymes)… January 21, 2017 at 9:15 EST AM MacFrogger January 21, 2017 And of course measuring the oxygen level of your blood is easy – when the hemoglobin in your red blood cells has oxygen bound to it, it is distinguishable spectroscopically from hemoglobin that does not have oxygen bound to it. There are already commercial devices out there that exclusively perform this function, and integrating this tech into a watch should be relatively easy. January 21, 2017 at 9:20 EST AM Mike Weasner January 21, 2017 Regarding the iTunes fiasco, I see two scenarios for this to have happened. A similar problem has occurred with the new (improperly named) iOS TV app from Apple (which replaced the Video app). 1. Apple believes that users have purchased ALL their audio and video content FROM Apple. So, in order to verify that the audio or video you want to play is legally yours, Apple has to check that you have purchased it (from Apple). Of course, that requires an Internet connection. (The iOS TV app actually has the reverse problem. You have to disable Wi-Fi and Cell networking to view your non-Apple purchased videos, unless you have changed the “media type” of the videos in iTunes.) Of course, Apple is wrong in this belief. I get most of my audio content from archive.org. That audio (old time radio shows like “X Minus One”, “The Lone Ranger”, “Jack Benny”, etc) is in the public domain. 2. Apple software quality assurance is failing to perform its job. I suspect that #2 is the reason for this most recent iTunes mess. It is also probably the reason behind the iOS TV app mess. As more evidence of the failure of software quality assurance I offer the recent iOS Garageband update. Version 2.2 was released on 19 January and 2.2.1 on 20 January. That is just sloppy. Apple’s software quality has deteriorated in recent years and Apple should be embarrassed. The hardware quality of Apple products remains generally high (with the exception of the Time Capsule, which Apple has now killed), but that quality is the responsibility of many companies, not just Apple. Apple alone is responsible for the quality of its software. January 21, 2017 at 10:02 EST AM RonMacGuy January 22, 2017 Why does it have to be non-invasive? I’d be OK with a sensor or two under my skin or, perhaps, even deeper, that my Watch can connect with (securely, of course) that can detect medical issues or provide data that is more accurate and reliable than hoping I sweat enough for my Watch to pick up. Well, maybe… until Google hacks it from a passing android phone and starts to send me emails about dialysis equipment that I may need down the road… 🙂 January 22, 2017 at 8:23 EST AM wab95 January 22, 2017 John: Of the themes you’ve chosen for this week’s PD, I find two most intriguing, namely the Apple Watch as a medical device (shockingly), specifically a bio-med lab, and second the interplay between robotics and AI, specifically the capacity of a robot to refuse a human command. You, and other writers at TMO like Bryan Chaffin and Jeff Gamet have, on several occasions, addressed the topic of the Apple Watch and health, specifically the role of sensors to monitor specific health indicators, and several comments have followed, including from yours truly, outlining both specific technical issues and longterm, high level vision pieces of where this will lead. I don’t intend to restate those here. Rather, I’d like to address the issue raised in the Matthias Scheutz piece about robots saying ‘No’ to a human command and expand that to the issue of technologies, like the Apple Watch and robotics writ large that can have a direct effect on human safety and address the role and imperative of manufacturers of those technologies to also say ‘No’ at the appropriate time. A core concept in the Matthias Scheutz piece is the question of context. Merely giving a robot a command such as ‘throw the ball through the window’ requires context, such as whether or not the window is open or closed, or whether there would be broader safety concerns, like traffic outside the window that the ball could negatively affect; context that a human would use, before deciding whether or not it is ethical or safe to obey the order. This is not easy to programme and raises an oddly related issue, namely that of the oft-quoted, ‘With great power comes great responsibility’, not simply for the device but more importantly for the creator and/or manufacturer of the device. Simply because something can be built, is it safe, ethical or even moral to build it today? The context here is not the technology, which might already exist, but the safety of the human user and that of society more broadly. Before we build more capable robots en masse, like self driving cars, or additional sensors in our wearables, like those that can monitor health parameters that people will rely on to serve and to protect them, that decision must guided by the protection and safety of the human first. An example or two might be illustrative. Imagine a self driving robotic car that could be remotely hacked, started and told to drive through the garage into your living room, use its forward camera and infrared sensors (newly installed for enhanced HUD night driving) to locate anything with a heat signature, identify a specific individual and run them over. Far-fetched? I think not. Remote take over of automobiles has already been demonstrated and security patches post production have had to be installed at a cost. Security systems will need to be hardened and multiple redundant safety subroutines in-built before robotic cars will be a safe technology for mass rollout. How about new sensors in the Apple Watch, like one that can monitor blood sugar, as an example? All sensors have a calibrated uncertainty, characterised by what we call ‘confidence intervals’, that is, a range within which the true value resides. Due to the technical limitations of that sensor, the range will be greater at the extremes, meaning that the value displayed to the human could be markedly different than ‘the truth’. No matter how often Apple, or any manufacturer, might warn people that this is not meant to be a ‘medical device’, should that range be too great to qualify as a medical device, people will still use it as such, because just like the camera in your iPhone vs a DSLR camera, the best camera is the one that you have on you when you need it. Diabetic wearers, when seeing that, most often when their blood sugar is in the normal range, the Watch gives a similar reading to their dedicated medical device, will come to rely over time on their AW, and may be lulled into a false sense of security when their sugars are abnormal and their Watch is not accurately telling them just how abnormal it is due to the uncertainty and limitations of the sensor. It will happen. Ask any ER doc. Let me cite another hackneyed expression, ‘You’ve got to crawl before you walk, and walk before you run’, a citation often belied by toddler behaviour, but I digress. We now live in an age in which, as our technology becomes more capable, particularly technology that relies on AI, including one as simple as SIRI, it begs the ethical question of whether that technology should be publicly available if it lacks sufficient capacity either to be used responsibly or, in the case of AI, to make responsible decisions that will protect the human user. Not only manufacturers, but consumers will need to accept either more simplified, less capable versions of these technologies or forego those technologies altogether, until these more capable technologies can be safely deployed, and will accommodate not simply inevitable lapses in human judgement, but will be reasonably hardened against malicious intent, however defined by regulators. In short, until those technologies can reliably assume the responsibility that matches the power with which we invest them, we, the human makers and consumers, must retain the responsibility to delay their adoption until they are safe. January 22, 2017 at 5:25 EST PM ibuck January 24, 2017 Adding to wab95’s comments, imagine Samsung wanted to release a self-driving vehicle or a robot, and wanted to beat Apple (or another manufacturer) to market. Would they wait until it could “be safely deployed, and will accommodate not simply inevitable lapses in human judgement, but will be reasonably hardened against malicious intent?” Regulation must be required to prevent safety flaws. I’ll be relieved if robots and robotic cars are required to have a simple human override that disables them when necessary. January 24, 2017 at 1:20 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

SAN FRANCISCO >> Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The 100-page complaint filed today in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple’s fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. “Qualcomm’s recent effort to cover its tracks — by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators — underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme,” the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Besides cooperating with the FTC’s investigation, Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting. Shares in San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. fell $1.56, or 2.4 percent, to close Friday at $62.88. Those of Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, ended up 22 cents at $120.

Robson says the wheat crop is dormant, and while farmers would prefer snow cover to protect it from extreme cold, no actual crop damage is occurring. (MIKE HENSEN, The London Free Press) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Ontario’s farmers aren’t worried that the extended balmy streak we’ve had in the last week — which is expected to continue into next week — is going to hurt this year’s crops. At least, not yet. “The trees are dormant. They will stay dormant,” said Kelly Ciceran, general manager of the Ontario Apple Growers. That’s despite the fact temperatures may top out at a record 10 C in the London area today. In 2012, the province’s apple crop was wiped out when an early spring was followed by –11 C temperatures, which destroyed the buds in almost every orchard. “It takes a lot to wake a tree out of dormancy,” said local apple grower Phil Crunican. “The blossom is your weak link.” “Apple trees are pretty hardy,” echoed Ciceran. “Every year, there’s a risk of frost in that critical bloom time,” which doesn’t come until May. Growers who planted winter wheat are the same way. There’s no reason to feel dire right now. But they’re taking this unpredictable winter one day at a time. “Every day, you’re taking an educated guess. You’ve got to kind of watch and wait yet,” said Clarence Nywening, head of the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario. A field of snow acts as insulation for dormant winter wheat underneath, locking moisture into the ground. If melting causes pooling in a field that produces frozen standing water, that could pose a danger to the plants. And cooler temperatures kill off more insects, which saves aggravation when spring does arrive. “We tend to have freezes and thaws this time of year,” said Todd Austin, marketing manager for the Grain Farmers of Ontario. Mark Schuster, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said conditions we have seen in the last week is what we’re going to get in near term. “It looks like the warm weather is going to continue for the next week at least,” he said. “It’s actually warm right across the province.” Expect more mild conditions, with drizzle, rain and fog in the mix, he said. There are no major weather makers pushing into the region, which makes for a “stagnant pattern,” he added. “It’s so depressing looking outside.” danbrown@postmedia.com   Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » New Homes Rembrandt Homes Equipment Sales & Rentals McLean Scale Co & Ltd Real Estate Brad McClelland Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Time, September 29, 2014 By: Catherine Mayer   They're used to playing marathon shows in sold-out arenas, but on the morning of Sept. 9, Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. -- known collectively as the world-bestriding Irish band U2 -- performed a single song on a bare stage in a tired auditorium to a mere 2,300 geeks, investors and journalists. The audience at the Flint Center in Cupertino, Calif., may have seemed inconsequential, but millions watched U2 on a live feed. Or tried to -- the feed stuttered under the pressure of people logging on to discover what the tech giant Apple, the event's host, was ready to reveal. Onstage, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company's heavily anticipated smart watch, then summoned the four rock stars to unleash a brand-new creation of their own. Driving chords announced "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)," the first single from Songs Of Innocence, U2's 13th studio album, which, like the Apple Watch, was rumored but until that moment unconfirmed. The bigger surprise came as soon as the band finished playing. Within minutes, the more than half a billion subscribers to Apple's music download service iTunes began receiving Songs Of Innocence in their accounts, paid for by Apple and delivered for free. Traditionally, singles are released before albums to build demand before the record becomes available in digital and physical formats like CDs, at a price. But tradition no longer counts for much in an industry that has been every business model upended by the Internet. Once, musicians made album to make money, relying on touring to promote album sales, but these days they're just as likely to record albums to lure fans to live shows. Music, easily pirated and free to access on legitimate sites like YouTube, is often a loss leader. Apple and U2 have joined forces at a pivotal time for both. Each has something to prove, and each has something to get from the other. Apple hitched itself to one of the world's biggest bands, giving U2 the ultimate album-distribution system. But past glories can be a burden. At the Flint Center, Apple silenced skeptics with its impressive new products as the company finally emerged from the shadow of its late founder, Steve Jobs. Then it was U2's turn to prove that it can still match its creative high-water marks. The band's lovely, complex Songs Of Innocence -- 3 1/2 years in the making -- must stand against earlier triumphs such as Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree. The bandmates are now in their mid-50s, nearly four decades into their careers, but ambition burns fiercer than ever. "It sometimes feels that we are competing with ourselves a lot," admits The Edge. He worries that TIME has described the new album as "very, very good." U2 settles only for greatness. After the Apple show, the members of U2 arrived at Silicon Valley's Hotel Los Gatos for a celebratory lunch. They believe in the album, and their guests, including music stars Gwen Stefani and will.i.am, fashion models Lily Cole and Liberty Ross, Apple execs and music moguls enthusiastically affirmed that faith. But even amid the celebrations, rancorous comments were already appearing on social media platforms, trolling the album that popped up unasked in iTunes libraries and characterizing U2's Apple deal as a devil's pact that enriches the band while devaluing music by charging consumers nothing. "They are seriously running 'ads' for the new U2 album!? Are they suggesting we have a choice?" asked another rocker, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction, on Twitter. On Sept. 15, Apple --  facing complaints from customers struggling to remove the album from their iTunes libraries -- released a tool that allowed users to delete what Bono has described as "the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys." Mockery is nothing new to U2. Its front man's ceaseless campaigning on behalf of the world's poorest has earned him the nickname Saint Bono. But the singer is by no means the only evangelist in this band. All four members aim to persuade consumers to place a value on music once more, to the potential benefit, yes, of U2, but also of all musicians. Getting Apple to pay them to give away their new music to millions is just an opening salvo in a new collaboration with the tech company. Bigger hopes ride on a secret new digital format they're developing with Apple that they hope will attract reliable paying customers again, boosting the music industry -- and maybe even saving it. "For the last decade, the interweb has had its way with music," says Bono in an impromptu speech at the lunch, opening his arms wide as if greeting a stadium crowd. "Today we turned it around." Seeking Salvation The members of U2 have always been preoccupied with saving things, starting with themselves. They were in bad shape when they first convened in 1976 at Mullen's parents' house after he posted a notice at their tough Mount Temple school in Dublin seeking musicians to form a band. Together they discovered an alchemy, plus a clumsy name -- The Hype -- later exchanged for another clunker. (The band became famous before they had the chance to change their name again.) Songs Of Innocence -- the album takes its name from William Blake's Songs Of Innocence And Experience -- charts boyhood excitements like discovering the music of the Ramones and the Clash. It also mines early tribulations, which tinge even up-tempo tracks with melancholy. The inherent contradiction in U2 dispatching "its most intimate album ever" to everyone with an iTunes account gave Mullen "a little tickle," the drummer says. A wry presence, he counterpoints Bono's voluble passions, The Edge's instinctive self-effacement and Clayton's easygoing charm. The band won't say how much Apple paid for Songs Of Innocence, but a record company insider reveals that the tech giant pledge more than $100 million toward a marketing campaign. The surprise release has rekindled sales of U2's back catalog, too, with old albums re-entering the iTunes charts across the world. It's good news for the band, but money has never been what drives them. "I preferred being on the other side of the barricade," says Mullen, referring to the times when working for a living was an obligation, not an option. That ethos -- to keep searching, to keep toiling -- drives them today; the band went straight back to the studio after the Cupertino jaunt, finishing an acoustic version of Songs Of Innocence that will be released alongside the CD and bonus tracks on Oct. 13 in most of the world, a day later in the U.S. When U2 got together, Mullen had already lost his youngest sister to illness. At 15, shortly before the band formed, he had to cope with his mother's death in a car crash. Bono understood his grief. As a 14-year-old, the singer had attended his grandfather's funeral, only to watch his mother Iris collapse at the graveside. She died a few days later. He commemorates her on Songs Of Innocence with the ballad "Iris (Hold Me Close)." The trauma left Bono with a rage that he still harnesses creatively. "But I don't let it rule me." For his part, Clayton had been uprooted to Ireland from England and consigned to boarding schools before his expulsion from one such institution landed him at Mount Temple. The Edge can't easily pinpoint why he felt alienated, but he was, in his words, a "weird" loner. The band provided solace and the opportunity for reinvention: the teenage Paul Hewson became Bono; David Evans became The Edge. Religion also lifted the group, though not the type then purveyed by the Catholic Church. A track called "Sleep Like A Baby Tonight," about a pedophile priest, reflects the brutal reality of the Ireland U2 knew as boys. Mullen learned to drum as part of a traditional marching band and recalls the failure of adults to ask why one of the other child musicians, a victim of sexual abuse, had become too traumatized to speak. Clayton, widely thought to the lone atheist in U2, unpicks that idea. Though he took to the rock lifestyle enthusiastically -- so much so that he landed in rehab in the 1990s -- he says he's "probably like the rest of the band" in seeing "a core of an idea in organized religion that is appealing, but how it played itself out in suburban society didn't touch me at all." As an unhappy schoolboy, he literally prayed to be a musician. He did not, however, follow his three bandmates into a charismatic Christian sect called Shalom. Paul McGuinness, who managed the band from their early days until his 2013 retirement, had to push back when Bono, Edge and Mullen announced, under Shalom's influence, that rock life was incompatible with religion. It was 1981, the band's debut album, Boy, was riding high, and they had recently signed to make a follow-up. "I said, 'If God anything to say about our plans, there was a time he should have spoken up a few weeks ago, when we were signing the contract,'" McGuinness remembers. The faith that threatened to break U2 at its start instead now sustains the band. "It probably saves me from myself, in the end, because when you're in these environments, you have to be able to wake up in the morning and start a new day fresh and clean," says Mullen. Yet the perception of piety can be a cross for U2 to bear. Bono's campaigning through ONE, the advocacy organization he co-founded to combat poverty, and its sister organization RED, which harnesses commerce to fight AIDS, can seem at odds with the wilder spirits of rock. His sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms that cause and maintain global poverty -- and his determination to mobilize help from across the political spectrum to disarm those mechanisms -- creates jarring juxtapositions. It's hard to be hip when you're schmoozing with President George W. Bush or inviting archconservative U.S. Senator Jesse Helms to your gigs. Helms accepted, to the discomfort of The Edge, who is viscerally opposed to the brand of politics the late Helms represented. There may be complaints -- and there are -- but the rest of the band is at peace with Bono's extracurricular work, tolerating the hit to their image as part of an enduring pledge to support one another. Extended Family U2 has always stood out, melodic during the roar of postpunk. Coldplay at times could be mistaken for a U2 tribute act, but only U2 sounds exactly like U2. The Edge's ringing guitar is as instantly recognizable as Bono's emotion-drenched vocals; Clayton and Mullen form a rhythm section that is unexpected in its attack, in a good way. U2's songwriting -- The Edge says he lays down "a bunch of hooks and chords before Bono adds "the top-line melody and the lyrics" -- produces music that can quietly envelop or soar to fill huge spaces. "You want to play stadiums? You listen to U2," says will.i.am, whose own band, Black Eyed Peas, has benefited from this advice. "You study it for harmonics, the vocal placement, the freaking chord progressions, their lyrics. You study the production. You study it because studying that equals stadiums." Something else marks out U2 in a legendarily scrappy industry. After 38 years of sweaty proximity, its members still really like one another. During the recording of Songs Of Innocence, they've been sharing digs, coping with one another's eccentricities -- The Edge composing, loudly, in the middle of the night; Mullen so nocturnal they've dubbed him Dracula. It's a sitcom waiting to be filmed. They have woven family lives into their nomadic rock-star existence and to that foundation added layers of old friends who work for the band or collaborate or simply hang out. Bono calls touring -- and no band on the planet has bigger tours than U2 -- "taking a small city on the road." At other times, they merely travel with a village. In 2005 the band flew from the U.S. to the Hague to celebrate the 50th birthday of their longtime friend and collaborator, Dutch photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn. They brought with them old Dublin mates including Reggie Manuel, who first alerted Bono to Mullen's ad on the school notice board and who these days is the optician supplying Bono's trademark eyewear. (The code to get into the Flint Center ahead of the Apple launch was sunglasses.) The band calls Manual "Mad Dog." Guy Oseary, U2's manager since McGuinness' departure, has become "Guy Oh So Serious." U2's universe holds no higher honor than to be awarded a nickname, and Oseary, who also manages Madonna, appears to have stepped easily into McGuinness' shoes. He's gung ho about U2's future. "They've got a lot that they're planning on doing, and there's announcements coming up shortly," Oseary says the day after Cupertino. "There's no slowing down this train." Magic Bullet? Oseary may be right, but at this moment of maximum exposure, U2 flirts with failure, as the band often does, by aiming so high. For them it is not enough to keep making very, very good -- even great -- records and packing stadiums. They want to fix the industry that has given them so much. Every year since Apple's 2003 launch of the iTunes store, sales of physical recorded music have declined. In the U.S., Nielsen Soundscan registered drops in CD sales of from 18.2% to 19.7% each year from 2007 to 2010. The legitimate digital downloads sold by companies like Apple not only pay artists less per transaction but also encourage a culture change in which consumers buy individual tracks more often than albums. Now downloads are also losing ground, dipping 12.5% in the U.S in the first quarter of this year. Interactive streaming services such as Spotify or Apple's own Beats are expanding but generally pay pennies to artists. Meanwhile, anyone who wants to enjoy music for free can easily do so by seeking out a pirate website or visiting YouTube. An entire generation has come of age without the habit of buying and owning music. These trends have given U2 "a scary few years," says Bono, citing the band's decision in the early days of its success to agree to lower royalty rates in return for future ownership of their work, an arrangement that made sense before sales declined. The band members are rich, no question, but the U2 machine feeds many mouths besides. The band has many other ways to generate income besides selling records: merchandizing, promotional tie-ups; synchronization fee from TV, film, video games and advertising; and most of all, live performance. By the time U2's 360 Tour ended in 2011, it had sold more than 7 million tickets to become the biggest-ever tour by any artist or band measured by both attendance and box-office gross. In the Cupertino greenroom after the Apple event, Bono declares, "I don't believe in free music. Music is a sacrament." But in the case of Songs Of Experience [sic], it was a sacrament delivered from the stage of an Apple marketing event, one that will continue to be pushed with ads that celebrate Apple as much as U2. That has some critics calling the deal heresy. Not so, says The Edge. The launch was "actually incredibly subversive. It's really punk rock, it's really disruptive." Bono, with the grandeur that routinely lands him in trouble, compares the relationship between Apple and the band -- which goes back years -- to the Medicis' patronage of Michelangelo, chuckling when it's pointed out that opponents of the tech company might well accept its parallels with the ruthless Florentine dynasty. "The Music industry is at a nadir," he says, "and the charts are broken," reflecting only the dwindling amounts of paid for music rather than the totality of what's being consumed. U2 sees the iTunes rollout as a way to harness digital rather than passively roll with its punches. An immediate spike in sales of U2's back catalog bore out that business strategy behind the deal even as the messaging went awry. But a bigger coup de theatre is planned. There will be a world tour in 2015, and another album is in the works, a companion piece to Songs Of Innocence called Songs Of Experience. Of itself, that would be good news for U2 fans, if little more, but Bono also sketches the outlines of the new format that Apple and U2 are developing. The band is working with Apple to create "an audiovisual interactive format for music that can't be pirated and will bring back album artwork in the most powerful way, where you can play with the lyrics and get behind the songs when you're sitting on the subway with your iPad or on these big flat screens. You can see photography like you've never seen it before." Bono squints into the Californian heat haze as if a vision shimmers above him: salvation for working musicians everywhere, as consumers willingly pay to own music again -- and not just single digital tracks but entire albums. "We're about 18 months away from it," he says. "I think Songs Of Experience will be released in a new format. And I think it's going to get very exciting for the music business." Apple isn't quite as loquacious as U2's front man; the company say only that it "declined comment on future product plans." Some technological leaps forward have transformed the music industry; others sink without a trace. (Remember Stereo 8, DAT tapes and minidiscs? Probably not.) And any new way of enjoying music would be swimming against the stream, the trend away from buying and owning content -- records, movies, TV shows -- and toward streaming from the cloud whatever we want, whenever we want it. But one thing is clear: not for the first time, U2 is on a grand mission, perhaps its grandest yet. It won't be enough if its next album is great. Bono, The Edge, Clayton and Mullen want Songs Of Experience to save all of music too. They may fail, but that won't stop them trying. © TIME, 2014.

Although the company continued to make money hand over fist, 2016 marked the first time Apple experienced a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. On top of that, Apple’s new MacBook Pro lineup elicited an onslaught of criticism from folks who viewed the device as underpowered and embarrassingly overpriced. Don't Miss: You won’t believe how much Amazon is charging for Google’s Pixel XL But if we smash through some of the hyperbole and dire projections about Apple’s ability to innovate, we find that Apple still has a knack for delivering products and services that keep consumers coming back for more. According to Brand Keys’ 2017 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, Apple delivers a best in class user experience across every single category in which it competes, from smartphones to music streaming. CNET reports: When it comes to the smartphone category, the top driver is Apple. In tablets, it’s Apple. In laptop computers, it’s Apple. Yes, this despite the launch of the somewhat deflating MacBook Pro. What about online music? Goodness me, it’s isn’t Spotify. It’s Apple Music. Even in the headphones product category, Apple-owned Beats ties with LG as the category driver. Can it be that at a time when Apple is subject to criticism from seemingly all sides, it’s still the most emotionally involving, customer-pleasing brand of all? Brand Keys’ latest study provides a good opportunity to point out the dangers in getting swept away in the hive mind mentality that tends to hover over Apple. If you didn’t know any better, you might reasonably assume that the new MacBook Pro, for example, was nothing short of a flop. In reality, Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro has proven to be extremely popular with consumers, with Phil Schiller even stating this past November that Apple’s “online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.” It’s easy to get bogged down in sales figures and pessimistic diatribes about how Apple’s best days are behind it, but it’s important to remember that when it comes to providing users with an intuitive and enjoyable user experience, Apple still knows how to deliver.

Unfortunately Qualcomm’s legal woes don’t end there as Apple has since filed a lawsuit themselves. According to the lawsuit, it seems that when Apple cooperated with the Korea Fair Trade Commission, Qualcomm decided to “punish” the Cupertino company by withholding payments to Apple, that is unless Apple was willing to change its statement to the KFTC, or at least that’s what Apple is alleging in its lawsuit. The company goes on to note that Qualcomm had been overcharging the company in the billions for patent royalties that Apple claims are “for technologies they have nothing to do with.” Qualcomm has yet to respond to Apple’s allegations but it does seem like the company is facing quite a bit of legal trouble. In 2016 they were hit with a $854 million fine in South Korea, and the year before that they landed themselves in trouble with China’s antitrust regulators who slapped them with a $954 million fine. Combine this with the FTC and Apple’s lawsuit, it seems that Qualcomm has quite a deep legal hole that they’ll have to dig themselves out of. In the meantime Apple’s full statement on the lawsuit reads: For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts.

The 100-page complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a greedy monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. For instance, Qualcomm demanded royalties on Apple's fingerprint identification system built into recent models of the iPhone and also for larger storage capacities on the devices, according to the lawsuit. Qualcomm denied the allegations. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. "Qualcomm's recent effort to cover its tracks — by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators — underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme," the lawsuit alleges. Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. Besides cooperating with the FTC's investigation, Apple says it has been providing information about its dealings with Qualcomm to regulators in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. South Korea regulators last month imposed an $853 million fine on Qualcomm for violating its antitrust laws, a decision that Qualcomm is fighting. Shares in San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. fell $1.56, or 2.4 percent, to close Friday at $62.88. Those of Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, ended up 22 cents at $120.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Liberty Utilities water rates frozen for more than 2 years Friday Jan 20, 2017 at 5:49 PM Jan 23, 2017 at 4:03 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — In what company officials are touting as an opportunity to “better engage customers,” Liberty Utilities announced a freeze Friday that will lock in base rates at 2017 levels for more than two years. The 30-month rate freeze is the result of approval of Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley’s December request to delay filing its next general rate case with the California Public Utilities Commission for one year. CPUC approval came on Dec. 20, according to a letter obtained from the company by the Daily Press, and follows the release of a Dec. 15 Office of Ratepayer Advocates letter that objected to Liberty’s request. In the first letter, the ORA cited a need to examine Liberty's next general rate case "as soon as possible" and said uncertainty exists regarding Liberty’s reduced capital spending relative to the levels adopted by the commission. "Given this recent decrease in capital spending in 2016, the Commission should require Liberty Apple Valley to move forward with its GRC on schedule beginning in January, 2017 to examine rates that will be effective January 1, 2018," the letter said. The now-approved request also allows Liberty to consolidate regulatory filings with its water system in southeast Los Angeles County, a move the company said will lead to savings that “will be passed along to customers.” In a statement, Tony Penna, Liberty’s vice president and general manager, said the CPUC’s approval will reduce regulatory costs in addition to stabilizing water rates in the town. “The base rate freeze, consolidated regulatory schedule and expanded customer outreach reflect Liberty Utilities’ transparency, accountability and commitment to the Apple Valley community,” Penna said. It should be noted that the freeze comes after an increase of nearly 5 percent to base rates that took effect Jan. 1. Penna also noted the delayed filing allows the company an opportunity to “collaborate with community leaders regarding operations, maintenance and investment in the local water system.” It remains uncertain how much collaboration, if any, will occur given Liberty is locked in eminent-domain litigation with the Town of Apple Valley. Mayor Scott Nassif told the Daily Press that Liberty’s "action" is not a rate freeze. “Consumers will notice higher rates on their bills for January because Liberty applied for, received approval for and has implemented a 4.88 percent rate increase for the 2017 calendar year,” Nassif said. “The Office of Ratepayer Advocates objected to Liberty’s recent rate request because it was based on a capital spending plan that Liberty is not meeting.” As a result, according to Nassif, Liberty “might be charging far more than they should be.” “This ‘freeze’ is an attempt to escape scrutiny of their current, exorbitant rate structure for another year,” he said. “Liberty has routinely used advice letters to increase rates in the past with little notice to customers.” Meanwhile, Liberty officials said that during the freeze period, which ends June 30, 2019, the company will make its mandated annual regulatory filings for a customer credit or surcharge to ensure it collects only the 2017 authorized revenue levels approved by the CPUC.

Apple is ready for the deal By mid-day online correspondent | Posted 21-Jan-2017Now Available on the mid-day iOS App, Download Now Apple iPhone 8 California based Apple Inc. is going to meet the central government officials in Delhi next week because the global tech manufacturer is willing to start manufacturing iPhones in India itself. Apple feels that the central government will be a big help to the company in this case. Apple will therefore discuss the prospects and possibilities of setting up its manufacturing units in India in 2017. Apple is asking India for a long list of financial concessions that includes a 15-year tax exemption on imports of materials and components. Apple aims to set up their manufacturing units in India because the tech giant aims to boost India’s business scenario and at the same time sees the country as a fast growing smartphone hub. Narendra Modi under his 'Make in India' campaign wants firms to manufacture their products within India itself. If the upcoming meeting between Apple and Indian government goes fine and it decides to accept Apple’s request to waive of custom duties, then this will be a big move for Indian economy, where the global tech giant will set up their exclusive manufacturing unit and start making iPhones.

The Cupertino maker of AirPods says in a lawsuit [PDF] filed with the Southern California District Court on Friday that Qualcomm has for years been gouging it with excessive licensing charges as a condition of using its cellular modem chips. Apple says that Qualcomm has insisted on charging royalties for patented technology that were, in some cases, not even used in the iOS products Apple had purchased Qualcomm's chips for. The suit seeks roughly $1bn in damages. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement to El Reg. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies that contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Apple also claims that Qualcomm withheld payments it owed as retaliation against Apple for cooperating in a probe by the Korean Fair Trade Commission that eventually led to Qualcomm being hit with an $853m fine. "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use," Apple said. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty, we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." The filing comes just days after the FTC filed its own suit against Qualcomm for abuses in its licensing system. That suit included allegations that Qualcomm had been overcharging Apple and bribing the iPhone maker with lower licensing costs in exchange for an exclusive deal to provide baseband chips for its smartphones over a five-year period (Apple switched to a mix of Qualcomm and Intel baseband chips last year). Qualcomm has said it will fight the FTC's complaint. "While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless," said Don Rosenberg, a Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel. "Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [Korean] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits." ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 57 Comments More from The Register Uh-oh!

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion in unpaid rebates, alleges attempted perjury, extortion Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion in unpaid rebates, alleges attempted perjury, extortion By Joel Hruska on January 20, 2017 at 7:32 pm Comment Apple sued Qualcomm today, alleging that the mobile chip giant owes it at least a billion dollars in unpaid rebates and agreements. Apple further states that Qualcomm “attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC [Korean FTC] in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple.” That’s a bombshell accusation, if true. The Korean FTC recently fined Qualcomm $850 million, but an accusation that Qualcomm may have deliberately attempted to pay other corporations to lie on its behalf could open Qualcomm up to criminal lawsuits and accusations of perjury. China has also fined Qualcomm for its alleged monopolistic abuses and the FTC filed a lawsuit against QC earlier this week. Apple provided Ars Technica with the following statement: For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts. Among Apple’s complaints, are allegations that it is forced to effectively double-pay Qualcomm, since Qualcomm requires Apple’s manufacturing partners to take out a license to work with Snapdragon hardware, then charges Apple again for a separate license. According to Apple, Qualcomm sweetened the deal with rebates so long as Apple maintained exclusivity — which actually sounds a fair bit like the rebate practices Intel used to artificially deny and reduce AMD’s ability to win product designs from 2002 – 2006. In this case, however, it was Intel’s modem that allowed Apple to break Qualcomm’s lock on its LTE business. This also explains why Apple used Intel in the first place, given that Intel’s modem isn’t as good as Qualcomm’s according to objective analysis. Apple’s suit alleges that Qualcomm breached its contracts, abused its monopoly power, and violated California contract law. It also claims Apple was overcharged and required to license nine separate patents that Apple does not believe it infringed upon. If this case is anything like the long-running Apple / Samsung litigation, it’ll be years before it goes to trial and years after that until a verdict and damages amount is settled — but throwing another lawsuit shines an unwelcome spotlight on its business practices and policies.

No one likes being overcharged for the iPhone, not even Apple, so it's suing one of its biggest partners for $1 billion, alleging inflated patent prices. Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker, holds the rights to cellular patents that are used to make the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But it's getting expensive. Apple says Qualcomm charges "at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," reports CNBC. Taking a shot at its partner, Apple adds, "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." Here's what Qualcomm says Qualcomm, of course, doesn't see it the same way , saying, "it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless" in an official statement. It calls out Apple for snipping it at various junctures around the globe, noting, "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world." Qualcomm concludes its statement with, "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court."  It sounds like we'll have another long, drawn-out Apple legal saga, reminiscent of the Apple-Samsung court case. Side benefit? We may discover tantalizing, never-before-heard trade secrets again in the process. When the chips are down iPhone prices have gotten more expensive in the last decade, ever since the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the original iPhone in 2007. At the same time, Apple's profits have been on a sudden downward trend, and current CEO Tim Cook's compensation even has dipped because of it. Apple is clearly pinching every penny, playing defense in its filing: "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason." It's driving home the point that the more it's charged for patents, the "more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Qualcomm, for its part, makes most of its money off of these sort of royalties. It sells Apple GSM and CDMA-enabled iPhone 7 modem chips, primarily used in the US models, and they've proven to perform better than Intel's GSM-only modems. Whether or not this billion-dollar lawsuit sours their relationship for the iPhone 8 later this year remains to be seen.  Qualcomm also makes Android chipsets, like the Snapdragon 820 found in over 200 devices, and it has a sequel on the way: the Snapdragon 835, expected in the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8.

Qualcomm on Friday faced the second lawsuit in less than a week alleging it engaged in unfair business practices, this time from Apple, which filed a complaint seeking $1 billion in damages, the Wall Street Journal reported. Apple's suit, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of California, alleges that Qualcomm withheld contractually-obligated payments in retaliation for Apple's cooperation with a Korean investigation into its business practices. That investigation ended with the Korean antitrust agency levying a record $854 million fine against Qualcomm last month. Qualcomm makes the processors found in some models of the iPhone and many other smartphones and mobile devices, from flagship handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S7 to lower-end Android models. The agreement with Apple, which used Qualcomm chips exclusively in its iPhones from 2011 to 2016, required Apple to pay a percentage of iPhone sales revenue to Qualcomm, according to the Journal. Qualcomm was supposed to return a portion of those payments as rebates, but it stopped doing so after Apple cooperated with investigators from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). The suit says that Qualcomm "attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments," according to the Journal. In all, Apple claims that $1 billion worth of rebates were withheld. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts," Apple said in a statement to the Journal. Related FTC: Qualcomm Violated Competition Laws FTC: Qualcomm Violated Competition Laws Qualcomm Executive Vice President and General Counsel Don Rosenberg said that Apple was encouraging "regulatory attacks" on Qualcomm's business practice. "Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program," Rosenberg said in a statement. Apple's complaint comes two days after the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm for using anticompetitive tactics to impose unfair conditions on its customers and weaken its competitors. Qualcomm has objected to both the Korean and US lawsuits, and said it plans to appeal them.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Apple Hits Qualcomm with $1 Billion Lawsuit over Excessive Royalties GO The chip maker withheld 1$ billion because Apple helped South Korean authorities investigating its business Jan 21, 2017 00:54 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  It looks like the partnership between Apple and Qualcomm has come to an end, as the Cupertino company has decided to turn to the courts to settle a disagreement on paid royalties. Apple has already released an official statement explaining why it has decided to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm over excessive royalties. The amount Apple is asking Qualcomm to pay for charging more excessive royalties is no less than $1 billion. “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations,” reads Apple's statement obtained by CBNC. But that's not all, as Apple went on to say that it was charged by Qualcomm up to five times more in payments than any other patent licensors it has agreements with combined. That must have hurt really bad, so we can understand why Apple has decided to take it to the courts. Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” On top of that, according to the statement, Qualcomm withheld around the same amount of $1 billion in payments from Apple because the Cupertino-based company helped the South Korean authorities investigating the chip maker's business. “To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them.” Qualcomm hasn't yet responded to Apple's lawsuit and allegations, so it will be interesting to see how this clash between two giants will end up.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple suit#Qualcomm royalties#Apple patent#Qualcomm chipset#Apple lawsuit subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple's 2018 iPhone Could Use TSMC's 7nm Processor, Rumors Claim Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States Why Some iPhone 7 Models Are Faster than Others and How to Tell If Yours Is Slow iPhone 7 AT&T and International Versions to Get Intel LTE Modem Family Tree Now: How to Remove Your Private Records from Genealogy Site Huawei Watch 2 with Cellular Connectivity Reportedly Coming Next Month Padoka or Oibaf PPA for Ubuntu Gaming?

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Business  • Markets •  Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Markets > Apple Sues Qualcomm For $1 Billion Apple Sues Qualcomm For $1 Billion Friday, 20 January 2017 (4 days ago) It has gone from bad to worse for mobile chipmaker Qualcom, which just days after getting sued by the US government, which accused the chipmaker of engaging in monopoly tactics over mobile phone components, was also sued this afternoon by the world's biggest company. Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against its supplier, accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates for chip purchases. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and that it withheld rebates because Apple cooperated with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, in its probe into Qualcomm licensing practice. The KFTC fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. In its statement, Apple said that Qualcomm has taken "radical steps," including "withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." Apple added, "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple also said. According to the Apple complaint, Qualcomm’s terms required Apple to pay a percentage of the average selling price of an iPhone to use Qualcomm patents and to exclusively use Qualcomm chips in iPhones from at least 2011 to 2016. Apple received what it called quarterly rebates from Qualcomm under terms of the agreement, but Qualcomm began withholding those last year after Apple met with Korean regulators, the suit says. The lawsuit is surprising in that Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and its arch nemesis, Samsung Electronics for "modem" chips that help phones connect to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Furthermore, Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's legal problems continue to pile up. In February 2015, the company paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. In Washington on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers like Apple and to weaken competitors. For now, Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said, however sensing weakness how long until Samsung likewise attacks its key vendor demanding easier terms too? Judging by the modest reaction in QCOM's stock, the market does not see that as a likely possibility. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Global Business - 4 days ago< > Embed Apple Sues Qualcomm Over Patent Royalties 03:35 Jan.20 -- Apple sued Qualcomm, accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities.

According to the lawsuit, Apple has had this technology since 2008, but has not implemented it due a fear that it would lose a significant portion of its customer base. © Photo: Pixabay No Evidence Overheated iPhone, iPad Could Cause EgyptAir A320 Crash - AppleA lawsuit filed at the Los Angeles County Superior Court by lawyers at MLG Automotive Law demands Apple halt iPhone sales until the company upgrades its smartphones with a feature that forcibly prevents text messages from being composed while driving. The main plaintiff in the case, Julio Ceja from Costa Mesa, California, reportedly suffered injuries after his car was rear-ended at a stoplight by a woman who was texting on her iPhone at the moment of the incident. The lawsuit, which names Ceja and "other similarly situated" plaintiffs, states that Apple has had a technology that prevents iPhones from being used to text while driving, as far back as in 2008. The company applied for a patent for this technology in that year, and it was granted in 2014. According to the patent abstract, the technology uses the smartphone's built-in motion analyzer and scenery analyzer and "does not require any modifications or additions to the vehicle." No iPhone is equipped with this feature, because, according to the lawsuit, Apple is "fearful" that implementing its patented technology "would cause it to lose valuable market share." The lawsuit alleges Apple and its iPhones are responsible for an estimated 52,000 automobile accidents annually in California alone, based on reports from the California Highway Patrol and the Federal Highway Administration. According to these reports, 312 Californians die in car crashes each year due to using an iPhone while texting. "Texting and driving has become one of the most serious issues that confronts all of us on a daily basis," said MLG Automotive Law founding member Jonathan Michaels. "Legislating against drivers will unfortunately not solve the problem." © Photo: Pixabay New Year May Dash Apple's Dream to Make IPhone in IndiaAccording to Michaels, people are unwilling to put away their cell phones while driving, and there is no way to make sure that they do. Implementing a lock-out feature is the only way to prevent automotive accidents. This is not the first time this technology has been cited in court, as it was noted in lawsuits regarding accidents that happened in 2013 and 2014. In the first case, a Texas woman rammed an SUV while checking her iPhone for new messages, which resulted in death of the driver and his passenger, and left a child paralyzed. In 2014, a driver using FaceTime, Apple's video-calling feature for iPhone, caused a car crash that resulted in the death of a 5-year-old girl. This tragedy became the point of another lawsuit against Apple that was filed in December 2016. The lawsuits are different, as this one does not demand implementing a technology, instead focusing on damages and medical expenses. ...

Posted 21 Jan 2017 08:16 In its court filing, Apple said it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by Qualcomm's "illegal scheme". (AFP/Ethan Miller) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Friday (Jan 20) sued Qualcomm, accusing the California chipmaker of abusing its market power to demand unfair royalties, echoing charges filed days earlier by US antitrust regulators. Apple said in the court filing that it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by its chipmaking partner's "illegal scheme." Apple also claimed Qualcomm owes it a billion dollars but is refusing to pay in retaliation for the iPhone maker's cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators looking into the chipmaker's actions in that country. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in an email statement. "To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly US$1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." The suit charges Qualcomm of building a business model on using its rights to older, legacy technology considered telecommunication industry standards to raise royalties when Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices. "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," Apple said. ANTITRUST WOES Apple noted in the suit that Qualcomm's business practices have come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in an array of countries for selling its smartphone chipsets only to makers agreeing to its "preferred license terms" for essential mobile telecom patents. Apple asked for a jury trial, and for damages including Qualcomm paying the company what it owes plus giving up excessive royalties it has raked in. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment. The Apple filing came three days after the US Federal Trade Commission filed suit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm abused its market power in as part of its "unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors," which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as "significantly flawed," arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. South Korea's anti-trust watchdog last month slapped Qualcomm with a record fine exceeding US$850 million for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chipsets used in mobile phones. ROOM FOR RIVALS Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. Apple undoubtedly knows of the antitrust tide rising against Qualcomm and would like to help provide room for rival chipmakers to flourish, perhaps letting Intel improve its position, according to analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insight and Strategies. "I think Apple is not comfortable in feeling that they have only one source and are taking this opportunity to go after Qualcomm," Moorhead said, referring to the mobile device modems. "Qualcomm is being looked at on every continent on the planet; this is probably, strategically, the right time for Apple to do this." While the legal case alleges exclusionary contracts and the idea of being overcharged for licensing, it may well be powered by Apple wanting to ramp up competition to Qualcomm so it can negotiate better deals, the analyst said. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

CST January 20, 2017 NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 17: The Apple logo is displayed at the Apple Store June 17, 2015 on Fifth Avenue in New York City.    (Photo: Eric Thayer, 2015 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is suing supplier Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing the company of overcharging for its wireless chips and engaging in monopolistic tactics. The lawsuit filed Friday in San Diego federal court follows a complaint earlier this week by the Federal Trade Commission that Qualcomm used its dominant position to force "onerous and anticompetitive" terms on mobile phone makers such as Apple and Samsung, which together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm's $32.5 billion in revenue in the most recent fiscal year. Qualcomm said earlier this week it would "vigorously contest"  the FTC complaint. Qualcomm could not be reached for comment on Apple's lawsuit. In its lawsuit, Apple claims Qualcomm overcharged for its chips and then refused to pay $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators probing Qualcomm. Those regulators fined Qualcomm more than $800 million for what they alleged were unfair practices in patent licensing. Qualcomm is appealing the decision. Apple also challenged the validity of some Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. If the patents are upheld, Apple asked the court to reduce the royalty amounts. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties," Apple said in a statement. According to the Apple complaint, it must pay Qualcomm a percentage of the average selling price of an iPhone to use Qualcomm patents and to exclusively use Qualcomm chips in iPhones. Under the agreement, Apple received quarterly rebates from Qualcomm but Apple says Qualcomm began withholding those last year after Apple met with Korean regulators. Qualcomm shares (QCOM) ended 2.4% lower Friday, adding to losses that followed the FTC complaint. Apple shares (AAPL) ended 0.2% higher.

Dan Wheat Capital Press Published on January 20, 2017 4:18PM Dan Wheat/Capital Press A crew picks apples from a Bandit Xpress in a Stemilt AgServices orchard near Quincy, Wash., on Oct. 10. This simple platform does a better job than some higher-tech machines, its maker says. Buy this photo WENATCHEE, Wash. — Harvest-assist platforms are faster than conveyor systems for pickers who work quickly, a tree fruit specialist says. Conveyor systems work well in Europe and Australia where pickers are slower, half the speed of typical Washington pickers, Karen Lewis, a Washington State University Extension tree fruit specialist, told Capital Press. She also spoke via Skype at the Northcentral Washington Apple Day in Wenatchee on Jan. 19. Pickers frequently have to adjust conveyor arms to keep them close to their work, and that slows Washington pickers who often pick two to four apples at a time, Lewis said. Harvest-assist platforms, on which apple pickers still pick into bags and dump their bags into bins, optimize their high proficiency, she said. “We are the envy of the world with our predominately Mexican workforce. We pick an apple every two seconds and that’s not just for a short period, but over time. No place picks like that in the world and we have the numbers to back this up,” she said. Abundant Robotics, Hayward, Calif., has been field testing a robotic picker it says has picked one apple per second. It’s aiming to have it ready for commercial use in the fall of 2018. Conveyor systems have not been making new sales in Washington, Lewis said. It may be because they’re not what growers want, she said. Automated Ag Systems of Moses Lake, Wash., has sold 400 to 500 of its Bandit Xpress self-propelled harvest-assist platforms from 2013 through 2016, mostly in the West, owner, J.J. Dagorret, has said. A New York grower, Rod Farrow, has said he’s experienced a 30 percent increase in efficiency using the Bandit Xpress to replace ladders. His pickers still use bags. Lewis said pickers color pick better at night with LED lights on platforms because they can see color better than in the daylight. She also spoke about mechanized pruning and blossom thinning at the educational meeting, which was attended by hundreds of growers and co-sponsored by WSU Extension and the Northcentral Washington Fieldmen’s Association. High-density planting of trees with narrow canopies where all the apples are within arm’s reach is vital to mechanization, she said. Mechanized hedge pruning during winter tree dormancy keeps trees narrow, or sets the box, for fruit production and should be followed up by detailed hand pruning to fine-tune tree architecture and manage bud load, she said. Mechanized pruning ahead of hand pruning is faster than just hand pruning, she said. A second mechanized hedging in early June eliminates excess limbs, foliage and young apples, keeping the canopy small to allow better light for growth of remaining apples. “Fruit, leaves and wood are flying. Fruit is hitting fruit. It’s not something we normally do and it can be pretty scary for the grower but results can be pretty fantastic,” Lewis said. Better light penetration for remaining apples improves their growth and quality, she said. About 3.5 to 4 percent damage of fruit left on trees is manageable for pickers to cull, she said. Very few growers do early June hedge pruning, she said. Mechanical blossom thinning is best done right at bloom. If done too early it knocks off too many spurs of the following year’s crop and if done too late eliminates too much fruit set, she said.

The content artists upload now appears in different locations within the newly updated Apple Music app on iOS 10 for listeners. It remains, however, a powerful tool for sharing new music and videos, clips of upcoming releases, and everything else beyond your main releases on Apple Music, iTunes and the other streaming services.  The user interface for uploading has changed slightly, and Apple has introduced new tools for Connect since it first launched that allows users to create and share an embedded web player and more. You’ll also be able to attach music videos to your albums on Apple Music using Connect. Here’s how it works: **If your music isn’t already on Apple Music, you can learn how to do so here. If your music IS already on Apple Music, you’ll also have to claim your Connect profile if you haven’t already done so before you can post to Connect. Where do Connect posts appear? How to upload to Connect from iPhone/iPad How to upload to Connect from Mac Create an embeddable web player or badge for Connect posts How to delete Connect posts Add or update your Apple Music artist profile page Contact Apple for support with Apple Music (For artists) Where do Connect posts appear? The content you share will appear in two places: For You: Connect posts will appear in a feed on the ‘For You’ tab in the Apple Music app on iOS devices or under For You>Connect in iTunes. Artist pages: Content you post to Connect will also appear in a section under your albums and songs on your artist profile page. (You can also attach videos you upload to an album or song you have on Apple Music when uploading.) How to upload from iPhone | From the Apple Music iOS app: From the ‘For You’ tab in the Apple Music app, tap the compose icon in the upper right next to your profile photo. From there you can type text and insert links, and connect to any Facebook and Twtitter account you might want to automatically share the post to. Tap the + icon in the bottom left corner of the compose window to add a song or video to the post before publishing: Select Upload Photo or Video or Upload Song to add content to your post. You can also attach the video to an album or song you have on Apple Music when uploading. And you’ll get options to trim a video before posting if you wish. Share from your library. Tapping the “…” icon next to any album or song on Apple Music (including your own), will give you an option to “Post to Connect”.  From GarageBand on iOS: From the main projects screen in GarageBand for iPhone or iPad, you can upload a song directly to Connect. Tap Select in the upper right corner Select the project/song you want to share from your projects and tap the share icon in the upper left corner Tap the Apple Music icon from the share menu (You might have to scroll over to find it) Fill out your song art and details and click Done to upload to connect How to upload from Mac | From iTunes on Mac: You can also post to Connect from a Mac from within Apple Music in iTunes. Navigate to Music>For You Click the compose icon in the upper right-hand corner next to your profile (you’ll have to be signed in to your Apple ID associated with your Connect profile). From there you’ll get the same upload screen as on iOS, allowing you to write a message, drag and drop or click the + to upload photos and videos, and options to link Twitter and Facebook accounts to automatically share the post to your social media accounts. From Logic Pro or GarageBand on Mac: You can upload directly to Apple Music Connect from Logic Pro on Mac or Garageband on both iOS and Mac.

Navigate to Apple’s Music Marketing Tools website. Use the dropdown menu to select “Connect” or other category and search for your artist or song name.  From there Apple will give you options to copy code for a web player or alternatively a “Listen on Apple Music” badge that you can embed on your website (as pictured above). I’ve embedded a web player I made of a Connect post for my EP below:    How to Delete Apple Music Connect posts | Tap the “…” icon next to a Connect post from within the Apple Music iOS app or in Apple Music from iTunes on the desktop and select “Delete”.

Apple wants Qualcomm to hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money to punish Apple for cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is headquartered. The Cupertino company also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future. Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. “It is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented.” Qualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company $890 million and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal. Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from its licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones. Susan Decker, Alex Webb and Ian King are Bloomberg writers.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple sues Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman January 20, 2017: 5:43 PM ET The original iPhone almost looked like this The world's largest company is suing one of its suppliers for effectively holding it hostage. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) filed a lawsuit Friday against Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30), accusing it of charging "excessive royalties" and withholding payments in retaliation for Apple cooperating with South Korean regulators that are investigating the chip supplier. Qualcomm, which provides crucial chips used in the iPhone, allegedly charges Apple an unfair amount to to license its cellular patents, according to the lawsuit. Apple is also seeking nearly $1 billion in rebate payments, which it claims have been wrongfully withheld. The previously agreed upon rebates were conditional on Apple putting Qualcomm chips in its products and not pushing litigation that accused the chip maker of unfair licensing practices. "To protect this business scheme, Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple said in a statement about the lawsuit provided to CNNTech. Related: Apple AirPods review: Do they actually stay in your ears? Regulators in South Korea fined Qualcomm roughly $850 million last month for forcing phone manufacturers into unfair patent licensing agreements in order to get its modem chips. Apple's lawsuit comes the same week as the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust complaint against Qualcomm for using its position in the market to push "onerous and anti-competitive supply and licensing terms" on cellphone companies. Qualcomm "maintains a 'no license, no chips' policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cellphone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms," according to the FTC complaint. Reps for Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Qualcomm's stock closed down more than 2% Friday following the lawsuit.

Apple is asking a federal district court in Southern California to order Qualcomm to pay it nearly $1 billion that it says Qualcomm is holding back. Apple says it is owed the money, but Qualcomm is holding it back because Apple cooperated with a South Korean government investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices. The lawsuit alleges that Qualcomm charges high licensing fees to the companies that make iPhones for Apple. Those companies pass the fees on to Apple but aren't allowed to show Apple the specifics of the licensing deals, leaving Apple unsure what it is paying for. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." The lawsuit comes just months after Apple began using Intel radio chips in some units of the iPhone 7. It also follows two recent legal actions by antitrust regulators against Qualcomm's licensing practices. In December, antitrust regulators in South Korea fined Qualcomm $854 million for unfair licensing practices. Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision. Then, earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission followed with allegations that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive practices by forcing some phone makers into accepting unfavorable licensing terms while giving Apple a break in exchange for exclusivity. Apple cooperated with the South Korean investigation. It alleged on Friday that Qualcomm withheld nearly $1 billion in rebates as punishment for that. In response to the FTC's lawsuit earlier this week, Qualcomm denied the charges and said the FTC's lawsuit is "significantly flawed." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms," it said in a statement. "The FTC’s allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong." It has not commented on Apple's lawsuit.

January 21 AAPL: 120.00 0.22 KGI: iPhone 8 will feature new 3D Touch pressure-sensitive sensor to work with flexible OLED display Benjamin Mayo - Jan. 21st 2017 7:10 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There are a big expectations for the iPhone 8; namely a major redesign featuring a large OLED display that wraps around the sides of the device with a front face featuring almost no bezels; the fingerprint Home Button will somehow be integrated into the screen. In addition to the radical new design, KGI has a new report today adding another new feature to the list: a new, improved, 3D Touch system for enhanced pressure sensitivity … KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the new OLED iPhone will use a flexible display panel, which will likely allow it to curve around the sides of the main chassis. However, this makes it incompatible with the existing 3D Touch pressure sensors seen in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Therefore, the upcoming flagship device will switch from a ‘FBCB sensor to a film sensor’, offering higher sensitivity and a wider range of 3D Touch pressure levels. As OLED panel is more fragile than the LCD displays, Apple will reinforce the 3D Touch sensor with a metal structural part to provide support. The report does not detail whether this extra layer of metal would be externally visible, if it is solely an internal component. Apple’s new flagship iPhone, currently being dubbed the ‘iPhone 8’, is expected to launch in the fall. Many sources indicate the device will be a major upgrade from the iPhone 7 with an all-new glass design, with an OLED display larger than a 7 Plus although some of the screen area will be wrapped around the sides of the device. It may also feature new Touch ID and facial recognition biometrics, wireless charging, enhanced waterproofing and other features. Apple is also said to be developing two iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with minor external changes and new chips for better performance. Essentially, if the rumors are true, Apple is readying three new iPhones for 2017: an iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 with OLED screen and a radically-new form factor. In a separate report from the same analyst, KGI claims that Sharp is receiving a higher proportion of Apple product orders across fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. As well as being a supplier for the OLED iPhone, it will also be the enw leading supplier of MacBook and iPad displays.

The Unicode 9.0 collection features 72 new emoji, including such crowd-pleasers as “Nauseated face” and “Fox face”. Emoji are an extremely popular part of messaging on iOS and some people even update their devices just to get the new releases. However, you needn’t choose between your jailbreak and your smileys; in this article we’ll go through how to get the new iOS 10.2 emoji on your jailbroken iOS 9 device. This method uses developer Poomsmart’s Emoji10 suite. Please note, whilst it is possible to get the iOS 10.2 emoji on jailbroken firmwares as far back as iOS 6 as well as on iOS 10, in the interests of brevity I will only be going through the method on iOS 9. The process for other iOS versions is similar, but may require different packages. Consult Poomsmart’s guide page for details. Requirements A jailbroken device BytaFont 3 Poomsmart’s Cydia repository vxBakerxv’s Cydia repository Instructions 1) First, launch Cydia and add the following two repos: https://vxbakerxv.github.io/repo/ https://poomsmart.github.io/repo/ Poomsmart’s repo contains the various Emoji10 packages we need to allow our iOS 9 device to handle the layout and attributes of the iOS 10.2 emoji keyboard. vxBakerxv’s repo hosts the iOS 10.2 emoji font files themselves. 2) If you haven’t already, install BytaFont 3 from the ModMyi repo, which comes pre-installed with Cydia. BytaFont 3 will be used to equip the Emoji10 font, once Poomsmart’s tweaks have set up our device to be able to handle it. 3 a) If you are on iOS 9.0 – iOS 9.1 inclusive, search for and install the following packages: Emoji10 (iOS 9.0-9.3) – Poomsmart Emoji iOS 10 – vxBakerxv EmojiAttributes – Poomsmart EmojiLocalization – Poomsmart EmojiResources – Poomsmart The final three in the above list may be automatically queued for installation when you try to install Emoji10 (iOS 9.0-9.3). If they aren’t, install them manually. 3 b) If you are on iOS 9.2 – iOS 9.3.3 inclusive, install these packages instead: Emoji10 (iOS 9.0-9.3) – Poomsmart EmojiAttributes – Poomsmart Emoji iOS 10 – vxBakerxv 4) After respringing your device, open BytaFont 3. 5) Navigate to the Swap Mode tab, and select Emoji. 6) On the Emoji screen, tap Emoji10 to swap your original emoji for the updated iOS 10.2 versions. 7) Respring your device when prompted. 8) After it has resprung, open any messaging app and swap to the emoji keyboard. Check for the presence of an iOS 10.2 addition such as “Whisky” or “Bacon”. If they are there, you are golden! Reverting your changes 1) Open BytaFont 3 and navigate to Swap Mode – Emoji. 2) Press the Restore BytaFont backup button to swap the iOS 10.2 emoji back to your original iOS version’s. 3) We must now uninstall the Emoji10 packages from Cydia. If you don’t, your keyboard will still be set up for iOS 10.2 but without the 10.2 emoji font equipped, which will leave gaps in your keyboard. To do this, open Cydia and uninstall all of the packages on this list that you have (you may not have all of them): Emoji10 (iOS 9.0-9.3) – Poomsmart Emoji iOS 10 – vxBakerxv EmojiAttributes – Poomsmart EmojiLocalization – Poomsmart EmojiResources – Poomsmart 4) Respring and check that your emoji are back to normal again. And that’s all there is to it. These packages are useful in that they also allow you to view iOS 10.2 emoji in messages received on your device, when they are sent to you by someone running iOS 10.2. Enjoy expressing such emotions as “Facepalm” and “Rofl”, without giving up your jailbreak to do it! Have you tried out the new emoji on your device? Do you need a guide for iOS 10.2 emoji on a version other than iOS 9? Let me know.

I just want the new emojis, nothing else. Thanks in advance! Anderson Silva (2) Joaquim Barbosa I’ll have a poke around and see if I can find a similar procedure, but I don’t think it will be as easy on OS X as it doesn’t have the same sort of package system for modifying OS properties. You can probably replace the font file itself with the Unicode 9.0 emoji from Sierra, but it may not recognise it properly without other modifications. I’ll have a look anyway though. Cheers! Ash Is it possible to get iOS 10.2 Emoji on iOS 8.1.2? put a guide please if there a way.. leart im on 9.3.5.. Joaquim Barbosa I’m afraid you’re out of luck on 9.3.5 until a jailbreak comes out, but some of your other devices may be eligible. Thanks! Joshua The-Legend Wiebe If we give it time, this will be achievable through one package and one repo instead of multiple ones. Diego Milano I doubt it, back in the day it was only possible to get the latest iOS emojis but within the same major version (eg., iOS 7.1 emojis on iOS 7.0). I am still surprised this is possible, I always thought it wasn’t! I’m glad to be wrong! Joshua The-Legend Wiebe back in the day, it took GeoHot 500 hours to unlock the first iPhone, now its done in a few hours with internet tools.. you’ll see it’ll become easier. Diego Milano It won’t. An example of this is the current state of the jailbreak. Sad but true. Joaquim Barbosa This is already achievable in some cases with a single package which a Reddit user posted. However, this way is better, because the packages can be updated separately by the developer, and are also more flexible. It is also not necessarily advisable to take another developer’s work and repackage it without their permission, as they then have to support unusual configurations and have had their work reappropriated. So in answer to your point, which is a good observation: it is already possible, but not really a better way in my opinion. Thanks for reading! Diego Milano This is FANTASTIC! I remember when I added the emojis from a higher build on a lower build but I always thought it was impossible to import newer Unicode emojis into lower major firmware versions! Joaquim Barbosa Yea it’s pretty handy. As I mention in the most recent ‘Let’s Talk Jailbreak’, my favourite kinds of tweak are ones which bring features from later iOS versions to earlier ones, so that I can have the benefits of iOS 10 on jailbroken iOS 9 for example. This is a good example of that. Another example would be LiveWallEnabler and EnableLivePhotos. Glad it helped you out! Diego Milano So I just noticed something really interesting— when you are using Safari and you try to add these emojis on a Disqus comment, nothing shows up except for a blank space. 🙁 Joaquim Barbosa On macOS or iOS? It works fine for me on iOS… Diego Milano Oh, sorry, I don’t have a Mac— always on iOS (9.3.3). What about you? It’s really odd, that was unexpected. Joaquim Barbosa I’m on iOS 9.3.3 too, iP6. It’s working for me. How strange… Diego Milano It really is. I just tried disabling some of the keyboard tweaks I have installed such as FastDel or EmojiKey and it makes no difference. Weird! Haha. I’m gonna keep poking around and see what I find… 🙂 Back to the basics, I guess, ha. Joaquim Barbosa What about Safari-related tweaks? Or generic image/bug fix packages which may interfere with Safari? Diego Milano No, I have none of those installed, except SafariTabCount which I doubt may conflict but I could try. Apel iOS 9.3.3 6S “seleted font is invalid” Can somebody help me, please? Joaquim Barbosa Where is that message reported, in BytaFont 3? Make sure you are downloading the correct font file from vxbakerxv’ repo. I can probably help with a few more details. Apel Yes, In Swap Mode if you select Emoji 10 the PopUp “.. is invalid” appers downloaded the standard 10.2, Not the Pink one Joaquim Barbosa How strange. Do you have all the other supporting packages installed? Perhaps try reinstalling the font package and BytaFont 3 and trying again… Apel Yeah everything reinstalled & did a jailbreak refresh, too :// Joaquim Barbosa Make sure it’s not the EFM version of the Emoji10 package, and that you have BytaFont 3 not 2. Do you use a custom keyboard, and what is your system language in your phone? JoeMerlino Same error StupidBoy Chheang bytafont the selected font is invalid, how to solve? Joaquim Barbosa Did removing Emojiant work like Samir suggested? StupidBoy Chheang yes, got removing already, still can not solve. so how to restore back to original emojis back on ios 9.3.3? Joaquim Barbosa The article explains how to go back. Look at the end of the article. Replace default emoji in BytaFont 3, and then uninstall all the emoji packages you installed. Joaquim Barbosa Do you have Emojiant installed? JoeMerlino No I don’t Samir If you have emojigiant installed remove it. That worked for me Abigail Pietrzyk Powell I have emojiant installed. I’m on 9.3. New emojis still work fine with that tweak. ☺️ Rick Hart What’s the repo for emojigiant? Thank for your help Rick Hart I was spelling it wrong I found it David Gow Any update on a iOS 10 jb? Blacklight: Retribution this. My iPad Air 2 needs a jailbreak. JF In my case ios9.02, the bottom icons should jump to the right location on the emojis and it’s not… The flag icon jump in the middle of the flags, not at the start, same for others… Joaquim Barbosa Interesting, I only have one device to test this on iOS 9.0.2, but it does not have this problem. What is your device and which packages do you have installed? leart how about those ios versions? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca0baa7c019c63aade16f8c720d92c73054fc82a2c07cf209a894523e6ea036.jpg Joaquim Barbosa Can’t see all of those iOS versions properly, but in general, this can be done easily on iOS 6-10, but only with a jailbreak. Earlier than iOS 6 will not be as easy. Check out Poomsmart’s guide I link in the article for iOS 6-10. Hope that helps! Art Can I still downgrade, from 10.2 to 10.1.1? Joaquim Barbosa Nope. Shingo ios8? Joaquim Barbosa Emoji10 (iOS 6-8.2) OR Emoji10 (iOS 8.3-8.4) depending on your iOS 8 version – Poomsmart Emoji iOS 10 – vxBakerxv EmojiAttributes – Poomsmart EmojiLocalization – Poomsmart EmojiResources – Poomsmart Then follow the guide as usual. Cheers Abigail Pietrzyk Powell Thank you ! Finally a tweak that worked. I have been researching this forever and nothing worked. Thank you !

Meet the “Snapbot” from Snap Inc., a vending machine that allows users to buy Spectacles, the company’s trendy wearables which enable users to record video clips directly from their sunglasses. Last year, I praised the release of Spectacles and the bots you can shop from as one of 2016’s biggest developments in social media marketing. Since then, a Spectacles pop-up shop opened its doors in New York City, the first store location where one can purchase a pair of Specs. However, the store’s opening hasn’t cooled off the hype over Snapbots. Here’s what the brand is getting right about marketing. There’s only one bot… The key word for Snapbot is "one." A bot’s landing is specifically chosen for “places where you’re excited to make memories.” Only one bot travels across the United States, landing in one location at a time for just one day. Using the map on the Spectacles site, you can count down when the next one is scheduled to arrive. The Snapbot machine even has a cute mythology of its own — arriving by floating from the sky and waking up upon landing. … and one pop-up shop Let’s discuss the Spectacles pop-up store in New York. Parked across the street from an Apple store, and open from 10 AM – 10 PM, you might think this shopping experience would be similar to shopping at Apple with dozens of registers, employees, and products get you in and out quickly. The store offers up plenty of Spectacles, but you have to be prepared to wait in a line of hundreds. Once you make your way inside the store, Specs may be purchased from a single bot machine which is separated a bit away from the line. The experience doesn’t differ in the pop-up any more than it would at a random Snapbot location either. You still have to wait in line, plus the pop-up shop will only be open through February 19, keeping the countdown going for the arrival of the next Snapbot. These glasses aren’t readily accessible to everyone - and that’s a good thing We live in a time where new technology tends to oversaturate on launch. Events are held (and live tweeted) about upcoming new releases. Media and influencers get the goods complimentary so they can write reviews and post on social platforms to add to the hype. And audiences, hungry for the latest update, are able to place pre-orders in-store and online to be one of the first to acquire it. None of the above has happened with Spectacles - yet. Specs cater to their fan base and the only way to get a pair is by visiting a Snapbot. Even early press pieces were based on impressions from Snap users that acquired a pair and tried them out. Overall, it’s an interesting approach to supply and demand in an era of endless shopping avenues. You can’t go online and buy Spectacles whenever you feel like it. You can’t cut to the front of the line with a pre-order. For now, you just have to wait and see where the next bot will land and wait to make the purchase. Spectacles are worth the wait Snapbot aside, as a business, Snap Inc. has nailed it's product and made wearables cool - no easy feat. Wearables have long had a reputation for being overpriced, clunky, and inaccessible which Spectacles turned on its head. Priced at $130 apiece, these glasses are affordable and well-made, able to charge in their case. You can choose between three colors - black, coral, and blue - and virtually try the glasses on in front of the Snapbot (the bot’s “eye” switches to a screen that enables you to see how you might look in each color). And then there’s the glasses, which allow users to easily record videos through a 10-second Snap and capture a slice of the world without using a smartphone. Only time will tell how Spectacles endure with fans (and evolve, since I imagine they may go the way of iPhones and release glasses with updates), but the cheerful Snapbot and its TBD travel agenda do more than provide a product to fans. It surprises and delights, making the arrival of this vending machine something to anticipate as well as celebrate.

ENTERTAINMENT 2017 Academy Award nominations: The snubs, surprises and what happened to Scorsese? ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Emojis are everywhere — including in their own Hollywood movie 'The Emoji Movie' Sony Pictures Animation A scene from "The Emoji Movie." A scene from "The Emoji Movie." (Sony Pictures Animation) Emily Zemler Over the last few years, emojis have become a ubiquitous form of communication. The tiny digital icons, found on your smartphone keyboard and elsewhere, connect users and have become their own language. The original emojis, designed by Japanese mobile provider NTT DoCoMo and released in 1999, were even recently acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Clearly, we’re obsessed. Not surprisingly, Hollywood has taken note. Exclusive emojis now accompany film releases and TV show premieres as part of studio and network marketing campaigns, and an emoji movie is scheduled for release by Sony Pictures Animation in the summer. “As storytellers, we’re always trying to tell stories that really connect with people,” said Tony Leondis, director and co-writer of “The Emoji Movie.” “For millions of people, emojis are how we do that now in our daily lives. We have this immediate connection to these little yellow guys that we send out as versions of ourselves. Billions of emojis are sent every day to share their love, their frustrations, their happiness, their lives with each other. It seemed like such a perfect landscape to tell a story.” It also helps that no one owns the rights to them. Because emojis are considered a font or a language, that means that anyone, including movie studios, can use them for any purpose at any time (MoMA acquired DoCoMo’s emojis through a licensing agreement) —  as long as they don’t directly copy pre-existing ones. “You don’t have to get the rights to emojis,” Leondis said. “You just have to create your own version of emojis.” “The Emoji Movie” will be Leondis’ breakout (previously, he  directed the animated short “Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters”).   For the director, the movie is an opportunity to capitalize on our interest in these icons. He even enlisted James Corden to voice one of the characters, Hi-5, alongside T.J. Miller and Ilana Glazer, which is fitting as Corden’s talk show, “The Late Late Show,” has a recurring segment called “Emoji News,” which recaps headlines using emojis for comedic effect. Many people are familiar with the emojis included in Apple’s iPhone keyboard, but other tech companies and phone providers also have their own. Twitter, in particular, continually partners with movie studios and TV networks on exclusive emojis that are activated with specific hashtags. For “Rogue One,” the “Star Wars” picture released by Lucasfilm and Disney on Dec. 16, a “Star Wars” Twitter emoji automatically appeared when you tweeted any of the following: #RogueOne, #DeathStar, #StarWars and #StarWarsRogueOne. “We know there's a massive, engaged audience of movie fans on Twitter who are tweeting about upcoming films,” said Jennifer Prince, who deals with media and entertainment at Twitter. “Studios that recognize that opportunity leverage Twitter during the film promotion process —  it has become a core part of studios’ playbooks, whether it is with a custom emoji, exclusive trailer or cast Q&A. Emojis are a new way for people to connect and express their excitement and passion for films with a community of fans.” Twitter has worked on  more than 50 exclusive emojis for films since  its first campaign in April 2015 for “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” A “Bad Moms” emoji was tweeted more than 103,000 times, according to Prince, and “Suicide Squad” appeared in 1 million tweets between March 1 and May 26, thanks to a Joker Twitter emoji with the hashtag #JokerWasHere.” Skype debuted  its own set of icons, dubbed Emoticons by the brand, although they are similar to traditional emojis, around the November release of Marvel’s “Doctor Strange.” The digital communication app had created similar partnerships for “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” “Our fans are extremely engaged, so we try to provide them with as much content as possible for them to express their fandom,” said Mindy Hamilton, senior vice president of global partnerships for Marvel Entertainment. “Skype’s ‘Doctor Strange’ emoticons provided users with exclusive content to add personality and their love for pop culture and Marvel’s ‘Doctor Strange’ to their Skype chats. Anything that can bring people closer to our characters and our universe is key, especially if it’s something as fun and creative as what Skype did here.” Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim released  its own emoji keyboard over the summer; it includes 150 custom emojis themed around characters from popular shows like “Rick and Morty” and “Robot Chicken.” The free keyboard has been installed 320,000 times and the included emojis used 2.6 million times, said Jim Babcock, vice president of consumer marketing at Adult Swim. The Cartoon Network offshoot will soon roll out more animated emojis for iOS 10. “We want to give our fans a way to drop an Adult Swim GIF, sound clip or sticker into a conversation with a friend that will make them laugh or question the course their life has taken,” Babcock said. “It’s less about a transaction and more about engaging and sharing a joke. We’re thinking about emoji for every show and for any sentiment where we think we can add something funny or weird.” The emojis, although generally for entertainment and fun communication, can also make a statement. Around the theatrical release of “Loving,” the real-life story of a couple’s historic legal fight to have their interracial marriage recognized by the state of Virginia, Focus Features unveiled its own set of icons via the Love-Moji app. “It came about through social insight,” said Josh Kornblit,  senior vice president of digital marketing and media at Focus. “In August 2016, Apple announced they were planning to add more gender-diverse emoji in iOS 10, something that was done in response to negative social feedback they had received. But we noticed that interracial couples were still absent from the update. The [app] helped fill a void for something that wasn’t previously available, and people got behind it in a big way.  “It was great to see how excited people were to see themselves represented that way. It’s meaningful —  which is why it took off so quickly.” calendar@latimes.com Caption Kristen Stewart on directing 'Come Swim' Kristen Stewart enjoyed the free-form aspect of making her short film, "Come Swim" which is showing at the Sundance Film Festival.

Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple and Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple's iPhone and Alphabet Inc.'s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What's the next platform? ... It's about data and people training AI systems to learn." Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard, Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin's engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the startup. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.

The report noted that "Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry and Japanese subsidiary Sharp aim to take a huge leap in TV sales in 2018. In fact their goal is to double sales and in order to be able to do that Hon Hai has decided to tell Samsung that they have no interest in supplying LCD panels to them for TVs next year (2017). That news has sent Samsung into a panic and is now trying to strike a deal with rival LG." It was reported weeks later that Samsung was in talks with LG. Today we learn that Samsung is now suing Sharp for dropping them as customers.   A Korean report today states that "Samsung Electronics South Korea's tech giant, has filed a request for international arbitration against Sharp Corp. of Japan and two other panel makers, seeking US$492 million in compensation that it claims to be suffering from due to their halting of LCD panel supply.   According to the sources, Samsung has filed the request with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) demanding that they resume panel supply or compensate the loss.   Sharp, taken over by Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said earlier it would stop supplying LCD panels to the world's largest TV maker Samsung.   Samsung, which receives an average of 4 to 5 million LCD panels every year from Sharp, has been in negotiation with other LCD suppliers such as LG Display Co. to reduce any impact on its business.   The prices of LCD panels soared during the latter half of 2016 with demand for LCD panels during the first half of 2017 expected to be above the level expected for the usual off season, the sources said."   Patently Apple's December report had noted that "Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou has said that his company, working with Sharp, will be able to beat Samsung. Since Gou's sense of rivalry against the South Korean electronics giant is well known, Taiwan's news media have reported Sakai Display's decision as a possible 'declaration of war' against Samsung by the Foxconn group." Sakai Display is owned by Foxconn / Sharp.   So Samsung's striking out against Foxconn/Sharp is probably putting a smile on Terry Gou's face today knowing that his strike against Samsung has caused them maximum grief. Maybe it's just me, but I think that this recent news may also be putting a smile on some Apple fan faces today as they cheer on Apple's number one supplier.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

You are also entering a global military-industrial complex By Subodh Varma, TNN | Updated: Jan 21, 2017, 05.01 PM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » weapons | US | India | Army The biggest clients of these weapon makers are governments themselves, although many 'non-state actors' also patronize them probably through covert help from some interested government. Budget 2017: Can Arun Jaitley make you & economy happy? Click for our special Budget 2017 coverage Everybody has heard of big companies with global reach ­ Microsoft and IBM, Google and Apple, Coca Cola and Pepsi, Nestle and Kraft, and many others. But how many of us can recall hearing about Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin or BAE Systems or Almaz-Antey? These and others like them too have annual profits running into billions of dollars, and they have customers in virtually every country . Yet, they live in a secretive netherworld about which few people have any inkling ­ and they deal in lifeand-death products. These are collectively known as the 'aerospace and defence' industry, much of which is located in the West but with important and even more secretive counterparts in Russia and China. Arms sales are truly global and cut across borders.So, these companies may supply to both sides of a conflict -India and Pakistan, Israel and surrounding Arab countries, Turkey and the Kurdish Peshmerga. Young, idealistic men and women joining up to serve their country's armed forces will probably use their weapons or technologies without realizing that what they are really becoming part of is a sprawling transnational military-industrial complex that has no friend or foe, and covets only profits. As has happened in many places, unknowing citizens may be marching off to the killing fields of a distant war that has nothing to do with defending their country and everything to do with boosting the sales of weapon manufacturers and serving as a live testing field for their new products. Lucas Berard, a US army veteran who deployed with the Marines in Fallujah in Iraq, and with the Army in Kirkuk, also in Iraq, writes in a blog that he "soaked it up like a sponge, every bit of it: the esprit de corps, the prevailing viewpoints of superiority and violence of action, a love of weaponry, and the desire to use it". But, like all human beings, the experience left him deeply disturbed by the loss of life on both sides. “I found my self becoming more isolated, divided as to how I should feel. I was angered at the deaths and injuries of our own, but it nev er detracted from the pity I felt for the local population as well. After all, we were in their country, kicking their country, kicking down the doors of, and often utterly destroying, their homes," he says. Millions around the world who join the armed services are not really aware that they are just becoming a pawn in a global game of thrones fuelled by greedy arms dealers. Back in 1935, Major General Smedley D. Butler of the US Marines, who served for over 33 years and fought wars on three continents, memorably said that war is a racket, and described it as the only one in which “the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives“. Make that billions of dollars. The top 100 arms companies (excluding China) sold $401 billion worth of deadly weaponry in 2015, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). About 20 of these companies did not reveal their profits but the remaining earned $42 billion.The total global arms trade was estimated at $94.5 billion in 2015. Apart from these heavy weapon systems and fighter aircraft, about 9.5 million pieces of small arms like pistols and rifles, and light weapons like machine guns were also sold worldwide, according to the UN's Registry of Conventional Arms. These are under-estimates because much of the small arms trade is underground. The biggest clients of these weapon makers are governments themselves, although many 'non-state actors' also patronize them probably through covert help from some interested government. Global defence spending by governments was estimated at a mind-numbing $1.57 trillion in 2016 by the authoritative industry publication Jane's. This was needed to arm and maintain 27.3 million armed forces personnel across the world. "Solutions for America's Global Partners" -this is the slogan of a little known but immensely powerful agency within the US Department of Defense. It is called the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The "solutions" it provides to its "partners" are -weapons systems. The DSCA buys arms from manufacturers to sell them to various countries around the world. The US is by far the biggest arms supplier with about 56 per cent of global arms supplied from its shores. Between 2008 and 2015, US entered into arms sale agreements worth over $265 billion, with Russia a distant second at about $88 billion. Who are the top buyers? Unsurprisingly, four of the top five recipients are US allies -Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and the UAE. The fifth is India, currently moving towards a closer alliance with US. India agreed to buy weapons systems worth $34 billion in the 2008-15 period. What is unique about the arms manufacturing industry is that it works in very close ways with governments. In the US, bulk of orders received by these companies are from the US government. Conversely, the industry has a stake in increasing govt spending -the more govt spends, the more orders it gets. This is not something that's done in secret: the US weapons industry employed over 400 lobbyists to push its case with the govt, Senators and Congress members.And, they see `national priorities' as their own priorities. After Donald Trump's victory, the industry quickly regrouped and there is a sense of barely restrained joy because Trump has announced plans to up defence spending, and buy and deploy new weapons. "We've called for elevating defence spending as a national priority, and early indications are this call is being heeded," said David Melcher, president of the Aerospace Indus tries Association, the defence industry body with 300 top manufac turers as its members. After the US signed the Iran nuke deal, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hew son was asked wheth er tensions in the Middle East would go down and drag down the company's arms exports to the region. She was reported to have blithely responded that continuing "volatility" in both the Middle East and Asia would make them "growth areas" for the foreseeable future. In other words, for her company, and for all arms companies, tension and conflict are opportunities for growth. So, next time you hear the drums of war anywhere, ask this, who's really benefitting?

How far is this common in Zimbabwean context.? (25) COMMENT OVERVIEW  - The above question requires one to have deep knowledge concerning the methods which were used by Israel prophets to convey their messages. They used various methods which will be mentioned on the ongoing article. Zimbabwean prophets use different methods. Zimbabwean prophets include the following a)    The Apple Prophet  "Fordrick Fordrick" b)    "The Spectacle Prophet "Freddy" c)    Ezekiel Guti d)    Major Provovo man of style "Uebert Angel" e)    W .Magaya f)    Passion Java g)    Zviratidzo Zvevapostori sects h)    Wutuanashe Andrew i)    Prophetess Ruth Makandiwa j)    Prophetess Beverly Angel k)    Makomichi l)    Aaron Mhukuta "Madzibaba Wimbo" ANSWERS  - Israel prophets used symbolic actions to deliver their messages, There are so many prophets who used symbolic actions ,for instance Moses performed symbolic actions in front of Pharaoh as a way of convincing him. This is recorded in Exodus 7-10.[charging of the rod into serpent]. Isaiah of Jerusalem is well known of his symbolic action which is even shocking the readers of this generation, Isaiah is recorded to have spent 3 years walking nak*d ,this is recorded in Isaiah 20:3.Jeremiah is also known of performing unusual symbolic actions of caring yoke bar, this is recorded in Jeremiah 27. Hosea is well known of marrying a harlot as away of delivering a message, even though in the society it was not allowed for men to marry woman with loose morals [Exodus 24:1-4].The above prophets might have been delivering the message to the audience ,one should note that on the onset it shocked the hearers or audience considering Moses who performed unusual symbolic action in front of Pharoah ,he was shocked this can be evidenced by summoning his magicians and soothsayers and his heart being hardened. All this is recorded in Exodus 7:10-15.Jeremiah shocked the leaders in Judah, it even shocked Hananiah the false prophet, this might be the reason why he broke the yoke bar ,this is evidenced in Jeremiah 28:10-11.Basing on the above ,it is clear that most of the symbolic actions performed by prophets shocked hearers than attracting them .  - The visions sometimes shocked the audience, this is true in the case of Amos who delivered his message of doom ,perhaps in Gilgal and Bethel. The visions are well known by number of biblical readers [Amos 7].The visions of Amos might have shocked even the priest Amaziah ,this is the reason why he expelled him even though some scholars believe that Amos was expelled because Amaziah believed that Amos was prophesying for bread.The point is that Amaziah might have been shocked by the visions of doom which were uttered by Amos ,hence meaning that prophets often shocked their hearers rather than attracting them. HOWEVER PART  - In as much as it can be said that prophets often shocked their hearers with their methods which they used to deliver their messages, it will be loss of memory if one ignore the view that some methods attracted the hearers, for instance, songs. Israel prophets used songs to deliver their messages .Moses used a song to deliver his message, this is recorded in Deuteronomy 32:1. Amos also used the song "funeral dirge" to deliver his message of doom ,this is recorded in Amos 5:2. Isaiah of Jerusalem also used the song of vineyard to deliver his message to the Israelites, this is recorded in Isaiah 5:1.Some scholars believe that on the onset songs attracted people especially when a prophet used the vernacular language. As such ,this indicates that sometimes audience were attracted by the methods which were used by the prophets. N.B There are so many ways which attracted the audience. ZIMBABWEAN CONTEXT  - In Zimbabwean context, number of so many prophets uses methods which attract their hearers, for instance the use of stories, the son of Wimbo, Gomo submitted that the way his father delivered his message it was amazing, this was even published by Bulawayo24.com ["He has always been amazing because at times he makes prophecies without informing anyone that he is sending a prophetic message. He would just pretend to be telling a story and often we would realise it was a prophecy when things he would have said begin to happen"] All this indicates that methods used by Zimbabwean prophets attract hearers. SOME OF ATTRACTIVE METHODS a)    Pamphlets b)    Radios c)    TV stations d)    banners QUESTION DEMANDS -Read the demands of the question Questions by schools to be answered on Newspaper can be submitted through my mobile number +2363777896159 or Email address : [email protected] .Readers of the Daily Old Testament Questions and Answers can follow the Questions and Answers on Sunday News Newspaper every week | Bulawayo24.com Online Newspaper | Listen to Divinity on Lips Radio Program with Witness Dingani every Sundays on Channel Zim Free Tv Decorders [Radio Dialogue] 09:00am -10:00am or Like Facebook page "Witness Dingani" where some of useful information will be posted.

AP Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. Photo: Bloomberg Washington/San Francisco: Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm Inc., accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is based. Apple also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future. Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed on Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. Qualcomm fell 2.4% to $63 at the close in New York. Apple rose less than 1% to $120. “It is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.” Also Read: Apple is ready to start making iPhones in India, but at a price Qualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Legacy standards “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision. Antitrust investigations Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. Patent royalties The US Federal Trade Commission on 17 January filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from the separate licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not. One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells — measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars. Companies collaborate to develop industry standards so that the devices can communicate with each other. Since they have the ability to ensure their inventions get included in the standards, they pledge to license on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm has breached that pledge by refusing to license its patents to Intel Corp., a rival chipmaker that’s been providing some chips to Apple for the past year, according to the complaint. Bullying accusations Apple accused Qualcomm of bullying it, threatening to withhold chip supply, forcing it to agree not to challenge Qualcomm’s patents and using Apple innovations to help its competitors. Much of the money Qualcomm collects on the iPhone or iPad is paid by third-party manufacturers who pass along the cost, according to the complaint. Apple said Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because those manufacturers “have no incentive to negotiate.” Apple said it’s not allowed to see those agreements, and believes Qualcomm gets paid multiple times on the same device. Since Qualcomm won’t give Apple a direct license, it instead agreed to give Apple a rebate — money that it’s now withholding. The case is Apple Inc. v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-108, US District Court for the Southern District of California (San Diego).

Photo: REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Apple Inc. filed a $1 billion lawsuit against telecommunications equipment company Qualcomm on Friday, days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) questioned the company’s patent royalty practices and also accused it of engaging in anticompetitive tactics to ensure its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC lawsuit filed Tuesday had also accused the San Diego-based chipmaker Qualcomm of forcing Apple to exclusively use its chips for iPhones. Fending off the allegations, Qualcomm had responded that it never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. However, in its lawsuit, also filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of withholding some $1 billion in promised rebates as ransom because Apple complied with investigations carried out by South Korea’s anti-trust regulator, the Fair Trade Commission. The South Korean regulator had fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won (almost $853 million) in December. Apple also accused Qualcomm of overcharging the company for its chips. It said that Qualcomm offered to pay the money it had withheld “if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint, Bloomberg reported. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. ... Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," Apple said in its lawsuit, according to Reuters. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple added. Qualcomm's stock fell 2.42 percent to close at $62.88 in New York, following the news. Apple's stock rose 0.18 percent to close at $120. Commenting on Apple's allegations, Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm, said in a statement Saturday: “It is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. ... Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.”  Related Stories Qualcomm Denies Use Of Anticompetitive Tactics FTC: Qualcomm Made Apple Use Its Products Qualcomm also accused Apple of inciting regulators against the chipmaker in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” it added in the statement. Qualcomm owns numerous essential patents in the CDMA (code division multiple access) and LTE (long-term evolution) mobile standards and charges mobile companies and other chipmakers royalties for using them.  The company is also being investigated in Europe, Japan and Taiwan for anticompetitive and monopolistic trade practices. Apple used Qualcomm's chips until its latest iPhone 7 model in September 2016, when its exclusivity agreement signed from 2011 until 2016 lapsed.

FILE: Picture: AFP. Apple Inc Qualcomm Inc Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 4 days ago WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO - Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the US government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. ADVERTISING “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4% lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1% at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyse their parts.

Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is based. Apple also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in "Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future. Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics. Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price. Qualcomm fell 2.4 percent to $63 at the close in New York. Apple rose less than 1 percent to $120. "It is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. "Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.” Qualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in "various jurisdictions around the world,” by "misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Legacy Standards "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement. "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now. In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomm’s largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision. Antitrust Investigations Under the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomm’s business model. Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said. Qualcomm offered to pay the money "if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies,” according to the complaint. South Korean regulators aren’t the only authorities investigating Qualcomm. Patent Royalties The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 17 filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from the separate licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not. One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells -- measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars. Companies collaborate to develop industry standards so that the devices can communicate with each other. Since they have the ability to ensure their inventions get included in the standards, they pledge to license on "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm has breached that pledge by refusing to license its patents to Intel Corp., a rival chipmaker that’s been providing some chips to Apple for the past year, according to the complaint. Bullying Accusations Apple accused Qualcomm of bullying it, threatening to withhold chip supply, forcing it to agree not to challenge Qualcomm’s patents and using Apple innovations to help its competitors. Much of the money Qualcomm collects on the iPhone or iPad is paid by third-party manufacturers who pass along the cost, according to the complaint. Apple said Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because those manufacturers "have no incentive to negotiate.” Apple said it’s not allowed to see those agreements, and believes Qualcomm gets paid multiple times on the same device. Since Qualcomm won’t give Apple a direct license, it instead agreed to give Apple a rebate -- money that it’s now withholding. The case is Apple Inc. v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-108, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (San Diego). < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm`s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple`s discussions with South Korea`s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm`s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple`s claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm`s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel`s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s US$23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at US$62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 per cent at US$36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week DuPont says Dow Chemical merger to close later than expected Mexico may leave Nafta if renegotiation unfavourable, minister says HSBC to close 117 branches in Britain, cut 380 jobs Trump urges US automakers to make big push for new plants Wall Street edges higher as earnings gather pace Singapore dollar rises to new record high against ringgit Trump pulls US out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties (VIDEO) Ringgit to trade softer against US dollar next week US dollar slides near seven-week lows on fading Trump trade At some Singapore suburban malls, retailers confront the sound of silence Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Jackie Chan hits Mumbai to promote ‘Kung Fu Yoga’ Reuters Video: Asian TPP nations pledge to save trade deal Reuters Video: Spider milking time at the zoo, all to save lives Reuters Video: Trump sued for defamation by former 'Apprentice' contestant Bloomberg Video: Audi’s Keogh — people really want luxury SUVs Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles As nuclear loss grows, Toshiba needs chip investors, soon India to consider Apple request for investment incentives with ‘open mind’ Pawn poll: Monopoly players get vote on new generation of game pieces Tesla taps Apple engineer for self-driving Autopilot software Three new iPads rumoured to be releasing this spring Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

That, however, might finally change this year. According to a yet-unconfirmed report from Israel, Apple is going to make group FaceTime calls a feature of iOS 11. The new version of the mobile operating system will probably be unveiled, like clockwork, at the company's annual WWDC conference in the summer. It should then go through the usual phase of developer-focused and public betas before being released for everyone in the fall, around the time the new iPhones launch. The information regarding group FaceTime video calls in iOS 11 allegedly comes from "several people familiar with iOS development process", which is apparently being done, in part, in Israel. The group calling feature will support up to five people at a time, and will be initialized through group iMessage conversations.

Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

Apple files $1 bn lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm for overcharging Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for 'modem' chips Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for 'modem' chips Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of a name change for the iPhone. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. iPhone X: A new rumor claims that Apple won’t release the iPhone 8 later this year, reports Forbes. According to this rumor, the tech company is planning to drop the numbers from its next smartphone and call it the “iPhone X.” The rumor comes from sources inside the company’s supply chain. It is possible that this is just a code name for the next iPhone. However, AAPL has dropped numbers from its devices in the past to help them stand out. Pencil 2: Rumor has it that AAPL is planning to release the next version of its Pencil stylus soon, MacRumors notes. This rumor claims that the company is looking to release the Pencil 2 sometime during March of this year. The rumor states that the device may be shown off at a rumored event coming in March. Another rumor claims that the tech company will show off the next generation of the iPad Pro at this event. iPad Release: There’s a new rumor claiming that Apple’s next generation of iPad devices is coming later this year, reports AppleInsider. According to this rumor, the tech company is planning to release three new iPad tablets during the second half of 2017. The rumor claims that the release will include new 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch tablets. If this rumor holds true, it would likely mean that AAPL isn’t actually planning an iPad event for March.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS - Apple Inc filed a US$1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's US$23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at US$62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at US$36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. - Reuters Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

ENTERTAINMENT 2017 Academy Award nominations: The snubs, surprises and what happened to Scorsese? BUSINESS Technology Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion, depicting it as a shady monopolist Qualcomm Gregory Bull / Associated Press Qualcomm is the target of a lawsuit filed by Apple. Qualcomm is the target of a lawsuit filed by Apple. (Gregory Bull / Associated Press) Associated Press Apple Inc. is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm Inc. for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. In an email, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s allegations “baseless.” Qualcomm has said in the past that its 3G and 4G cellular patents are essential to what makes smartphones truly mobile, with the ability to link to the Internet from almost anywhere. The royalties it has been charging for these key technologies for more than two decades are not unreasonable, the San Diego company contends. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers.  The FTC alleged that Qualcomm used its dominant market share in wireless chips to get excessive royalties on key, standard essential patents, which are supposed to be made available at reasonable rates under law. The U.S. agency also accused Qualcomm of giving Apple rebates in exchange for being the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015 — hurting competitors. And the FTC lawsuit came a month after a South Korean regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, fined Qualcomm $865 million over patent royalties. The company vowed to fight in South Korea’s courts. Qualcomm has vigorously denied claims made by the FTC and the South Korean regulator, saying they are based on a flawed legal theory and inaccurate information about the mobile industry. The company also faces investigations in Europe, Japan and Taiwan.

The anime-style photo-editing tool, which is available through the Apple and Android app stores, features airbrushed, fairylike depictions of people. But there’s a serious privacy and security issue with the app, according to mobile security researchers who performed tests running the application, primarily on Android phones. The code instructs users’ phones to send a large amount of data back to China, and possibly around the world. That information that could potentially be used to spy on users and their communications. Some of the application’s permissions, presented before users download the app, include access to the calendar, camera, geolocation data, contacts, screen resolution, photos, the contents of  the phone’s USB storage, and other data. The application also appears to be collecting the unique ID, the IMEI number, of users’ phones, according to Greg Linares, a security researcher who examined the application. The IMEI is a 15-digit long serial number that can pinpoint the phone’s country of origin and individual model. Linares says the information being collected would allow someone “to pair a phone with an individual and then, with the right equipment, you can clone the phone and intercept calls, SMS.” Cloning phones, which is illegal in most countries, is a relatively easy and inexpensive way to enable spying, according to Linares. “The information is nice to have, good to sell to other individuals or organizations who would readily have the tools, means, and interest of cloning devices,” he wrote. “I doubt the company behind the app is doing it themselves…[but] there is the potential for individuals intercepting stolen information in transit as well.” Meitu published a statement on Friday in response to concerns about the application’s privacy and security, saying that the company takes “personal data very seriously” and only collects information to improve performance of the app. Meitu “does not sell user data in any form,” the statement says. However, if hackers got ahold of this data, it would provide them a lot of detailed information on millions of people who have downloaded the app, according to Linares. “Imagine pairing this data with other compromised data,” he said, noting the massive theft of security clearance information from the Office of Personnel and Management announced in 2015—a breach often tied to China. However, iOS forensic researcher Jonathan Zdiarski says there’s probably nothing special or malicious about Meitu. He decompiled the source code of the iOS app and primarily found tracking capabilities he assumes are used to build up ad revenue. “If someone walked up to me and asked me about Meitu, I’d tell them it’s just a piece of crapware with a bunch of ad trackers,” he wrote. China’s Cyberspace Administration also recently issued new rules requiring apps to collect data to authenticate users by tying them to verified phone numbers or other information. Nick, an independent security researcher who goes by “FourOctets” on Twitter, performed a forensic analysis on an Android phone in his lab to confirm the findings. His tests captured the traffic as it left the device on its way to China. The Intercept ran an additional report that revealed “information leakage” from the network: the app sent strings of numbers, including what appeared to be an IMEI number, to many different IP addresses in China. Jay Bennett, another independent security researcher interviewed by The Intercept, decompiled the application’s source code entirely and shared it, confirming that Meitu gets the IMEI number and information like your time zone, MAC address, screen resolution, and information about your SIM Card for “business analytics.” While the code might seem like a purposeful security flaw designed to covertly gather personal information without users being aware, Bennett and other researchers caution against calling it a backdoor, because Meitu does ask for permission to access at least some of the data. Users might not understand or read what they are approving, however. “Meitu’s permissions are seriously long, and if unsuspecting users are allowing these permissions, Meitu can get this information,” Bennett wrote in a message to The Intercept. The application now has a privacy policy published on its website that mentions IMEI data—information not previously included on the app store, according to @FourOctets. It’s unclear when the page was updated or published. But other applications created by the same company, like MakeupPlus, collect the same type of information as Meitu—but those privacy policies have not been updated, according to @FourOctets. Some of the company’s applications don’t have terms of service at all. Android apps are notorious for having long laundry lists of permissions, which people rarely read let alone understand. Apple’s operating system has tighter restrictions and doesn’t allow apps to request such a large amount of information without a clear purpose for its use. However, the iPhone app behaves strangely, too. Zdiarski, the iOS forensics researcher, ran a forensics test on an iPhone and tracked Meitu’s code. According to his work, which he documented in a series of tweets, the code “checks” whether or not the phone is jail broken, and allows the developer to “use undocumented APIs”—insecurities that allow it to gather information about the phone it wouldn’t be allowed to otherwise. It retrieves information about your cellphone provider, and appears “to build a unique device ID profile,” he says. The worst thing Zdiarski says he found is code that could track someone’s location using the photo’s geolocation tags, if certain permissions are granted. “This app has a lot of ways to track you,” he said. However, he said he believed the application was more of a poorly coded “cute” app with a ton of ad trackers built in, designed to generate revenue—something he sees a lot. Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, agreed that the data being gathered by Meitu was concerning, but not necessarily malicious. “Regardless,” he said, “the lesson here is: if you want to have secrets, don’t download random Chinese android apps.” Contact the author: Jenna McLaughlin✉jenna.mclaughlin@​theintercept.comt@JennaMC_Laugh ˅ ⎕ 19 Comments The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

I took a Tesla Model S on a road trip — and found out the hard way why it's a very different car Matthew DeBord Jan. 21, 2017, 11:01 AM 3,960,425 facebook linkedin twitter email print Oh sure, everybody is happy now.Matthew DeBord/Business Insider In 2015, I drove one of my kids to camp in a BMW i3, an extended-range electric vehicle that at the time was rumored to be a basis for the Apple Car. The trip went great, so I decided to make our annual camp sojourn to the scenic Catskills in upstate New York a regular EV-paloooza. And what better car to serve as our futuristic chariot in 2016 than ... the Tesla Model S? And not just any Model S, but a P90D with Ludicrous Mode — the baddest, fastest, coolest Tesla in all the land. (At least until the P100D arrived in early 2017.) The idea was to see if this four-door luxury "family car" with supercar-beating acceleration — zero to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds, claimed — could handle a journey of decent length (about 240 miles round trip) involving two adults, three kids, and gear for a pair of campers for two weeks. Quite a test, eh? And with a few scheduled stops to dine, take in the sights, and recharge the battery. Our adventure began on a pleasant Sunday in July, just like 2015, and all initially went according to plan. Until it didn't. Read on to learn all about our most excellent misadventure with the world's most famous electric car. View As: One Page Slides The pearl-white Tesla, equipped with everything, landed in the driveway of our suburban New Jersey test car HQ. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider My Prius was intimidated. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Our Tesla was the Model S sedan ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... in P90D trim. The "P" for "performance," the "90" for the 90 kWh battery pack, and the "D" for a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive setup. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Just in case you needed a reminder: all-electric equals no tailpipe emissions. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The P90D is loaded with sexy extras, like this carbon-fiber spoiler ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... and door handles that retract flush, but present themselves to you when you get close by. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider But enough about the fancy stuff. Can this ride handle a lot of gear? Well, here's what the rear hatch swallowed up ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... meeting my son James' approval. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And here's what we got into the "frunk," a front trunk that's there because the Model S doesn't have a conventional engine. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider James also dug the frunk! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider In 2015, the BMW i3 got us to our destination, but it did so at a lower sticker price, about $50,000 less than the Model S P90D, and with less cargo space. We only had one camper's gear to deal with for that trip. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We were all smiles as we saddled up in 2016. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The trio in the back was joyful. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider My lovely wife was psyched. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I even pulled out my lucky hat. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider It would shield me from the rays pouring in through that humongous sunroof. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Oh yeah, lucky hat! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We'd rely on Tesla's massive center touchscreen for all our infotainment and navigation needs. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The trip would cover 117 miles, one way. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The Model S when fully charged has 270 miles of range, enough to comfortably make the journey up and back. But we wanted to investigate the charging options along the way, so we didn't top off before departing. Still, almost 200 miles of range! Plenty, right? My plan was to get to camp, then head over to a Tesla destination partner charging site, get enough juice to make a Supercharger station on the return route, and be home by early evening. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We had Tesla's innovative, redesigned cupholders to keep us company ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... as well as the old-school versions. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Ample storage for gadgets and chargers. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And classic rock!!! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The Model S has Tesla's simple digital instrument screen ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... which can display various types of data. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Gorgeous weather to start! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And away we go! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Some threatening clouds along the route. Little did I suspect that there was some dramatic foreshadowing afoot. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider What road trip is complete without a stop at McDonald's? Sadly, this burger has been discontinued by the chain. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Happy Meal, happy kid. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We arrive! But there's just one problem ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I've screwed up my range calculations. We don't have enough to make the closest partner charging station. The car was warning us of this, but we needed to get the boys dropped off on time. So we took a chance and ended up ALMOST RUNNING OUT OF GAS, er ... ELECTRICITY! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider There's a cable in the truck of every Tesla that enables you to charge on the fly. But there are no high-speed charging options up here in the middle of nowhere in the Catskills. So we had to resort to the slowest option, good old 120-volt, wall-socket-level rejuicing. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider You plug into this small charging port at the left rear of the Model S. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider No exactly the most scenic location. We had to ask the camp maintenance staff to find us an outlet that we could use. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider This one was down by a maintenance shed. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We are charging away ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... and the Model S looks plenty sharp ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... but we'll be getting only 1 mile per hour of charging! That's mega-slow. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider A few hours, a few more miles in the battery, and we have enough to head back through the lovely scenery to find lodging — and charging — for the night. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The Blue Hill Lodge was nearby. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider There's a café and store. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And beautiful views of the Catskills heavens. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider My son Dante had endured a long, rough day. He conked out over a plate of chicken tenders and fries. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I enjoyed a delicious specialty of the house, small Russian dumplings covered in sauteed onions and mushrooms, sprinkled with dill, plus a side of sour cream. Totally hit the spot. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We retired to our quaint, blue-doored room. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And once again plugged into a basic outlet. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Still lookin' good, Model S! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider By the next morning, at a charging rate of 3 miles per hour, we have enough juice to make the closest partner charging location. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Off we go! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider It's located at the charming Inn at Lake Joseph. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Bingo! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We're plugged in ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... and drawing power again. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider But this time, we're charging much faster. In a few hours, we'll have enough power to get to the closest Supercharger location. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The inn beckons. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider There's an alluring spread of breads, bagels, fruit, jams, and preserves, as well as heartier breakfast fare. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The decor is soothingly old-fashioned. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Art! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider And pre-internet distractions. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider But most important for me ... a bottomless cup of coffee! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider After breakfast, we retired to the billiards room ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... where I taught Dante the art of the hustle. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider My wife took in the scenery. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Later, Dante reconnected with the modern world. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider The Tesla, meanwhile, stayed connected to its power supply. Tesla has set up these partner charging sites to provide relatively fast charging in more places and to fill in some of the Supercharger gaps. A Tesla vehicle can find them all using GPS and can calculate the state of its charge at all times so you never end up like unlucky, stupid me. Trust the car! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I couldn't resist messing around with some of the high-tech Easter eggs, including the famous Lotus submarine goof from the James Bond flick "The Spy Who Loved Me" (Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a big Bond fan). Matthew DeBord/Business Insider With 76 miles in the battery, we can comfortably get to the nearest Supercharger. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider It's about 50 miles away, in Newburgh, New York. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Some of the route was over unimproved roads, so we saw how the AWD system performed — and it performed just fine. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider At last! Superchargers! We should have been here a whole day earlier. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I'm thrilled — and finally relieved. Our excellent adventure had become a misadventure. But the car handled everything fantastically well: It was fast, smooth, quiet, comfortable, roomy, and the navigation was flawless — and the infotainment options kept us entertained. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider One hour on a Supercharger will get us a whopping 206 miles of range. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Bzzzzz ... electrons in, at high velocity! Go Supercharger, go! Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Cosimo's restaurant is right there, and it's time for lunch. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider They have one of these ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider .. and they used it to make one of these. Really tasty, some of the best I've ever had. This is my new favorite Tesla Supercharger location. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider I got myself fully fortified for the remainder of the trip ... Matthew DeBord/Business Insider ... and so did the Model S. Yep, almost a full charge for what's left of the drive. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Tesla makes it abundantly clear how charging its vehicles works. You can look it up ... in the car! We explored — unintentionally — three choices: 120V slow charging, destination partner charging at a faster rate, and Supercharging. My takeaway? ALWAYS START WITH A FULL CHARGE. And then plan to hit a partner charging spot or Supercharger along the way, with some margin for error — say, 50 miles of range. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider We made it home in style, and I returned the Tesla to its Brooklyn home. I wonder what 2017's camp trip will have in store for us? Prepare yourself, Chevy Bolt!

PARC Scientist Alan Kay's sketch from a 1972 paper of children playing with the "Dynabook"; its concept led to the personal computer and its form factor prefigured today's laptops. (Alan Kay) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter Few executives have moved into new jobs as freighted with history as Tolga Kurtoglu. When he became chief executive of Xerox PARC on Jan. 10, he inherited the legacy of one of Silicon Valley’s most revered institutions.  The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center is the birthplace of personal computing, the graphical user interface, the Ethernet, the laser printer, and key elements of what became the Internet. Members of its founding generation of engineers and computer scientists went on to create their own companies, such as Adobe and 3Com, and create new products and inspire innovation at fledgling companies such as Apple and Microsoft. Pride in that record still infuses PARC. “The creative aspects of thinking about hard problems and finding solutions to them is still there,” the Ankara, Turkey-born Kurtoglu, 40, told me during a recent interview from his Palo Alto office. “But there’s more of a pragmatic view of the world in today’s PARC compared to the past.”  We don’t advance the science for the sake of advancing the science ... but we ask hard questions about whether the market needs it. — PARC CEO Tolga Kurtoglu Instilling a “pragmatic view” in PARC has been a mission at Xerox ever since the lab’s first generation delivered those wonderful inventions along with some hard lessons for the parent. Xerox was ill-equipped to exploit most of PARC’s inventions. It was a hulking big company that had developed as a marketing machine for big, centralized office copiers that couldn’t be purchased, only leased — with rental payments, and sales commissions, based on the number of copies produced. The company’s thousands of salesmen couldn’t figure out how they’d collect commissions on machines that didn’t require paper. Consequently, many of PARC’s innovations — the laser printer was a key exception — ended up enriching other companies. Kurtoglu, who joined PARC in 2010 after working at Dell and NASA’s Ames Research Center, alludes to that past even as he looks ahead to PARC’s future. He says that among its core interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning, and “integrating devices, systems, and computing.” One can hear excitement rising in his voice as he describes how sensors and high-level computing can create “a whole set of new capabilities” for technologies including self-driving cars, robotics, and virtual and augmented reality. “PARC is going to be right there,” he says.  Practical applications? They range from the mundane, such as containers for milk and other perishables that judge the freshness of their contents based on the environments they’ve traversed from factory to fridge, to life-saving — expiration-tracking for vaccine and medicine supplies and sensors for soldiers’ helmets that measure their exposure to explosive impacts. Today the lab, which employs about 260 physicists, computer and social scientists, engineers and other staff, is one of four Xerox R&D centers budgeted at a total of more than a half-billion dollars a year. That’s a far cry from the core group of perhaps 40 researchers who were at the hub of its most important inventions in the early 1970s. The lab still occupies the modernistic concrete-and-glass hillside complex opened in 1975 to accommodate a growing workforce.  The most important change at PARC has been in its business model — or to be more precise, the creation of a business model where one did not originally exist. Xerox today is nothing like the high-flying company that founded PARC in 1970 — the year before a local journalist first used the term “Silicon Valley” in print. Back then, as I described the arrangement in my 1999 book “Dealers of Lightning,” PARC was free to look ahead to digital technologies that might erode copier demand. The catchphrase was to invent “the office of the future” — but the company was willing to indulge the view of PARC’s first director, George Pake, that it shouldn’t expect anything concrete from the lab for at least five years. The corporation’s wealth flowed west just at the moment when new technological vistas were about to open up. Many of Xerox’s new employees cherished the opportunity to make the first tracks in a field of new-fallen snow.  More recently, Xerox has struggled with technological change. Its sales declined 20% and profit fell more than 50% from 2011 through 2015. On Jan. 3, the company spun off its business services unit — the remnant of a company it acquired in 2010 — as a separate publicly traded company, Conduent. PARC will remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of the surviving Xerox, which retains its copier and printer business.

(Michael Hiltzik) PARC today reflects a rethinking of corporate research and development that took hold in industry following its own initial sunburst. The notion that corporate researchers should follow their instincts regardless of their parents’ needs and desires is now regarded almost as quaint, though in reality it was more a myth than reality.  Even AT&T’s Bell Labs, whose Nobel Prizes made it resemble an academic lab and made it a model for PARC, was largely focused on its parent’s technical demands.  Technology companies struggled to find ways to bring corporate research more in sync with business imperatives without stamping out the creative impulses that could lead to unexpected new markets. Xerox tried “intrepreneuring” by giving researchers the chance to spin off their best ideas into their own businesses or Xerox subsidiaries. Today the watchword is “open innovation.” PARC depends on Xerox for half its revenue, with the other half raised by hiring out as an innovation farm for government and industry, helping to develop manufacturing processes and performing technical studies for clients that have included the Pentagon, Boeing, Honda and Sony. This portfolio may not have the romantic sheen of the launch of the digital age by a clutch of youthful visionaries, but Kurtoglu says it allows its staff to work within a broad business “ecosystem” while also sharing the risks inherent in early-stage R&D before a product can be commercialized.  The goal is to “bring business thinking into the mix of science and technology development,” he says. “We don’t advance the science for the sake of advancing the science per se, but we ask hard questions about whether the market needs it and who needs it and in what format.”  This mode of operation has won praise from the Harvard Business Review, which found in 2011 that “partnering closely with customers, inventing a minimally viable product, and collaboratively iterating from there based on market feedback” preserves the “enduring PARC culture of excitement about and support for invention” and made for “a winning combination.” Whether this fosters the sort of innovation that PARC’s original scientists and engineers strived for is an open question. The original structure of PARC was a sort of “artists’ colony” whose members had a “shared feeling” about their ultimate goal, as Alan Kay, one of the original PARC computer scientists,  told Fast Company in 2015. Kay, whose concept of a “personal, portable information manipulator” helped give birth to the PARC’s pioneering Alto PC, argued that a company should have an “invention center” precisely because “it’s a wild card.” But PARC-like things have failed over the years, he observed, either because they’re “so antithetical to the corporate culture that nobody really wants it,” or the impulse is to try to “monetize everything.”  SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter »  There were few limits on the participants’ imagination,  but their innovations could become orphans if the parent was unable or unwilling to commercialize them.  PARC today may harbor a converse set of risks and benefits. A project may not get very far if its commercial potential remains murky; but the flashes of inspiration that can create entirely new markets may not come either. That defines the changes in PARC’s role. Industry needs the “collaborative iteration” of nascent technologies mentioned by the Harvard Business Review. But it also needs wild cards, and they’re hard to find.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss "La La Land" is a departure from Lionsgate’s typical fare. Have the women’s marches started a movement? In the presidential election, just seven of L.A.’s 1,700 precincts went for Trump. It's Round 2 of confirmation hearings for U.S. Rep.

ENTERTAINMENT 'La La Land' ties Oscars record with 14 nominations NATION Women's marches live updates: Millions march in L.A. and around the world following Trump's inauguration Jan. 22, 2017, 7:30 a.m. A day after the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump, millions nationwide and around the world marched in support of women's rights. • Huge crowds converge on flagship Washington march. • Hundreds of thousands at Los Angeles march alone • Did you march? Tell us why. • See the marches around the world. All updates L.A. Nation Nation Jan. 21, 2017, 7:15 a.m. New York In New York, the demonstrations are sky-high Barbara Demick A banner towed by a small plane urges New Yorkers to resist. (Alex Wellerstein) A large women’s march was scheduled in New York City on Saturday, and it appeared to be officially sanctioned: Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, was on the program to give opening remarks. But the Big Apple was already in full demonstration mode a day earlier. “WE OUTNUMBER HIM! RESIST!’’ was the message soaring past the Statue of Liberty across New York Harbor hours before Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday. The banner was tugged by a small airplane that had reportedly been hired for a three-hour run by a woman from Seattle. The plane was spotted by thousands of people in New York and New Jersey, who posted their descriptions and photographs on Twitter. The best shots came out of Hoboken, N.J. Another banner was hung from the Queensboro Bridge reading “BRIDGES NOT WALLS,’’ a reference to Trump’s plan to build a wall on the Southern border to keep out Mexicans. Although Trump is a native New Yorker, born and bred in Queens, he received only 19% of the vote in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Donald Trump Bigg Boss 10 Jallikattu Narendra Modi BCCI Home India What Donald Trump's inaugural address means for India Donald Trump and Narendra Modi (File Photo) Shares101 Arghya Roy Chowdhury | Sat, 21 Jan 2017-07:43pm , DNA webdesk Trump's speech of gloom and doom for US, where he is the sole messiah may not be a great news for India. ‘Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech’ screamed a Guardian op-ed shortly after Trump took over as the 45th President of the United States. His close-to 17 minute inaugural speech was shorn of the oratory we had become accustomed to expect from a US President over the past eight years. Instead, it was typically Trump - nationalism on steroids - appealing to his core group of voters in the Rust and Bible belts. If anyone thought Trump would mellow or carry forward from his surprisingly modest acceptance speech shortly after winning the elections, they were in for a surprise. Like his numerous campaign speeches, Trump painted a picture of gloom and doom, and hope for radical redemption during his reign. The only difference from his stump speeches was that 'I will make the change' was tweaked to project that it is people power that will be the harbinger of the US’ makeover Trump claims he can make happen. While Americans will figure out how Trump's 'bigly' claims materialise in reality, his vision for the future is likely to have ramifications for other countries, including India. Taking a stance, far adrift that of conservative Republicans, Trump batted for protectionism saying “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength". This is the direct opposite of the message of globalisation the Western World has espoused for the past half-century or so. Can Trump really turn the clock back at a time when the world is increasingly getting connected, and collaborations in technology and resource sharing are happening at a micro level? Trump's strategy of America First with its associated mantra of ‘Buy American and Hire American’ reflects a narrow, zero-sum game vision in trade policy, which isn't the case in a co-dependent world. Will the Trump government crack down on the H1B visa program? India's $146 billion IT industry is heavily dependent on it. Currently the number of applications is more than thrice the 65,000 that Indians get. 86% of the HIB visas given to tech firms go to Indians. Hence any curtailment in this program is likely to hit Indians hardest. Similarly, US companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple are looking to hire extensively from India. The Indian government has laid the red carpet for Apple to make iPhones in India. Will those plans get scuttled now? Trump's opening speech certainly comes as an alarm bell to all the allied sectors which extensively hire quality foreign talent to get their work done. The Trump administration has made it clear that it will pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership which was a big part of Obama's Asia pivot. US pulling out of TPP effectively makes it toothless and will only help China to exert more influence in its neighbourhood with ambitious projects like OBOR. Trump has nominated some heavyweights in the Defence and Foreign departments. But playing fast and loose with carefully crafted trade deals can play right into China's hand, which will have negative connotations for India. It is perhaps ironic, that when Xi Jinping is promoting globalism in Davos, Trump is advocating protectionism. As White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon said, they outlined two different world views, and although he hyped up the speech, claiming it is Jacksonian in tone, Trump runs the run the risk of being seen in the wrong side of history with his rhetoric for nativism. Finally, Trump during his inaugural speech pledged to finish radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth. Will Trump actually walk the talk, and cut or completely stop aid to Pakistan, which for very long has used proxies to unleash terror in India. Trump as a private citizen was certainly in favour of it, but then again as President-Elect he was effusive in his praise for India's Western neighbour. If Trump can indeed cut Pakistan's terror funding, and call out its bigotry and doublespeak in international fora, it will be music to the ears of Indian policymakers. For years, the US has done a fine balancing act in Indo-Pak relations. Will Trump shed political correctness and read out the riot act to them? Only time will tell. Trump's relationship with the Modi government is unlikely to be starkly different from the path laid down by George Bush and Barack Obama. But Trump's policy of America First may upset an emerging and developing economy like India. As Trump said in his speech, the wealth of US middle class has been used to benefit other countries. In the mind of an average American, India and China have been big benefactors of globalisation. Thus, on the economic front, Modi's Make in India may directly clash with Trump's America First policy if a framework for cooperation is not properly laid out. For all his broad claims, Trump gave no roadmap of how to achieve them. Many of his plans will hurt the interests, and deep pockets, of Republican donors and politicians. Also, in foreign policy, it will not be a one-way street. The other countries will look to pushback if US decides to exert force. How Trump reacts will establish the leitmotif of his presidency. For now, it is wait and watch for Indians – with both trepidation and hope.

Amazon's voice assistant arrives for the first time on a phone next month, which is... cool? Redundant? Here's how it might help you, and how it won't. Sarah Tew Phones by Jessica Dolcourt January 21, 2017 5:00 AM PST @jdolcourt Up Next This crazy camera could be a boon to VR filmmakers Alexa on your phone won't exactly be like an Echo in your pocket. CNET Imagine if Siri and Google Now had an app store filled with 7,000 extra tricks you could teach them for free. That's the promise of Amazon's cloud-based Alexa assistant on a phone, which debuts with the Huawei Mate 9 in February (for US markets only right now). The integration brings up a whole lot of questions, like how useful will Alexa be in a phone that already has a Siri (iPhones) or Google Now (Android phones) assistant onboard? And what won't Alexa be able to give you on a phone that it can on that speaker in your living room? Alexa, which initially appeared on the Amazon Echo speaker, made it possible for families and roommates to ask for music, headlines and Amazon services in a shared space like the living room or kitchen. Since then, Alexa has gained control over thousands of apps and services, which anyone with Alexa-based hardware -- like the Echo, Echo Dot or Tap and even a lamp or a smart refrigerator -- can trigger with a voice command. Alexa has become especially important for controlling various smart-home devices -- but until now, that only worked when you're within shouting range. But what about when you're out? This is where Alexa on a phone comes into play. We take a look at what Alexa on a phone can and can't do for you. Alexa on phones won't always listen Huawei isn't demoing how Alexa works on the Mate 9 (which already has Google Voice Search/Google Now), but we have a pretty good idea of how it will function. First off, don't expect an Echo in your pocket. The Mate 9 doesn't have Amazon's far-field beam-forming microphones, so it won't be able to hear you whisper "Alexa" from across the room. Even if it could, you'll need to boot up the Alexa app first: Unlike the Mate 9's built-in Google Now functionality, Alexa won't be always listening. 49 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do When you have the app running, Alexa on a phone will give you access to her world of skills without having to buy an Alexa-enabled device. It will also give you voice control over your smart-home devices even when you're away from home, which is something you can't get on at-home devices. Yes, you could just as easily open that Philips Hue app on your phone to turn on the lights with a few taps. But with Alexa on there too, you can ask her to turn on the heat and the kitchen light, and open the garage door before you even pull into the drive. (Of course, without a phone to test out real-life scenarios, the question of how well the system works is up in the air for now. But we'll take the Mate 9 on a thorough ride as soon as Alexa lands on our Mate 9.) What Alexa can do that Google and Siri can't Access most of Alexa's skills if you don't have an Amazon Echo, Dot, Tap or other Alexa-enabled device. Remotely control your smart-home devices hands-free. (Exceptions: Siri can remotely control HomeKit devices if you also have an Apple TV; Most Android phones can control the Nest thermostat and trigger IFTTT recipes using Google Now commands.) Call an Uber or Lyft to a specific address with your voice (e.g. "Alexa get me a Lyft to pick me up from 235 2nd Street"). Stream songs from Spotify/Pandora with a voice command. (You can with Google Assistant -- which is just for the Pixel phones, if you also have Google Home.) Vocally launch IFTTT scenarios. Play Jeopardy mode wherever you are. Directly launch a skill rather than opening an app first and launching with a tap (e.g. "Alexa, start 7-Minute Workout"; "Alexa, ask Twitter what's happening"). Order items through Amazon (you can do this on your independent Amazon app, but not with Google or Siri). Alexa skills that your phone assistant can already do with voice control Enlarge Image Alexa is getting into everything from fridges and lamps to phones. Chris Monroe/CNET State the weather Read out headline news Read audio books through Audible Add items to a shopping list Voice-launch apps Surprisingly, Alexa on phones won't be able to set a timer or alarm. Note that Alexa will let you control multiple compatible devices with your voice, but if you have an iPhone and HomeKit-compatible devices, you can do the same in one fell swoop if you've set up Scenes. Things Alexa can't do on your phone that it can do in your home Know where you are -- Alexa on phones is cloud-based and doesn't hook into phone services like GPS (Amazon acknowledges this). Call an Uber or Lyft to your current location without specifying (because it doesn't know where you are -- it'll send a car to your default address even if you aren't there). Set a timer or alarm (Huawei is working on this in the future). Play Amazon Prime Music: Amazon says this is a licensing issue. ("It's something we know customers want, and we're working on it," Amazon told CNET.) Connect to TuneIn Radio (Huawei is working on this, too). Be easily accessible to the whole family (versus a phone, which belongs to one person). Same old sticking points Many of Alexa's skills are tied to specific hardware and services you might need to have in order to use, like Spotify or Philips Hue lights, so you won't be able to use every skill right off the bat. For now, Alexa will cohabitate with Google Now, but I'd be surprised to see it come to the iPhone. Chris Monroe/CNET In many other cases, you need to remember the right invocation words to launch a particular skill. For example, "Alexa, ask Garageio to open my garage door" versus "Alexa, open the garage door." So Alexa on a phone is ultimately as useful to you as the number of services you have accounts for, or the number of services you can remember. What would make Alexa awesome on phones (and what Google and Apple do better) As a platform attracting plenty of app and device makers, Alexa has some clear advantages over Google and Siri's mobile assistants, mostly because more devices currently work with Alexa than they do Google and Siri -- and with fewer caveats that also require you to own specific hardware like an Apple TV or Google Home. That said, Alexa will complement, not replace, the voice powers your phone already has. Siri and Google Voice Search/Google Now are tied to the phone services where Alexa isn't yet, which gives them two distinct advantages: 1) They know where you are (geolocation), and 2) They're either always-on when the phone's unlocked, or launch with a quick gesture or tap (like Siri's long-press of the home button). Amazon's Alexa assistant will find a stronger foothold if it can do those things and also make it onto more phones before Google and Apple can elbow into Alexa's territory and start pushing Amazon out. Alexa may be the leader today, but the tide could easily turn if other competitors find a way to strengthen their grip.

But he doesn’t think Russia has a commitment to sell weapons to any country, given especially that an arms trade with conflicting countries is an underlying principle in the Russian politics and secures money profit for Russia. “Russia has always sold weapons to the conflicting sides in an attempt to rule out advantages and simultaneously drop hints that none of the sides’ victory is in its interests. Russia thus guides itself by it own interest, i.e. – to preserve - and why not als  to strengthen - the Russian interest in the South Caucasus,” he said in comments to 168 Zham.   According to Pavel Felengauer, a Russian military analyst, the relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan are important for Russia as the county needs the Transcaucaucus on the whole, not just separate countries.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 20:01 • 24/01 Israel approves plans for 2,500 new settlement homes in West Bank 19:34 • 24/01 Airbus warns over Brexit free movement 19:23 • 24/01 Bomb planted under state of Azerbaijan may go off at any moment – David Babayan 18:17 • 24/01 Armenia welcomes Russian capital in forming favorable investment environment – Karen Karapetyan 17:11 • 24/01 Armenia-Iran-Turkmenistan cooperation plan promising – expert 16:12 • 24/01 Puppies raise rescuers' hopes in Italy 16:11 • 24/01 Armenia’s Ombudsman informed CE Commissioner for Human Rights of Azerbaijani attacks 15:58 • 24/01 Armenia to host joint Armenian-Russian Economic Intergovernmental Council session 15:13 • 24/01 Yerevan-Tehran-Ashgabat cooperation: Armenia should pursue more active policy - expert 14:54 • 24/01 Turkish folk singer claims to be father of Adele 14:33 • 24/01 UK loses Brexit vote appeal 14:31 • 24/01 Armenia-EU agreement: negotiations nearing completion - Piotr Świtalski 14:19 • 24/01 Genes determine how young people use internet and social media 13:59 • 24/01 Azerbaijani FM starts trip to Moscow 13:55 • 24/01 Syria conflict: Astana peace talks seek to reinforce truce 13:40 • 24/01 Mel Gibson, 61, welcomes ninth child 13:27 • 24/01 Melania Trump wore $100,000 worth wedding dress in 2005 13:16 • 24/01 Armenian-Japanese cooperation discussed in Yerevan 13:08 • 24/01 Richard Mills not leaving office as US Ambassador to Armenia – statement 12:39 • 24/01 Armenia’s ex-premier to announce his secession from ruling party 12:26 • 24/01 US judge approves VW dealers $1.2 billion settlement 12:13 • 24/01 Turkey will not hand over al-Bab to Syrian government forces: deputy PM 11:48 • 24/01 New Armenian airline plan discussed in Moscow 11:27 • 24/01 US sends $221 million to Palestinians in Obama's last hours 11:11 • 24/01 Star Wars reveals Episode VIII 11:02 • 24/01 US judge backs VW dealers $1.2 billion settlement 10:51 • 24/01 Samsung blames battery faults for Galaxy Note 7 fires 10:43 • 24/01 Kuwaiti TV host sets guest on fire live on air 10:36 • 24/01 Dongfeng-41 to bring China more respect 10:20 • 24/01 Populism won't solve world's problems, says Germany’s Merkel   09:41 • 24/01 Azerbaijan shoots grenade fire on Karabakh frontline 09:23 • 24/01 Armenian member to PACE speaks of Hrant Dink, Garo Paylan at Assembly session   09:06 • 24/01 Borussia Dortmund extends contract with young Christian Pulisic 08:57 • 24/01 Azerbaijan should put up with inevitability of Karabakh recognition – Armenian deputy FM 08:33 • 24/01 US Senate confirms Mike Pompeo to be Trump's CIA director 08:16 • 24/01 Russia says it carried out joint strikes with US-led coalition in Syria, US denies reports 19:57 • 23/01 German-Turkish author of Genocide bill meets with Canadian-Armenians 19:25 • 23/01 Main political forces to maintain seats in parliament after April election - pollster 18:33 • 23/01 Stunning 'hotel room' in the Swiss Alps has no walls 18:21 • 23/01 Trump plans flurry of deals for first full week in office 18:00 • 23/01 PACE re-elects Armenian vice speaker 17:45 • 23/01 Killed Nagorno-Karabakh sergeant fatally shot by fellow serviceman 17:25 • 23/01 Australia Open: Nadal qualifies for quarter finals 17:00 • 23/01 Armenia’s Ombudsman meets with ECHR president 16:45 • 23/01 Miss Universe candidates meet Philippines’ Duterte 16:32 • 23/01 Israel opposed to jailed blogger’s extradition to Azerbaijan – ambassador 16:14 • 23/01 Passions run high at PACE over corruption charges against Luca Volontè – Armenian MP 16:03 • 23/01 We have competitive advantages to be elected to parliament – New Renaissance leader 15:33 • 23/01 Ghost gator!

The Good Canary's $199/£159 Flex installs fast, it's well designed and its app is easy to navigate. It's also a highly versatile camera that can watch over your house from pretty much anywhere. The Bad The Flex is limited to 720p HD live streaming, it has a smaller 116-degree field of view and it currently only works with Wink for smart home integrations. The Bottom Line The Canary Flex isn't perfect, but its adaptability, simple app interface and excellent design make it a great choice for anyone who needs a lot of flexibility in their home security setup. 8.2 Overall Features 7.0 Usability 8.0 Design 10.0 Performance 8.0 Review Sections Review Prices User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Appliances Smart Home Canary Flex Canary's $199/£159 Flex definitely lives up to its name. Not only is this rechargeable, battery-powered indoor/outdoor security camera portable, its strong magnetic base and swiveling body design make it extremely easy to find the right viewing angle. The app is smartly designed, too, with an activity log of motion-related video clips and auto-adjusting Home and Away security modes tied to your phone's location. You are limited to 720p video for live streaming, and the Flex currently only works with Wink on the smart home compatibility side of things. But Canary says it's working on an IFTTT channel and, in future hardware, integrations with HomeKit , Apple's Siri-based smart home platform. Factor in the Flex's many optional accessories, including a Verizon 4G LTE mount, and there are few standalone DIY security cameras that offer so many potential use cases. Look no further than the Canary Flex for an HD live streaming device that's truly flexible. Canary flexes its smart-home muscle with... See full gallery 1 - 5 of 19 Next Prev Meet the Flex The Flex is Canary's second security camera, following a successful Indiegogo campaign for its inaugural all-in-one indoor security system back in 2013. But the home security market has changed quite a bit since then. Yes, indoor high-definition live streaming cameras are still important, but many companies are introducing models that can go from your living room to your backyard with minimal effort. Enter: the Canary Flex. Take a look at what the Flex can do versus the $200/£159 Logi Circle and the $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro: Comparing rechargeable security cameras: Canary Flex Logi Circle Netgear Arlo Pro Price $199/£159 $200/£159 $250/£300 Color finish Black, white Black, white White Type Indoor/outdoor Indoor only Indoor/outdoor Power source Rechargeable battery, power adapter Rechargeable battery, power adapter Rechargeable battery, power adapter Resolution 720p HD 1080p HD 720p HD Expected battery life Two months 3 hours (12 hours in power save mode) Six months Field of view 116-degree viewing angle 135-degree viewing angle 130-degree viewing angle Live streaming Yes Yes Yes Continuous recording No No No Cloud storage Free 24-hour event-based video history (Optional 30-day event-based video history for $10 per month) Free 24-hour event-based video history (Optional 14- or 31-day event-based video history for $4 or $10 per month) Free 7-day event-based video history (Optional 30- or 60-day event-based video history for $10 or $15 per month) Local storage No No No Mobile app Yes, Android and iPhone Yes, Android and iPhone Yes, Android and iPhone Web app No Yes Yes Night vision Yes Yes Yes Alerts Motion Motion (Person alerts with Circle Safe Premium subscription) Motion and audio Activity zones No Yes No Two-way audio Yes, but Canary hasn't activated the feature yet Yes Yes Operating temperature range -4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 to 40 degrees Celsius) 32 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 40 degrees Celsius) -4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 to 40 degrees Celsius) Third-party integrations Wink No IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings Given that the Logi Circle is indoor-only, has a short battery life and doesn't work with any smart home products from other manufacturers, it really can't compete with Canary's Flex or Netgear's Arlo Pro. But, the competition gets a lot closer when you look at the Flex and the Arlo Pro. The Arlo Pro promises a longer battery life of "up to six months" compared with the Flex's two-month charge (Logi's lasted about four hours). After about a week of testing, the Netgear Arlo Pro's battery indicator still shows a full charge, while the Canary Flex is showing a slightly diminished battery around the 80 to 90 percent mark. Netgear's rechargeable indoor/outdoor camera also has a wider viewing angle and offers seven days of free cloud storage (as opposed to the Flex's 24 hours). You'll also get a web app with Netgear's camera, as well as integrations with IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings. The Flex's third-party integrations currently include Wink, although the team is working on potential IFTTT and Apple HomeKit support. Other connected cameras: Netgear's Arlo Pro camera gives rechargeable batteries a go Logi's people-detecting camera isn't sure I'm human This smart indoor security camera sees in HD Ultimately, I prefer the Flex's app interface and its fast hub-free setup -- the Arlo Pro requires the installation of a rather large hub that you connect to your router during initial configuration. The hub does have a built-in 100-decibel siren, but that might not make a difference if your router is located in your basement or some other out-of-the-way location in your house. Netgear sells its Arlo Pro cameras in one or multiunit kits with the hub (since this is a required accessory). The one camera kit costs $250 -- 50 bucks more than a standalone Canary Flex or Logi Circle.

More than a year ago, the company released version 1511 of its System Center Configuration Manager, optimizing it for Windows 10, and transitioning to Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Since then, it has received numerous updates, which have added new features such as Cloud Management Gateway, enhancements in the Software Center, and remote control optimization, among other things. Recently, Microsoft also added support for Apple's macOS Sierra in System Center Configuration Manager. Now, the company has released version 1701 of the Technical Preview branch of System Center Configuration Manager. Image via: Florian Aguettaz IT Blog As with the nomenclature of the version numbers for various other software products from Microsoft, build 1701 refers to the time of release as well - "17" corresponds to the year 2017, and "01" coincides with the first month January. The update packs a number of new features including Express files support for Windows 10 Cumulative Update, and UEFI inventory data. The full change log can be viewed below: UEFI inventory data – Hardware inventory can now determine whether the device is UEFI-enabled. Express files support for Windows 10 Cumulative Update – Configuration Manager can support Windows 10 Cumulative Update using Express files. This functionality is only supported in Windows 10 version 1607 with a Windows Update Agent update included with the updates released on January 10, 2017 (Patch Tuesday). For more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1612#express-installation-files-support-for-windows-10-updates. Validate Device Health Attestation Data via Management Point – You can now configure management points to validate health attestation reporting data for cloud or on-premises health attestation service. Updated Content Library Cleanup Tool – The command line tool (ContentLibraryCleanup.exe) used to remove content that is no longer associated with any package or application from a distribution point (orphaned content) has been updated with fixes for known issues. Host software updates on cloud-based distribution points – Beginning with this preview version, you can use a cloud-based distribution point to host a software update package. Support for Microsoft Azure Government cloud added to Operations Management Suite (OMS) Connector feature – You can now configure an OMS connector for the OMS workspace on Microsoft Azure Government cloud. Additional boundary groups improvements – Clients now find software update points using Boundary Group associations. Additionally, Microsoft has made improvements to operating system deployment based on the feedback from UserVoice. Windows 10 ADK is now tracked by build version, default boot image source path can not be configured, package ID is displayed in task sequence steps, and support for additional content has been introduced in standalone media, among other things. Update 1701 is available in the Configuration Manager console of version 1610. Microsoft has also encouraged users to contact the company in order to provide feedback or report any issues.

Partner Voices Subscribe to San Diego's top stories. Sign Up By Lisa Halverstadt | January 21, 2017 Pension debts are skyrocketing again years after a pension crisis sent city leaders into a tailspin. New reports reveal city and county pension fund deficits have surged 90 percent in two years, reaching nearly $7 billion– even despite a slew of reforms, Ashly McGlone reports. The reasons: longer life expectancies, poor market gains and across-the-board salary hikes after years of status quo. Now, McGlone finds, the city’s talking about trimming each department’s budget by 3.5 percent while the county says it’s found ways to avoid cuts.

State Sens. Toni Atkins and Scott Wiener introduced a bill this week to open up more tax-payment possibilities for cannabis business operators, who often go to great lengths just to pay their taxes. VOSD contributor Sebastian Montes explains the proposed Atkins-Wiener solution and Sara Libby and Ry Rivard round up other Golden State government news – including plans to fight new President Donald Trump – in the latest Sacramento Report. • State Assembly Democrats had their own message for Californians during Trump’s inauguration ceremony. Special Podcast: CA Ladies Get in Formation A day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, scores of San Diego women are set to hit the streets in protest – and VOSD decided to podcast about it. Libby caught up with San Diego Women’s March organizers Alex Zaragoza and Eboney Steward while Kinsee Morlan dropped in on a poster-making party and a “Nasty Woman” art show. VOSD Podcast: Padres Chief Talks Chargers As San Diego sports fans mourn the loss of the Chargers, the executive chairman of the group that owns the Padres is offering tissues. Ron Fowler joined Andrew Keatts and Scott Lewis this week for a wide-ranging interview covering everything from the Padres’ plans to fill the Chargers’ void to what the city can do to address its homelessness crisis. The podcast crew also honored former state legislator Lucy Killea and roasted outgoing District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis. • The Kept Faith podcast co-host Dallas McLaughlin is among the Padres fans displeased with the Padres’ new uniforms. In a new story, he talked to the Padres’ chief marketing officer to find out why the team went with uniforms one critic described as “devoid of all imagination and creativity.” In Other News • Apple has sued telecom giant Qualcomm, alleging it’s charging royalties it’s not owed days after a separate Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleged bad behavior on patent licensing. (Bloomberg News) • The deputy district attorney’s political action committee is set to discuss endorsing a replacement for Dumanis despite the fact that no one’s publicly announced plans to run for district attorney. (Union-Tribune) • The city’s decision to axe plans to build bike lanes on El Cajon Boulevard as part of a plan to reconfigure a stretch of the busy thoroughfare has disappointed advocates hoping for a more dramatic overhaul.

There’s Already a Challenge to the ‘LA Chargers’ Trademark – and It’s Not From the Dodgers The Chargers’ application to trademark “LA Chargers” ran into an issue even before the team announced it will move to Los Angeles. (David Lizerbram) 2. The Mayor Fumbled in the Chargers Game but It’s Not His Fault They’re Leaving The mayor is not to blame for losing the Chargers. But he and others consistently got what was going on wrong. (Scott Lewis) 3. How the Spanos Family Built a Fortune Selling Bologna Sandwiches to Mexican Farmworkers The Spanos family, which owns the Chargers, is worth $2.4 billion. As the team asks the public to help fund a new stadium, many have wondered where the Spanos family fortune came from. For Alex Spanos, it started with bologna sandwiches and Mexican farmworkers. The family has long faced questions, in fact, of whether Spanos helped exploit farmworkers in the notorious Bracero program that started nearly 70 years ago. (Ry Rivard) 4. Opinion: The Chargers Stopped Caring About San Diego Two Years Ago I was tired of listening to Mark Fabiani. For more than an hour he arrogantly presented a series of rigid deal points on behalf of Chargers owner Dean Spanos to Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s newly formed stadium task force. I had heard enough so I quietly opened my laptop to check Twitter. What I saw surprised me. (Tony Manolatos) 5. Is the Drought Over? Depends on Which One We’re Talking About It’s still too soon to know if the drought is truly over. We can’t predict the future, for one thing. Nor can we agree on what is meant by “drought.” President-elect Donald Trump, the California Department of Water Resources, the U.S. Drought Monitor and some top climate scientists all have different definitions.

However, we could be on the cusp of a big move in stocks now that we are in the thick of fourth-quarter earnings. Initial results have been mixed. On the bull side, the so-called “earnings recession” is over and we are on track for the second consecutive quarter of earnings growth since results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. Also, we’ve seen rosy reports from some of the world’s biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.43% and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.21% hinting at a cyclical recovery. On the other hand, those Goldman and J.P. Morgan earnings reports trounced expectations thanks in large part to trading profits — and in the case of Goldman, revenue for the full year was actually down compared with 2015. Furthermore, as I pointed out in my last column making the bullish case for gold, several companies have offered nasty guidance going forward even if 2016 was a decent year. It’s no wonder, then, that this mixed earnings record has prompted middling performance for the market. Yes, we are very much in a wait-and-see period regarding Trump’s policies, but investors also lack clarity on the earnings picture. That could all change when Big Tech reports earnings in the next few weeks, however. After all, the tech sector represents the lion’s share of most portfolios. Roughly 21% of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.66%  consists of tech stocks, and a whopping 53% of the Nasdaq-100 NDX, +0.70%   is weighted toward the sector. As for individual names, big-name companies like Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.09% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.56%  remain old favorites for stock-pickers of all stripes. That means a lot is riding on how the sector performs — and depending on your personal portfolio, one big report could make or break your 2017 returns. Here's what Trump means for the tech industry(1:34) The incoming Trump administration has given Silicon Valley a headache, mainly due to potential plans to penalize companies that manufacture goods in China. But not all of Trump's proposed policies may have a harmful effect on the tech sector. Here’s what to expect from six top tech stocks set to report in the coming weeks. Each of these names trades daily volume of about 10 million shares or higher on a normal day and has a market cap of more than $170 billion, so you can bet they will be the tech stocks everyone is talking about: Amazon Amazon powered higher for much of 2016 but ran out of gas in October after an earnings miss in its third-quarter report. Also discouraging was softer-than-expected numbers in North America and a weak outlook for its all-important holiday quarter. In a nutshell, its fast-growing Amazon Web Services arm can’t prop up the stock all by itself, and CEO Jeff Bezos continues to invest the profits from AWS in other bets at an aggressive clip. This reinforces the narrative of last quarter: Amazon may be a great bet long-term, but it isn’t putting up the numbers right now to make it a buy vs. the field. Amazon reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, and should hold the line but probably won’t break out or break down. I say hold. Read: Amazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did Alphabet Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.56% GOOGL, +0.60% saw strong results in the third quarter, and topped it off with a $7 billion buyback plan. That’s only the second time in history that the company has authorized a repurchase plan of any kind. The initial reaction immediately after the October report was negative, but Alphabet has since corrected that trend dramatically; since Dec. 2, the tech stock has run up almost 7% vs. a 3% gain for the S&P 500. That momentum bodes very well as we approach Alphabet’s next report on Jan. 26. Admittedly, the earnings history of this tech giant is anything but consistent, so it’s quite possible we’ll see another stumble here. However, results across 2016 show the core Google business is strong and growing — and recent product rollouts including mobile-friendly expanded text ads could fuel additional gains. I call this one a buy. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. INTC, +2.31%  have been trying to break out of a rut since 2014, running into a wall every time they get to about $37 or so. And unfortunately, with shares once again at the high end of their range, this is not going to be the quarter Intel breaks out to new highs. Intel slipped significantly after the company’s last report featured disappointing guidance. Cost-cutting measures including the reduction of 12,000 positions won’t be completed until this summer and won’t yield savings in this upcoming report, even while restructuring charges still weigh down results. Throw in a miss from Intel’s high-margin data center group last quarter, and the deck is stacked against this chipmaker when it reports earnings on Jan. 26. This one is a sell. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. Microsoft Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.89% is an old tech name that is out of favor with some investors, but perhaps that’s because they weren’t paying attention in 2016. Shares outperformed the market in 2016 with a more than 20% gain, including setting a new all-time high after its third-quarter report. Those results added to the technology giant’s past success, and as it approaches its next earnings report Microsoft is riding nine consecutive quarters of meeting or exceeded expectations. Analysts have been very impressed with how Microsoft has transitioned to cloud computing, and have been raising their targets lately in the wake of results. Expect earnings to validate that optimism when Microsoft reports on Jan. 26. The stock, in my opinion, is a buy. Apple In 2016, Apple stock did quite well even if the fundamentals weren’t exactly thrilling. Shares gained about 20% on the year despite the company logging its first year-over-year decline in revenue since 2001 as the iPhone reached its saturation point. Worse, in its October report, Apple took a drubbing after both the top and bottom lines slipped year-over-year even as competitor Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. SSNLF, +12.00% 005930, +0.26%  was suffering from bad press and recalls for its fire-prone Note 7 smartphone. Its forward guidance disappointed to boot. However, it’s important to note that Apple has not been labeled a dying tech dinosaur nor have investors abandoned ship. Shares remain under their 2015, yes, but that means a lot of this negativity is priced in and subdued earnings are expected. That’s hardly a reason to buy and be a bull going into Apple earnings on Tuesday, Jan. 31, but it’s certainly not a reason to sell. If you own this stock — particularly for long-term dividend growth — just sit tight. If not, wait and see what transpires. This is a hold. Facebook Facebook Inc. FB, +0.34%  is off to a good start in 2017, up by double digits in the New Year even as the S&P 500 has gone nowhere. It’s not hard to see why, as the already dominant social media platform continues to grow and could close in on 2 billion monthly active users this year — and that’s in spite of being blocked in China! As users grow, profitability is growing briskly too; Facebook should report earnings growth of almost 80% this fiscal year when it reports fourth-quarter numbers on Feb. 1. Facebook has only missed earnings estimates once since its IPO, and this strong track record coupled with consistent outperformance makes it hard to bet against this digital media giant. The stock is a buy.

Apple shared a statement with several news sites on Friday announcing the lawsuit, which argued that Qualcomm used its position as the sole supplier of a key iPhone component to drive up patent licensing fees. This morning Qualcomm responded in a statement on its website in which it claimed that Apple "intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations". "While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated.Qualcomm was the sole supplier of LTE modems used in iPhones up until 2016, when Intel also began providing the component with the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple claims Qualcomm forced it to use the LTE chips and pay back a percentage of the selling price of the phone in return for access to its patents. Apple wants $1 billion in rebate payments, which were withheld by Qualcomm after Apple became involved in an antitrust investigation against the company in South Korea.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: Marques Brownlee, YouTube Google’s Pixel is still the hottest Android phone in town Chris Smith @chris_writes January 17th, 2017 at 9:06 PM Share Tweet Google’s pair of Pixel phones is a remarkable success for the company. Sure, they may have some flaws, but they’re still the hottest Android devices in town — if you can get one. A new report indicates that Pixel “demand is exceeding supply” at Verizon. Don't Miss: You can buy a handgun that looks like an iPhone, and cops are worried Big Red is still the only US carrier selling Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone, and the investment has been paying off for the company. Verizon committed a $25 million marketing budget for the phone after its launch and continues to promote the phone, although spending has cooled. According to Fierce Wireless, Wave7 Research data shows that the Pixel phones remained hot-selling devices even after the holidays. “Along with Apple, Samsung, and Droid, the Pixel/XL continues to be heavily advertised—on an equal footing with top OEMs—at a price point of $10 (Pixel) or $15 (XL) per month with trade-in of a high-end smartphone,” the firm noted. “It is clear that demand is exceeding supply.” The firm conducted a survey of 50 carrier stores last week, concluding that the Pixel accounted for 9.5% of smartphone sales at Verizon last month. And it’s not just Verizon subscribers that are buying the phone. The Pixel and Pixel XL can be used with other US carriers, and T-Mobile specifically targeted the handsets with a promotion not too long ago. “AT AT&T/T-Mobile/Sprint stores, 39% of reps (13 of 33) are aware of an average of ~2 Pixel activations each at these 13 stores,” Wave7 Research wrote. “Most Pixel XL SKUs are shipping in March and most Pixel SKUs are out of stock as well.” Comparatively, the iPhone 7 remained strong, Wave7 said, as the iPhone’s share of sales was up at every carrier other than Sprint. The iPhone 7 is slightly outselling the iPhone 7 Plus, the research company noted. “Sales of the iPhone 7 exceeded sales of the iPhone 7 Plus at all four carriers, but the gap narrowed significantly from prior months, now that iPhone 7 Plus supply is greatly improved,” Wave7 said.
