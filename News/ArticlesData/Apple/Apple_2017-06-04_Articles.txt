Photo courtesy of Apple. The long anticipated Apple rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, dubbed HomePod, has arrived. The centerpiece unveiling at Monday's WWDC keynote presentation, the HomePod is a predictably good looking and well designed device, and Apple CEO Tim Cook says, for one thing, the sound quality for music is going to blow everyone away. The New York Times notes that the biggest casualty of Apple entering the voice-enabled home speaker realm may end up being Sonos, whose app-controlled, internet-enabled stereo devices remain popular in-home speaker options. But with a Siri-controlled Apple device that also can send text, provide traffic and weather info, control home lighting, and play Apple Music, Sonos better watch out, not to mention Amazon, among whose Echo owners are likely a lot of iPhone owners and Apple fans. And as The Verge mentions, the HomePod also has a “Musicologist” feature that "works with Apple Music to stream the music you ask the speaker’s built-in Siri to play. [And] You can even ask more complex, music-related questions like 'Who’s the drummer in this song?' or 'What album came out on this day 20 years ago?'" As CNet points out, this also means that Apple's HomeKit software now has its own standalone device, meaning that it could attract Android users and others who previously did not want to use Siri through an iPhone or iPad. The HomePod will hit shelves in December, and is priced at $349, and apparently comes with companion speakers for creating surround-sound. The Verge runs down all the other big announcements from today's keynote, and those include a new iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch screen, the new iOS 11 with improved camera and Apple Maps software, upgrades to Siri, and a powerful new iMac Pro on steroids that can support up to 18 core processors and is priced at $5,000. Also, in important news for the upcoming macOS release, High Sierra, there will be an update to Safari that helps block site trackers and autoplaying videos  something that seems to be an epidemic on media sites right now and it drives me, personally, insane. Below is The Verge's 19-minute edit of the full keynote. There's also an update to WatchOS with a new Siri interface and a new Music app for the Apple Watch, and laptops are getting updates, with a new faster 21.5-inch MacBook Air with 4K high resolution that will start at around $1,300, and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at $1,300.

It would seem that now is the time d timing since Apple’s first original video shows are being release soon over the net few weeks • iTunes / Apple Music - Both services feel clunky compared the sleekness that we're used to Apple delivering. If someone did a customer satisfaction survey, we suspect that Spotify would top Apple. This may just be wishful thinking, but this could be the time that both see an upgrade.  • Siri Speaker - Apple's voice assistant Siri is almost certainly getting a major update.  And this could well be when a Siri Speaker that competes with  Amazon Echo and Google Home.  If so, will it just play Apple Music on demand or will Spotify and others be invited to the party?

 Apple's app store downloads are soaring Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool Jun. 5, 2017, 8:59 PM 3,163 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Jim Urquhart As Apple's iPhone sales growth leveled off in recent years, management has been attempting to shift investor attention toward the tech giant's rapidly growing services segment. The segment offers continued growth prospects and a more reliable revenue stream than Apple's more volatile hardware sales. While Apple's services segment is benefiting from a broad base of growth drivers, including App Store sales, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and more, App Store sales serve as the segment's primary catalyst. That's why when Apple shares an update on its App Store business, investors may want to take note. On Thursday, Apple shared an update on its App Store, including the announcement that all-time App Store earnings paid to developers hit $70 billion. Here's what investors should know. Still a major catalyst Overall, Apple's latest data on its App Store continues to drive home one important point for Apple investors: The App Store is more integral to Apple's business than ever before. Consider these takeaways from Apple's App Store update: All-time gross App Store revenue, including Apple's 30% cut and developers' 70% cut, has now hit $100 billion. Apple's cut of App Store Revenue is about $30 billion. Developer earnings from the App Store are up 40% since August 2016, growing from about $50 billion to $70 billion. App Store downloads are up more than 70% in the trailing 12 months compared to the preceding 12-month period. In its update on App Store sales, Apple also provided some context on App Store categories driving this growth. Gaming and Entertainment, thanks to "breakout hits" like Pokemon GO and Super Mario and streaming-TV subscriptions like Netflix and Hulu, are the top-grossing App Store categories, Apple said. Further, thanks to Apple's more accommodating policies on recurring subscriptions (the policies were revamped last year), subscriptions have now expanded to every app category and are up 58% year over year. Why it matters Investors are increasingly looking to Apple's services segment as the next frontier for the tech giant's growth. In Apple's most recent quarter, services revenue increased 18% year over year, helping make up for some of the iPhone segment's much slower growth. IPhone revenue was down 1% year over year. Of course, Apple's services segment is much smaller than Apple's iPhone segment. In the second quarter of 2017, for instance, services revenue was $7 billion and iPhone revenue was $33 billion. But, with the help of surging App Store revenue, which was up 40% in Apple's second quarter, Apple's services business is growing as a percentage of total revenue. In Q2, services accounted for 13.3% of total revenue, up from 11.8% of revenue in the same quarter in 2016. Investors will watch for Apple's App Store to continue helping the tech giant's services business grow into a more meaningful operating segment for the company. Looking out to 2020, Apple believes its services business can grow to twice the size it was at the end of 2016 -- and Apple's going to need App Store revenue to continue growing nicely for this to happen.

Augmented reality is coming to hundreds of millions of iOS devices with a new platform for developers to build apps that let users place virtual content on top of real-world scenes. CoreML gives developers on-device machine learning capabilities so they can easily make apps that will predict, learn and become more intelligent.

Professional portrait mode With Apple iOS 11, Portrait Mode images can be taken with optical image stabilization, True Tone flash and HDR, so every shot looks even more professional. Live Photos are more expressive with new Loop and Bounce effects that create continuous video loops, while Long Exposure can capture time and movement. In Photos, Memory movies are optimized to play in both portrait and landscape orientation, and more memories, such as photos of pets or birthdays, are automatically created. With iOS 11, Apple introduces a new technology called High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) that reduces the file size of every photo taken with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple Pay Apple Pay users will be able to make and receive payments with friends and family quickly, easily and securely. They can send money and get paid right in Messages, or tell Siri to pay someone, using the credit and debit cards they already have in Wallet. When users get paid, they receive the money in their new Apple Pay Cash account. They can use the money instantly to send to someone, make purchases using Apple Pay in stores, apps and on the web, or transfer it from Apple Pay Cash to their bank account.

Still, some traders are worried about this stock-market rally as a large chunk of this year's gains have come from just five large-cap tech stocks. Fred Imbert | @foimbert Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:28 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Stocks close lower as Apple falls on rare downgrade    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:01 PM ET | 00:39 U.S. equities closed slightly lower on Monday, but held near record levels, while shares of Apple declined on a rare downgrade. The S&P 500 slipped 1 percent, with materials and utilities lagging. The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 20 points, with Apple contributing the most losses. The Nasdaq composite traded 0.1 percent lower after reaching an all-time intraday high. Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth Management, said two key elements supporting this market are the relative value of stocks versus other alternatives, like bonds, and strong earnings growth. "Clearly the market is more expensive compared to a few years ago, but earnings have justified those valuations," he said. Still, some traders are worried about this stock-market rally as a large chunk of this year's gains have come from just five large-cap tech stocks. "The averages are making new highs but that's because of a handful of stocks. If you take those out, we'd probably be lower," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Spencer Platt | Getty Images NYSE Trader on the floor The S&P tech sector has handily outperformed in 2017, advancing 22.5 percent. On Monday, the sector rose 0.1 percent, but a decline in Apple shares capped gains. Apple's stock fell 1 percent after Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves downgraded the stock to sector weight from overweight. In a Sunday note, Hargreaves said the stock is not pricing in potential risks, like supply issues with the new iPhone 8. "We believe AAPL anticipates strong performance in the iPhone 8 cycle, while providing relatively little weight to risks through the cycle or the potential for iPhone sales to decline in FY19," he said. Investors also kept an eye on Apple's annual developers' conference on Monday, where the revealed several new products. Stocks traded in a narrow range for most of Monday's session, with the S&P moving just 0.21 percent. "There's not a lot of economic news to really decipher," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, noting the market will remain in a "wait-and-see mode for a few weeks until we get peak second-quarter earnings." In economic news, the IHS Markit U.S. services PMI for May came in at 53.6, up from 53.1 in April, marking "the largest rise in overall activity since February," IHS said in a release. The May ISM nonmanufacturing index, meanwhile, came in at 56.9, just below a consensus estimate of 57.0. Overseas, European stocks traded lower as investors digested a terrorist attack in London that killed at least seven people on Saturday night. The FSTE 100 fell 0.27 percent, while the French CAC 40 dropped 0.66 percent. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.1 percent. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said that it's time to step up the fight against Islamist extremism in the wake of the new attack. "It is time to say enough is enough," she said. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.25 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 21,184.04, with Apple leading decliners and Wal-Mart outperforming.

HomePod a “Breakthrough” Smart Speaker Apple noted the growing popularity of wireless home audio and smart speakers, but made the point that current offerings are lacking. Called out by name in the WWDC 2017 presentation were Sonos and the Amazon Echo. Sonos — the market leader for wireless multi-room audio — was noted for offering speakers that lack any “smart” capabilities. Amazon’s Echo was singled out as offering poor quality audio. The HomePod is described as a “breakthrough” device that delivers high quality audio along with spatial awareness, smart features and integration with streaming audio. In other words, Apple is positioning it to take on Sonos in audio quality, while offering the smarts of the Amazon Echo, combining the two approaches in a single product. Apple HomePod Key Specs: Array of 7 tweeters (each with its own amplifier), upward-facing 4-inch high excursion woofer Tweeters support beam-forming 360-degree audio Apple A8 CPU 6 directional microphone array with echo cancellation 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MIMO Designed for Siri, Apple Music, HomeKit Multi-speaker configuration support 5.6-inches tall, available in white and space gray mesh fabric cover $349 High Performance Audio with Smarts Apple is touting the fact that the HomePod is packed with drivers, delivering superior audio to the Amazon Echo and competitors like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home. But the company is also touting its intelligence (the HomePod is powered by an Apple A8 chip), as helping to boost audio performance compared to Sonos. AAPL says the HomePod does real-time acoustic modelling, scanning the room it’s in and using beam-forming technology to shape audio based on variables like room size and its position. AAPL says it can essentially act as a virtual surround sound system; set up two HomePods and they automatically work together. Using the New AirPLay 2 wireless standard, multiple HomePods can also be used for Sonos-style multi-room audio. Apple Music + Siri Control Naturally, HomePod is designed around two of AAPL’s key services: Siri and Apple Music. With Apple Music integration, the smart speaker has 40 million songs on tap. Siri can help the user choose music (what AAPL called the speaker’s “musicologist”), including recommending tracks. But Siri voice control is also the key to taking on the Amazon Echo. The HomePod features Apple HomeKit integration, so Siri can be used for tasks like turning on smart lights or adjusting the thermostat. And, like Siri on the iPhone, AAPL’s personal digital assistant can be asked questions about the weather, traffic and pretty much anything else. Apple is big on privacy, so whenever Siri is active, the top of the speaker displays a “Siri” animation, and AAPL employs end-to-end encryption and anonymous IDs for any queries. Two things the HomePod is not: portable (there’s no battery) and Bluetooth (Wi-Fi only). It’s meant to be set up in a home and used by the regular occupants as opposed to carried around and casually connected to by anyone with a smartphone. When and How Much? AAPL says the Siri speaker will cost $349. It starts shipping in the U.S, U.K. and Australia in December and will roll out to other countries later.

Seven tweeters align the bottom of the device with precision acoustic horns. One big woofer serves up the equalized vibrations needed for rich bass and percussion. The device is powered by an Apple A8 chip (perhaps this is why the iPhone 6 is back in some areas) that can focus on beamforming that can take main vocals, backing vocals and the track and give a mix that can be controlled to the note. Two HomePods can work in synchronization to amplify that effect. Siri responds to your queries through the six microphones, even through loud music playing. Apple Music serves up the 40 million songs — probably an incentive for you to become one of the more than 27 million subscribers and counting. Other audio bits are also available for streaming like news, podcasts, time-based apps and translation. HomeKit control is also available, thanks to the power of Siri. Apple doesn’t log anything until the HomePod recognizes “Hey Siri.” The transmission is encrypted and anonymously tagged. The speaker, in White and Space Gray, is being worked on for December shipping times in the US, UK and Australia for $349 or local equivalents.

Andrew Cunningham - Jun 5, 2017 11:51 pm UTC reader comments 121 Share this story The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Andrew Cunningham In profile; note the headphone jack.

Note the new 64GB base capacity and 512GB peak capacity. Andrew Cunningham I have seen the new iPad Pros, and they are about what you'd expect, not that that's a bad thing. Since the "hands on" process is basically the same as handling any other iPad, let's focus on answering questions. The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the easiest to describe, since its physical design is the same as the original model. It's still a 0.27-inch (6.9mm) thick, 1.49 pound (677g) tablet that looks like a stretched-out version of the iPad design Apple has been selling since 2013 or so. The difference is that some of the features introduced in last year's 9.7-inch iPad Pro weren't ready for the first 12.9-inch version. That list of features includes: Apple's top-tier mobile camera. The old iPad Pro used Apple's "good enough" 8MP camera, the same one from the $329 iPad and a few other products. The new one uses the exact same camera and ISP as the iPhone 7, which means it can take "wide color" photos and shoot 4K video. The wide color display. This has also shown up in other Apple products, including recent iMacs, the iPhone 7, and the iPhone 7 Plus. The "True Tone" display. Formerly exclusive to the 9.7-inch iPad, this is a system of sensors that detects the tone of your ambient light and adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match. This is on by default but easy to disable. Further Reading9.7-inch iPad Pro review: What makes something “Pro” anyway? The 10.5-inch iPad Pro has all of these features, too—the new models are more in sync with each other than the first two, since their releases weren't staggered. And design-wise, though the ratio of bezel to screen obviously differs, both include Touch ID, a four-speaker sound system, a camera bump, a Smart Connector, and (yes) a headphone jack. The two tablets also share other new features. Most prominent is the A10X Fusion chip, an SoC with a six-core CPU and a 12-core GPU. Of those six CPU cores, three are high-performance cores and three are low-power cores, mirroring the big.LITTLE configuration we've seen in lots of other ARM SoCs in Android phones for the last few years. The A10 Fusion includes two high-performance cores and two low-power cores, but the operating system only sees two logical CPU cores—sending specific tasks to specific cores is handled in the background, and it's not something the software is aware of. Likewise, I assume that the A10X is effectively a tri-core CPU, like the Apple A8X before it. We don't know this chip's clock speed, and we don't know how much RAM either tablet has (I would guess 4GB for both models, but that's based on a hunch and not actual data). But Apple says the A10X is around 30 percent faster than the dual-core A9X in the old iPad Pros. Some of that increase may come from architectural improvements, but most of it will come from the presence of that third processor core. The GPU is apparently 40 percent faster, which will help keep those new 120Hz displays fed with frames. Speaking of those "ProMotion" screens, I can report that 120Hz scrolling and animations look just as lovely and smooth as Apple says they do, though it's completely impossible to convey unless you see it in person. Your device's screen is probably running at a paltry 60Hz, incapable of showing off the new iPad screen in its full glory. Changes for the 10.5-inch iPad Finally, let's talk about the 10.5-inch iPad specifically. It's just a tiny bit taller and wider than the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (9.4 and 6.6 inches for the old Pro compared to 9.8 and 6.8 for the new one), but it retains the same thickness and weight, which contributes to an overall impression that it's about the same size as the older iPad Pro. Apple has used that extra width to create a full-sized Smart Keyboard to replace the reduced-size one that paired with the 9.7-inch Pro. The keys are still canvas covered, and they retain the shallow-but-clicky feel of Apple's other butterfly-switch keyboards. The typing experience is not so much radically changed as it is slightly more comfortable. With the new iPad Pros, Apple hasn't reinvented the category, but it has put some much-needed space between the $329 iPad at the entry level (still a good deal) and the $649 iPad Pro lineup. The 9.7-inch Pro was better than the $329 iPad, but it wasn't so much better that most people could justify paying nearly twice as much; the 10.5-inch iPad adds enough that, for particularly heavy users, you could justify the extra cost. The only missing piece of the puzzle right now is iOS 11, which includes new multitasking capabilities that will help the Pro hardware better realize its multitasking potential. We'll be spending more time with the iPad Pros in our full review, where we'll be able to perform our standard benchmarking and battery testing and give you some impressions based on more than a few minutes of use. But the short story is you don't really need more than a few minutes—these are iPad Pros, and they're unlikely to move anyone who already thinks that the words "iPad" and "Pro" don't belong next to each other.

Compatible with other HomeKit accessories, and pre-baked with a large dose of Siri, the HomePod represents Apple's take on Alexa. Here's what I thought of it. Apple tellingly led with the ear when it announced the HomePod at WWDC 2017, pitching it as a reinvention of the home speaker first – virtual assistant second. When I spent a few minutes with the HomePod in the demo area, I was able to get a good look at both the black and white models of the speaker-slash-Siri-box. The mesh-covered design certainly foregrounds this emphasis on sound; it looks like a Mac Pro that’s decided to join a band. Within its squat body, the HomePod hides an array of speakers. There are seven tweeters, arrayed around the speaker’s base, along with a 4in bass driver that fires upwards, and six microphones which, like the Amazon Echo, allow the HomePod to pick up your voice as music is playing and from across the room. Size-wise, it’s somewhere between the Amazon Echo and Google Home, at just under 7in tall. And like those other devices, the aesthetic is innocuous, mantelpiece fare, although the mesh covering gives it a characteristic, sound-system appearance. At first glance, it looks like a bulkier sibling of the UE WonderBoom Bluetooth speaker. Indeed, it’s not until you notice the throbbing light on the HomePod’s top that you get a hint of its full, home assistant capabilities. This takes on the appearance of the waveform you see when activating Siri on iPhone and, presumably, it moves as Siri speaks. I say presumably, as the demo area didn’t give press an opportunity to interact with the HomePod. Because of this, it’s impossible at this stage to tell how well Siri behaves. According to Apple, the device will provide updates on news, sports and weather, and work with HomeKit to control smart home devices. Siri will also keep its ears to itself, not sending any data to Apple’s servers until the user says “Hey Siri” and then only with an anonymous encrypted Siri ID. Of course, how all of this will work in practice is something we’ll need to explore after spending more time with the HomePod. There’s an A8 chip inside the HomePod, which does all sorts of clever stuff to cancel echo and distortion and tune audio to the acoustics of a given space. You can even use two of the devices in tandem and they’ll adapt their sound to work in harmony. After the morning session, I had a chance to listen to the HomePod, comparing its audio against that of the Amazon Echo and the Sonos Play 3. I can say that Apple's efforts were hands-down superior, with the tinny Echo falling particularly short against the HomePod's lush, textured sound. After hearing a variety of pop and hip-hop tracks, Apple seems to have done a stellar job in separating direct and ambient layers. There's an emphasis on bass that brings to mind Beats, but even at its heaviest there was definition between highs and lows that made the music bloom across the space.    See related  HomePod is Apple’s answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home Apple’s iPad Pro family just got a middle brother Exactly what you’ll be listening to on the HomePod may have some restrictions. According to Apple, the HomePod is “designed to work with an Apple Music subscription”. Because the HomePod works with AirPlay, there's nothing to stop you from broadcasting Spotify from your iPhone, but it isn't clear how this will work with Siri. It might be the case that asking Siri to search and play select tracks will only work with Apple Music, although we'll need to play around with the HomePod to see if this is the case.  At $349, the HomePod is a considerably more expensive option than both the Amazon Echo and Google Home, although it’s clearly aiming to justify this with a focus on high-quality sound. There’s also the Apple name, and if you’ve already bought into the Apple ecosystem this box might be the Siri-string to tie your devices together. How well it does that will need to be judged at a later date, but for now the HomePod looks to be an attractive, premium-speaker counterpoint to existing home assistants.

He pointed out that it was a ‘fully baked’ name. Craig mentioned that it was smoking fast. The crowd giggled. This was Apple’s World Wide Developer’s Conference and here’s Craig Federighi dropping pot jokes to introduce the newest ‘latest greatest tech thing ever’ on stage. The smart money says he simply wanted to give the room an air of “okay, we’ve had our fun, now back to the interesting stuff”. But that’s just what they want you to think Studies showing that pot makes you paranoid notwithstanding, I submit that Apple isn’t trolling the creative product-namers of the world. Instead – it’s painfully obvious that California and Apple are in cahoots. When Apple filed a patent earlier this year, it wasn’t for any of that fancy stuff they showed off on stage at WWDC2017. That patent, dear reader, was for a vaporizer. I didn’t have to google it to figure out that a vaporizer is something that is only used by two types of people: those who use vaporizers for marijuana, and those who use them for other purposes. We’ll immediately dismiss the second group. What we expect from Apple’s (entirely fictional) iOSVape The world’s first iOSVape, I predict,  will be a “volcano” style machine that allows you to vape with the precision that only the world-class engineers at Apple can create. It gives you the full support of Apple Care, provided you read the entire terms of service agreement. You can also ask it questions like “how do you convert dollars to grams?” The device automatically texts Turtle from Entourage when you run out. The iOSVape, California Governor’s edition comes with a 24k gold finish and support for the all new Siri – who is now voiced by Seth Rogen and scripted by Kevin Smith. What the fuck is Apple thinking? Satire aside – When the head of Apple software engineering is making pot jokes to win over a crowd of app developers the world has become an insane, awesome, terrifying, beautiful place.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing macOS 10.13 High Sierra Focuses on Performance, Launches Fall 2017 macOS 10.13 High Sierra Focuses on Performance, Launches Fall 2017 By Grant Brunner on June 5, 2017 at 4:50 pm Comment On stage at today’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote, Apple SVP Craig Federighi gave us a glimpse at the next version of macOS: High Sierra. Drug jokes aside, this derivative name harkens back to the days of Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion — polish-focused releases that eschew loads of flashy new features in favor of performance and quality of life improvements. Some new and notable user-facing features include HEVC video support, enhanced privacy controls for Safari, faster web rendering, better text-to-speech, and more sophisticated editing tools included in the Photos app. To be sure, those are all excellent improvements, but we’re obsessed with two features in particular: The new file system and VR support. File systems are easy to forget about. They’re not sexy like virtual reality or sassy AI secretaries, but they play a major role in the overall computing experience. Speed, resilience against corruption, data security, and ease of search are all impacted by which file system you’re using, and it’s clear that HFS+ has overstayed its welcome. In the late aughts, Apple flirted with ZFS from Oracle, but it sadly fizzled out. However, Apple finally announced last year that their own in-house replacement (dubbed Apple File System or APFS) would be coming soon. When High Sierra ships this year, APFS will be the default file system for new installations, and we’re disproportionately excited about it. Many people won’t even notice the change. But the move to a proper modern file system is much appreciated by Mac nerds like us. Changing or inspecting large files and folders in the Finder has long been painfully slow, but APFS’s improvements in these and other areas will go a long way toward keeping us from yanking out fists full of hair. While early virtual reality devkits had decent Mac support, the consumer-focused products have been almost entirely Windows-focused. With High Sierra and a string of new high-end Macs, consumer VR will finally be a reality for Apple diehards. Metal, Apple’s answer to the likes of the Vulkan API, is being updated with improved support for external GPUs, machine learning tasks, and virtual reality. And since Metal 2 is doing a fair bit of the heavy lifting for VR, Apple is hoping that devs will be willing to put in some extra effort to support macOS as well. Both the Unity and Unreal 4 engines will support VR on the Mac from the get-go, and the HTC Vive is the headset of choice. Oculus will almost certainly make its way to the Mac as well, but Facebook and Microsoft’s partnership might make that a bit more difficult. Interestingly, Final Cut Pro X is getting thrown into the VR discussion as well, so it seems that Apple remembers fondly the good ol’ days of QuickTime VR. And since Apple has historically been lukewarm (at best) to video games, we’d expect a focus on 360 video and VR “experiences.” If you’re running particularly old hardware, you can rest easy. You won’t be able to run a VR helmet, but the minimum requirements seem to have stayed the same as 10.12. MacBooks and iMacs from 2009 and on are supported, and 2010 models of the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro are still good to go. As this very post was written on a 2011-era iMac, we’re pretty stoked about the long-lived support. Developers will have access to the beta OS today, and the public can sign up for beta access later this month. And as expected, the full-fledged release will hit this fall at no additional cost.

It sets the template for the future of development an Apple’s many platforms, and considering that Apple’s devices attract the top developers in the world, everyone watches the event very closely. Traditionally, WWDC is also where Apple announces updates to their software and Mac hardware. It’s the developers, after all, who need to worry about such things. At the outset, Tim Cook promised that this would be the largest WWDC ever. Considering the number, and magnitude of the announcements, this was no understatement. In brief, here’s everything that the iPhone giant unveiled at the keynote: The iMac: Slightly faster than before The iMac line received some minor updates, notably the bump up to seventh generation Intel Core processors. These processors not only improve performance in every department by a around 5-15 percent, they also include new features like hardware HEVC support, which can dramatically cut down on the resources needed for 4K video playback and rendering. Of course, Kaby-Lake also means that Macs can now support more than 16 GB of RAM. The iMacs all get Kaby-Lake processors, brighter displays, Thunderbolt 3, faster storage, and in the case of the 4K and 5K iMacs, discrete GPUs. Prices start at $1,299. The new SSDs are said to be 50 percent faster. The 4K and 5K models will support Radeon Pro-500 series of graphics chips. MacBook and MacBook Pro: Slightly faster, again The new MacBooks get a bump up to Kaby-Lake. The same benefits that we mentioned in the above section still apply here, with the added mention mobile devices can get more battery life out of Kaby-Lake devices. Prices start at $1,299. In better news, Apple has finally decided to see sense and has updated the MacBook Air. All the devices are available for pre-order today, except in countries that aren’t the US, UK or Australia. watchOS 4: More play, less work watchOS 4 is getting a bunch of new updates to make your watch smarter, faster and easier to use. The biggest update is the Siri Face, which, there’s no other way to put it, places Apple’s version of Google Now on your Watch face. Cards will give you information that’s relevant to you, including news, appointments, etc. Workout and Activity apps are getting updates to make them smarter and to provide better information. Music will now also be easier to control during a workout. Apple also announced a bunch of new Watch faces. App Store: A much needed refresh, but is it useful? The App Store is getting its first major overhaul since its inception nine years ago. To put it simply, the Store will carry forward the design language hinted at in the new Music, News and TV apps. Bold cards will provide more information about a fewer number of items, in part to bring more focus to the store. A number of new tabs have been added, including one dedicated to games. macOS High Sierra: Flying high The latest build of macOS, unveiled at WWDC today, is to be called High Sierra. Think of it as a more refined macOS Sierra. Apple simply took the best bits of the OS and refined it a bit more. Notably, you get HEVC support and a brand new file system. The default Photos app gets a some tweaks and now includes better editing options. Safari gets a bunch of useful updates, including the ability to prevent sites from auto-playing content and to prevent tracking. A newly announced Metal 2 API finally adds support for external GPUs, though these are limited to specific AMD model cards for now, which is very restrictive and unnecessary. iOS 11: Everything’s changed There are enough new features in iOS 11 to warrant a separate press conference on the announcements. We’re not going to delve it into detail here, but you can read all about it on our website. Essentially, iOS 11 gets a serious design overhaul, adds true multi-tasking capabilities and borrows features from Microsoft’s Ink. 10.5-inch iPad Pro: It’s different The new iPad Pro is, well, different. It’s running on A10X SoC, so it’s more powerful than the A10 powered iPhone 7 devices that we’re carrying. It also features a new design with slimmer bezels. Speaking of displays, the refresh rate on the 10.5-inch iPad’s display can vary from 24 Hz to 120 Hz. This should mean smoother animations. Pencil response time has been brought down to 20 ms. With the A10X and iOS 11, the device is certainly making a compelling argument for a tablet in 2017. The base model will sell for $649 and offer 64 GB of storage. HomePod: They didn’t call it the Siri Speaker For whatever reason, it didn’t cross anyone’s mind that Apple would choose to give their fancy new speaker a blindingly obvious name like HomePod. The HomePod is a Google Home like speaker that functions like the Echo, but offers incredible music quality, relatively speaking. The speaker looks like a mesh-encapsulated Mac Pro and features directional tweeters and a 4-inch woofer. The device apparently uses spatial recognition technology and machine learning to tune the audio output to the listening environment. Multiple HomePods can work together to further enhance the audio experience. These devices will support Siri and will retail for $350 later this year.

In 3.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.05 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.11 percent. In 3.07pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.05 percent lower. Earlier in the day the Nasdaq had touched a record-high 6,310.62. The Dow slid as declines in shares of Cisco and those of Apple, each 1.1 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Microsoft, recently up 1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Shares of Apple fell as Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves downgraded the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight.” “We believe AAPL anticipates strong performance in the iPhone 8 cycle, while providing relatively little weight to risks through the cycle or the potential for iPhone sales to decline in FY19," Hargreaves wrote in a note to investors Sunday, CNBC reported. He cited risks “around gross margins, elasticity, supply issues, or the likelihood for declines beyond the iPhone 8 cycle.” The latest US economic data, while mixed, further underpinned already-firm bets that the Federal Reserve will announce an interest rate increase at the end of its two-day meeting next week. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its non-manufacturing activity index declined to a lower-than-expected reading of 56.9 in May, down from 57.5 in April. "The economy is neither accelerating nor slowing, but the labour market is looking up," Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania, told Reuters. Meanwhile, shares of Herbalife sank, down 8.2 percent as of 3.23pm in New York, after the company downgraded its sales outlook, predicting second-quarter revenue will fall more than previously expected. Hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman was unimpressed. "On May 4th Herbalife raised guidance driving the stock to new highs. Insiders including [CEO Michael] Johnson sold their stock and options,” Ackman said in a statement, CNBC reported. “Fewer than three weeks after the stock sales, the company is now lowering guidance, somehow claiming that it is surprised by reduced volumes the first month the [US Federal Trade Commission] settlement takes effect.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.1 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index shed 0.7 percent. Several European financial markets were closed for national public holidays including Germany and Switzerland. Oil resumed its decline, following earlier gains as investors assessed the impact of a Middle East rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Investors remained concerned about the global glut. “The market has again turned its focus to worries that excess supplies are going to continue to keep the glut in place,” Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, told Bloomberg.

The company announced on Monday a new augmented reality development platform, ARKit, that will bring augmented reality capabilities to hundreds of millions of devices. While most people know AR as the technology behind Snapchat Lenses and "Pokemon Go," it's much more important, according to Munster. "AR is going to be the operating system of the future," Munster told CNBC's "Fast Money" on Monday. Stephen Lam | Reuters Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President Software Engineering speaks about "Augmented Reality" during Apple's annual world wide developer conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017. Munster was a top Apple analyst before starting venture firm Loup Ventures, where he invests in technology like augmented reality. He called the AR platform — which was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose — "revolutionary." "The iPhone is going to be the AR device of the next five years, but eventually it's going to become some wearable," Munster said. "This ARKit will allow developers to build rich AR experiences far beyond what we've experienced in AR today." To be sure, Apple is not the only tech giant with augmented reality ambitions. Facebook has also said it wants to be the augmented reality platform of choice. While few of Apple's individual software platforms — like Apple Music — have been a breakout success, the broader power of platforms like the App Store makes a difference, Munster said. Apple is also in a unique position since it makes the cameras and hardware that many consumers may eventually use for AR. That's important because Apple's next iPhone is expected by some analysts to create a "supercycle" of sales. It all comes as shares of Apple's stock have been coasting off a recent all-time high in May. "I think the stock will continue to move higher over the next year," Munster said. "I think it probably will sell off just before the new phone comes out. It has to. So many people have made a lot of money in this trade."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman While you were sleeping: Downgrade for Apple Tuesday, 6 June 2017, 11:05 am Article: BusinessDesk While you were sleeping: Downgrade for Apple June 6 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street eased from record highs, as a decline in shares of Apple weighed on sentiment. In 3.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.05 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.11 percent. In 3.07pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.05 percent lower. Earlier in the day the Nasdaq had touched a record-high 6,310.62. The Dow slid as declines in shares of Cisco and those of Apple, each 1.1 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Microsoft, recently up 1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Shares of Apple fell as Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves downgraded the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight.” “We believe AAPL anticipates strong performance in the iPhone 8 cycle, while providing relatively little weight to risks through the cycle or the potential for iPhone sales to decline in FY19,” Hargreaves wrote in a note to investors Sunday, CNBC reported. He cited risks “around gross margins, elasticity, supply issues, or the likelihood for declines beyond the iPhone 8 cycle.” The latest US economic data, while mixed, further underpinned already-firm bets that the Federal Reserve will announce an interest rate increase at the end of its two-day meeting next week. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its non-manufacturing activity index declined to a lower-than-expected reading of 56.9 in May, down from 57.5 in April. „The economy is neither accelerating nor slowing, but the labour market is looking up,” Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania, told Reuters. Meanwhile, shares of Herbalife sank, down 8.2 percent as of 3.23pm in New York, after the company downgraded its sales outlook, predicting second-quarter revenue will fall more than previously expected. Hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman was unimpressed. „On May 4th Herbalife raised guidance driving the stock to new highs. Insiders including [CEO Michael] Johnson sold their stock and options,” Ackman said in a statement, CNBC reported. “Fewer than three weeks after the stock sales, the company is now lowering guidance, somehow claiming that it is surprised by reduced volumes the first month the [US Federal Trade Commission] settlement takes effect.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.1 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index shed 0.7 percent. Several European financial markets were closed for national public holidays including Germany and Switzerland. Oil resumed its decline, following earlier gains as investors assessed the impact of a Middle East rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Investors remained concerned about the global glut. “The market has again turned its focus to worries that excess supplies are going to continue to keep the glut in place,” Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, told Bloomberg.

As is always the case following the event, the company has released Developer Betas. But before you go and install it, you should be aware that you're doing this at your own risk. Apple Store employees will be hesitant to listen to your complaints when they see that your device is running beta software, and complaints are something that you'll likely have. If you're like I am though, then you need to try it out anyway despite the risks, so here's how you can get it. There are two different avenues that you can go down here. You can flash the image, or you can install a configuration profile that will get you an OTA update. The latter is the much easier option. While it's not required as much as it used to be, I highly recommend completing the following steps first: Go to Settings -> iCloud -> Backup -> Back Up Now. Plug your iPhone or iPad into a PC running iTunes with a Lightning cable. Click on the serial number in iTunes, which will turn into the UDID. In Apple Developer, go to Account -> Certificates, IDs, & Profiles, and use your UDID to add your device. Once you're done with that, you'll need to decide between installing the configuration profile and flashing the image. The config profile requires the least work, but the full image will allow you to do a clean install (you can also use it for an update). To use the recommended method of installing the configuration profile: In Apple Developer, go to Develop -> Downloads. Locate iOS 11, and use the download link that says "Preferred". If the download is more than a dozen kilobytes, you picked the wrong one. Email the file to yourself. Open the email on your iPhone or iPad and open the file. You'll be prompted to enter your PIN, agree to a EULA, and eventually your iPhone will reboot. Once it reboots, go to Settings -> General -> Software Update, and follow the onscreen instructions to install iOS 11. If you want to flash the image: In Apple Developer, go to Develop -> Downloads. Click "See all" by iOS Restore Images, and download the image that corresponds to your device. Plug the device into a PC running iTunes with your Lightning cable. While holding Option on a Mac or Shift on Windows, click Restore iPhone (for a clean install) or Check for Updates (to update the device). Navigate to the file you downloaded and open it. You should now be all set with iOS 11 beta. If it's too unstable for you, you can always roll back by using the iOS 10.3.2 images that are available from Apple Developer and using the steps provided above. If it's not worth the risk to you though, you might be better off just waiting until later this month when the Public Beta is available.

Jun, 2017, 19:01 ET Share this article LONDON, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the Top 5 places in the 2017 BrandZTM Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/513554/Kantar_Millward_Brown_Logo.jpg ) Amazon achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion (+41%) to $139.3bn to take the no. 4 position. The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal. Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino's Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers' lives better, such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases." The BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands report and rankings, and a great deal more brand insight for key regions of the world and 14 market sectors, are available online here. The Global report, rankings, charts, articles and more can also be found via the BrandZ app. The BrandZ app also contains the same features and functionality for all BrandZ regional reports and is free to download for Apple IOS and all Android devices from www.brandz.com/mobile or search for BrandZ in the respective iTunes or Google Play app stores. About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

Credit: Apple, Inc     Apple has jumped the gun on an upcoming addition to its iOS devices, listing a placeholder for a new in-house app on its App Store. Dubbed “Files”, the app was initially spotted by developer Steve Troughton-Smith, and it’s getting iPhone and iPad users very excited. With Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference set to kick off in mere hours, the app hints at a potential overhaul of Apple’s iOS file management approach. Since 2007, iOS has given users limited access to files on their devices, in contrast to systems like Android, which allow in-depth browsing and moving of individual files and folders. Instead, iOS apps handle their own files. For example, documents received in emails can only be viewed using specific apps, and not within a file management system akin to ‘Finder’ on Mac computers or ‘File Explorer’ on Windows. All suspicions and speculation will be addressed at the conference later today.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → HomePod: More Sonos Than Alexa?  June 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Just yesterday, I shared some thoughts on the timing of what has been announced as HomePod: Apple could pre-announce it at WWDC, and ship it in the coming weeks or months. If it comes with SiriKit support, and if Apple expands that in iOS 11, does it make sense to launch it now with SiriKit being limited to such a small handful of app categories in iOS 10? Apple did pre-announce the device. It will go on sale — for $349 — in December. Apple put a Sonos speaker and an Echo on a slide in the keynote, building the case that a product in this category should sound great and be smart. I have no doubt Apple’s product will sound good. A good section of its time on stage was about the various components in its audio system. Most of the product’s webpage is dedicated to the tech within the small cylinder. When it comes to smarts, I’m not convinced Apple has done enough to take on the Echo. Siri is onboard, ready to do almost anything you ask when it comes to Apple Music. Past that, the HomePod can be used with HomeKit devices. Apple’s has limited Siri on the device to domains Apple knows well: News, Messages, Podcasts, Stocks, Weather, Reminders, alarms, timers, sports and traffic. There is no third-party app support for HomePod at this time. The Echo and Google Home both have a growing library of third-party apps that can provide content and skills to the user. I assume that third-party support will come in the future. Apple’s playing it slow with SiriKit, but I’d like to see things move forward more aggressively.

According to Tim Cook, Apple CEO, the focus will be on music in the first instance: “Just like we did with portable music we want to reinvent home music.” The HomePod will launch in the US, UK and Australia in December. It will be priced at a (surprisingly expensive) $349 and come in white and space grey. Combined with Siri you’ll be able to ask it to “play more from this band” or ask for more songs with the same guitarist and the like. You will also be able to use it to set a timers and give you reminders. You will be able to send a text with apple Messages, control the household lights and hook up with other connected devices through HomeKit. And needless to say it will also read the news and weather to you. The competition is hotting up in the home AI unit space and many Apple fans will be interested and excited to have access to a new device to add to the suite of gadgets they offer. That’s probably how they will justify the higher price tag. But with an end of year launch date, Apple has some catching up to do. Have your say Click here to cancel reply.

This paves the way for virtual reality development on lighter-weight laptops and also opens up the possibility that Mac users will some day be able to plug in and play with VR headsets. Steam owner Valve also announced today that it’s made SteamVR available for Mac in beta. Apple now sells an enclosure and AMD graphics card for $599 To help developers get started, Apple has also started selling its very own external graphics enclosure to developers. The idea is to give Mac owners who’ve always wanted and needed a bit more horsepower the extra juice required to work on graphically intensive VR and 3D applications and games. This all seems to work only in the beta version of macOS High Sierra, which is now available. However, an Apple preview page for the new OS says external GPU support might not arrive for everyday consumers until spring of 2018. That said, the Apple-approved enclosure on the company’s website is a Sonnet external GPU chassis with Thunderbolt 3 support and a 350-watt power supply. The package comes with a AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB graphics card, which is a VR-ready GPU. Developers will also get $100 toward a HTC Vive headset to use for VR purposes. You have to be a member of the Apple Developer Program to even be eligible to purchase the kit. This is what the VR stations at #wwdc2017 look like. MacBook, GPU Enclosure, Vive. pic.twitter.com/nQ8n8pPmlP— Holodeck Janitor (@russellholly) June 5, 2017 This is all a promising start to bringing the Mac platform up to speed for the VR community. But there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before developers, and especially consumer, can look at Apple’s platform as a viable place to create and consume VR content. At least in the short term, when external GPU support does launch, the MacBook and iMac line might just become more viable gaming machines.

Win! X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple's New iPad Pro Takes A Stride Towards Killing Bezels Alex Cranz Jun 6, 2017, 8:45am ⋅ Filed to:  apple ipad pro wwdc wwdc 2017 Share If you're curious about what the 10th Anniversary iPhone might look like this spring, then there might be some hints in the new iPad Pro. The most enduring iPhone rumours suggest that Apple is coming for the bezel, and the new iPad might just be a precursor to that massacre. Apple has killed the 9.7-inch iPad, but announced a new 10.5-inch iPad, that will have the same footprint with a lot less bezel. Screenshot: WWDC Besides shaving off the bezel, and thus making it impossible to grip in portrait mode, Apple claims the new iPad is 30 per cent faster with an A10X CPU and 12-core GPU, and a display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This, according to Apple, allows the iPad to behave more like a traditional computer than ever before, particularly when it comes to Pencil interaction. Apple demo'd fine, highly-detailed art creation that it claims wouldn't have been possible on earlier iPads, as well as super smooth animations that it claims are the result of the 120Hz refresh rate. Older iPads, and most laptops, have a 60Hz or lower refresh rate. 120Hz means you can enjoy up to 120 frames per second in games, and it's also what allows for more responsiveness when drawing using the Apple Pencil. Besides the better display, and improved guts, the new iPad Prohas a nicer camera — which you should never ever use at a concert — and up to 10 hours of battery life. Many bezels were sacrificed to make this iPad happen, and we won't know if the exchange was worth it until we get our hands on one. They will be available for sale starting today and will begin shipping next week. Pricing in Australia is $979 for a 64GB 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with $1199 for 12.9-inch.

Tell Campbell Simpson as well. If it was the same, I would be upgrading. Btw, isn't it cool how you and I have the same name? Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Win! X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Here Are All Of The New Upgrades To Siri Michael Nunez Jun 6, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple digital assistant siri video feature wwdc wwdc 2017 Share If you're someone who's constantly talking to Siri on your phone, you might be shocked by some of the big changes coming to the digital assistant. Today at Apple's annual developer conference, the company announced a bunch of upgrades and tweaks that will be coming to Siri later this year with the launch of iOS 11. There's an assortment of big changes being made to the artificially intelligent helper, so let's dive right in. Image: Apple Siri is getting a new voice One of the most noticeable updates is that Siri is getting a brand new voice — both male and female — to make the assistant sound more natural and less like it's a T-900 Terminator robot. You'll notice the difference in things like inflection and the way that the assistant pronounces long sentences. Siri's robotic voice and inability to understand users has become somewhat of a running gag in Silicon Valley and tech culture. The upgraded voice will come to many as a welcome respite from the ineffectiveness of previous generations. Siri is getting much smarter — and it's getting a more human voice to punctuate its advancement in artificial intelligence. Get instant translations from your assistant Siri is also getting an instant translation feature that many travellers will be excited about. The new version of Siri can translate from English to other languages such as Spanish, Chinese, French, German and Italian. You'll now be able to say something like, "How do I say, 'Where's the nearest grocery store?'" and the assistant will automatically translate for you, and say it out loud. The translation tool could have a major impact on the way people behave while travelling because of the fact that Siri can speak the language out loud. In the future, this could make it much easier for people to have two-way conversations in multiple languages. For now, it's important to note that Siri can only translate from English, but it's easy to imagine Apple expanding this support in the near future. Siri finally gets some contextual awareness Siri will begin to understand in greater detail how you're using your phone during the day, and it will use some of that knowledge to make smarter decisions and suggestions for you. For example, if you received a message that asks "How far away are you?" from a friend, Siri will now use something called "on-device learning" that will suggest things like responding with your location or a calendar location. This will make replying on-the-go much easier. The digital assistant will also be able to suggest things such as news articles you might like. For example, if Siri notices that you're reading stories about Iceland in the Safari web browser, it might begin suggesting Iceland-related news from the Apple News app. This type of contextual awareness will only increase over time as Apple make more updates to iOS 11. Better security and skills Finally, Apple executives also emphasised several times during the presentation that the on-device learning means that that the system is more secure than alternative assistants like Google Assistant. The learning that Siri experiences will be synced across devices, however, the data will remain private to you, which means that, according to Apple, the company isn't going to be selling your activity to advertisers or anything weird like that. According to company executives, you don't have to worry about privacy because it is kept private to each individual. Apple executives also teased that there will be more third-party support to let developers integrate new and better experiences into Siri. The updated version of Siri will be rolled out later this year with the release of iOS 11.

Win! X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Hey, Apple Updated The MacBook Air! Campbell Simpson Jun 6, 2017, 9:15am ⋅ Filed to:  apple apple macbook air Australian Stories feature video feature Share Image: Apple "Apple today also updated the 13-inch MacBook Air® with a 1.8 GHz processor." Oh... cool. Here's a list of the updates Apple has made to the MacBook Air today: A new 1.8GHz processor Here's a list of the updates Apple has not made to the MacBook Air today: A new display Literally everything else Seriously, guys? Seriously? The mid-2017 MacBook Air has the same display as the late 2010 MacBook Air. It's a 13.3-inch 1440x900 pixel panel — 1296000 pixels in total, if you do the maths. Another skinny 13-inch laptop that you can buy is the Razer Blade Stealth, which has a 4K display. That's 3840x2160 pixels, or 8294400 individual dots. 6.4 times as many as the MacBook Air. The updated MacBook Air — don't call it's new, because it's not — will be available to buy in Apple Stores starting on Wednesday. I don't think you should buy one. (Buy a new MacBook instead.) Comments targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:30am Really the new macbook replaces the MacBook Air, I think this is the last Air you will see, and it is probably only available to appease the few people that still want OSX at a lower entry point. My guess is next year we will see a lower price macbook to have the lower price point entry level machine to completely replace the Air, maybe with an AMD heart. Reply 0 robb @robb Jun 6, 2017, 12:09pm Yeah, Tim Cook pretty much sounded the death knell for The Air last year. Which sucks, because I dont like the Macbook or the new Pros. Reply 0 namarrgon @namarrgon Jun 6, 2017, 10:49am Just be happy they didn't take away another port. Reply 2 robb @robb Jun 6, 2017, 12:10pm Or update the keyboard. Reply 0 Zeugma Guest Jun 6, 2017, 5:07pm So no new battery... With a 24 hr use time. That would be far to revolutionary! Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

In 3.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.05 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.11 percent. In 3.07pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.05 percent lower. Earlier in the day the Nasdaq had touched a record-high 6,310.62. The Dow slid as declines in shares of Cisco and those of Apple, each 1.1 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Microsoft, recently up 1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Shares of Apple fell as Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves downgraded the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight.” “We believe AAPL anticipates strong performance in the iPhone 8 cycle, while providing relatively little weight to risks through the cycle or the potential for iPhone sales to decline in FY19,” Hargreaves wrote in a note to investors Sunday, CNBC reported. He cited risks “around gross margins, elasticity, supply issues, or the likelihood for declines beyond the iPhone 8 cycle.” The latest US economic data, while mixed, further underpinned already-firm bets that the Federal Reserve will announce an interest rate increase at the end of its two-day meeting next week. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its non-manufacturing activity index declined to a lower-than-expected reading of 56.9 in May, down from 57.5 in April. “The economy is neither accelerating nor slowing, but the labour market is looking up,” Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania, told Reuters. Meanwhile, shares of Herbalife sank, down 8.2 percent as of 3.23pm in New York, after the company downgraded its sales outlook, predicting second-quarter revenue will fall more than previously expected. Hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman was unimpressed. “On May 4th Herbalife raised guidance driving the stock to new highs. Insiders including [CEO Michael] Johnson sold their stock and options,” Ackman said in a statement, CNBC reported. “Fewer than three weeks after the stock sales, the company is now lowering guidance, somehow claiming that it is surprised by reduced volumes the first month the [US Federal Trade Commission] settlement takes effect.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.1 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index shed 0.7 percent. Several European financial markets were closed for national public holidays including Germany and Switzerland. Oil resumed its decline, following earlier gains as investors assessed the impact of a Middle East rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Investors remained concerned about the global glut. “The market has again turned its focus to worries that excess supplies are going to continue to keep the glut in place,” Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, told Bloomberg.

Apple wasn’t actually allowing press to get hands-on with the new machine, but we did get an opportunity to get up close and personal with some video of the new iMac Pro (below). The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac In addition to including pro specs in a familiar iMac all-in-one form factor— and a $4999 starting price to go along with it— the new iMac Pro also comes in a Space Gray color that’s actually slightly darker than Apple’s other products that use the signature darkened aluminum tone. We also learned that the machine won’t have user accessible RAM, but Apple will be offering some of its usual upgrade options at the time of purchase. Apple also confirmed that it doesn’t have plans to sell the Space Gray Apple Magic Keyboard, mouse and trackpad that come with the new iMac Pro separately. The iMac Pro will notably come with four Thunderbolt 3 ports with support for up to two 5K displays, a 1080p FaceTime camera, a 5K built-in display, and base configurations that start with 8-core Xeon processors, Radeon Vega graphics, 32GB ECC memory, and 10GB Ethernet.

He also noted that he isn’t worried about being beat to the market by Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, saying that Apple doesn’t rush to market, but rather tries to give users a positive experience. “Apple is a company that deeply cares about music and wants to deliver a great audio experience in the home. We feel like we re-invented it in the portable player area and we feel we can re-invent it in the home area as well.” “For us it’s not about being first, it’s about being the best,” Cook said. “And giving the users an experience that delights them every time. So we don’t let the impatience result in shipping something that’s just not great.” Tim Cook also touched on his relationship with President Trump in the interview. Regarding Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact, Cook explained that the decision was not in the best interest of the United States. Furthermore Cook stated that he decided not to join Trump’s business council because it’s something that he generally doesn’t find to be very productive (via CNBC). “He didn’t decide what I wanted him to decide…He decided wrong. It’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided.” “I don’t find councils and committees to be terribly productive…It wasn’t about not wanting to advise on something that we thought should be heard.” “It wasn’t about not wanting to advise on something where I thought that we could help or we had a point of view that should be heard,” Cook said. “I’m doing the latter. I can’t imagine a situation where I wouldn’t do the latter, because I think it’s in the best interest of America to do it, and I am first and foremost an American.” Cook strongly opposed Trump’s decision to leave the Paris climate accord and voiced his opinion in a company-wide email after the move was announced. He reiterated in that email that Apple will continue all of its corporate efforts in regards to climate change. The full interview will be airing on Bloomberg TV throughout the night and into the morning.

Cohen During today’s frenetic keynote for WWDC 2017, iPad Pro news came relatively late in the proceedings, but for those of you wondering what you might buy to replace an old iPad, the news was worth waiting for. First, though, a short requiem for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which has been discontinued as of today. It was a great device (full disclosure: I own one), and it will be missed. iPad Pro Hardware -- But most people probably won’t miss it much, for it has been replaced by a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which, along with a refreshed 12.9-inch model, now resides near the upper end of Apple’s iPad lineup. Most welcome is the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro’s screen real estate: its screen offers 20 percent more area than the 9.7-inch tablet’s screen, with 2224 by 1668 pixels available at 264 pixels per inch (ppi) compared to the 2048 by 1536 pixels available on the discontinued model. (For comparison, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro offers 2732 by 2048 pixels.) Apple squeezed that display into a package that’s only slightly larger than the previous model by reducing the size of the bezel around the screen. Those pixels are faster, too. Both the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and its bigger sibling, the refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro, boast an impressive 120 Hz refresh rate that should make all motion on the screen smoother and more responsive. It should make using the Apple Pencil even more fluid, since the latency is reduced to a mere 20 milliseconds. That refresh rate won’t be in play all the time because all those pixels are smarter, too: the new tablets employ a technology that Apple calls ProMotion, which adjusts the refresh rate depending on the content being displayed. High motion video, or scrolling, will ramp up the refresh rate, while static images will be refreshed less often, saving on battery and processing power. The pixels are brighter as well, displaying up to 600 nits; they’re more colorful, using the P3 color gamut; and they’re more legible, with a screen reflectivity of only 1.8 percent. Driving those pixels is a new processor, Apple’s new 64-bit 6-core A10X Fusion chip that, aided by a 12-core GPU, can handle 4K video and speed up model rendering. Apple claims the A10X provides 30 percent faster processing than the older A9X processor and the new GPU delivers 40 percent faster graphics. Also taking advantage of these processing capabilities are the cameras in the new iPads, which now match those on the iPhone 7: a 12-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization and a six-element lens on the back and a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera on the front. The rear camera is accompanied by Apple’s True Tone flash. All this comes in a package that weighs only 1.03 pounds (469 grams) for the 10.5-inch Wi-Fi model (add 8 grams if you want a cellular model), or 1.49 pounds (677 grams) for the Wi-Fi-only 12.9-incher (cellular capability adds a whopping 15 grams — about half an ounce). Each offers an estimated 10 hours of battery life. Unsurprisingly, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro retains its physical dimensions, so current cases should continue to fit fine. However, even though the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is similar in size to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro it replaces, and is the same thickness, it’s 10.6 mm taller and 4.6 mm wider, so most of today’s cases for the previous iPad Pro won’t fit. For those deeply into technical specifications (and who among us isn’t?), you can find many more details on the iPad Pro Tech Specs page. iPad-specific iOS Features -- But hardware is only half the story, because when iOS 11 comes out (see “iOS 11 Gets Smarter in Small Ways,” 5 June 2017), it will sport a bevy of features designed with the iPad in mind. Not all of these features may work on older iPads, but Apple hasn’t announced details yet. New iPad-specific features include: A customizable Dock that provides more than the paltry six icons of previous iOS generations. It even features an area at the right side that predicts which apps you might want to use. A brand new App Switcher that you access by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. It makes moving among apps much more convenient. As a bonus, the App Switcher includes app combinations from multitasking sessions. Files, a new app that lets users peruse locally stored files, iCloud Drive files, and files stored using third-party services such as Dropbox and Box. It looks and works a lot like the Finder on the Mac. Drag-and-drop capability between apps so you can drag text, images, and files from one app to another using the improved multitasking in iOS 11. A new document scanning feature in Notes that can handle multi-page documents and employs image processing to straighten and sharpen scanned images. In addition, iOS 11 offers additional goodies for iPad Pro users who also have an Apple Pencil. Aside from the general snappiness increase courtesy of the new processors, the Apple Pencil learns a few new tricks in iOS 11: A new Instant Notes feature so you can compose notes instantly by tapping the Pencil on the lock screen Markup capability in Notes, Mail, PDFs, and on screenshots Inline drawing in Notes and Mail Handwritten text recognition — no, not the Newton handwriting recognition of yore, but recognition that leaves your handwritten notes looking as you wrote them but that makes them searchable Pricing and Availability -- The new iPad Pro models are available for pre-order now, and will begin shipping by 12 June 2017 in the United States as well as in 37 other countries. The base model iPad Pros ship with 64 GB of storage but can be ordered with up to 512 GB, a nice jump from the previous 256 GB max. They come in silver, space gray, and gold, and Apple added a rose gold color for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. How much would you pay to own one of these bits of future kit? The 64 GB 10.5-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi costs $649; jumping to 256 GB increases the price to $749, and going to 512 GB raises it to $949. For the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, a 64 GB configuration starts at $799, with 256 GB at $899 and 512 GB at $1099. Add $130 to any configuration to get cellular connectivity as well. For the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, those prices may seem to be $50 more than the previous 9.7-inch iPad Pro storage configurations. If you look closely, though, the only storage configuration that matches is the 256 GB size, and the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is actually $50 cheaper there. Although Apple’s iPad sales have been nothing to cheer about lately, these new Pro models may well reinvigorate this stagnating backwater in Apple’s hardware lineup.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

The good news is everything else, including a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, improvements to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, and iPad-specific improvements in iOS 11. The new hardware is available this month; we’ll have to wait until fall for iOS 11. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Scott M.   2017-06-05 23:55 I have to admit that the improvements for the iPad in iOS 11, including the Apple Pencil stuff, was the biggest thing to catch my eye from the Keynote. The Apple Pencil stuff they highlighted will make the Pencil more useful for me. Currently I don't find that much use for my Apple Pencil as it seems more aimed at artists. With the updates, they appear to be more applicable to those beyond just artists, etc. The Files app and drag & drop and better Dock, etc looks like it might make the iPad Pro most like a computer and thus more useful. So, I liked those even more than the Apple Pencil improvements. Most the stuff highlighted for iOS for iPhone and High Sierra did not dazzle much, but time will tell if the improvements under the hood are the real dazzlers. The native no autoplay of videos is nice, but that can largely be accomplished now with extensions (and yes, Macworld is a real pain in the you know what about that...big reason why I rarely go to the Macworld site anymore). Reply Frans Moquette  2017-06-06 18:28 2017 could be the year in which I am going to replace my iPad Air 2 with an iPad Pro with Apple pencil as soon as iOS 11 comes out. The new features, with Files at the top, could very well change the iPad from a 'nice to have extra' to a potential laptop replacement. Reply  Search   Cached.

By Emily Bary and Nicholas Jasinski June 5, 2017 5:29 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple's $349 HomePod speaker comes out in December. Photo: Apple Apple has finally made its much-anticipated entrance into the smart home speaker market with the “HomePod,” announced Monday afternoon at WWDC. Given how much hype the device got from the rumor mill before its reveal, Apple nerds (and investors) might be disappointed by its high price tag and lack of revolutionary new features. HomePod is a 7-inch tall Apple-engineered wireless speaker with a large woofer and seven smaller speakers. The $349 WiFi-connected unit includes six microphones and the same chip that powers your iPhone. You can use voice controls to turn on lights, set timers, play music, and handle your usual Siri commands. Apple’s not the first to come out with a voice-controlled speaker, and its device costs more than the two big players combined; the HomePod will sell for $349, while the Amazon Echo costs $180 and the Google Home goes for $130. Essentially Apple is betting that its ecosystem is worth twice Amazon’s or Google’s. Apple tried to justify the HomePod's steep price tag in its WWDC keynote. Photo: Apple Apple has a history of introducing devices with high price points and still managing to outsell the competition, but such a premium over other smart home speakers might be hard to justify -- especially given the Alexa-powered Echo’s head start. An industry report earlier this year estimated that the Echo would make up 70% of the voice-controlled speaker market by year end. (The report didn’t take into account the possibility of an Apple speaker, but the Home Pod won’t be out until December anyway.) Apple’s PR machine is already working overtime to convince consumers that the HomePod is worth the money. “It takes the listening experience to a whole new level,” reads a quintessentially Apple description of the new product. “And that’s just the beginning.” Besides a more-advanced speaker, the HomePod doesn’t seem to have any features that its competitors haven’t had for months. Siri is touted as a big selling point for the device, but it has plenty of room for improvement. Marketing agency Stone Temple recently asked Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana each the same 5,000 general knowledge questions and rated their replies for accuracy. Google Assistant and Cortana each got more than half right, while Siri and Alexa barely answered more than 20% correctly. At least Amazon already has its device in millions of homes. The HomePod won’t even be out until the end of the year. Overall, Apple’s announcements at WWDC didn’t wow investors. Shares dropped 1% on Monday after an analyst downgrade. And Wall Street isn’t sold on the HomePod’s potential. “Given the price point relative to competitive offerings, we would expect the near-term impact from HomePod to be immaterial,” Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Apple Busted Misleading Customers in Sting Operation, Lawsuit Claims Rhett JonesMonday 6:38pm Filed to: Right to Repair apple australia Australian Competition and Consumer Commission aaac lawsuit documents consumer tech 69 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: Getty Apple really doesn’t like its customers having the right to repair their own devices, and while Apple fights it out in the US, it’s being accused of sneakily trying to get around Australian law. The Guardian has obtained court documents that detail a sting operation by Australia’s consumer watchdog that showed Apple willfully misled customers about their rights. Apple Confirms That If You Mess With Your Home Button It Will Brick Your Phone Earlier today the Guardian reported on mounting “fury” over a mysterious “Error 53” appearing on…Read more You might remember “Error 53” from such hits as “Apple gets sued” and “Apple being sued.” But if not, just know that it was an error message that popped up informing users that their iOS device had been bricked following unauthorized repairs. At first, Apple said it was actually a security feature, then it said that it was a software check that should have only occurred at the factory. The tech giant has since issued a fix. But that hasn’t stopped the lawsuits. Advertisement The case being brought to court by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges that Apple’s staff informed customers that they were not eligible for a free repair or replacement if their device had been taken to an unauthorized repair outlet. Australian law gives consumers the right to a free repair or replacement in the event that a product is “faulty or of unacceptable quality.” Error 53, according to Apple, was a mistake. A mistake that renders a very expensive piece of hardware useless. The best part of this is Apple’s alleged defense. According to the court documents obtained by The Guardian, the ACCC’s sting operation called all of the official Apple retailers in Australia and told the representatives that an iPhone’s speakers had stopped working after the screen was replaced by a third-party. From the documents: In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider. Apple isn’t publicly responding to the charges but the court documents show its attorneys believe this case is frivolous because “hypothetical circumstances” don’t constitute a breach. Apple maintains that a real customer with a real issue would have been told all about their rights. Sponsored The ACCC also maintains that a message on Apple’s US website misled customers. It informed users who had received the error message that, “if the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else,” they should “contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.” Apple disagrees that this was misleading because it was only referring to the company’s own warranty. Last June, a US court in California rejected one Error 53-related lawsuit, but a separate suit in Seattle is ongoing. The ACCC is seeking “pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs.” Court proceedings are scheduled to begin in mid-December.

Here's how much they'll all cost, and when you'll be able to buy them in Australia. The new iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are available to order today on Apple's website, and will all be available to buy at Apple Stores from tomorrow. Here's a quick run-down of the new pricing: New Apple MacBook, 12-inch: 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 (256GB SSD): $1899 1.3Ghz dual-core Intel Core i5 (512GB SSD): $2399 The new MacBook, Apple says, features SSDs 50 per cent faster than the previous model and with support for up to twice as much RAM. New Apple MacBook Pro, 13-inch: 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (128GB SSD): $1899 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (256GB SSD): $2199 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Touch Bar, 256GB): $2699 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Touch Bar, 512GB SSD): $2999 The entry-level price point of the 13-inch MacBook Pro drops to $1899, although that model doesn't have the Touch Bar of more expensive units. New Apple MacBook Pro, 15-inch: 2.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (256GB SSD): $2999 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Touch Bar, 256GB SSD): $3499 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Touch Bar, 512GB SSD): $4099 Apple's new MacBooks Pro have more powerful discrete graphics chips — the AMD Radeon Pro 555 and 560 in the 15-inch model. New Apple iMac, 21.5-inch: 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5: $1599 3.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Retina 4K display): $1899 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Retina 4K display): $2199 The iMac has more powerful graphics, faster processors, Thunderbolt 3, faster storage and Retina display options. The 21.5-inch in particular gets new discrete graphics chips and a Retina 4K model for the first time. New Apple iMac, 27-inch: 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Retina 5K display): $2699 3.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Retina 5K display): $2999 3.8Ghz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Retina 5K display): $3449 The 27-inch iMac gets those same processing and graphics updates as the smaller model, but keeps that existing — and beautiful — 5K display. New iMac Pro: The iMac Pro is scheduled to ship in the US in December, Apple says, for $US4999. That translates to $6679 in Australia, although you can expect a hefty premium on top of that by the time it reaches Australian shores.

Chris Jager 07 Jun 2017 11:30 AM Foxtel has announced a revamped high-definition video streaming service dubbed Foxtel Now - and it's priced competitively with Stan and Netflix. With subscriptions starting at just $10 per month, it's a far cry from the company's prohibitively expensive Pay TV offerings. (In fact, it's actually cheaper than Netflix's HD tiers which start at $11.99.) But what do you actually get for your ten dollarydoos? Does Foxtel Now include Game Of Thrones? Do you still need to add a bunch of additional packs to make it worthwhile? We take a look at the prices, inclusions and your frequently asked questions. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

Apple is getting serious about competing with Amazon’s and Google’s infiltration of the home. At the company’s annual developer conference on Monday, Apple announced a new Wi-Fi speaker called HomePod that will play music and respond to voice commands with Apple’s digital assistant, Siri. HomePod will be released in December for $349, and it's meant to work with Apple's $10-per-month subscription music service, Apple Music. HomePod marks Apple’s attempt to put a stake in the smart-home assistant hardware market, an area currently dominated by Amazon’s growing array of Alexa-running devices, like its Echo speaker, and Google’s Home gadget, which runs Google Assistant.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences HomePod doesn’t have a display, but when you say “Hey Siri” to invoke Apple’s assistant, the top of the device lights up. It can do things Siri already does, like deliver weather, traffic, or sports updates. You can also use it to relay voice commands to smart appliances that use Apple’s smart-home software, HomeKit (these include a range of smart bulbs, thermostats, and so on, but excludes Google-owned Nest’s smart thermostat). In many ways, Apple kicked off the mass-market digital personal assistant trend in 2011 with the release of Siri for the iPhone, then considered novel for its abilities to respond to commands to make phone calls, check the weather, or set up an appointment (though its ability to understand queries was sometimes comically bad). Siri was originally developed at SRI International as part of a DARPA-funded artificial intelligence project called CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) and spun out as a startup; Apple purchased it in 2010. Apple has lagged behind Google and Amazon, however, in incorporating Siri into a voice-operated household device, and it was widely expected to start selling its own. After all, the market for such devices is growing fast, and projected to keep expanding: in a report this month, research firm eMarketer predicted nearly 36 million Americans will use a speaker-based voice-assistant each month this year, more than twice as many as a year ago. About 71 percent of them will be using Amazon’s Echo speaker, while Google’s Home captures about 24 percent of the market. This overall adoption is still tiny compared to, say, the number of people using smartphones every month, but is growing faster. Yet even as Apple showed off HomePod—which it saved for last during the more than two-hour presentation—the company seemed to deliberately undersell the device as an all-around home assistant. Instead, it positioned the product as a more of a smart speaker that is wedded to Apple Music and happens to also have other capabilities thanks to its Siri integration.  Recommended for You First Quantum-Secured Blockchain Technology Tested in Moscow The Desktop of the Future Is Coming Experts Predict When Artificial Intelligence Will Exceed Human Performance Google Sprinkles AI on Its Spreadsheets to Automate Away Some Office Work Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law First, there’s the name, HomePod, which hearkens back to Apple’s iPod—a device that has always been focused almost exclusively on tunes. “Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” CEO Tim Cook said. Second, when Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, came back to the stage to present the device, he spent much of his time highlighting how well it plays music—explaining the minutiae of its built-in tweeters and woofer. He also singled out its ability to figure out the acoustics of the room it’s in, and optimize the sound accordingly. Finally, when talking about its ability to use Siri, he explained most in depth how the assistant can help with a range of music-related HomePod commands like “Play something more mellow” or questions like “Who’s playing drums on this track?” These types of music-related capabilities are limited to Apple Music subscribers, though; if you don't want to pay a monthly fee, Siri won't be able to help you here.  Tech Obsessive?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Knocks it out of the Park with their new High Quality Speaker Device for Siri called 'HomePod' | Main | Apple's iOS 11 will Introduce 'Pay friends with a Message' Feature which was First Forecast in a 2015 Patent Filing » June 05, 2017 Apple's Senior VP of Software says that Apple will have the Largest AR Platform in the World   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "While the State of VR Headsets is at a crawl today, the Market is set to Explode with Vitality later this Year." While the report primarily took a look at the current state of the VR market and what's coming this fall, I dedicated one segment of the report about Augmented Reality that's likely to launch on the iPhone in Q4. I have to admit it was a bit of stretch for this year but evidence was beginning to mount that it might just happen. I had pointed to Google's new smartphone feature called Google Lens and how something like that could be coming to the iPhone.   The report noted that "This is where Apple could slowly introduce Augmented Reality into the mainstream before leaping to a full blown headset. Apple was recently granted a patent on this feature and Apple's acquisition of Metaio puts them in a great position to deliver top quality AR experiences on future iDevices. Today at Apple's WWDC, Craig Federighi, Apple's SVP software engineering introduced Augmented Reality coming to iOS 11 around the 85.20 minute mark of their event video. Federighi introduced ARKit to Apple developers.   ARKit is a new framework that brings augmented reality to hundreds of millions of iOS devices by allowing developers to easily build unparalleled AR experiences. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, augmented reality takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways. Like never before, games and apps can offer fantastically immersive and fluid experiences that are out of this world, yet virtually within it.   In the first demo of AR on an iPhone app being distributed to their developers this week, Federighi put on an incredible demo. Below you see him touch the "+" button to pull up a menu of items that could be placed anywhere on the demo table. He chooses cup and bam, a cup of coffee is on the table with live steam coming from it and shadows around the cup always able to shift accordingly. Federighi pulls up another item, this time a lamp. He then turns on the lamp and then effortlessly moves the items around the table in real time always changing shadows according to the stage lights.   After his first demo Federighi noted that will hundreds of millions of devices being able to run AR, Apple will have the largest AR Platform in the world!   Apple's Craig Federighi then introduced Alasdair Coull, creative director of 'Wingnut AR', a company that was started by 'Lord of the Rings' director Peter Jackson. It's a new company dedicated to creating AR content. Their demo was mind boggling.   It made Microsoft HoloLens demos look like child's play. This is one demo that you have to see on Apple's event video to believe it. And this is the quality coming to the iDevices right out the gate. It was simply amazing. The little characters walking around the environment and ships attacking the town: Stunning realism on an iPad. The iPad's camera points to a desktop and the content understands the environment in which it has to display this game using 'Computer Vision.'   If there a single moment in the WWDC 2017 that blew me away, it was this one with AR, with Apple's Schiller introducing HomePod being a very close second.   If anyone had any doubts about Apple's position with Augmented Reality, I'm sure that they doubt no more. The demos were live not filmed which made it all the more stunning to think where Apple could take this technology on iDevices in the future.   Apple's work on Augmented Reality is going to blow every competitor out of the water. Between the AR demos and Apple's stunning HomePod introduction, Apple definitely hit a home run out of the park with this year's WWDC keynote and there's even more excitement coming this fall.   I'm sure that Samsung and other Apple competitors never saw this coming. Apple has just set the excitement level for the fall's iPhone 8 through the roof.   In an exclusive interview with ABC News back in September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the he favored augmented reality (AR) over virtual reality (VR), and suggested the emerging technology may be more commercially viable because it allows users to be more "present." After seeing today's AR demonstration it's easy to understand Cook's exuberance of the technology coming to iOS devices.   Apple was granted a design patent over the weekend in Hong Kong for the Siri logo, the one that was shown for watchOS today. Our report pointed to the logo being associated with smartglasses. Now that I've seen Apple's AR demo, it's easier to understand how the glasses could be an iOS accessory. Instead of holding up an iPad as they did today to play an AR game, it would be so much easier projected onto a headset to keep a user's hands free to operate a controller.   Yes, interesting times are ahead – that's for sure.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama June 5 Follow @htsuka Apple revealed a new smart speaker device, the HomePod, at WWDC. Here are some of its features. (Apple) Hey Siri, what did Apple announce today? The firm is jumping into a whole new product category — the home hub. Chief executive Tim Cook on Monday introduced Apple's voice-enabled smart speaker, the HomePod, at the company's annual developers conference, finally entering the home hub fray. The announcement was the most notable from the event, which packed in a lot of hardware and software updates. Apple's new product is a competitor to Google's Home and Amazon's Echo lines of smart speakers, which have taken an early lead in the young product category. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Just like its competitors, the HomePod will be able to answer basic questions, such as what the weather will be like or how bad traffic is. But the real selling point, as far as Apple is concerned, is the HomePod's sound quality. The $349 HomePod looks to provide an alternative to high-end speakers from competitors such as Bose and Sonos as well as the cheaper home hubs from its fellow tech giants. In that way, Apple is sticking to its normal playbook and focusing on consumers willing to shell out more cash — a strategy that can mean fewer sales but generally leads to greater profits. Onstage, Apple's worldwide head of marketing, Phil Schiller, described how the speaker analyzes the song it's playing and adjusts its output. For example, with a vocal-heavy track, it may emphasize middle tones, while a song with a driving beat will get more emphasis on the bass. The idea is that consumers will never have to mess with settings to optimize their speaker output. HomePod owners also won't have to tinker with the speaker to fit its position in a room, Apple said. The speaker is able to detect the surfaces around it and will beam sound to the right spot. If you link multiple speakers, they will adjust to one another's positions. The company, however, did not show off the speaker's Siri-enabled features Monday, saying it would release more information at a later date. [Here are the six big things Apple announced at its developer conference] Some analysts said they don't expect the HomePod to catch on as quickly as its cheaper competitors. “Apple will carve out some sales in the smart speaker market with HomePod but will continue to stand far behind Amazon and Google by the end of 2017,” Ronan de Renesse, of the analysis firm Ovum, said in an email. Apple, unlike Amazon or Google, is more interested in selling hardware than in using its devices to attract users for its services. The voice-activated-speaker market is projected to reach $2.1 billion by 2020, according to an October report from the analysis firm Gartner. By 2020, 3.3 percent of global households are expected to have one. At the event, Apple also announced updates to its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Mac operating system. The company also refreshed the operating system on the Apple Watch — which will have more Siri integration — and the Apple TV, which will now work with Amazon Video. More expected updates came with the company's MacBook, Mac and iPad Pro lines. The new iPad Pro has a larger screen than its predecessors — 10.5 inches instead of the standard 9.7 inches. There is also a 12.9-inch model; both come with a slew of new productivity features that make them more appealing as laptop replacements. Apple last updated the iPad Pro last fall, when it introduced the smaller model, but the iPad Pro hasn't had a significant performance update since its 2015 release. The company rounded out its computer announcements with devices focused more on the professional market. They include a faster MacBook and MacBook Pro and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro for $1,300. Three iMac models got a processor bump. The company also released a new computer, the iMac Pro. The high-end desktop will cost $5,000 and will ship in December. The HomePod will also go on sale in December. business technology the-switch false after3th true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Apple didn't just announce hardware devices such as the 'HomePod' smart home speaker and new iMacs at its WWDC 2017 developer conference. In addition, the company announced new versions/upgrades to all four of its operating systems - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. The new versions bring both fresh features as well as updates user experiences. iOS 11 The developer preview of the brand-new iOS 11 is available starting today and the first public beta will arrive later this month. The final version of the OS will arrive later this year on iPhone 5s and later, as well as all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation, iPad mini 2 and later, and iPod touch 6th generation devices. The new version of iOS brings an updated Messages app. It now has a redesigned app drawer, along with the ability to sync messages across different devices via iCloud. In addition, Apple Pay in iOS 11 supports person to person payments. Users can send and receive money using the Messages app and the transactions can be authenticated via Touch ID. Siri has also been improved in iOS 11 and uses deep learning technologies. It also has more natural-sounding voice output. The updated Camera app now records videos in the HEVC format that takes less storage space. Same technique is used while taking images. READ ALSO: WWDC 2017: Apple announces iOS 11 with new features, UI changes and more One of the most notable changes has been introduced in the Control Center. It now includes all the options in one window, which can be expanded when the 3D Touch feature is used. In addition, apps such as Apple Maps, HomeKit and Apple Music have received new design and features. Lastly, the App Store has been overhauled with a new interface. tvOS The biggest highlight of tvOS 4, the latest version of Apple TV's OS, is the arrival of Amazon's Prime Video platform to the OS. CEO Tim Cook said that the Amazon Prime app will arrive later this year, but no particular date was mentioned. We assume that the OS will roll out a few days after the unveiling of the new iPhone handsets. As of now, tvOS has content sourced from around 50 partners. READ ALSO: WWDC 2017: Apple 'HomePod' Siri-powered smart speaker announced watchOS 4 As for the new watchOS 4, the platform brings new watch faces. The OS now has a dedicated Siri watch face for easier access to the company's virtual assistant. The particular watch face uses machine learning to adapt to the wearer's daily activities. In addition, when the wearer raises the wrist, the watch face dynamically updates. It also gives access for controlling home app functionalities. The second watch face is the Kaleidoscope watch face, which has a trippy design. It also has multiple styles based on colour patterns from a selected image. Third watch face is the Toy Story Face including three sub watch faces with Toy Story characters Woody, Jesse and Buzz Lightyear. The OS also has an updated Activity app. The app now gives more personalized updates, along with a new monthly challenges feature. There are also new animations for celebrations on achieving health goals. Besides a new UI, the new watchOS 4 brings enhanced pool swim workouts. If the Apple Watch wearer is resting in a pool, the OS will mark it as one complete set of swim. Users can swipe from the workout screen and add a new workout task easily. The OS comes with gym equipment support as well. The watchOS 4 has an updated Music app which can auto sync music based on what you love to listen. It has a new album art on which users can tap and play the music playlist easily. READ ALSO: WWDC 2017: 10.5-inch iPad Pro with A10X CPU announced, 12.9-inch model refreshed macOS High Sierra For desktops and laptops, Apple introduced the new version of macOS. Dubbed macOS High Sierra, the OS includes an enhanced and more powerful Safari browser. It includes a built-in functionality to block video/audio from autoplaying. In addition, there's an Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature which uses machine learning to prevent ads from tracking users, thus enhancing privacy. The OS supports full Screen split view for better multitasking, while using 35% less disk space. The new Photos app gets an enhanced UI along with a new viewing grid, better face recognition feature, and enhanced new editing options. While macOS until now used HFS file system, High Sierra brings the 64-bit Apple File System (APFS) as the new default. The new OS is much safer and secure with native encryption.

In addition, Cook said Apple, headquartered in Cupertino, Northern California, now has 16 million registered software developers worldwide for its consumer electronics, including smartphone known as iPhone, and 3 million of them were added last year.

Those machines relied on Intel's Skylake processors instead of the higher-boosting, more-responsive Kaby Lake mobile chips that launched about two months later. Subsequent complaints about performance, limited memory capacity, and battery life from MacBook Pros may have been related to that choice of CPU. Today, Apple is harmonizing MacBooks and iMacs with Intel's latest CPUs by replacing Skylake with Kaby Lake. iMacs now come with Kaby Lake quad-core CPUs ranging up to 4.2 GHz base and 4.5 GHz Turbo Boost clocks. Apple is also taking this opportunity to add its Fusion Drive hybrid storage system to all 27-inch iMacs, and the highest-end 21.5" iMac will also benefit from that upgrade. New iMacs will come with two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of Thunderbolt 2, and Apple further claims the SSDs in these machines will be 50% faster than those in its outgoing all-in-ones. 21.5" models will top out at 32GB of RAM, and 27" models can take up to 64GB. The latest iMacs will also feature optional Radeon RX 500-series graphics chips. The entry-level 21.5" iMac will rely on its Kaby Lake CPU's Iris Plus graphics, while 4K versions of the 21.5" machine will offer Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560 pixel-pushers with up to 4GB of RAM. The 27" iMac will give buyers a choice of the Radeon Pro 570, Radeon Pro 575, and Radeon Pro 580 graphics processors with up to 8GB of RAM. Apple announced that it's partnering with Valve to bring the SteamVR SDK to the Mac, and the new graphics options for the 27" version offer the hardware foundation required to power VR headsets for folks who prefer to create VR experiences in macOS. Other improvements to the iMac line include displays with 10-bit color support (through dithering) and 500-nit maximum brightness ratings. The 21.5" 4K iMac now starts at $1299, as well. On the mobile Mac side of the aisle, the MacBook's infusion of Kaby Lake lets Apple's thinnest and lightest laptop hold low-power CPUs up to a Core i7 with 1.3 GHz base and 3.6 GHz boost speeds. Apple also says the CPU upgrade allows the MacBook to address twice the maximum amount of memory compared to older models. MacBook SSDs should run up to 50% faster than their predecessors, as well. The 13" MacBook Pros get (presumably dual-core) Kaby Lake Core i7s running at up to 3.5 GHz base and 4.0 GHz Turbo speeds, while the 15" models will get quad-core Core i7s running at up to 3.1 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost speeds. 15" MacBook Pros will also get more powerful discrete graphics chips at the base of the lineup. The 13" MacBook Pro is now more attainable with prices starting at $1299. All of these machines will be available to order today from Apple's online store.

The iMac Pro takes Apple's 5K iMac chassis and crams it full of workstation-class hardware. CPU duties will be handled by what sounds like eight-core, 10-core, and even 18-core versions of Intel's presumably upcoming Skylake Xeons. Graphics power will come courtesy of AMD's Radeon Vega graphics chip with up to 16GB of VRAM on board. The truly insatiable will be able to add 128GB of ECC RAM and 4TB of PCIe SSD storage to their iMac Pros, as well. All that computing power needs copious interconnect bandwidth to communicate with the outside world, and Apple is delivering with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a built-in 10Gb Ethernet NIC. The machine will be VESA-mountable, and its space gray finish won't stand out in the subdued lighting of directors' editing bays. Apple will be introducing the iMac Pro in December with an eight-core Xeon, unspecified Vega graphics hardware, 32GB of ECC RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $4999.

The new release prominently favors the iPad, and for that device, it adds a number of features aimed at improving multitasking and general usability for what we might call "real work." Apple has also decided that it's time to revamp the App Store for the first time in iOS history. Split-screen with drag-and-drop First, those iPad changes. The new app switcher now shows multiple app "cards" in a manner similar to Mission Control and will remember application pairs when they're used in split-screen mode. A newly redesigned Dock should also help with using multiple applications simultaneously. User can summon ithe Dock from anywhere in the OS, and they can fill it with applications of their own choosing or launch Siri suggestions. Dragging an icon from Dock to a side of the app that's currently runnning will fire up split-screen mode. Files application iOS 11 will also support drag-and-drop for text and images, something that'll come in handy in combination with the multitasking improvements. There's also a new Files application similar to macOS' Finder or Windows Explorer. Other than managing "files stored locally" and on multiple cloud services, there's no telling exactly how much depth this app will offer to users. Even so, the inclusion of a central file manager at all is a huge change for iOS, and it might help make the iPad (and iPhone) more useful as general-purpose computing devices. Finally, there's Instant Markup, a feature reminescent of the Surface Pro's pen support, which lets users write notes on top of most applications and then save or share the whole screenshot. While those features may be par for the course on other consumer operating systems, they're new for iOS, and may be a signal that Apple wants to boost iPad sales and push the iPad Pro as a PC replacement, if its recent hardware refresh is any indication. Taking photos and shooting video is one of the most frequent use cases for a mobile device these days, and Apple is acutely aware of that demand. The Photos app in iOS 11 will let users easily clip a small section of a video to create a looping animation, which Apple calls a live photo. Image recognition can help make these loops cross-fade in a natural manner, too. The software will also try and automatically find photos and videos related to the same subject, and offer better tools for simple video editing. In the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the Photos app uses both HEVC and HEIF (a still-image variation of HEVC) codecs for storing videos and photos, something that should help snap-happy users save a fair bit of storage capacity. New Dock and Control Center Since this is the year of machine learning and computer assistants, Apple plans to upgrade Siri in several ways. The assistant now has a more natural voice, and it can process follow-up questions as well as answer with multiple types of results to the same query. The assistant can also perform anticipatory monitoring across multiple applications, like noticing that a user's been checking out a specific city in Safari, or returning to common topics in e-mail threads. The data that Siri learns can then come into play in the form of typing suggestions. Using a phone while driving is a questionable decision, and Apple wants to help people stay on the good side of a car crash. iPhones will now detect when they're connected to CarPlay or use a combination of heuristics from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS data to detect when a person is driving. When the device detects that it's in a moving vehicle, it'll block all notifications and leave its screen blank. Messages sent to the user when the phone's in this mode can get an automatic notification stating that they're driving, although specific contacts will have the ability to "break through" this Aluminum Curtain. Rather surprisingly, Apple's calling this feature Do Not Disturb While Driving. I have two iDevices and will flatly say that the App Store is probably the worst digital storefront (Windows Store included), especially in terms of discoverability and search result relevance. Apple's acutely aware of the long-standing issues with its digital storefront, and is revamping it for iOS 11. Apps and games will each get their own tabs, which will then be further divided across multiple relevant genres. The individual app pages will get a facelift and offer better screenshot and video previews. In-app purchases (IAPs) will also get their own listings, so it'll be easier to both search for them and to see what types of IAPs are available for a specific application. The Control Center has been the subject of a redesign, too. Its main functionality is now presented on a single page, similar to Android's quick settings. More detailed configuration pops up in secondary screens, and Apple says that there's now deep integration with 3D Touch-enabled devices. The Maps application can now show users detailed floor plans and directories of malls across multiple cities. The app's navigation functionality will also display speed limits and offer lane guidance. The Notes app has a particularly neat trick up its sleeve—photograph a document laying on a desk, and the app will automatically perspective- and color-correct it so that you end up with a clean version, close to what you'd get from an actual scanner. As for iOS 11's innards, Metal (not our comments system) has been upgraded to version 2, and it now offers virtual reality support. Apple's ARKit augments those capabilities by offering motion tracking, plane detection, and ambient lighting estimations to applications. The CoreML API provides vision and natural language processing for applications to leverage, as well. Supported devices this time around are iPhones from the 5S on up, all iPad Airs and Pros, the iPad mini 2 or later, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch. There are many, many more changes in iOS 11 than we can discuss here, but Apple has thoroughly detailed them on its preview page. iOS 11 is set to arrive this fall.

The logic of linking Apple TV, a device for watching television over the internet, with Amazon.com Inc's booming video-streaming service looks obvious. Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them - and buy more toilet paper, too. Viewers want to watch their favorite programs on whatever device they choose. Yet Monday's announcement, rather than being routine, was the result of a negotiation stretching back at least to 2015 when Amazon stopped selling Apple TVs on its retail site. Amazon had explained that move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who would expect Prime Video to be on devices sold by Amazon. Critics instead saw a negotiating tactic to get Prime Video onto the Apple device, and a prod for people to buy Amazon's competing Fire TV players. Advertisement Advertisement "Whenever these companies try to freeze each other out, the consumer always loses," said Paul Verna, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Amazon and Apple declined to comment on how their differences have affected customers. The companies said Amazon shows will be available on Apple TV later this year, but did not specify a date. Streaming is not the only example where a spat between Apple and Amazon limited customer choice. Amazon's popular voice-controlled speaker, the Echo, can be told to play songs from an Amazon music account or even Spotify, but not from Apple Music. Amazon's Kindle app for Apple's iPhone lets people read but not buy books, which must be purchased directly from Amazon's website. According to former Amazon employees, the company at times brings in tangential business concerns as leverage in negotiations. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget "The outcomes of these deals may factor into future conversations," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. It was not clear how Amazon and Apple came to terms on the video player. Analysts estimate that the ascendance of Prime Video gave Amazon a better starting point for negotiations. Its shows and films have started winning awards, including three Oscars in 2017. The internet video player with most market share, Roku, not only offers Prime Video but has a smaller price tag than Apple TV. "It put Apple TV at a big disadvantage," said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TVEV. Amazon declined to comment on whether it will again sell Apple TVs.

Apple also announced updates to its iPad Pro tablets, which were last updated in March 2016. The smaller version's screen is getting a size bump from 9.7" to 10.5". Apple shrunk the bezels of its mini-Pro to keep the one-pound weight and exterior dimensions about the same. The new 10.5" and 12.9" iPad Pros boast screens with a rated brightness of 600 cd/m². Intriguingly, these screens support variable-refresh-rate technology, which Apple calls "ProMotion." iOS uses this VRR tech to crank up refresh rates to 120 Hz for smooth motion during scrolling and user input, while more static content can be displayed at lower refresh rates for power savings. The smaller iPad Pro's bigger screen has productivity benefits: two apps can be shown side-by-side, just like they can on the larger 12.9" iPad Pro. The old 9.7" model could display one half-size app and a second in a narrower, phone-like part of the screen. Apple debuted a new SoC for both of its new iPads. The A10X Fusion chip has three high-performance cores and another three optimized for efficiency. The presumably proprietary integrated graphics processor comprises 12 "cores," and Apple says it can deliver up to 40% faster graphics performance than the old model. Apple further claims the internal battery will be able to deliver 10 hours of use between charges. The new iPads get a boost in the storage department, too. 64 GB is the new baseline, and 256 GB and 512 GB capacities are optional. Apple cribbed the seven-megapixel front camera and 12-MP rear unit from the iPhone 7. As a final flourish, the company cut input latency down to 20 ms for the Apple Pencil with the new iPads. The base-model 10.5" iPad Pro will sell for $650, and the refreshed 12.9" model will start at $800. Both models will be available for order next week.

To be "smart," the latest product in Apple's portfolio, known as HomePod, comes with a A8 microprocessor chip, the same power engine in the company's flagship iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet computer. To be available on the market in December this year, the compact wireless speaker has some identical functions offered by similar products made by other companies, such as Amazon Echo, but promises to produce sound with higher quality, Xinhua reported. HomePod is deemed a more expensive competitor of Echo, which was released two years ago. Meanwhile, at a San Jose venue in Northern California, Apple's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook opened the Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, with announcement that Prime Video, a video streaming service that is operated by Amazon.com, will be integrated into Apple TV, a digital media player and microconsole. In addition, Cook said Apple, headquartered in Cupertino, Northern California, now has 16 million registered software developers worldwide for its consumer electronics, including smartphone known as iPhone, and 3 million of them were added last year. He claimed this year's WWDC is the largest of the kind for the technology company. At the event, a parade of executives unveiled updates to Apple's hardware, software and mobile applications, or apps, including iMac desktop computer, MacBook laptop machine, iPad, Apple Watch, iOS software operating system and App Store. The company said its App Store has so far paid out $70 billion to developers, of which 30 per cent was made last year. --IANS qd./ SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Media under pressure Modi-fying bilateral relations: PM's four-nation Europe tour 'Mor' about law!

Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: ___ SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. ___ A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and centre. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. ___ A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. ___ NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. ___ UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Apple Inc.

By Tiernan Ray June 5, 2017 6:49 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Here are some things going on today in your world of tech: Shares of computer chip maker Microchip Technologies (MCHP) are up 97 cents, or 1%, at $85.48, in late trading, after the company after market close narrowed its forecast for its fiscal Q1 ending in June. The company now sees revenue rising 4.5% to 6%, better than its prior view of 2% to 7%. EPS is now seen in a range of $1.22 to $1.26, up from a prior $1.17 to $1.27. That is better than Street consensus for 4% growth and $1.21 per share. CEO Steve Sanghi said that “while we are adding capacity in numerous areas, we expect that it could take another year for our inventories and lead times to return to more normal levels." Apple's dev show Shares of Apple (AAPL) are down $1.63, or 1%, at $153.82, after the company this afternoon hosted software developers in San Jose for its annual WWDC conference, where it unveiled something called “HomePod,” a 6.8-inch tall cylinder wrapped in speaker mesh, in black or in white, that features Apple’s “A8” processor. It is the long-awaited competitor to Amazon’s (AMZN) “Echo” home assistant line. The company also updated its Mac computers, its MacBook Pro laptop tine, and its iPad tablets, and its mobile, desktop and “WatchOS” software. Former Apple analyst Gene Munster, on hand at the event, declares HomePod is a “winner,” though he is still waiting for a major upgrade of the capabilities of Apple’s “Siri” assistant technology. Today’s 1.5% decline was just slightly more than the 1.2% average of the last nine years, as Walter Piecyk of BTIG noted this morning. iPhone expectations too high? Speaking of Apple, Pacific Crest's Andy Hargreaves cut his rating on the stock to Sector Weight from Overweight, arguing investors' expectations for Apple's presumed forthcoming iPhone 8 have gotten out of hand. The device is unlikely to add as many new users as people expect, especially as those willing to spend more than $800 or more for a phone aren't that many. Criteo hit by ad blocking A casualty of Apple's event is Criteo (CRTO), the advertising technology company, whose shares fell $3.88, over 7%, to close at $48.80, as Apple unveiled a function coming in an update to its Safari browser that will block ads from automatically loading in a Web site, as described by Cnet’s Shara Tibken. Cutting Veeva Shares of life sciences cloud software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV) closed down 98 cents, or 1.5%, at $65.72, after Morgan Stanley’s Stan Zlotsky cut his rating on the shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, but raised his price target to $68 from $53, writing that the 60% jump in the shares this year leaves little upside. He writes, "Veeva's management team has executed very well since IPO and we expect similar results going forward, as the company penetrates opportunities outside of the core life sciences." T-Mo, Sprint all-stock deal Speculation continues about a potential merger of T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S). Alex Sherman and Scott Moritz with Bloomberg this afternoon report that multiple unnamed sources are telling them that the duo are “in early-stage discussions” about “an all-stock deal that would avoid the need for financing” as one "potential option." Watch WDC and Toshiba In the ongoing struggle between Toshiba (6502JP) and its NAND join venture partner Western Digital (WDC), Mizuho’s Vijay Rakesh today reiterates a Buy rating on Western stock, writing that “we believe June-July will be key months for WDC investors.” That follows Toshiba’s announcement last week that it intends to sort through potential bidders for the bidders for the chip unit and pick just one. Western CEO Steve Milligan is expected to meet with Toshiba’s president this week. A report today by Nikkei Asia Review said Apple and Amazon are going to support a bid by electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW). Verizon and Pandora Following speculation last month that Pandora Media (P) is intent on selling itself, comes a report yesterday by The New York Post’s Claire Atkinson stating Verizon Communications (VZ) is looking to make an investment in Pandora of $100 million if the company is not able to strike a deal with SiriusXM (SIRI) to buy Pandora, citing multiple unnamed sources. This follows a report two weeks ago by the Post that SiriusXM was holding talks with Pandora about a deal. eBay's hidden charms Shares of eBay (EBAY) closed up 23 cents, or 0.7%, at $35.55, after Credit Suisse's Paul Bieber took over coverage from colleague Stephen Ju, and raised his rating to Outperform from Neutral, while raising the price target to $44 from $34, arguing investors aren't giving proper credit to the company's two big businesses outside of auctions, its classified listings and its StubHub ticket operation, both of which he thinks could someday follow PayPal (PYPL) to the public markets. Snap's seasonality Shares of messaging app-cum-camera company Snap (SNAP) closed down 88 cents, or 4%, at $20.21, after J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth cut estimates, warning the company’s seasonally-sensitive advertising revenue may be hit in Q3 by a lack of Olympics and political ads. Anmuth also lowered figures for how many new users the company may add, and for how many of its "Specs" sunglasses it may sell.

The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal . Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino ' s Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers ' lives better , such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

The HomePod speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7-inch model couldn’t, yet isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple is updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It has enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Photos Click to enlarge Keywords iPad, Samsung, Google, Apple, iPhone, Mac, VR, homepod Tech Japanese mobile carriers begin testing ultrafast 5G tech Blockchain, technology behind Bitcoin, emerges as key tool in food safety battle Takeoff and cruise: Toyota-backed startup tests ‘flying car’ prototype At the Tokyo Toy Show, a blend of old and new targets fans of all ages Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now Tackling signs in Japan that you’re not welcome Merkel wrong about Trump, Brexit Mitsubishi Heavy unveils first F-35 stealth fighter assembled in Japan Learn Japanese as you binge with Netflix anime series Indoor smoking ban shelved as LDP and health ministry reach impasse, sources say Western Digital gives up on buying majority stake in Toshiba chip unit High infidelity: Ayumi Ito reprises her role in ‘Hirugao’ Seven more Fukushima residents diagnosed with thyroid cancer Blogs Japan Pulse Yen for Living BACK TO TOP The Japan Times on Sunday The Japan Times ST Jobs Study in Japan JT for Women JT Bookclub Japanese School Directory Email Updates | Home Delivery RSS Twitter Facebook Newsletter News National World Business Asia Pacific Reference Columns Multimedia Opinion Editorials Commentary Reader Mail Cartoons Life Travel Digital Food & Drink Environment Style & Design Language Lifestyle People Columns Multimedia Community Voices Issues Our Lives Event Listings How-tos Columns Culture Film Music Art Stage Events Festivals Books TV Columns Multimedia Sports Baseball Soccer Basketball Sumo Rugby Figure Skating Tennis More Sports Columns Multimedia About us Contact us Privacy Policy Link Policy Reprints FAQs Support Press Sitemap Advertise The Japan Times LTD.

The new models continue to come in 21.5 inch and 27 inch varieties, but the smaller model now supports up to 32GB of RAM and Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics for entry-level models or AMD Radeon Pro 555 or Pro 560 graphics on higher-end configurations. Apple’s new 27 inch iMac supports up to 64GB of RAM, comes with up to 2TB of solid state storage and a Fusion Drive that’s 50 percent faster than other SSDs (according to Apple), and each version supports 10-bit HEVC/H.265 video decoding. The 5K 27-inch iMac is available with Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 graphics options, and every new model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new models also have displays that are 43 percent brighter than their predecessors, and which support 1-bit dithering and a billion colors. Among other things, the new iMacs support Apple’s new Metal 2 graphics technology with support for external graphics, Steam VR, and the Unity and Unreal engines. Prices for the new iMac start at $1099. The announcement came during today’s WWDC keynote, where Apple also introduced watchOS 4, Mac OS X High Sierra, and teased an update for Apple TV: Amazon Prime Video support is coming to the TV app later this year. There’s also a new iMac Pro that offers up to an 18-core Intel Xeon processor, and Apple’s MacBook laptop lineup is also getting a spec bump.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Apple updates iMac lineup with Kaby Lake chips, better graphics, improved screens" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Max L L Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple MacBook laptops go Kaby Lake 06/05/2017 at 2:36 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Apple is updating its MacBook line of laptops with new models sporting Intel Kaby Lake processors, solid state drives that are up to 50 percent faster than their predecessors, and higher-performance graphics for the new 15 inch MacBook Pro. Prices start at $1299 for the new MacBook models. That’s the price for either an entry-level MacBook or a 13 inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. Apple’s latest MacBook supports up to a 1.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, measures about half an inch thick, and weighs about 2 pounds. Apple says it now supports up to twice as much memory as earlier models. The new 13 inch MacBook Pro is available with up to a 3.5 GHz Core i7 processor, and the 15 inch models now come with discrete graphics on all models. The new MacBook Pro 13 inch laptop with Touch Bar starts at $1799, while the new 15 inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399. Apple is also updating the MacBook Air with a more modest spec bump: the company says it’s giving it a CPU “megahertz” bump to bring it a bit more in line with the company’s other laptops. The new Apple laptops should be available starting today, and they’ll all support the new features in Mac OS X High Sierra that Apple’s introducing at WWDC today, including a speeider version of the Safari web browser (with automatic blocking of auto-playing videos), improved Mail and Photos apps, and more.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HomePod is Apple’s answer to the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Sonos speakers 06/05/2017 at 3:29 PM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Apple is launching its first Siri-powered home speaker. It’s called HomePod, and on the one hand it seems like a rather late entry into the space first created by the launch of the Amazon Echo in 2014. But Apple thinks HomePod will stand out in a few ways. The company says the HomePod offers the kind of audio quality you’d expect from a high-end WiFi speaker from a company like Sonos as well as the smarts you’d expect from something like an Amazon Echo or Google Assistant. The most important thing though? It’s tied into Apple’s ecosystem… so if you’re already using an iPhone, iPad, and Mac… this is probably the speaker you’re going to want. You can use the “Hey Siri” wake word to interact with HomePod, control smart home devices that are tied into Apple’s HomeKit ecosystem, and stream music from Apple Music, among other things. It also supports news updates, traffic alerts, stock information, alarms and timers, translation, and other features. It can answer questions, just like Siri on a phone or other device. And there’s a 6-microphone array to pick up your voice from across a room. There’s also a 7 beam-forming tweeter array and directional control to fill a room with music. Apple’s HomePod speaker measures about 7 inches tall and has a vaguely familiar design. And since it’s compatible with the multi-room audio capabilities baked into the Apple Airplay 2 service that rolls out with iOS 11, you could buy a few HomePods and use them to create a whole-home speaker solution similar to what you can get from a set of Sonus speakers. But generally speaking, if you’re not already using Apple products? Then I’m not sure why you’d buy HomePod unless you’re really dissatisfied with the audio quality of Google Home or Amazon Echo devices (in which case you could just spend $50 on an Echo Dot and plug it into a high-end speaker). Apple’s HomePod ships in the US, UK, and Australia in December, and it will eventually make its way to additional markets.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. I think you are essentially wrong. Though I didn’t see the presentation and have only had time to catch some headlines so far. Apple seems to be pushing this speaker for its sonic ability. I believe the on-device processing they are referencing is to do with spatial processing to deliver the best sound in the context of your particular physical environment. Kind of like most home tuners have done for years now is my guess. Where you plug in a mic and it runs some tests and adjusts the output for best results in your space. For voice processing they don’t have the power yet to do it all on device. Just some keywords. Really it’s kind of irrelevant anyway as most of the stuff you want to know it has to go to the internet for anyway. I mean I suppose it could set some alarms/timers for you. I’m… Read more » Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 2 days 14 hours ago Guest savagemichael Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Apple people are well known for being happy to part with cash more often but I think Apple has probably gone a little too far here at $350. Most people never see the high retail cost of iPhones because the monthly charge is just wrapped up in their cell bill. iPads have always commanded more cash and so generally have Macbooks and such. However they have both typically delivered more for that extra money than the competition in ways that are meaningful to enough people. A $350 single speaker though? I think they’ll end up like Apple Watch. Meaning they’ll actually sell decently well but in nothing like the numbers people demand of an Apple product to be ‘successful’. To that end I think the reporting next year this time will mostly be about why the Homepod has ‘failed’, whether that’s necessarily fair or not. And I think that will… Read more » Vote Up2Vote Down  Reply 2 days 13 hours ago Guest Neoprimal Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. The added benefits of better sonics and similarity to what Sonos offers may afford them the shadow of a doubt of selling better than so-so. Sonos speakers aren’t cheap – they sound great, and being able to put 2-4 speakers to fill a big room completely is something that many people want. I own a Bose Soundlink 3 and while I took a chance on buying it, I’m really happy that I did – they are awesome speakers with full sound. You turn them all the way down and you can still hear every word that’s coming from someone singing or speaking, in crystal clarity. I think this is what ‘makes’ a good speaker. The difference here is that this is Apple, and not because it costs more does it mean it really is ‘better’. For all we know they used the same parts as Amazon or Google did for… Read more » Vote Up-2Vote Down  Reply 2 days 1 minute ago Guest BoloMKXXVIII Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I would be willing to bet that Apple’s speaker sounds better than Amazon’s or Google’s speakers. The problem with that is I added three audio chromecasts to the stereos I have around the house. For less than $100 I can now fill the entire house with music. The speakers I already own will definitely sound better than any of the above mentioned devices. If you need portable, Bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen. Any smartphone can perform the search functions. Is tapping a button so hard? The smartphone is always with you. These speakers (unless you buy several) will only live in one room.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Siri taking the spotlight at Apple's annual developers conference. The company rolled out a HomePod home speaker that uses Siri to send texts, check news, and control home gadgets. (SOUNDBITE) TIM COOK, APPLE CEO, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "A breakthrough home speaker with amazing sound and incredible intelligence. It will reinvent home audio." It also made its voice activated assistant available across all its devices. Other new products include a new operating system for the iPhone, peer-to-peer payments in Apple Pay, and a software tool for making augmented reality. Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Capital says all this adds to Apple's already strong position in the global markets. (SOUNDBITE) MAX WOLFF, MARKET STRATEGIST, 55 CAPITAL (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Apple has done something that no one else has been able to do, which is sell a product to the whole world at a ridiculously high premium price with a thirty to forty percent profit margin. Usually, almost always, the law of gravity is, you either sell a whole a lot or you sell at a high price. Apple figured out a way to do both." Despite all the new products Apple announced, its stock fell. Pacific Crest earlier downgraded its shares to "sector weight" from "overweight". Wolff says he's not worried about the stock. Apple shares have already risen by a third this year.

provided by Kantar Millward Brown 06 Jun, 2017, 00:01 BST Share this article LONDON, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the Top 5 places in the 2017 BrandZTM Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/513554/Kantar_Millward_Brown_Logo.jpg ) Amazon achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion (+41%) to $139.3bn to take the no. 4 position. The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal. Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino's Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers' lives better, such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

Tim Cook is pumped. It’s been earned. I don’t know how to says this any more bluntly. This keynote was pure genius. Apple’s keynote was a bases-loaded home run. It was a 21 point Superbowl comeback in the 4th quarter. Instead of time wasters and filler, we got amazing glimpses at what Apple has been working hard on since the last keynote. The next macOS continues to be refined while committing to APFS sooner than some expected. We were hoping for new hardware, but even in our hopes, conditioned by previous keynotes, we didn’t think so much new hardware would ship immediately (iMacs) or next week (iPads). We got a tantalizing glimpse of an iMac Pro, 22 teraflops, up to 128 GB of RAM, a Mac to die for, due out this December. Major improvements were discussed to iOS 11 and the iPad hardware that finally make the iPad a compelling, powerful tool. The Files feature was hinted at, but the immediacy of it in the keynote was a visual stunner. Apple Pay person-to-person payments. Yes! Serious attention to graphics performance, VR and AR. HomePod looks to be a stellar smart speaker system and will be launched in December with a very un-Apple-like, modest price of US$349. And that’s just an overview of what was introduced. Stunning Apple has taken a lot of heat in the last year for not delivering new products that were compelling. The Mac had been ignored. The iPad seemed to be stagnant in its technology. iOS was having trouble making the transition to a creation tool on iPad. Amazon was grabbing all the mind share around smart speakers. We weren’t sure Apple would fous on extremely high end graphics needed for first class VR and AR. But every negative has been remedied. This keynote showed Apple in a feisty mood. The company came out swinging for the fences. The atmosphere was that of a company that was tired of being seen as lagging behind, not innovative, and resting on its iPhone laurels. Now, there’s so much excitement, so much to talk about that we’ll all be busy for months sorting everything out. Thanks Apple. You nailed it all. This keynote was dazzling, the best in years. Apple is back.

(BTW, you might want to proof your 5th bullet point. Either that or the new iPad Pro is astounding) This is going to be a good year. I have to admit I skipped over the AppleTV and Apple Watch portions. Those aren’t part of my world. Maybe a watch with new hardware this fall, maybe. And the Apple speaker was interesting. I did not expect them to really dive in. A very good idea to position it as an exemplary speaker, oh that can also do these other things rather than a mediocre speaker that listens in to everything you say, transmits to home base, and then orders stuff for you. I was completely gobsmacked that they updated the MacBook Air. I was sure it was EOL The new iPads are fantastic. Might have to consider updating my iPad Air this fall. Lets see what the reviews are and how much I lose by not having a Pro version. Drag and drop is a lot bigger than most people probably realize. To drag and drop text from one app to another they must have overhauled how text is selected. That would be fantastic, and sorely needed. The new iMacs are great. I got one of the old 27″ 5K models last fall but you know, Kaby Lake isn’t THAT much faster than the chip in my iMac. Sure the TB3 and USB-C ports would be nice. But I don’t really need them right now. And the new graphics chip is a bump up from what I have, but…but really I’m OK really with the one in my system. It’s fast enough for what I do. And I got to use my new 5K iMac for six months already so it’s fine. What’s that? They also dropped the price? And added an upcoming Pro version with a Xion processor? Well sonnava******* No but it’s really OK. June 5, 2017 at 5:15 EDT PM John Martellaro June 5, 2017 geoduck. Typo fixed in bullet #5. Thanks! I think the MacBook Air survives thanks to the education market. At a local community college, in the bookstore, they sell a new MBA + MS Office (1 yr sub.) for $599. I agree on iPad. These new iPad Pros combined with iOS 11 will have me buying a new iPad soon. June 5, 2017 at 5:21 EDT PM geoduck June 5, 2017 Aha! The now iMac does not have user upgradeable RAM. I’m glad I got the old one. June 5, 2017 at 7:10 EDT PM DavidLeedy June 5, 2017 Modest price of $349? for a Speaker? I think that’s a very high price. It pretty much does what the Amazon Echo does and that’s $179 with regular discounts I believe. Ok I’m sure this speaker will sound better.. and it’ll connect to Siri and the apple echo system better… but at the end of the day for “normal” users and not true audiophiles is it giving that much more functionality then the Echo? $170? or almost twice the price? I don’t think so. I think they’re pricing is way out of line here. June 5, 2017 at 7:17 EDT PM Jamie June 5, 2017 I must be past the point of no return in my cynicism, I wasn’t super excited about anything they announced today. Egad, have I become a troll? 😉 A not very upgradeable iMac for the price of a used car? iPod Hifi 2.0? The problem with iPad Pros is also partly the screen size for a lot of work, adding features can’t change that. I haven’t ever been interested in Watch. Ditto for AR and VR. I really don’t care about Michelle Obama’s opinions. It was a complete bust for me. Honestly, the only thing that made me go, ‘Cool!’, was Prime coming to Apple TV. June 5, 2017 at 7:33 EDT PM Customized Marketing June 5, 2017 Yes, it was perfect! Agree completely with your review.Never expected that much in 1 keynote, but very happy with the new products and os enhancements. I think the speaker pricing was adding a Sonos Play 1 with features like the Echo. June 5, 2017 at 9:22 EDT PM vpndev June 6, 2017 Am I the only one who noticed the “Apple Pay Cash Card” ?? It’s there at ~55 minutes into the stream. No other mention, but this could be huge. June 6, 2017 at 2:59 EDT AM iGrouch June 6, 2017 Emperors New Clothes I’m afraid. At this stage, Apple is taking the piss and it comes down to one think the cost of working with Apple hardware. As always Apple presented some impressive technology. But consider this. To buy a new extended keyboard now costs €149 because the older wired version at €54 is no longer available. I can’t see many spending over €5,000 on an iMac, and don’t get me wrong, it is impressive but not when it is not very upgradable. All this proves that Apple is focused on catering to the upper middle classes with more money than sense. It is a boutique company and the reason that I went the Hackintosh route many years ago and will remain on it for the foreseeable future. My Mac Pro 1.1 served me well between 2006 – 2014. Well worth the investment at the time. Apple had a golden age between 2006 -2010 but then hey dropped the ball around 2010 when the original iconic Mac Pro was more or less abandoned. Johnny Ive et al had visions of compact versions where they did not see the merit of the Porsche of computers. It’s all a shame really as the OS is well ahead of anything else out there but when added to the hot air, flash in the pan, crassness that is evident in the tech world, it has be said that we have a long way to go before the tech industry has truly matured. What I mean by that is a lot of what we see is superficial. June 6, 2017 at 5:00 EDT AM Scott B in DC June 6, 2017 When can we start the jokes about High Sierra and the legalization of recreational marijuana in California (#justsayin) June 6, 2017 at 11:03 EDT AM DMO June 6, 2017 No, you aren’t. I was wondering how it worked to receive a payment, and although you can transfer the funds to a bank account, I think the float may be substantial. Would that be competition for Paypal? And if it were to become a physical card, as well . . . June 6, 2017 at 3:53 EDT PM wab95 June 6, 2017 John: I was trying to watch the live stream during a conference call concerning some real science (I know…but at least I wasn’t chairing the call), and had to go back and look at specific parts after the call. Here’s my personal take. Apple got serious about addressing the criticism with which they have been excoriated these past couple of years, particularly following the last keynote. In particular, they have responded to the issue of a professional machine (expandability may still need to be addressed with a future Mac Pro – if there is to be one), including multiple configurational options to fit varying needs. They have responded to the issue of processor iteration with the adoption of the 7th generation Intel chip set. They have responded to the MS challenge of processing power on a tablet device with one that excels the power on many current PCs, and they have addressed the issue of multi-tasking by unleashing differential features and performance of iOS on the iPad vs the iPhone, thereby making the iPad more Mac-like. One can quibble as to whether it is sufficiently feature – rich, but we can at least have that discussion. On a more personal note, once the presentation had sunk in, I felt like an immigrant to the West from a small town in the former Soviet Union who walks into a supermarket for the first time in his life. So. Many. Choices. And to quote one such immigrant, one is nearly paralysed by choice. I am now cycling back and forth on which options I am likely to pursue, and in what order. The new iPad Pro will be for me a no-brainer, to borrow a phrase. I increasingly use my iPad professionally, and this looks like a worthy upgrade, although I need to better understand which features are hardware vs the soon to be released iOS 11. I’ve decided that I can wait until the Fall, in any case, when iOS 11 is released to make that purchase and then hand my current iPad Pro to my son, who is an avid iPad user. The hard choice is on the mix of laptop and, for the first time in years, a possible desktop. I’d be lying if said that I’m not interested in the iMac Pro. With a beast like that on my desk, I could easily get by with a far less capable laptop. The only problem is, I travel. I mean, I really travel and will deploy for months at a time if I’m running a clinical trial overseas. The iMac Pro then might as well be on Mars. So there’s that. I didn’t get the first touch bar MBP, as I wanted to wait for the Kaby Lake processors. Now they’re here. But, if I get either an iMac Pro, or even a 5K iMac, I could go with a 13” MBP (which I’ve never used – but it’s cheaper and still highly capable) or even a MB. Given what I do, the modest price differential between the top end MB and a 13” fully kitted MBP (okay, it’s $900, but over the next 3 – 4 years, chump change), the MB’s value proposition is challenged. If I go with a non-flagship laptop, it will probably be the 13” core i7 MBP. I will need to play with one first, as the 15” was a real change from my old 17”, and importantly, the 13” is a dual core, whereas the 15” is quad-core, which could make a difference when crunching through large data sets and generating graphical outputs. Needless to say, these would be a small snack for an iMac Pro. Yes, I’ve got some thinking to do, but time to do it. Once I’ve made my purchases, I may also have some ‘splainin’ to do with the Mrs as well as with my grants administration – depending on purchase patterns. The burden of choice. So great to have it back. In spades. June 6, 2017 at 4:06 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Amazon-Apple TV deal shows tough road to cooperation for tech rivals By Reuters Published: 18:54 EDT, 5 June 2017 | Updated: 18:54 EDT, 5 June 2017 e-mail By Jeffrey Dastin SAN FRANCISCO, June 5, (Reuters) - A deal bringing Amazon Prime Video to Apple TV, announced on Monday at Apple Inc's developer conference after years of talk, shows how competitive tensions among Silicon Valley titans can stand in the way of serving customers. The logic of linking Apple TV, a device for watching television over the internet, with Amazon.com Inc's booming video-streaming service looks obvious. Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them - and buy more toilet paper, too. Viewers want to watch their favorite programs on whatever device they choose. Yet Monday's announcement, rather than being routine, was the result of a negotiation stretching back at least to 2015 when Amazon stopped selling Apple TVs on its retail site. Amazon had explained that move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who would expect Prime Video to be on devices sold by Amazon. Critics instead saw a negotiating tactic to get Prime Video onto the Apple device, and a prod for people to buy Amazon's competing Fire TV players. "Whenever these companies try to freeze each other out, the consumer always loses," said Paul Verna, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Amazon and Apple declined to comment on how their differences have affected customers. The companies said Amazon shows will be available on Apple TV later this year, but did not specify a date. Streaming is not the only example where a spat between Apple and Amazon limited customer choice. Amazon's popular voice-controlled speaker, the Echo, can be told to play songs from an Amazon music account or even Spotify, but not from Apple Music. Amazon's Kindle app for Apple's iPhone lets people read but not buy books, which must be purchased directly from Amazon's website. According to former Amazon employees, the company at times brings in tangential business concerns as leverage in negotiations. "The outcomes of these deals may factor into future conversations," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. It was not clear how Amazon and Apple came to terms on the video player. Analysts estimate that the ascendance of Prime Video gave Amazon a better starting point for negotiations. Its shows and films have started winning awards, including three Oscars in 2017. The internet video player with most market share, Roku, not only offers Prime Video but has a smaller price tag than Apple TV. "It put Apple TV at a big disadvantage," said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV EV. Amazon declined to comment on whether it will again sell Apple TVs.

(KTRK) AP Monday, June 05, 2017 05:57PM Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Report a typo to the ABC13 staff Report a Typo Related Topics: technologyappleapple watchiPad Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 by The Associated Press.

This is something Apple TV owners have been asking for ever since the fourth-generation set top box was released. Word of Amazon Prime Video arriving on Apple TV was leaked in early May 2017, but nothing was set in stone. With today’s announcement, Apple TV users can be confident of having a much better home theater experience in the near future. After all, until now, watching Amazon Prime Video was available only through the iOS app, which includes AirPlay support. It isn’t yet clear if Amazon Prime Video will be integrated into the TV app on tvOS, or come only as a standalone app. It seems likely, however, that Cupertino would bake that support straight into the TV app. Amazon ceased selling Apple TV devices in October 2015, citing customer confusion over which devices would support their Prime account. Today’s announcement means the Apple TV should return to Amazon’s marketplace in the near future. Apple CEO Tim Cook also said there would be more news about tvOS “later this year.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV You might also like… Get Free Bitcoins from 21 Faucets That Pay Apple’s Rumored Siri Speaker Targets Sonos, Too Here are the iPhones and iPads that Won't Run iOS 11 Now That Apple’s Announced the iMac Pro, What Does This Mean for Mac Pro Design? - Page 2 of 3 Apple's WWDC Keynote Was One We Never Dreamed Could Happen Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The feature is the first time Apple has given users access to any aspect of the file system in iOS, and marks a major step forward in making iPad into computer replacement. This is a living document until we complete updates after the WWDC keynote. “The new Files app keeps everything in one place,” Apple said, “whether files are stored locally, in iCloud Drive or across other providers like Box, Dropbox and more, and with Drag and Drop available across the system, moving images and text is easier than ever.” Craig Federighi demos Files app in iOS 11 at WWDC Though announced as part of senior vice president Craig Federighi’s iOS 11 for iPad presentation, Jeff Butts installed the developer preview on iPhone 7 Plus, where Files worked. We’re early in the beta process, though, and it remains to be seen whether Apple intends this feature to be available across iOS devices.

After detailing how the iPod revolutionized music and then the iPhone did so again, Cupertino had one last announcement. To revolutionize the home music experience, Apple is releasing the HomePod, a wireless smart speaker with amazing sound and capabilities. The new HomePod looks and should sound gorgeous It’s Time to Reinvent Home Music Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vide president of Worldwide Marketing, was extremely enthusiastic about how HomePod will reinvent home music. Apple reinvented portable music with iPod and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes. HomePod packs powerful speaker technology, Siri intelligence and wireless access to the entire Apple Music library into a beautiful speaker that is less than 7 inches tall, can rock most any room with distortion free music and be a helpful assistant around your home. The smart speaker features an Apple-designed upward-facing woofer, paired with a custom A8 chip to provide bass management through real-time software modeling. This makes sure the speaker delivers the deepest, cleanest bass possible, with little to no distortion. Not to leave out the high end, there’s a custom array of seven beam-forming tweeters in the base of HomePod. Each has its own amplifier, providing well-balanced, smooth timbre and precise directional control of a multitude of beam shapes and sizes. With automatic room-sensing technology, HomePod can learn its position in a room, whether it’s in a corner, on a table, or on a bookshelf. Within seconds, it optimizes the sound output to deliver an immersive music listening experience wherever your HomePod is placed. Finally, if you have two HomePod speakers, they automatically detect each other and balance the sound, using direct and reflected audio, to deliver a much more immersive experience. A Siri-Controlled Home Speaker and Assistant The HomePod, at its heart, has Siri to help you. Six microphones are arrayed on top of the device, with echo cancellation, to understand people whether they are near the device or standing across the room. HomePod can even hear it being called when loud music is playing. As a musicologist, Siri can answer questions like who the drummer is in a song, learn your music preferences across hundreds of genres and moods, and share your music tastes across your devices. You can create a queue, and stream anything from your iCloud Music Library or Apple Music. For the privacy of its users, HomePod doesn’t transfer any information to Apple until it recognizes “Hey Siri” locally on the device. Even then, the communication is encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identified. This means that Apple doesn’t know who is using the HomePod, and you can rest assured that your privacy is protected. As a home assistant, HomePod will be able to send messages, get news and weather updates, or control smarthome devices using HomeKit. When away from home, HomePod can act as a remote access hub for your smarthome devices, as Apple TV and iPad do currently. HomePod Availability HomePod will begin shipping in December 2017, and will retail for $349. It will be available in white or space gray.

Show More Editors’ note: We’ve updated this story to include an expanded iOS 11 FAQ. Siri in iOS 11 has learned to sound like an actual human—and that’s just the beginning when it comes to the new mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Apple CEO Tim Cook and friends gave us a full overview of iOS 11 during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday. New features include sweeping new upgrades to Siri, a redesigned Control Center and App Store, and a brand-new Apple Pay feature that lets you send or receive money to your contacts via iMessage. In addition, developers can now create apps that tap into your iOS device’s potential to create augmented reality experiences via the new ARKit. Plus, there are new productivity features for the iPad, including drag-and-drop capability and a new Mac-style Dock. Here’s everything we know so far about iOS 11, plus a few of the new features that we can’t wait to try. What iOS devices will it run on? The following iPhones: iPhone 7/Plus iPhone 6s/Plus iPhone 6/Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s  The following iPads: iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch) iPad Air iPad Air 2 iPad (5th generation) iPad mini 2/3/4 Plus, the iPod Touch (6th generation) Apple When will it be available? Following a series of developer and public betas this summer, Apple will make iOS 11 available to everyone as a free upgrade later this fall—likely around the same time as the launch of the next iPhone, typically in early or mid-September. Can I test the iOS 11 public beta? Yes, Apple will probably start rolling out the first public beta in June and anyone can give it a whirl (at their own risk). First, log in to the Beta Software Program page using your Apple ID and click on the link to enroll your iOS device. In order to download and install a configuration profile, you’ll be instructed to go to beta.apple.com/profile on the iOS device that you want to put the beta on—that will make the beta available as an over-the-air software update in the Settings app. Just remember that this is a beta version of the new software, so make sure you backup your iOS device before venturing into this unknown territory. Better yet, we recommend installing the public beta profile on a secondary iOS device (if you have one) so that you can test it without fear that it will screw something up. What’s new with Siri? The first new thing you’ll notice about Siri in iOS 11 is her more-natural sounding voice. However, she also looks a little different: Apple has given its voice assistant a new visual interface that surfaces multiple results for your requests, as well as followup questions. In addition, Siri can now translate phrases for you, from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This feature is in beta, and Apple will add more languages in the months to come. Apple Siri has also become more predictive across different iOS apps. For example, if you search for “Iceland” in Safari, Siri will surface Iceland-related articles in the News app and bring up QuickType suggestions in Icelandic. Or, if you get a text message asking for money, Siri will suggest iMessage’s Apple Pay integration with the exact amount that’s been requested. Apple has also expanded SiriKit support to include more robust integrations with third-party services. You can now use Siri to add to your Evernote or pull up a QR code in WeChat, among other things. How is Apple Pay more like Venmo? You can use Apple Pay at certain brick-and-mortar stores (Apple says 50 percent of U.S. retailers will support Apple Pay by the end of the year), online web stores via Safari, and in certain iPhone apps. With iOS 11, you’ll be able to use Apple Pay to send or receive money from your contacts via Messages, thanks to a new iMessage app which essentially turns Apple Pay into your new Venmo or Square Cash alternative. All the money that you receive will be collected in your Wallet app in the form of a Cash card. You can use these funds to complete other Apple Pay transactions, or you can transfer that cash over to your bank account. Apple Pay’s peer-to-peer transactions will be available in iOS 11 and watchOS 4. Apple Can I do more with Live Photos? Yes! Apple has given us more editing tools for Live Photos, those moving images that you can take using an iPhone 6s and later. You can turn your Live Photos into video loops that replay over... and over... and over. The Photos app will even suggest Live Photos that would make for great loops. You can also add a “Bounce” effect so that the Live Photo plays and then rewinds, kind of like Instagram Boomerangs. There’s also a new Long Exposure effect which makes the iPhone even more like a DSLR. But don’t Live Photos take up a lot of space? That’s true, but thankfully Apple has addressed this issue by switching to a more space efficient encoding system. For videos, iOS 11 uses HEVC (aka H.265), which is twice as efficient as the previous H.264 format. For still photos, iOS 11 uses HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) which Apple claims will take up only half the space. Where will I be able to use Maps indoors? Apple continues to improve the native Maps app in iOS 11. For the first time, you’ll be able to use Maps to navigate your way around indoor spaces. Maps in iOS 11 introduces indoor mapping so you can get detailed floor plans of certain malls and major airports, down to individual vendors on each floor. Apple To start off, Maps will have indoor support for malls in Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Jose, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. Maps will also be able to show you around inside 30 major airports including JFK and London Heathrow. How does “Do Not Disturb While Driving” work? Another feature introduced at WWDC is iOS 11’s “Do Not Disturb While Driving” mode. Your iPhone will use Bluetooth (if connected to CarPlay or any other in-vehicle Bluetooth system) or motion sensors to figure out if you’re driving, and will automatically prevent all notifications from surfacing and causing a distraction. You can override this mode, however, or setup an automatic response to let people who text you know you’re on the road and that you’ll get back to them as soon as you arrive at your destination. What about augmented reality? Tim Cook has spent all year talking about how excited he is for augmented reality, so it’s no surprise that Apple used this year’s WWDC keynote to show off what they’ve been working on in this emerging area. Alongside iOS 11, Apple unveiled ARKit, a new developer platform for creating iOS apps that tap into augmented reality. Apps built with ARKit will be able to use computer vision to identify surfaces and add 3D objects. These objects create dynamic shadows that are rendered in real-time. Did the iPad get more macOS-type features? You bet! There’s a new app Dock that looks a lot like the one in macOS, making it a lot easier to switch between apps. You can also press on any of these apps and drag them over to the right side of the screen to open them as a Slide Over. As always, you can lock Slide Over into Split View to use both apps simultaneously. Apple The Dock can be accessed from any screen and you can customize it with your favorite apps. Also, it has a dynamic section on the right side that changes to suggest recently-used apps across your Apple devices. What about drag-and-drop? Yes! Apple finally answered our prayers. With iOS 11, you can drag-and-drop between the two apps in Split View, which makes it easier to transfer files, images, text, and URLs. You can drag-attach images from the Photos to Mail, or drag-copy-and-paste directions from Safari into Maps. And how does the new Files app work? Apple also launched Files, a new iOS app intended to make the iPad experience more like a traditional Mac. Pretty self-explanatory, Files displays your documents stored in iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, and other file-storage apps. Are there new ways to use Apple Pencil? Yes, Apple has expanded Apple Pencil support for iPad Pro in iOS 11. Tap a PDF or screenshot with the tip of the Pencil and you’ll be able to scribble on it instantly thanks to a new feature called Instant Markup. Similarly, you can Pencil tap on the Lock screen to start writing. All your handwritten creations will be automatically saved to your Notes app, and these handwritten notes are searchable, too. Notes also has a new built-in Document Scanner, allowing you to scan a document, sign it or mark on it with Apple Pencil, then save or share—all with just your iPad Pro. In addition, Notes and Mail now support Inline Drawing so you can add some color to your emails and notes. The text will automatically move out of the way when you start drawing, so that everything remains legible. A few more things... Control Center has been redesigned so that it’s only one panel. You can customize it with your go-to’s like Low-Power Mode and use 3D Touch to adjust more-specific controls. Apple App Store now mirrors the look-and-feel of Apple Music, with a new Today tab for featured games and apps. Messages App Drawer makes it easier to access your favorite iMessage apps by swiping across the bottom of the screen, instead of having to tap back to the drawer every time you want to switch apps. Apple Music gets more social: New profile photos indicate when one of your friends has listened to a certain albums or playlist. QuickType Keyboard is now easier to use one-handed. Simply long-press on the emoji key to bring the keys closer to your thumb. For iPad users, you can now flick down on a specific key to type a number or punctuation mark, instead of having to switch to the symbols keyboard. Stay tuned for more iOS 11 coverage, including hidden features, tips and tricks, and how-to’s for making the most out of your iPhone and iPad.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Apple’s Xcode 9 finally allows iOS app testing over Wi-Fi Blair Hanley Frank@belril June 5, 2017 3:38 PM Above: A photo of the Apple logo at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. Image Credit: VentureBeat/Dean Takahashi Apple is letting developers cut the cord when testing their iOS apps with a new update to Xcode unveiled today. Starting with Xcode 9, developers will be able to deploy applications to an iPhone or iPad over a Wi-Fi network, rather than having to tether the device to a computer using a USB cable. The change drew a massive cheer from the audience at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose. Wireless deployment will help ease testing of new apps, since developers won’t need to keep iPhones anchored to their computers. That’s just one of the updates to Xcode that’s aimed at accelerating developers’ work. Xcode 9 should open-source code files 3 times faster than its predecessor, enabling editors to scroll through them at a consistent 60 frames per second and letting users jump from one line to another 50 times faster than before. The indexers in Xcode have also been rebuilt, which is supposed to make searching through source files 50 times faster than before. Apple also launched a beta of a new build system for Xcode 9 that’s supposed to make building apps up to 2.5 times faster. Apple’s Device Simulator app will let users test multiple device types at once, so they can see how the same app will behave on an Apple Watch, iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV, all at the same time. That’s important for developers who are building apps to run across multiple devices or who just want to test how features will behave across different form factors. A new refactoring system in Xcode 9 will make it easier for developers to apply changes across their application. For example, when developers go to rename a particular method in their code, the Xcode window will fold up the current source file and show snippets of where the soon-to-be-renamed method appears in different files. Xcode 9 is also integrated with GitHub, so that people can access code repositories from the popular site within their development environment. It’s possible to browse commits, readme files, and source code from the IDE. All of these new features are designed to make it faster and easier for developers to work with Apple’s tools so they can more quickly create software for the company’s hardware. Support for wireless deployment comes a month after Microsoft announced Xamarin Live Player, an app that lets developers wirelessly test C# code on iOS and Android devices.

Before Tim Cook even took the stage the room was abuzz with a group of thirsty reporters sharing intel, breaking down rumors, and speculating as to what could be in store this year. Last year we saw Siri come to macOS, improved Messages (with stickers!), and improved continuity between Apple laptops and mobile devices. This year was even more jam-packed than last time around. If you’re keeping score at home, you can measure your predictions in the “what to expect” preview against the wrap-up you’re reading now. The Siri speaker is real, and it’s called… wait for it… HomePod Apple today announced its new smart home speaker designed to compete with the likes of Google and Amazon (Home and Echo). The speaker is 7-inches tall and powered by the A8 chip that once graced the iPhone 6. HomePod has advanced spatial awareness allowing its 4-inch woofer and seven beam-forming tweeters to project sound differently depending on the shape of the room its placed in. Put simply: the smart speaker should sound great no matter where you put it. Better still, you can add a second HomePod and sync the two for a wide stereo soundfield. You can grab yours for $349 in December (US, UK, and Australia). Apple says it’ll be available to the rest of the world soon after. Read: Introducing HomePod: Apple’s poorly-named (and badass) Echo competitor iOS 11 Arguably the biggest feature worth mentioning in the latest version of iOS is the one we’ve all been waiting for: person-to-person payments. The new platform, which would compete with the likes of Square Cash and Venmo, resides within Apple Pay and gets us a giant leap closer to an all-inclusive wallet contained within a smart device. Another game-changer is Files. In Files, you’ll have a full-fledged file system that integrates with services like iCloud, Google Drive, and DropBox, while giving iOS users the ability to control their files in much the same way they would in macOS. In fact, the move seems a natural progression in bridging the gap between macOS and iOS and toward a seamlessly integrated operating system that works on any device, much like Windows. Aside from this, we saw numerous incremental updates that might not be game-changers, but each strengthens an already excellent mobile operating system. Here’s what you can look forward to: Photos: Live Photos can now createseamless loops, better video compression leads to smaller files, and you can now create great long exposures without the need for a tripod. Maps: Maps is generally a second tier service when compared to Google Maps, but new features like mall and airport maps, as well as navigation upgrades (with lane guidance) are helping to narrow the gap. Do Not Disturb While Driving: This safety feature turns off notification while you’re driving by using Bluetooth, location, and Wi-Fi data to determine when you’re behind the wheel. It not only blocks notifications, but sends text messages back to the sender and prompts them to enter “urgent” if the message is important. If deemed important, the message will break through, thus eliminating the fear of missing out most of us would typically suffer if we disabled notifications entirely. Completely re-designed App Store: It’s clean, beautiful, and useful. Or, basically everything the last App Store version wasn’t. Apple Pay in iMessage: Apple’s new person-to-person payment platform is also making an appearance as an incredibly useful iMessage application. iOS 11 is available today for developers, and will go into public beta at the end of June. Read: Apple makes iOS 11 official — here’s what’s new iOS 11 adds ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving” to mute notifications on the go Apple introduces a completely redesigned App Store experience at WWDC17 iMessage will let you collect debt from friends Apple finally gives iOS a proper file management system with new Files app iOS 11’s new image compression makes your photos smaller and look better Apple updates Maps with detailed floor plans of airports, malls in iOS 11 Apple Pay now lets you send money to iPhone-toting friends macOS ‘High Sierra’ Perhaps outshined by iOS this year, macOS still had a handful of updates that are worth talking about. For one, Mail is getting some long-overdue improvements. Among these is the ability to surface important messages right to the top of the window, a feature which should make it easier to compose new messages. The app also consumes 35-percent less storage space on your hard drive. It’s not the full-fledged reboot we’d hoped for, but it’s a start. Safari, as you’d expect, is now faster (80-percent faster than Chrome, according to Craig Federighi, Apple’s VP of Software Engineering), and makes use of Intelligent Tracking Prevention, a feature designed to help hide some of your browsing activity on the web. How well it works remains to be seen. I’m particularly curious to see if this is as (or more) effective than a handful of extensions on Safari that are designed to do the same thing. Photos also got more feature-rich. In the app, you’ll now gain fine-grain control that was typically reserved for editors like Pixelmator and Photoshop. Aside from the outward-facing upgrades, Apple also improved its graphics suite Metal. In version 2.0, you’ll see improved performance as well as external graphics support, a feature we were all secretly crossing our fingers for. With the update, Mac owners will now finally be able to jump into the VR realm without buying an expensive custom-built PC. Read: Apple’s latest version of macOS is called ‘High Sierra’ Apple is officially giving the MacBook Pro external graphics New iMacs (and a new iMac Pro) iMacs have been languishing much like the MacBook Pro was before last year’s update. Today, we saw not only a spec bump for existing models — Kaby Lake processors, faster (and larger) SSDs, Radeon Pro 555 & 560 graphics, with up to 4GB VRAM, and a bump to  32GB of RAM 64GB of RAM! — but an entirely new SKU: the iMac Pro. The beast-like new desktop from Apple is the most powerful its ever made. It’ll ship with an 8 core Xeon processor, with the ability to update to a 10 or 18 core setup for those with supreme needs. The Turbo Boost technology bumps these to around 4.5GHz with a cache of up to 42MB. Better, the iMac Pro boasts up to a 4TB (3GBps) SSD, Radeon Vega graphics, and four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Lastly, all of Apple’s MacBooks were shown some love too, mainly through updates to Kaby Lake generation processors and faster SSDs. Read: Apple updates iMacs to be brighter, faster, and more powerful The new $5,000 iMac Pro is an absolute beast Apple just made every MacBook faster – here’s what’s new The rumored 10.5-inch iPad is real The 10.5-inch iPad we reported on at the beginning of May is a reality. With thinner bezels, the new 10.5-inch screen is actually the same size as the 9.7-inch Pro, which makes you wonder when we might see a hefty markdown as Apple clears inventory. Aside from the mid-sized screen, the Pro’s response time when using Apple Pencil is now an industry-leading 20 milliseconds. This is thanks, in part, to a new screen with a 120hz refresh rate, which should make movement look a lot more lifelike. Moreover, the screen can dynamically adjust the refresh rate depending on what type of content is being shown. In other iPad news, we’ll also finally see that drag-and-drop functionality we’ve been waiting for, as well as some improvements to multi-tasking. And for those iPad photographers we all love to hate, you’ll now be blessed with the same 12-megapixel camera in the rear and 7-megapixel camera in the front as the iPhone 7. The iPad Pro will set you back $649 (64GB) and it’s coming June 12. Read: Apple launches new 10.5-inch iPad Pro starting at $649 ARKit shows Apple is serious about augmented reality Augmented reality, even more than virtual reality, has sky high potential to shape the future of computing. Apple, for its part, is committed to the technology, and today launched ARKit, a dev kit that comes with sophisticated motion tracking and other tools to help developers make the leap toward AR. Read: ARKit shows Apple’s commitment to augmented reality Devs take priority My current situation. Short people problems… 😔 pic.twitter.com/RM2TSdBFoA — Bryan Clark (@bryanclark) June 5, 2017 As a member of the press, I’m typically spoiled at these types of events. Press typically enjoys free food, better internet access, and comfy lounge to lay around in while we file stories. Another perk is primo seating, which is common at any event we attend except this one. I’m not complaining. In an event for developers, there’s no reason to put the needs of the press ahead of them. And it’s not like Apple treated us poorly; I’m in a room sitting on a comfortable couch enjoying free food and fast Wi-Fi while I iron out the finishing touches of the piece you’re reading now. But still, a quick glance around Twitter shows just how unusual it is for press to take a back seat (pun intended) to anyone, including developers. Read: Devs were front-and-center at WWDC 2017 (literally) Worth a mention tvOS: Oddly enough, the only tvOS news we heard was that Amazon Prime Video is coming to the AppleTV. This isn’t a surprise, as we revealed as much a couple weeks back. We expected to hear more about original programming and perhaps a new feature or two. Crickets… watchOS: Three new watch faces — Siri, Kaleidoscope, and Toy Story — are coming to the Apple Watch. Each has a heavy focus on usability, a move that continues Apple’s push toward better user experience on the pint-sized device. Watch will also get usability improvements in its activity tracker, music, and a horizontal menu system that should be a huge improvement over the current vertical one.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Vianney le Masne New leak gives us a better look at the iPhone 8’s awesome redesign Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 5th, 2017 at 5:47 PM Share Tweet Apple may have done a decent job of keeping WWDC and iOS 11 rumors to a minimum, but it’s having a much tougher time keeping iPhone 8 leaks at bay. In fact, it seems as if we can’t even go a full 2-3 days without stumbling across a brand new iPhone 8 leak. Just this past weekend, a Foxconn insider divulged a boatload of information about upcoming Apple products, including the highly anticipated iPhone 8. In case you missed it, the leak revealed that the iPhone 8 will come with wireless charging, 3GB of RAM, fast-charging functionality, and last but not least, a Touch ID sensor on the front side of the device. Not too worry, those leaked schematics which showcase an iPhone design with a Touch ID sensor on the back will not be hitting store shelves this Fall. Don't Miss: New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project The latest iPhone 8 leak centers on a new dummy model of the device that recently surfaced at Computex 2017 in Tapei. The leak seemingly corroborates a number of previous reports involving the iPhone 8, namely that the majority of the front-facing display will consist of one giant piece of glass. The only area that won’t be composed of a display will feature the earpiece and a number of front-facing cameras designed for facial recognition purposes. And while we’ve seen mockups before, the dummy images below give us an even crisper look at what the final iPhone 8 design is going to look like. According to Engadget, the dummy models pictured below are based off of information a case maker “independently obtained” about the final iPhone 8 design. It’s worth noting that the design above mirrors what the aforementioned Foxconn leaker claims the iPhone 8 will look like. Although nothing is ever guaranteed until Tim Cook trots out on stage and announces a new product, it appears that the iPhone 8 is largely shaping up to be the radical redesign of the iPhone form factor we’ve all been patiently waiting for. Aside from a brand new form factor and the features mentioned above, the iPhone 8 will reportedly also feature improved water resistance, improved battery life, and support for advanced augmented reality functionality.

Along with unveiling of iOS 11, Apple also refreshed its line of Macs and MacBooks, added a 10.5-inch iPad Pro to its selection and introduced HomePod to the masses. If you happened to miss any of these reveals, but don’t feel up to re-watching the entire two-hour keynote, you’re in luck: Apple has shared all of the best videos from the event on its YouTube page, and you can watch each and every one of them below.

That said, it has full Siri functionality, so you can ask it about the weather or your calendar: Appocalypse What would happen if all the apps in the world suddenly disappeared?

The move had been the focus of rumous in the run-up to the Apple event on Monday. Apple says its history of ‘reinventing portable music’ through iTunes and the iPod means it is in a strong position to challenge its rivals. The HomePod will be just under 7in high and houses the company’s virtual assistant, Siri. Tim Cook, CEO, speaks during Apple’s annual world wide developer conference today (Picture: Reuters) Siri, who hasn’t always been known to get the gist, has been heavily updated by Apple to better understand context, the firm says, and in HomePod will be able to answer user queries and details about music when prompted using the voice command ‘Hey, Siri’. Data roaming charges in Europe are about to be completely wiped out The device contains six microphones to pick up voice commands. The Amazon Echo and the Google Home operate in a similar way, using voice commands to wake the assistant to ask for help. Apple says the A8 processor chip – the one used in the iPhone – means HomePod will be the ‘smartest home speaker’ on offer. It will look like this (Picture: Getty)   Part of this claim comes from the speaker’s ability to adjust sound levels when playing music based on its surroundings. Apple says HomePod is ‘spatially aware’ and can respond as such. Much like its rivals, the HomePod will also be able to control other smart, internet-connected items around the home, including lightbulbs.

While visually it’s very similar to iOS 10, this new version of Apple’s mobile operating system comes with a huge amount of new features. It will be available to download in September/October and will be a free update for all iPhone/iPad/iPod touch users. Without further ado we’ll get stuck into some of the biggest features that have been announced. Messages: Apple Apple’s Messages app has been given a subtle but important update. Before you bring up the keyboard, conversations will now allow you to quickly access your iMessage apps. Your iMessage conversations are now also synched across all your Apple devices automatically which means everything from conversations to individual messages can now be synched and deleted across all devices. Apple Pay Apple Now this is a big one. You can now pay each other using Apple Pay. It works through Messages which means that you can simply bring up Apple Pay within the app, select the amount you would like to pay and then authenticate it using the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone or iPad. Siri Apple This is also a big deal. Siri has been given a massive personality overhaul. Not only does it get a new logo and look but machine learning means Siri sounds more human and can be interacted with in a more human way. This is clearly a big move by Apple to tackle the increasing competition from Alexa and Google Assistant. Siri is also now able to learn more about you across all your devices, from automatically creating a calendar event based on tickets you bought in Safari, to suggesting Apple News stories based on subjects you were browsing. Last but not least is translation. Siri can now translate for you and then speak on your behalf. Camera Apple The camera gets a small update but one that’s going to make a huge difference to your storage woes. Apple’s moving over from JPEGs to a new type of image formate called HEV. It’s still compatible with everything you use currently but thanks to compression that’s twice as good it now massively reduces the amount space it’s going to take up on your phone. Control Centre Apple Control centre now has a new minimalist look that takes up just one screen so there’s no swiping between different cards. It looks more simplistic but Apple’s using 3D Touch on the newer iPhones to let you expand them into more complex settings menus. Do Not Disturb While Driving This is pretty self-explanatory but it’s also very necessary. Your iPhone will now intelligently know if you’re driving and then helpfully turn off all the notifications on your phone. Then if someone messages you they can get an automated response telling them that you’re driving. Apple Music Apple Apple Music hasn’t been given the major overhaul it was given last year. This time it’s about bringing your friends into the mix. You now have a profile that can be set as public or private. Your friends’ Apple Music listening habits will then appear on your app and help you find new music or allow you to tap into their playlists and music tastes.

Apple has revealed its very first smart speaker at WWDC 2017 and it is called HomePod Claiming that it will do to your home what the iPod did to portable music Apple is pushing this as the first premium speaker that combines intelligence with amazing sound quality. Apple To live up to that bold claim Apple revealed some of the specs that make it such a powerful device. At under 7-inches in height it’s remarkably small. Underneath that fabric coating are seven custom-built tweeters and a huge four-inch woofer that is upward firing. Apple The HomePod is then able to use a technology called beam-sensing and real-time acoustic modelling which allows it to effectively ‘scan’ the room and adjust the audio to make the best possible sound in the position you’ve placed it. Just like any other smart speaker the HomePod also has six powerful microphones that mean it can hear commands from the other side of the room even when there’s loud music playing. Naturally it responds to ‘Hey Siri’ at which point a Siri-esque light appears at the top allowing you ask it some commands. Now as we mentioned in our preview of the new features in iOS 11 Siri has been given a major overhaul which means that you’ll be able to talk to it in a far more natural fashion. Apple HomePod can also be used to control HomeKit compatible gadgets whether that’s the Philips Hue lighting system, Ikea’s own lighting system or perhaps a smart lock on your front door. So is this a direct competitor to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home? Well in some ways yes, but in others definitely not. For starters it’s a lot more expensive than both, with Apple instead suggesting that this is a new product category that combines premium audio with the same intelligence you would normally get in a smart speaker. HomePod will be available in Space Grey or White and launches in December. There’s no word on a UK price just yet but Apple has said that it will cost $349 when it launches in the US.

News & Analysis Wearables Shipments Swell as Consumer Tastes Shift Dylan McGrath 6/5/2017 06:21 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO—Worldwide shipments of wearable devices surged by nearly 18 percent in the first quarter as both the high-end Apple Watch and a slew of low-cost devices gained traction among consumers, according to market research firm International Data Corp. (IDC). Apple Inc. and Xiaomi Inc. have surpassed Fitbit Inc.—the early leader in wearables shipments—and now control nearly 15 percent of the market apiece, IDC (Framingham, Mass.). Ramon Llamas, research man ager for IDC's Wearables team, said through a press statement that consumer tastes in wearables have evolved from fitness bands to smartwatches and other products, fueling growth for the product category. "This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide," Llamas said. "Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position." Click here for larger image Companies shipped 24.7 million wearable devices in the first quarter, up from 20.9 million in the first quarter of last year, according to IDC's wearables market tracker. Llamas said Fitbit remains a key player in the wearables market despite being outpaced by Apple and Xiaomi in recent quarters. "With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets," Llamas said. Jitesh Ubrani, a senior research analyst for IDC, said the wearables market is still arguably in its first phase of development, where companies are seeding the market and trying to get consumers accustomed to wearing a device. Earlier this year, Llamas said the wearables market is shifting and would enjoy a very strong 2017 thanks to the addition of cellular connectivity in wearable devices and a slew of new products on the market, including fashionable watches that resemble more classic wristwatches as opposed to high-tech devices. Source: IDC Ubrani said the current market wearables opportunity makes it very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands, Ubrani said the second phase of development of the wearables market would be all about putting the user data accumulated by wearables to good use. "This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds," Urbani said. "And it's also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on." —Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.

(Apple) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy June 05, 2017 Apple’s annual developer conference felt especially like a show for consumers this year, with announcements of seven laptop updates, a new iMac Pro desktop computer, a new iPad, and a new home smart speaker called the HomePod. But Apple also had something for developers: new versions of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Apple computers, which will be available to consumers this Fall. Augmented reality, a theme of recent Google I/O and Facebook F8 developer conferences, also made an appearance on the San Jose stage. Apple spent significant time talking and demoing its ARKit, a set of tools for developers to use the iPhone and iPad camera lenses to overlay digital objects on the world, like in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. However, the coming changes announced today that might be most important to users are things Apple didn’t talk talk about. Based on a presentation slide shown onstage but not discussed by company reps, the new iOS 11 will bring a slew of little changes meant to make life easier, like a one-handed keyboard for little thumbs reaching across gargantuan screens, and easier wi-fi sharing. Here’s a rundown of all the news. HomePod The HomePod, with Siri. (Apple) Apple unveiled its answer to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home: a squat, 7-inch speaker called the HomePod. The fabric-covered smart speaker can do pretty much everything an Echo or Home can do, from controlling internet-of-things devices, to playing music, providing updates on your calendar, and answering general questions. You control it by talking to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant (who isn’t known for consistently providing the most reliable of responses). The HomePod features seven tweeters and a 4-inch woofer that Apple suggests will provide sound that will “rock the house.” The device comes in black or white, and will be available in December for $349—or about $200 more than Amazon and Google’s costliest speaker models, for roughly the same functionality. New iPads For a while now, Apple has been trying to convince us that, for the average person, the iPad is a worthy replacement for a laptop. After today’s announcements, that may finally be true. Apple debuted a new version of its massive 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new 10.5-inch model with smaller bezels. Both feature brighter screens and faster processors. But what really sets them apart is the new software they’ll come with: iOS 11, the next iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system, expected to launch in the autumn. Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro running the forthcoming iOS 11 software. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) A new app called Files gives iPad users access to all the files on their device in one place, so you can actually find photos to attach to a tweet, or a spreadsheet to add to an email. You can even drag and drop files right from one window to another, just like you would on a computer. You can float apps as windows from the iPad’s dock, or have them in split-screen, giving the iPad the feel of something you might actually be able to put into a bag and feel confident taking with you instead of a laptop—assuming you purchase an Apple Pencil and keyboard case to go with it, of course. The new iPads start at $649 (for the 10.5-inch) and $799 (for the 12.9-inch), and are available today. Apple expects them to start shipping next week. iMac Pro There’s a new Mac in town. Apple previewed the iMac Pro, a new version of its iMac desktop that only comes in its “space grey” color. Other than its more aggressive coloring, it also features some powerful innards: It can hold up to a 4 TB solid-state hard drive, 128 GB of memory, as well as run two 5K monitors and two RAID data storage arrays at once. The iMac has its own 27-inch 5K screen and a new cooling system that Apple says can run 80% cooler than its other iMacs, allowing it to run far more efficiently. The super-powered iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and will be available in December. Making sure the iMac Pro looks just right. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) New Macs and MacBooks On top of the new iMac Pro, Apple refreshed just about its entire line of Macs today. The MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops received new processors, featuring Intel’s new “Kaby Lake” processors, with speeds up to 3.5 GHz. Its non-Pro iMacs also got some upgrades: New iMacs will also feature Intel’s new processors, as well as faster hard drives, new graphics cards, brighter screens, and a new Thunderbolt 3 port. Both the iMacs, the new MacBook, and MacBook Pros will all start at $1,299, and are available today. Apple also revived its long-sidelined MacBook Air, upgrading it to a slightly more powerful 1.8 GHz processor. But the Air still doesn’t have a HD Retina display—like every other Mac computer. VR on Macs One of the more surprising announcements at the convention was that Apple is now working to support virtual reality systems on its computers. Onstage, a team from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the special-effects arm of Lucasfilm (the company behind Star Wars), showed a demonstration of Darth Vader roving around a lava planet breathing dramatically while surveying some destroyed starships, running on an iMac through an HTC Vive VR headset connect. A video showed an ILM employee walking through the Star Wars planet as Darth Vader walked by her. After the keynote, journalists could try out the Vader demo, as well as a few games from the HTC Vive library. The experience felt no different than it did playing on a Windows computer. Apple even had VR headsets connected up to MacBook Pro laptops, which however did require an external graphics card to power the VR experience. There's actual demos of the HTC Vive running on Macs and I thought it was as neat as the Windows experience is #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/KqIyWv4qIu — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 While these demonstrations were just proofs of concept of what Apple systems could do with VR, they do suggest Apple is taking the medium more seriously and that more could be in store—especially when one considers that the primary audience of today’s keynote was the myriad developers who build games and apps for the company’s existing platforms. iOS The annual iOS update is here. (Apple) Perhaps the most impactful announcements Apple made today concerned iOS, its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Rather than redesigning the entire experience, Apple decided to change specific pieces of the software and add new features into existing platforms like iMessage and Siri. iPhone owners will now be able to use Apple Pay to transfer money between each other, much like the popular Venmo app. Of course, because Apple Pay requires a phone made by Apple, you won’t be able to easily send money to your friends who have a Google Pixel, which might still give Venmo an edge. Swiping up from the bottom of the iPhone screen will reveal a new Control Center, the bevy of buttons used to manipulate things like wireless connectivity, screen brightness, and music. The new Control Center is all on one screen, rather than a series of pages that the user swipes through. There is also a dedicated button for turning cellular signal on and off, great for the times when you don’t want to lose signal to Bluetooth headphones, like on an airplane. Best of all, it’s finally customizable, so you can create your shortcuts in your own image. Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, wasn’t neglected either. Apple says Siri will be in even more places on the phone, reading iMessages and browsing history to help predict when you want to see information, create events, or even type certain words. Siri can also now translate English to Chinese, French, German, and a few other languages. You’ll also be able to type messages to Siri—instead of just talking to it—making it so much more than just a voice assistant. On the iPad, iOS 11 will bring an entirely new app switcher and bottom dock (like the one on traditional Mac laptops), as well as a new file explorer app. Called Files (nice), the app attempts to turn the iPad into a viable work machine; trying to put files in a folder or work with a few files at once on an iPad was previously a Sisyphean task. It’s not really a iOS feature per se, but Apple is also redesigning its entire App Store for the first time since its creation. A new “Today” tab will emphasize recently released apps, and there’s a dedicated section for games. Then, as mentioned earlier, the final iOS 11 presentation slide revealed a slew of other features not discussed by Apple execs onstage—but that will significantly change the iPhone and iPad experience for most users. To name a few: There’s now one-handed typing, where holding down the emoji key on the virtual keyboard brings all the keys closer to your preferred thumb, making it easier to tap out messages while holding a coffee or crying baby. There’s also a new way to set up your iOS device: Just hold it near one of your old ones, and a new setup process will automatically import data from that device’s iCloud. macOS High Sierra MacOS has a new name: High Sierra. Apple made a significant tweak under the hood, changing the way files are constructed and stored into a different proprietary format. This will likely speed up some operations like copying files, but doesn’t really mean much for the average user. It will probably still be a nightmare to transfer large files between Mac and Windows environments. Other than the new file system, nothing groundbreaking is happening on MacOS. watchOS 4 Smarter notifications. (Apple) Is the fourth time the charm for the Apple Watch? Since the device launched in April 2015, Apple’s premiere wearable has had three complete iterations on its operating system. They just can’t seem to get it right. But that’s okay, because nobody really has—smartwatch software is generally terrible. Apple is trying a slightly different approach this time, with a Siri-backed watch face. Based on a variety of factors, like the time of day, amount exercised, and location, Siri will suggest information that you might want to see. Given Apple’s past problems with slow load times on the Watch, we’ll have to see whether this feature is quick enough to be actually useful. Other faces added include a kaleidoscope and Toy Story characters for some reason. The Workouts app is being overhauled for easier use, and Apple has partnered with gym equipment manufacturers so Watches can sync with them for better health data. But unless your gym changes its equipment every year on an Apple hardware cycle, you probably shouldn’t get too hyped about using this feature in coming months. Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV, and that’s about all Apple had to say about its streaming device. AR Kit Augmented reality is Silicon Valley’s buzzword du jour, dragged into the public eye by the insane popularity of Pokemon Go last year. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic idea: you use your phone (or tablet) camera as an oracle to glimpse into a world where digital objects are laid over reality. A digital dog pees on your rug, but there is no stain afterwards. A cup of tea sits on your table but you cannot drink it. The idea is interesting, but in practice it feels silly to move around a tiny glass window in order to peek into a massive digital world that doesn’t do all that much. Following the trend— at Google’s I/O keynote the company also gave developers a group of augmented reality tools—Apple released AR Kit, tools for developers to build AR experiences for iOS devices. Where will iOS developers decide to put place digital teacups? That’s for us to find out, and personally we cannot wait.

It's available now as a developer preview, with a wider beta due in a few weeks' time, and it will roll out as an update to supported devices this autumn. Just under a year ago, Apple announced iOS 10, which it released to all users last September. Today, nine months after its release, Apple revealed that iOS 10 is installed on 86% of its mobile devices. Apple made that announcement by highlighting the stark difference between the percentage of its installed user base running its latest OS, versus that of Android. Apple showed a slide which stated that just 7% of Android users are on version 7.x Nougat - but that statistic is now over a month old. Google revealed its latest breakdown of Android version usage today, which shows that Android 7.0 and 7.1 are on a combined total of 9.5% of Google Play devices. But even with that increase, Android continues to lag far behind Apple's OS in terms of its availability to end users, despite Android 7.0 having been released almost a month before iOS 10 in August. It remains to be seen if iOS 10 will top iOS 9's peak of 88% before the next version of the operating system arrives later this year.

"$70 billion earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can't wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers' Conference," said Philip Schiller, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, in a statement. In January, Apple announced that its app developers earned over $20 billion in 2016 -- up over 40 per cent from 2015 and according to sources, a sizable chunk of those app developers were from India. App developers from India are now creating amazing apps for its platform. Apple last year revealed plans for an iOS app design and development facility in Bengaluru. Across India, Apple supports over 640,000 iOS app developer jobs and other positions related to the iOS ecosystem. According to the company, since the release of iOS 10 last fall, iPhone and iPad users have also experienced new engaging and creative ways to connect. From Pokemon GO and Super Mario Run to other standout launches such as CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly, customers discovered and experienced new apps and games every day on the App Store. The App Store developers from around the world create apps for customers in 155 countries that improve lives, rethink industries and shape culture. In the past 12 months alone, downloads from the App Store have grown over 70 per cent. Gaming and Entertainment are top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, have experienced over 70 per cent growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90 per cent growth. With the subscription business model now available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store's active paid subscriptions are up 58 per cent year-over-year. "Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including long time favourites such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight," Apple said in a statement. "People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers," added Schiller.

Previously, the Air started with a 1.6 GHz processor. So it should be a little bit faster. Apple did not say the processor boost includes a jump to Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" generation of processors, however, as it did with the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook on Monday. Instead, the MacBook Air will stick with Intel's years-old "Broadwell" chips, which are well behind the latest generation in terms of overall performance and battery efficiency.  Beyond that, Apple did not announce any changes to the new MacBook Air’s display or general design, so the rest of the laptop is about the same. View photos macbook airMore (Flickr/Matthew Pearce) That's not ideal: While the Air’s keyboard, trackpad, battery life, and general build quality are still above-average, the display is less vivid and substantially less sharp than competing laptops these days. Other devices have also managed to pack more power in designs that are slimmer, have smaller borders around the display, and support the newer USB-C standard. At its core, the Air is still a laptop from 2015.  Nevertheless, compared to other Apple laptops, the MacBook Air remains the most affordable of the bunch. It still starts at $999 — which gets you the older Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage — and goes up to $1,549 as you max out the specs. But with the MacBook providing a more svelte design, and with Apple slashing the entry price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) to $1,299 on Monday, it seems clearer that the company is ready to phase out its long-popular notebook — regardless of how popular it may continue to be. The updated MacBook Air is available to order through Apple's online store now. Apple says retail availbility will begin on June 7.

At its annual conference for app developers on Monday, Apple teased the iMac Pro, its first professional-grade desktop since the flashy Mac Pro redesign from 2013. Apple called the iMac Pro the "most powerful Mac we've ever made," and CEO Tim Cook called it "badass" onstage. The iMac Pro's starting configuration will be $4,999 when it goes on sale in December. The entire computer, including its keyboard and mouse, come in a sleek black finish. Apple's announcement on Monday comes just two months after exec Phil Schiller said that the company was "in the process of completely rethinking the Mac Pro." The Mac Pro line has long been neglected by Apple, despite calls from enthusiasts for a significant refresh. In a press release on its website, Apple said that, in addition to the iMac Pro, it's still working on "a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Here are some of the key specs for the iMac Pro: A 5K display, with the ability to power two more 5K displays simultaneously. Up to 18-core Xeon processor.  Up to 4TB of built-in SSD storage. Up to 126GB ECC memory. 10GB Ethernet connector.

Even still, Apple's unveiling of a new smart speaker system may be the standout product from its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose this week. http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/handson-with-apples-new-homepod-smart-speaker-35792556.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35792548.ece/fa9ce/AUTOCROP/h342/a1.jpg Email It may have been well-flagged in advance. Even still, Apple's unveiling of a new smart speaker system may be the standout product from its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose this week. Apple is positioning the seven-inch device as a very smart speaker that beats rivals on sound quality. But the company is also making clear that the gadget could become the voice-connected centre of emerging smart home technology for millions of people. This is largely down to the HomePod’s compatibility with HomeKit, Apple’s software platform that makes everyday domestic appliances work with iOS devices. In this way, the HomePod can control smart home devices by ‘asking’ Siri to turn on the lights, close the curtains or turn the alarm on. It can also so this when you’re away from the house by using the Home app on an iPhone or iPad. (Photo: Adrian Weckler) It can also be used via Siri for messages, news, sport or weather. The HomePod is quite small, at only seven inches tall. However, Apple claims that some high-end technology under its hood gives it an edge for audio quality. “Spatial awareness” sensors allow the HomePod to estimate how best to modify audio levels to maximise effect in any given room. So if you put it in a bookshelf, it will adjust differently than if you put it on a table. One of the things Apple wants is to make the HomePod addressable from anywhere in the room, even if there’s music playing fairly loudly. In this vein it has a six-microphone array to figure out whether people are nearby. As a smart speaker, it’s designed for Siri to handle advanced searches within the music library. So you can ask it questions such as “Hey Siri, who’s the bass player in this?”. Apple has also designed this to go seamlessly with an iPhone. So to pair it, you just hold your iPhone next to the HomePod and it’s ready to start in a few seconds. Apple is taking privacy pretty seriously on this one. The HomePod only starts ‘listening’ to what you’re saying when you say “Hey Siri”. Even then, any data sent to Apple servers is encrypted and anonymised. The new gadget will be a direct rival to both the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers. Wireless speakers are a booming tech category at present and are seen as a gateway into turning our homes into ‘smart’ homes. Everyday products such as light bulbs, heating systems and security alarms are increasingly being made to connect to the internet. Domestic appliances such as kettles, washing machines and fridges are also becoming wifi-connected. The device is set to be available in black and white and will first be launched in the US, UK and Australia before Christmas. It will launch in Ireland after Christmas. It’s compatible with an iPhone 5S device (or newer model) running iOS11. Online Editors Uber fires 20 over ugly scandal.

At WWDC 17, Apple unveiled a new high-end home speaker, new operating systems for Mac, Apple Watch and iPhone, and new and refreshed hardware, including an iPad Pro, iMac Pro, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 6:09 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers the opening keynote address the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. The president's decision to withdraw from a landmark environmental agreement is not in the best interest of the country, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said on Monday. "I think he did listen to me. He didn't decide what I wanted him to decide," Cook told Bloomberg's Emily Chang on Monday. "And I think he decided wrong. I think it's not in the best interest of the United States, what he decided." On Thursday, President Trump announced that the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a treaty designed to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Cook sent an email to staff last week reassuring them that Apple would continue to protect the environment. Apple's new headquarters, Apple Park, is the "world's largest naturally ventilated building," according to the company, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. About 96 percent of Apple's operations use renewable energy, according to the company. The company is also the steward of multiple forests. The environment wasn't the only political difference with Trump that Cook expressed during the interview. Cook also explained why he didn't join Trump's business council. "It wasn't about not wanting to advise on something where I thought that we could help or we had a point of view that should be heard," Cook said. "I'm doing the latter. I can't imagine a situation where I wouldn't do the latter, because I think it's in the best interest of America to do it, and I am first and foremost an American." Cook's comments followed Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose. At the event, Apple unveiled a new high-end home speaker, new operating systems for Mac, Apple Watch and iPhone, and new and refreshed hardware, including an iPad Pro, iMac Pro, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Siri was front and center during the event, serving as a conduit for Apple's machine learning capabilities. Augmented reality was also a focus of the keynote address, where a new development platform was demonstrated. The $349 HomePod is much more expensive than similar products that have already been released by rivals: Amazon's $179.99 Echo device and Google's $129 competitor, Google Home. Apple "deeply cares" about Music, after creating the iPod, and wants to reinvent music in the home as well, Cook said. Music is just the beginning, Cook told Bloomberg, though he declined to say whether the speaker will eventually make phone calls or enable e-commerce, the way other speakers do. "For us it's not about being first, it's about being the best," Cook said. "And giving the users an experience that delights them every time. So we don't let the impatience result in shipping something that's just not great." — CNBC's Todd Haselton and Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.

Apple SVP Craig Federeghi introduced and demonstrated several of the new features coming in iOS 11, which will be available to registered developers today, a public beta expected in the coming weeks. Messages gains some user interface improvements, including a redesigned App Drawer along with iCloud support for secure synchronization of all of a user’s Messages conversations across all of their iOS and macOS devices. The latter feature also provides the ability to more efficiently optimize space on iOS devices, since Messages can be left in iCloud and removed from individual devices when space is required for other things.. Along with the new Messages features comes Apple Pay support for person-to-person payments. Integrated within Messages, users will be able to send and receive money right in their conversations, authenticating with Touch ID. Received money will be placed onto an “Apple Pay Cash Card” that can be used as an Apple Pay payment source — either for person-to-person transactions or normal merchant transactions — or transferred to a bank account. Apple Pay person-to-person payments will be available across all iOS and watchOS devices, although Federeghi conspicuously omitted any mention of macOS support for the feature. Siri will gain a number of improvements in iOS 11 as well, including new natural male and female voices built using deep learning. A new visual interface has also been created for Siri that will provide follow-up questions that users can trigger with simple a tap, as well as displaying multiple results. A new Siri Translation feature is also being added, which appears to be initially in beta, but will provide the ability to translate from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, with more languages expected to be added in the future. Apple will also be expanding SiriKit beyond its current capabilities to allow third-party developers to integrate additional features such as task management, lists, QR codes, and more. More advanced on-device learning will also allow Siri to understand information more contextually, providing integration of data and queries across multiple apps, such as analyzing what you’re looking at in Safari to later offer references in the News app. Siri assistant data will also now synchronize across all iOS devices sharing the same iCloud account. Camera and Photos features will also gain several improvements in iOS 11, including compression improvements from a switch to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) as well as a new “HEIF” format for image capture. Both of these technologies should result in a savings of approximately 50% on photo and video storage both on iOS devices and in iCloud, although users will still be able to share using compatible formats. The iPhone 7 Plus will also gain new algorithms providing better low light performance and image quality through the use of the dual-lens camera. In the Photos app, Memories videos will now be viewable in portrait orientation, with the photos and videos dynamically formatted for proper presentation in each orientation. Live Photos also gain some editing enhancements allowing a specific frame of a live photo to be selected as a key photo, and effects such as “loop” and “bounce” to enhance live photos. Control Center will also see a major redesign in iOS 11, displaying more information on a single screen as floating controls, rather than buttons on a virtual panel, and making more use of 3D Touch gestures to access individual Control Center elements. iOS 11 will also unify the Lock Screen and Notification Center into a single virtual display. Maps in iOS 11 is expected to gain support for indoor maps for malls and airports in selected cities. Mall maps will initially be available in eleven cities in the U.S., U.K., China, and Japan, while airport terminal maps will initially include 30 major airports worldwide. Maps will include detailed floor plans of malls, with place cards for individual stores, directories, search features, and the ability to browse by floor. Maps will also gain support for speed limits and lane guidance while in navigation mode, and a new ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving” mode will automatically mute all notifications and auto-respond to Messages when iOS 11 detects that an iPhone is in a moving vehicle. Apple Music will also gain new social features, adding a new “Friends are Listening to” section in the Music app that allows you to see what your friends are listening to, subject to what they choose to share. Individual Apple Music users can share their profiles publicly, or choose to share only selected playlists. A new MusicKit API is also coming to allow third-party apps to integrate into the Music app more tightly. Apple will also be adding advanced wireless speaker support to HomeKit in the form of a new “AirPlay 2” protocol. Users will be able to configure speakers inside of HomeKit, and multi-room streaming will also now be available in iOS 11, allowing users to play music to multiple speakers directly from the Music app, although it was unclear if the speakers will need to support AirPlay 2 to take advantage of this feature; Federeghi did note that tvOS 11 will add support for AirPlay 2 to the Apple TV, however. The Apple Music app also gains a “Shared Up Next” feature, similar in concept to the “iTunes DJ” feature that was phased out in iTunes 11, that will allow users to contribute to a shared play queue. The iPad gains some significant new features in iOS 11, including a new, redesigned Dock that can be called up from within apps, similar to the macOS dock, and that users will be able to drag and drop icons out of to open split view multitasking windows. Multitasking has also been improved, with a new exposé-style view that shows open apps while preserving split-screen app pairings. The keyboard gains drag-and-drop style enhancements as well — users will be able to type numbers and symbols by flicking on individual keys, rather than having to go for the shift buttons. A new “Files” app will also expand the iCloud Drive app to provide a more Finder-esque interface, including support for nested folders, spring-loaded offers, list view, search, tags, recent files, and more. Files will also include plug-in support for other cloud file services such as Dropbox and Box. Drag-and-drop features integrated with the Files app and other iPad apps will allow files and images to be dragged between split apps, and even into spaces in the new multitasking multiple-app view. Significant markup improvements will also be added in iOS 11, allowing just about any screen to be marked up with the Apple Pencil, including screenshots, which will now automatically appear in a thumbnail view immediately after they’re taken, so that the user can quickly mark them up and re-share them right away. The Apple Pencil is also going to be integrated more tightly into Apple’s Notes app — handwritten text will now be searchable thanks to new machine learning algorithms, and users can make inline drawings in text-based notes. Notes will also gain a built-in document scanner, allowing users to capture and markup physical paper documents right into the Notes app. Markup is also being more tightly integrated into Mail, allowing users to add inline drawings to email messages. Apple is also making a number of interesting developer improvements in iOS 11, most notably expanding the machine learning algorithms into two new APIs — Vision and Natural Language — to provide third-party developers with access to features such as face detection algorithms. A new Machine Language Model Converter SDK will also allow developers to take their constructions from other modelling languages and easily translate them into iOS. Apple is also introducing a new ARKit core technology for developers which will allow augmented reality apps to be modelled using core iOS APIs, allowing third-party developers to take advantage of some significantly more powerful AR features.

Dubbed “HomePod” the new speaker appears to have a strong focus on music, with Apple touting it as a speaker to “reinvent home music” through features such as “Rock the house” sound, spatial awareness, and “Musicologist.” The speaker comes in at just under 7” tall, and is cylindrical and covered in a 3D mesh fabric available in either white or space grey. Internally, the HomePod features an array of 7 beam-forming tweeters at the bottom, coupled with an Apple-Designed 4” upward-facing woofer. An A8 chip inside the speaker provides advanced intelligence to allow the speaker to perform real-time acoustic modelling, audio beam-forming, and multi-channel echo cancellation so that it can adjust to the space it’s placed in and balance audio appropriately. Integrated Siri capabilities allow the speaker to act as a “musicologist” with Apple Music, which can be streamed directly to the HomePod without requiring an intermediate iOS device. Six microphones allow the speaker to hear audio commands from across the room, even when loud music is playing, and Apple has expanded Siri’s vocabulary and intelligence to allow it to respond to a wide variety of music-related queries. Apple also touched on other Siri features in the speaker, although these were mentioned in a secondary manner — the company is clearly focusing on the music capabilities. HomeKit functions will be available from the speaker, which it seems will also be able to act as a Home Hub in place of an Apple TV or iPad, and other Siri queries that could typically be directed to an iPhone can be made to the HomePod, such as setting reminders, getting traffic and weather information, send messages, asking general knowledge questions, and more. The speaker will also maintain an emphasis on privacy by only sending voice data to the cloud in response to specific requests initiated with “Hey Siri,” which the speaker will listen for with local voice recognition. The HomePod is expected to sell for $349 and be available in December in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

More videos Apple drops its latest gear The computer giant unveils an enormous assortment of new products. Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts.

Most of the big changes come to the desktop version with some cross-platform integration, TouchBar support and more. Luxury Book iPhone 7 Plus Case GargeBand for Mac was updated to version 10.2 today with a nice list of improvements and additions. First of all, Apple has refreshed the overall UI here both aesthetically and functionally.

For more details on Drummer, head over to our Logic Pros feature right here.  Apple is also noting the ability to remotely add tracks to your GarageBand sessions on the Mac via the iPhone and iPad version, along with Touch Bar updates. You should be able to “quickly navigate around your project and perform instruments” using Apple’s new mini-on board touch screen.  As for the iOS version of GarageBand, which is now at version 2.2.2, it looks like we are just getting a slew of behind-the-scenes bug fixes and stability tweaks. Overall, good news for users of Apple’s entry level (on the Mac anyway) DAW. The details in Apple’s words are down below.

Perhaps most notably, however, the company teased the iMac Pro: an ultra-powerful model coming later this year. The iMac Pro comes in Space Gray coloring with accompanying Space Gray accessories, and while some had hoped those accessories would be sold separately, Apple has since informed us that won’t be the case… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Many users have long called on Apple to make its wireless accessories available in additional colors and the company finally did that today, but it’ll cost you. The iMac Pro will be available later this year and start at $4999, and unfortunately that will be the only way you’ll be able to get your hands on the Space Gray wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse. Apple won’t be selling the accessories separately and instead will limit their availability to the iMac Pro. That’s not to say, however, that people won’t sell their Space Gray accessories on eBay and other aftermarket sites, but don’t expect to be able pick them up directly from Apple. Additionally, Apple has confirmed to us that the RAM in the iMac Pro will not be user-replaceable. This shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise given Apple’s other recent products, but nevertheless it means users are stuck with however much RAM they purchase from Apple. Currently, the 27-inch iMac features user-upgradeable RAM, while the 21.5-inch model does not. Apple will offer the iMac Pro with up to 128GB of ECC memory, though the base model will start at 32GB. Other specs of the base model include a 5K built-in display, 8-core Xeon processor, Radeon Vega graphics, and 10 gigabit Ethernet. Apple’s Space Gray iMac will be available this December starting at $4999. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

The online Apple Store is down, this is usually a sign that we can expect some product refreshes (at the very least) or, more likely, some new product announcements and possibly a new category or two.  WWDC is primarily an ecosystem and developer conference, Apple announes various new technologies and tools and shows examples of what is coming next to iOS, macOS and various peripheral ecosystems. We've seen minor hardware announcements in the past like the new MacBook Pros or the Mac Pro, however this year will likely be different. Apple hasn't had a hardware event since Septemeber's iPhone 7 and Apple Watch event which also brought new MacBook Pros with Touchbars. While the iPad received a rather quiet update (and drop in price) early this year, the iPad Pro hasn't seen a notable refresh in a while. That might change today as Apple showcases iOS 11 and more pro-focused functionality from its tablet line. Stay tuned!

Fitbit’s share slid to 12 percent of all unit sales from 23 percent a year earlier, according to data from market researcher IDC. The San Francisco company saw its dominance fade even as the overall wearable device market grew 18 percent to 24.7 million shipments worldwide. Xiaomi and Apple tied for first place, with about 15 percent each. Despite the emergence of new competitors, Fitbit had managed to hang on to its lead in wearables for several years, benefiting from its early arrival in the rapidly growing market. In the past year, demand has dropped as consumers turn to newer devices with more functions. Sales also took a hit last year because of manufacturing mistakes. The company’s stock, which soared as high as $51.90 following a 2015 initial public offering, has plunged as investors lose faith in Fitbit’s ability to resuscitate demand with new products. Shares dropped 1.7 percent to $5.42 Monday, and are down more than 60 percent in the past year. Latest business videos “Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” Ramon Llamas, an IDC analyst, wrote in the report. “This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide.” Chief Executive Officer James Park is betting that Fitbit’s impending smartwatch will reinvigorate demand and reach new consumers. The company has acquired startups Coin, Pebble and Vector to help produce its first smartwatch. Though Fitbit has a loyal base of users, its foray into the new category will face intense competition from Apple Watch and multitudes of cheaper Android watches. As Fitbit tries to differentiate its newer products with its focus on fitness, Apple has also been doubling down in health tracking. Last month, Apple acquired Beddit, a maker of sleep-tracking hardware and software. Selina Wang is a Bloomberg writer.

At just under 7 inches tall, HomePod represents years of hardware and software innovation at Apple, including spatial awareness that allows HomePod to sense its location in a room and automatically adjust the audio to deliver a great music experience, a large, Apple-designed woofer and a custom array of seven beam-forming tweeters. “Apple reinvented portable music with iPod and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “HomePod packs powerful speaker technology, Siri intelligence and wireless access to the entire Apple Music library into a beautiful speaker" Coming to the US and UK in December, HomePod is powered by an Apple A8 processor, it integrates Siri, has access to Apple Music's 40 million song library and can also control IoT and connected home devices by serving ans a HomeKit hub.

After many years of trials and tribulations, the two sources finally reached the agreement to bring the Amazon Prime Video application to Apple TV. At Apple’s annual developer conference WWDC 2017 that occurred today, the CEO Tim Cook made the announcement. From this app, users will receive a realm of opportunities due to the vast options for TV and movie watching on the application. For example, there will be Prime video content like viewing movies and TV shows while using Apple TV. This will be much more accessible than the previously used Airplay, which inconveniently required users to plug into other devices such as, iPhones or MacBooks. Considering Apple and Amazon have competed with each other in the past, this is exciting news and mends the previous issues between companies. Furthermore, there won’t be as many difficulties for users watching TV shows and movies that they may have faced previously. Both Apple and Amazon sold similar products for streaming, so this collaboration simply makes sense and is expected to reduce various caveats. As another piece of news to be released later this year, Apple is expected to share more details about tvOS, which we are also excited about. It came as a surprise that the Amazon and Apple collaboration was the only news talked about today at the conference, rather than any of these developments. We were surprised that no more details were released, but are now even more excited for the next developments and software features to be created later in the year. Amazon has not yet disclosed whether the Apple TV will return to its online store as a result of this deal, but we will let you know further details as soon as we can. We hope that you enjoy the new collaboration between Amazon and Apple. We are sure that the future is going to be bright for the pair.

Ten years ago, WWDC was all about macOS and later, the focus shifted to iOS. 2017 has the most number of ecosystems than ever before. iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, HomeKit, HealthKit and CarPlay are just some of the ecosystems that developers are expecting updates on. There's also a surging interest in ApplePay, in a standalone smart assistance and now, more than ever before, a focus on new hardware. Hardware announcements at WWDC were always a rarity. I remember seeing the first new generation MacBook Pro and the then new Mac Pro. These were all cherries on top of multiple layers of innovative iOS and macOS announcements and that was fine, then. It is 2017, and confidence in Apple's hardware focus has been greatly challenged. Apple has grown to be an even bigger and more profitable company than before, but it is being challenged on all sides. The Cupertino company has focused primarily on its iPhone business. It has neglected and shut down peripheral product lines like its WiFi routers and desktops. Competitors like Microsof have aggressively attacked Apple's notebook and even desktop lines with similarly premium products that have touch displays, take stylus input and look and feel just as premium and innovative as Apple's MacBooks and iMacs but at a similarly competitibe price.  Since Apple hasn't had a proper media event since last September, there's a lot of weight on this WWDC to serve and a big Apple reveal event, not just for future software initiatives but for sexy new hardware. Apple does have a lot to update. There's Intel Kaby Lake processors expected on iMacs and MacBooks. MacBook Air notebooks, still Apple's biggest PC product, haven't been updated in ages, same with the iMacs. There's some speculation that the 2-inch MacBooks as well as iPads will receive highly anticipated updates as well. Let's not even bring up Apple TV, the company's set-top box product that's due for an OS and hardware overhaul in order to compete with cheaper and 4K-capable competitors. Apple seems to be behind the eight ball. Specially after Microsoft has unloaded a slew of Surface Books, Notebooks, Studios and Pros catering to a wide range of users. Google, on the other hand, has the WiFi and smart assistant space covered in Canada and the US while Samsung has made major moves to leapfrog the current smartphone status quo, a stark contrast to Apple's three-years-in-row design for the iPhone and Apple Watch. The pressure has never felt greater than it does today for Apple. Thankfully, this is a company that's got a track record of proving detractors wrong, of zagging where other forces are zigging, and being capable of rewriting entire business segments with pivotal products and strategies. Tomorrow's WWDC will hopefully be a landmark event that will bring various new directions in the Apple ecosystem.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin By Elizabeth Dwoskin June 5 Follow @lizzadwoskin Apple revealed a new smart speaker device, the HomePod, at WWDC. Here are some of its features. (Apple) SAN JOSE — In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when it launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Six years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial-intelligence products is as fundamental to the company’s next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone of sleekly designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple’s rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn’t profile consumers. Moreover, Apple’s long-standing penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country’s top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. “Artificial intelligence is not in Apple’s DNA,” said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster. “They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot.” At Apple’s annual developers conference Monday — the same event where Siri was introduced — the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new stand-alone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri’s chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. “Machine learning” — an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling — was repeated throughout the 2½-hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute, or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company’s Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, the HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, such as “2nd Anniversary,” without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software tool kit, Core ML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It’s six times as fast as Google’s rival AI processor, an executive quipped.) But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence — software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind — and where the effort cuts against core aspects of the company’s secretive culture. “This is a substantial shift for Apple,” said Daniel Gross, a former Apple executive who focused on artificial intelligence. “The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers.” Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company’s revenue, which was $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company’s smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones may finally be saturated. “The difference between last year’s iPhone and this year’s iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. . . . So that S-curve is starting to flatten out,” said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. “Then you have the next transformative technology that isn’t here yet.” Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple’s launch of he HomePod, which will go on sale later this year, comes several years after Amazon.com and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers’ spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday’s updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified Web search that could tell the occasional preprogrammed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as “deep” or “unsupervised” learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain’s neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world’s top researcher in this area. Salakhutdinov divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple. Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products but also becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. “You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do,” Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper on artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was “off the scale” in terms of secrecy and that such secrecy was keeping it out of the loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino, Calif., giant was “making some changes.” “But it’s going to take some work,” he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates — Google, Facebook and Amazon were by far the top picks — but that the company was moving up in the rankings. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Apple’s forays into AI have also been slower than its peers' because it’s been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer’s conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Chief executive Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people’s speech to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise — or bad information — into good data to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn’t know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple’s focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. “Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science and doing so to try and preserve your privacy,” he said. “I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to a world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving.” Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. “The bad news is that Apple is behind,” he said. “The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it’s still early days — there is plenty of time to catch up.” Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced Siri eight years ago. It also misstated the first name of venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster.

Does it support multi-room audio? Does it work with Spotify? Show More Apple concluded its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday with a sneak peek of an all-new product: The HomePod.  Editor’s note: We’ve updated this story to include a full FAQ. Originally rumored to be called Siri Speaker, the HomePod is a smart speaker with Wi-Fi capabilities intended to compete against Amazon Echo devices and Google Home—although it will be significantly more expensive. During the WWDC keynote, Apple’s senior VP of marketing Phil Schiller boasted about the HomePod’s audio quality, its built-in room sensors, and the integration with Apple Music.  [ Further reading:The best home security cameras ] With its always-on voice assistant and ability to control connected devices, the HomePod is very similar to Echo devices and Google Home, but with a few notable differences. (We were able to get a closer look after the keynote, and you can check out our first eyes-on impressions here.) Here are the must-know HomePod features, specs, and sales info showcased during WWDC. Apple When’s the HomePod release date? The HomePod will be available for sale starting in December, initially in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. So it’s will only support English-language voice commands during the initial rollout. It will then be available in other countries starting in 2018. How much will it cost? The HomePod costs $349 and will be available in two colors: white and space grey. By comparison, Amazon Echo is $180 and Google Home retails for $129. Is the HomePod just as smart as the iPhone? The HomePod comes with an A8 fusion chip, the same one that powers the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. That definitely puts it up at the top when it comes to “smart” speakers. Like the AirPods (which sport an A1 chip), setting up the HomePod is just as easy and intuitive. All you have to do is hold your iPhone next to the HomePod and it’ll be ready to start playing music in seconds. Apple How do you activate it? The HomePod has six microphones so that it can be activated verbally using the “Hey Siri” voice command. We’re not sure what happens if you have “Hey Siri” activated on your nearby iPhone as well. Hopefully, Apple implements a way for you to customize which device responds and fulfills the voice commands, or for the iPhone and the HomePod to communicate with each other and figure it out. We’ll let you know once we do our full review. What can you ask Siri to do? You can ask Siri to send a text message to your friend, start playing the latest episode of your favorite podcast, and get the latest updates in news, sports, traffic, and weather. You can also use voice commands to set alarms, timers, and reminders. In addition, Siri on the HomePod can help you answer some of your most burning questions like, “What’s the best Korean barbecue restaurant nearby?” or “Did the Warriors win last night?” Does it have a touchscreen? No, the HomePod does not have a touchscreen like the more-recent Amazon Show, but it can still responds to touch controls. You can tap the top of HomePod to play, pause, or adjust the volume. This panel also animates with an LED waveform to indicate whenever Siri is listening. Roman Loyola Can it control HomeKit devices? Yes! You can ask Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a scene that you’ve pre-set in the Home app. HomePod can even control these devices when you’re not home via the Home app, giving you the power to remotely control your devices from anywhere. So far, HomeKit compatible with connected devices from Ecobee, Honeywell, August, Kwikset, Philips Hue, Lutron, and more. What about audio specs? Apple wanted to create a speaker that delivered state-of-the-art sound that “rocks the house.” The HomePod includes an Apple-designed four-inch woofer for a deeper bass and seven beam-forming tweeters for high frequency acoustics. All of this was designed to “preserve the richness and intent of the original recordings.” Of course, we won’t be able to vouch for this until we get to listen to it later this year. Does it support multi-room audio? Thanks to the new AirPlay 2, Wi-Fi speakers are now part of the HomeKit family so you can get multi-room audio controls from a single iPhone. This gives you the option to use the Home app to control multiple HomePods in different rooms and sync audio playback. Furthermore, AirPlay 2 is also compatible with Wi-Fi speakers from other manufacturers, including Bose, Bang & Olufsen, Libratone, Devialet, Bowers & Wilkins, and Apple’s own Beats. Does it work with Spotify? Unfortunately, the only music streaming service that the HomePod supports is... Apple Music (act surprised). In fact, Apple claims the smart speaker was designed to be deeply tied to Apple Music, which costs $10 a month. And we don’t foresee Apple bringing another other services to the fold anytime soon (or ever). Apple What if I am an Apple Music member? If you’re an Apple Music member, the HomePod can access Apple Music’s full catalog, as well as tap into machine learning to learn about your music preferences and suggest songs and artists you might like. Apple refers to the HomePod as the perfect musicologist. In addition, you can create a shared Up Next queue with other nearby iOS devices so that everyone in the house can participate in picking music. Does it have any other new technology? Not every room is the same, so the HomePod has learned about spatial awareness. Its built-in sensors can determine the size and layout of its surroundings to automatically deliver the volume and acoustic output that best fills the room. Think of it as virtual surround sound. When two paired HomePods are in the room, they’ll be able to sense each other to deliver actual surround sound. Will it be listening in to all my conversations? Privacy is also being touted as a vital component of the HomePod. According to Apple, the smart speaker will only start collecting information after the “Hey Siri” voice command is activated. This means that you shouldn’t be afraid that the HomePod is secretly recording your conversations in order to sell you stuff. All information is recorded locally on the device and sent to Apple servers encrypted using an anonymous Siri ID. What iOS devices is it compatible with? HomePod is compatible with iPhone 5s and later, running the latest iOS 11. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

By Michael Simon and Roman Loyola Macworld | Jun 7, 2017 6:54 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this iOS 11 FAQ: Everything we know about new Siri, Messages, Photos, and Apple Pay WWDC 2017 Wish List: New features we want in macOS 10.13 iPhone 8 rumors: Facial recognition could replace the Touch ID's fingerprint... Video Apple's HomePod: Everything we know so far about this new smart Siri speaker Table of Contents A new file system Better Photos Speedier, smarter Safari Smoother video Next-level Metal Other features macOS High Sierra FAQ Show More Editor’s note: We’ve updated this story to include a full FAQ. The next version of Apple’s operating system for the Mac is called macOS High Sierra. While the OS is mostly about software refinements, it also lays the foundation for future innovations in the worlds of VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality). You can learn more by taking a look at our favorite High Sierra features listed below. That’s followed by an FAQ, where you can get details on High Sierra’s release date, system requirements, installation instructions, and more. A new file system Ever since System 8, the Mac has used the HFS+ file system to keep our documents and directories running smoothly, but at last year’s WWDC, a new Apple File System (APFS) was announced. It made it into iOS with the iOS 10.3 update, and with High Sierra it’s also coming to the Mac. But where the changes to iOS are largely behind the scenes, you’ll really get it see it in action in the new macOS. One of the main tenets of High Sierra, APFS will be new the new default file system, bringing an advanced 64-bit architecture and a responsive design to cut down on the time it takes to do common tasks. Apple VP Craig Federighi quickly demoed how fast files are copied, and it should save quite a bit of time, even on older Macs. APFS also brings some heavy-duty security, including built‑in encryption, crash‑safe protections, and simplified data backup on the go. Better Photos Photos is rapidly becoming one of the most used apps on our Macs, and in High Sierra it looks we’ll be spending even more time with it. A slew of new features await us in the new OS, including better organization, looped Live Photos, and new Memories categories. It’ll also be easier to identify who’s in your photos with more accurate People identification and cross-device syncing for albums. Apple The new Photos app in High Sierra features new pro-level editing tools. But the coolest feature may be a set of new built-in editing tools. Photos already lets us make some awesome adjustments to our snapshots, but High Sierra seriously ups the game with powerful pro-level tools—like a curves palette for fine-tuning color and contrast, a selective color dropper to home in a specific hue, and new filters that will make your photos fit for an art gallery. And for all your gallery- and album-worthy photos, Apple has now partnered with third-party apps to give you more publishing and printing options. Speedier, smarter Safari Apple’s browser always gets a tune-up whenever a new version of macOS comes out, but this time around Federighi says the improvements coming in High Sierra actually make it the world’s fastest desktop browser. It features 80 percent faster JavaScript performance when compared to Chrome, which should help us surf way quicker. But we’re more interested in two new features that address what it’s like to use the Internet in 2017. The first will eliminate one of the more annoying features of the modern web: autoplay videos. Where Safari in Sierra tells you which tab is playing audio, in High Sierra, it will shut the video down before it can start. Autoplay blocking will detect which sites are delivering unwanted videos, and then press the pause button for you. Along with our ears, the new Safari will also protect our privacy. A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behavior and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind. That means you won’t get hit up with three dozen vacuum ads the next time you buy one on Amazon.  Smoother video We watch a lot of video on our Macs, and High Sierra is making the experience even better. In addition to supporting 4K where available, it’s also upgrading to the new industry standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (or H.265 for short). The new system compresses video up to 40 percent more the H.264, the current video standard. Under the new codec, videos will stream smoother and take up less space, both of which will make experience much more pleasant. And if you’re a video creator, the new standard will also be built into Pro Tools so your projects will be able to take full advantage of it right from the start.  Next-level Metal When Metal was introduced in El Capitan, it brought a slew of under-the-hood changes to make games and graphics sing, and now it’s ready to deliver the next generation, appropriately called Metal 2. The new technology will open up games to a whole new world of power, with a new API and powerful tools for developers. Metal 2 will bring 10 times the draw call throughput that Metal delivered, enabling graphics that are far more robust while adding external GPU support for hard-core gamers. Apple Metal 2 will let developers create even more powerful games and apps. But Metal 2 also brings support for something sorely missing from today’s Macs: virtual reality. High Sierra lets developers create interactive and immersive virtual reality experience on the Mac for the very first time that will work with the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine for VR. And to show how serious it is about VR, Apple is even offering developers an external graphics dev kit to get started, featuring a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU. You know, until the iMac Pro arrives in December. Other features Since High Sierra is a maintenance release, there will be lots of little improvements all over your desktop that you might not even notice at first. In Mail, Search will now use Spotlight to quickly identify top hits, and you’ll be able to split your inbox and your compose window when in full-screen view. You can add properly formatted tables to Notes and pin your most important ones. Siri has a more natural voice that sounds more like a person rather than a machine. And when you’re in a FaceTime call, you’ll be able to easily turn a special moment into a Live Photo so you can remember it forever. macOS High Sierra FAQ What is the name and version number of the new macOS? Apple names its macOS versions after California locations. This time, it named the new version High Sierra. The name follows Apple’s pattern of slightly changing the name of the previous version of the OS if the upgrade isn’t considered a big one. (See for example, Leopard and then Snow Leopard, Lion and then Mountain Lion.) Apple senior VP Craig Federighi joked during the WWDC keynote that the name could be “misconstrued,” but Federigi was reassured that the name High Sierra was “fully baked.” If you’re into version numbers, then you’ll be happy to know that this one is version 10.13. When will macOS High Sierra be released? Apple, as usual, said macOS High Sierra will be released this Fall. “Fall” has typically meant the end of October for macOS releases, so if you’re making plans, that’s the area of your calendar to target. How much with macOS High Sierra cost? Apple makes its operating systems free, so macOS High Sierra is a free upgrade for users who have macOS Sierra installed. From what operating systems can I upgrade to macOS High Sierra? If you have macOS Sierra (the current macOS version), you can upgrade straight to High Sierra without doing any other software installations. If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra. Chances are this will still be the case with High Sierra. If you are running Leopard, you need to upgrade to Snow Leopard first, and then upgrade to El Capitan, before you can upgrade to High Sierra. If you want to upgrade from Snow Leopard, you need to upgrade to El Capitan, and then you can upgrade to High Sierra. How do I get macOS High Sierra? Apple will make the High Sierra upgrade available in the Mac App Store. Can I try macOS High Sierra before it is released? If you are a developer, you can get a beta of macOS Sierra through the Apple Developer Program. The developer beta is available now. Apple will make a beta available to the general public in late June. Apple releases public betas on a regular cycle and the betas are free, but come with the caveat that the software isn’t as stable as it would be at release—meaning it could cause problems on your Mac. However, if you do decide to try the beta, you can provide Apple with valuable feedback. Sign up for the public beta program online here. What Macs are compatible with macOS High Sierra? MacBook Pro (2010 and later) MacBook (Late 2009 and later) MacBook Air (2010 and later) Mac Pro (2010 and later) iMac (Late 2009 and later) Mac mini (2010 and later) Should I upgrade to macOS Sierra? Whether you upgrade to High Sierra or not is up to you. First, you need to check to see if your Mac is compatible. Then, you also need to make sure the software you use most often will work. As High Sierra’s ship date approaches, developers may release updates to insure compatibility. Check the Mac App Store on a regular basis to install updates on apps you have bought there. (To do this in the Mac App Store app, click on the Updates tab. This will check the store for any updates.) If you have software you didn’t get in the Mac App Store, launch the app and look in the preferences or other menus for an option to check for updates. You can also look on the developer’s website. Make a backup of your Mac before you install High Sierra. You might even save your important documents separately from your primary backup, just in case. If you install High Sierra and encounter problems, you can revert back using the backup. How do I install macOS High Sierra? After you download High Sierra from the App Store, there are several ways to run the installation. Go to the High Sierra product page in the Mac App Store. The Download button will be replaced by an Open button. Click on it to start the installation. In the Mac App Store app, click on the Purchased tab. You should see the macOS High Sierra installer in the list of purchased apps. Click on the Install button. Go to your Applications folder and look for a app called “Install macOS High Sierra” and double-click on it.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Game makers applaud Apple’s support for AR and VR Dean Takahashi@deantak June 5, 2017 3:00 PM Apple surprised the emerging industries of augmented reality and virtual reality with broad support for the technologies at its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California. During the keynote, Apple showed off ARKit, which could transform hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads into AR devices. Both the AR and VR demos that Apple showed were based on support from Epic Games’ Unreal Engine 4. For instance, the AR demo from Wingnut AR used the Unreal Engine to superimpose a 3D science-fiction scene on a tabletop. And Apple also showed how developers at Disney’s ILM special effects studio could design a 3D-animated Star Wars scene from inside VR, using Unreal Engine 4. “Apple’s debut of VR support for Mac and AR support for iOS are true game-changers. Whereas there are a couple million VR enthusiasts today, and early AR hardware from other companies has reached several thousand developers, Apple is bringing this high-powered technology to hundreds of millions of consumers right now,” said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, in a blog post. “I believe this is truly the start of the mainstream VR and AR revolution that we at Epic have been striving for, and building for, over the course of many years. It’s the most definitive event marking the move to high-end technology that will power a new generation of world-class experiences transcending games and storytelling.” At WWDC, Apple invited Alasdair Coull, creative director of Wingnut AR, onstage to  demonstrate a new technology on an iPad Pro. Designed by director Peter Jackson and powered by Unreal Engine 4, the AR demo showcased a sci-fi battle. Viewed through an iPad, the scene showed a town in three dimensions, with people walking around in it. Then a couple of starship fighters showed up and started attacking the town. “I”m really happy that Apple finally came forward with direct support for AR and VR technology,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, in an interview. “It’s great to see their support for the technologies and it means they are more aligned with the other tech titans.” He noted Apple’s hardware had been graphics technology, support at the hardware level, applications programming interfaces — all of those things together show broad support. “That said, it seems like the support is limited,” Blau said. Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, also applauded Apple’s support for AR and VR. “Apple has a huge advantage because so many of its devices will support AR,” Bajarin said. The imagery used realistic lighting and shadowing. In another demo, Apple showed how developers could use the Unreal tool to insert objects into an AR environment. They could, for instance, put an animated coffee cup on a saucer onto the table. And then they put a lamp on the table and turned it on. The coffee cup cast a correct shadow, and as the lamp moved around the table, so did the shadow. That requires advanced rendering tools to make that happen. “AR will be an enormous new accelerator of high-end engine adoption,” Sweeney said. Apple announced support for VR on Mac, powered by Metal 2 and Valve’s SteamVR. It demonstrated VR with a HTC Vive VR headset connected to a newly-announced iMac. To show the capabilities of this new medium on Mac, Apple invited Academy Award-winning John Knoll, chief creative officer at Disney’s ILM and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story visual effects supervisor, to unveil a real-time Star Wars scene on the volcanic planet of Mustafar (that’s where Anakin and Obi-Wan fought in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, and it’s where Darth Vader choked Director Krennic in Rogue One). The demonstration started not in a game or cinematic, but in the Unreal Editor — running live in VR mode, on an iMac. Epic’s tools programmer Lauren Ridge was backstage building the scene live as Knoll talked, using the Content Browser to add terrain, TIE Fighters, and other components of the Sequencer-based action scene. The demo culminated with the entrance of Darth Vader on the virtual set. Mac VR support, together with general Metal 2 support and wide-ranging Mac optimizations, will ship in Unreal Engine 4.18 binary tools starting with previews in September and with the full release in early October. Valve has released a beta for SteamVR on the Mac today. “Apple’s emphatic entry into this space marks the beginning of AR and VR as a mainstream consumer phenomenon, as a market that’s now ready to grow beyond a few million enthusiasts, to reach hundreds of millions and then billions,” Sweeney said. Niantic, the maker of Pokémon Go, said that it will modify the popular mobile game using augmented reality features through Apple’s new ARKit for developers, which releases with iOS 11 this fall.

The event started with Apple CEO welcoming the audience at the 15th WWDC in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple is building its new campus. Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year “it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever.” Cook also praised the Apple developer community which has 16 million registered developers and added three million last year. He announced that Amazon’s video app will come to Apple’s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement, Amazon tweeted, “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year.” Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watch faces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watch face. The Siri watch face uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watch faces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch’s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple’s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as “the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16 GB of VRAM and up to 4 TB for SSD storage. Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat – the latest version of Google’s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronise messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant’s voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Everything Apple announced at WWDC: iOS 11, iMac Pro, HomePod, and more Bérénice Magistretti@bmagistretti June 5, 2017 3:17 PM This morning, Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stage to announce macOS and iOS updates; new hardware, including the iMac Pro and iPad Pro; and an ARKit for developers. The biggest and most anticipated announcement, however, was the HomePod, a smart speaker. Here is a recap of the key takeaways: Amazon Prime on Apple TV Apple and Amazon are finding a way to collaborate. Later this year, the Amazon Prime app will be available on Apple TV. This is perhaps a way to offer a united front against Google’s offerings, such as Home and Play. Apple reveals watchOS 4 Apple revealed the latest version of watchOS for its Apple Watch devices. Siri powers a new watch face that displays the info that is most relevant to you, such as traffic, your next meeting, and other features on your calendar. The workout app and the music app are also getting updates. Macs: New software and hardware Apple’s next big macOS update, version 10.13, was baptized High Sierra. Apple also unveiled a new model to its iMac line: the $5,000 iMac Pro, which will apparently deliver outstanding graphics. Finally, MacBook Pros will get a speed boost with Kaby Lake processors and support up to 32GB of memory. Apple Pay goes P2P Apple is adding person-to-person payments to Apple Pay and integrating the technology into Messages. It seems the company is catching up to PayPal and Square. Siri now translates on-the-fly Apple’s Siri will get a host of new features, including better expression, as part of an iOS 11 update coming this fall. Other upcoming features include the ability to offer translations when talking to Siri, starting with translations from English to Chinese, Spanish, Italian, French, and German. Metal 2 will boost gaming on Mac OS Apple’s graphical API (application program interface) is getting a big update along with the new Mac OS, High Sierra. Metal 2 will be 10 times better at draw call throughput than the original Metal, said Apple. It’s also promising a faster frame rate debugger. This will help games run better on Mac OS computers. Apple unveils iOS 11 Apple’s iOS updates include a new App store, iPad-only features, live photos, and more. The company also unveiled a new “Do not disturb while driving” option, which detects whether you’re driving and blocks notifications if you’re on the road. Monument Valley 2 out now Monument Valley 2, a sequel to the hit 2014 mobile maze game, is now available for $5 on the Apple App Store. The first Monument Valley, a premium game, had more than 26 million downloads. The new iPad Pro line Apple announced a new iPad Pro sporting a slimmer bezel and a slightly larger body than Apple’s preexisting 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The model comes in two sizes: 10.5 inches and 12.9 inches. The company appears to have killed the 9.7-inch model. Apple also unveiled the A10X Fusion processor-graphics combo chip for the iPad Pro, which which result in faster graphics performance, the company said. Apple unveils ARKit The company announced the launch of its ARKit to turn iOS 11 into ‘the largest AR platform in the world’. This is Apple’s first foray into augmented reality. Film director Peter Jackson’s new company, dubbed Wingnut AR, is currently using Apple’s ARKit, which will transform hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads into AR devices. SteamVR and external GPUs SteamVR is Valve’s open platform to enable VR headsets to work with games on the Steam PC gaming store. With this software, the HTC Vive will work on Macs, but so should Oculus Rift, OSVR’s HDK 2.0, and most other PC-based VR headsets. The Apple HomePod Apple announced plans to release a smart speaker named HomePod later this year to compete with Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other smart speakers. The device will be available in white and space grey and retail for $349.

Phil Schiller, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, introduces the HomePod speaker at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Monday in San Jose, Calif. Photo: AP tech Siri, speakers and software: Highlights from the Apple show June 6 06:42 am JST 2 Comments SAN JOSE, Calif Siri is getting a new voice, and the Mac is getting a new name. Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and center. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Both the iPads will come with the Apple A10X Fusion chipset. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with extremely thin bezels, reducing the borders by up to 40 percent while weighing in at under 500 grams. It means that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro fits in the form factor of yesteryear’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be available in the Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold colours. The prices start from $649 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model and $779 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model and goes up to $949 for the 512GB Wi-Fi model and $1079 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh will be available in Silver, Space Gray and Gold colours. The prices for the same start from $799 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model and $929 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh will start selling from next week, the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expectd to hit the markets later this month. The Indian prices for the new iPad Pros are not yet known. Both the iPad Pros will release with the iOS 10, and will be upgraded to iOS 11 eventually in fall. The two tablets will include the all-new Files app, customisable Dock, improved multitasking and deeper integration of Apple Pencil. The new iPad Pro will also come with ProMotion retina displays. The ProMotion display technology will ensure that refresh rates are 120Hz to give a fluid scrolling experience, improved responsiveness and smooth animations. Apple Pencil is also expected to be more responsive with a 20-millisecond latency for more natural drawing. Both the iPad Pros also come with the Apple A10X Fusion chipset, featuring 64-bit architecture, a 6-core CPU and a 12-core GPU. Apple claims that this brings in around 30 percent faster CPU performance and a 40 percent faster GPU performance while ensuring a one-day battery life. Some of the new features that iOS 11 operating system will bring to the iPad Pro include: a new customisable Dock that provides quick access to frequently used apps and documents from any screen; improved multi-tasking; new Files app that keeps everything in one place, whether files are stored locally, in iCloud Drive or across other providers like Box, Dropbox and more; Multi-touch drag and drop feature and much more. On the camera front, you get a 12 MP rear camera supporting optical image stabilisation and a 7 MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. It also supports a four-speaker audio system. An embedded Apple SIM2 and support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi and LTE Advanced3 make it easier to stay connected when traveling in more than 180 countries and regions. According to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s VP of product marketing, “These are by far the most powerful iPads we’ve ever created with the world’s most advanced displays featuring ProMotion, the powerful new A10X Fusion chip and the advanced camera system of iPhone 7. Together with iOS 11 these new iPad Pro models will radically change what users can do with iPad.” The new iPad Pro models are available to order beginning today from Apple.com and will start delivering to customers next week. Both models will also be available next week in Apple Stores, through select carriers and Apple Authorised Resellers in 37 countries including India.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 08, 10:18 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology iOS 11 Release Date Features: Highlights From Latest iPhone OS At WWDC 2017 By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 06/05/17 AT 6:25 PM Close At Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple on Monday officially unveiled iOS 11 details, the latest update to its long-running mobile operating system. Along with the expected under-the-hood updates and tweaks, the operating system also offers several notable new features. Here are the biggest takeaways from WWDC on iOS 11, which is slated to release this fall: Siri Siri has had a substantial head start on other virtual assistants since its launch in 2011 but hasn’t really garnered the attention paid to newer competitors like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. Read: Apple Virtual, Augmented Reality Developer Support Coming To iOS, macOS iOS 11, however, looks to bring some significant upgrades to Siri. At WWDC, Apple showcased a handful of new features for the virtual assistant. Some of these are more cosmetic: along with an adjusted female voice, you’ll be able to change Siri to a male voice. Other features are more technically impressive as Apple demonstrated Siri’s live translation feature. Onstage, Apple quickly translated a sentence from English to Chinese — at launch, the feature will include translation support in Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Apple also made a point of emphasizing bigger goals for Siri and iOS, highlighting its planned expansion of the SiriKit developers kit to make it easier to integrate Siri on an individual app level. The move ties into Apple’s goal of improving Siri’s machine learning functionality and its ability to understand your preferences and dislikes, as virtual assistants like Siri have struggled to understand more contextual and detailed requests. Payments Apple is finally getting into the micropayments space. Through its Messages app, you’ll be able to send and receive money from other iOS users. Payments can be validated with Touch ID and the service will also come with the Apple Pay Cash virtual card for transactions. The service was rumored to be in the works earlier this year and represents Apple’s latest attempt to bolster its Apple Pay service. Apple Pay, which allows you to tie a payment card to your iPhone, was the company’s bid to enter the payment space, but it’s only been a modest factor among iPhone users and retailers. With its new user-to-user payment feature, Apple Pay will be going up against competitors like Venmo in a bid to make itself more useful to users. Control Center Refresh It’s a smaller update, but Apple also plans to redesign the layout of its Control Center for iOS 11. Instead of the horizontal tiers that previously separated icons and functions, the new operating system will feature a more spread out layout that’s a clear change in direction. In iOS 11, the Control Center has been redesigned. Photo: Apple Car Notifications Apple will encourage users to avoid using their phones while driving. You can enable a safety mode that temporarily will disable notifications while you’re driving, and it can be disabled if you’re just a passenger. Read: Apple HomePod Speaker Powered By Siri Revealed At WWDC 2017 Files App As hinted before WWDC, Apple unveiled an official file management app for its new iPad Pro. Through the app, users will be able to manage files from cloud services like iCloud, Box and Google Drive, and have them all synced on a single device. The app is a bid from Apple to further make the iPad Pro a device that can be used as an alternative to a traditional laptop.

That’s hardly all that happened. Apple peppered the presser with minor announcements like a new fitness coach in WatchOS and a streamlined control panel. You can check out everything over at our sister publication, PCMag. For your geeky self, though, we’ve condensed the most important stuff right here, just for you. The tech giant ran through a ton of new features that will be coming with the release of iOS 11. Of note, there are major updates to Siri as well as some new productivity features. Siri, for example. Will be getting a new voice. She (or he, if you prefer) will now have better pronunciation, more frequently use context to discern meaning, and speaking with a more natural inflection. Siri will “learn” by leveraging data across apps. Part of that will help people more easily shoot more complex, informative messages on the go. Namely, when you’re driving, and someone asks what you’re up to. To go along with those features, maps will be getting some new upgrades as well, including lane assist to help you know where you need to be ahead of time. We’ve all been driving down that unfamiliar road and had to switch lanes at the last minute to make an exit, yeah? Well, that may be a thing of the past. Plus, Maps will be getting a special Do Not Disturb feature as well. Apple hopes that these additions will help you avoid using your phone behind the wheel — at least until we can offload that entire sector of our economy onto AI. Major cities will also have indoor maps to help you navigate popular malls and destinations in places like Washington DC and Tokyo — for when you’re in meat space. Beyond that, the Cupertino-based giant announced several new hardware lines. The MacBook family got an update. Laptops will now be equipped with Intel’s recent Kaby Lake processors. And that’s about it, actually. There are some other minor hardware updates, but for the most part, this is one of those “in-between” updates. The real big-hitter for hardware this time is the updated iMac Pro. These are designed for professional (who knew?) spaces and can come with serious computing hardware. You can get up to an 18-core Xeon processor (so not the new mega-powerful i9, but probably not too far off, either). You’ll also get a ton of SSD-based storage, insane amounts of memory and a decent amount of I/O ports given the manufacturer. While creative professionals the world over are most certainly salivating, let’s not forget that Apple tax. The new iMacs start at a cool $1099 and the Pro starts at a whopping five grand. Oh! And it won’t ship for another six months. C’est la vie. Rounding out the major announcements today, we have ARKit, a new software package to help developers with augmented reality apps and games. Pokemon Go will be one of the first to use the new functionality. With luck, it should ease the computing requirements and save on battery for AR-enabled apps, but we’ll have to wait a bit to know for sure. Eager for a piece of the personal assistant/smart speaker pie, Apple will be releasing their HomePod system, a Siri-enabled smart speaker that does all the usual things you’ve come to expect. It’ll be available for $349 and will start shipping in December. iPad Pro users also have something to look forward to — a 10.5-inch version coming next week. It starts at $649. All told, this was about what we’ve come to expect — incremental changes and upgrades. Nothing terribly earth-shattering, but we also haven’t seen nearly as much of the company’s trademark out-of-touch, breathlessness surrounding basic features and rudimentary ideas that everyone else has been enjoying for years. And that’s… well, it’s definitely something.

You can read more details on that news elsewhere on the site. Right now I want to talk about a certain theme pervading the show. One of the first announcements was for the next iteration of the Mac operating software. It’s called High Sierra. High Sierra. That emphasis isn’t mine. It’s Apple’s. Apple made pot jokes about its own software, talking about how baked it is or whatever. Suffice it to say we were surprised to see Apple acknowledge that marijuana exists. But as the show went on, it was clear that gag wasn’t an outlier. All I could think of during this WWDC was that the company founded by a dude who loved LSD finally rediscovered its connection to drugs. From what I hear, a thing about being on drugs is that little moments that might seem innocuous otherwise suddenly become uncanny or unnerving. This conference was full of screwed-up tiny little turns of phrases that seemed designed to trigger acid flashbacks like “buttery smooth” and “we invented printed books.” A man only referred to as Jaws walked out in a crazy purple shirt to talk about magic glass… the iPad. However, the products themselves also continued this vibe, and not just High Sierra. If you have an Apple Watch, which is already quantifying your feelings, you can trap living, writhing Toy Story cartoon characters on your wrist. The new Metal 2 graphics API can power virtual reality experiences on headsets like the HTC Vive. The demonstration featured an employee sucked into the world of Star Wars: Rogue One, shrinking TIE fighters and plopping Darth Vader right next to her on hellish Mustafar ready to chop her head off. Augmented reality is also getting a boost with ARKit. Now developers can easily allow you to hallucinate little Unreal Engine-rendered people or Lego Batman on your table when seen through your phone. In Pokemon Go, the Pokemon look so real, man. New 5K monitors like the iMac Pro display visuals at psychedelic levels and the music used in the teaser promo was similarly far out. With iOS (turned up to) 11, you can turn Live Photos into looping, hypnotic GIFs, watch kids hop into and out of a pool as long as you want. Or you can just go quickly download a trippy new game like beautiful crystalline indie puzzler Monument Valley 2 on the redesigned App Store. Meanwhile, the new HomePod Siri speaker/Amazon Echo competitor includes lofty, hippie features like using spatial awareness to adjust the sound depending on the room. You can totally, like, feel the music. Crank up the vaporwave. It will cost $350 when it launches in December but I would pay up to $420. And Siri’s new, increasingly human voice keeps on blurring the lines between man and machine, dog. But perhaps most importantly, Apple introduced many features for its products I suspect will be quite useful for people who use drugs. Better cybersecurity on Safari makes it much harder for websites to track you. Apple Pay now allows for Venmo-style person-to-person encrypted payments, so you can privately and securely pay friendly suppliers for whatever illicit goods you want just with your phone. The updated Maps app helps you navigate airports full of pesky drug-sniffing dogs more easily. And the new File system on iPad does a better job of understanding and keeping track of your handwritten nonsense notes or slapped together homemade Pirates of the Caribbean 5 posters. Apple wants to sell its goods and services to basically everyone on the planet, and that includes a lot of people who do drugs. An opening skit about the apocalypse that would follow if Apple tech failed even seemed like a shout-out to technophobic, paranoid stoners. At WWDC 2017 these truths collided in the most ironically hilarious and entertaining way a dry, industry-focused, two and a half hour software demonstration conference could have gone. High Sierra.

Apple TV adds Amazon After touting the work of Apple’s developers, Cook announced that Amazon is coming to Apple TV with its Prime Video app. Cook said Apple was pleased about the partnership, and mentioned some original Amazon content like Transparent. Advertisement The announcement marks a detente of sorts between the two companies, which have been locked in a streaming rivalry for years. In 2015, Amazon went so far as to pull listings for the Apple TV from its online store. watchOS Apple previewed the next version of watchOS 4, its operating system for the Apple Watch. There are new watch faces. A Siri face will show more info from the assistant, like flight times, controls for smart home devices and third-party notifications. A kaleidoscope face shows trippy animations, and new Toy Story character watch faces let Woody tell you the time. Advertisement The watch can communicate with some gym equipment to share data between the two — like your heart rate or the treadmill’s incline. Starting in the fall, Apple Watch compatible equipment will start coming to gyms from companies like Cybex, Schwinn and Matrix. If you hit workout goals, you’ll now get fancier animations to give you a greater sense of satisfaction. There are new workout updates, like one that can tell when you’re swimming and reach the end of the lane. The free OS upgrade will be available in the fall. The Mac Apple is pushing the Mac as a machine that’s made for virtual reality, with new hardware and software updates built for VR. The company is releasing a new version of its operating system for Macs. Coming this fall, macOS will be called High Sierra. Advertisement The OS is getting VR support, says Craig Federighi, including support for Unity, Unreal and Metal for VR. Expect more details later during the event. There are number of small changes in High Sierra. Safari is adding autoplay blocking, so loud videos don’t start playing without your approval. The browser is also adding “intelligent” tracking prevention in order to cut down on ads that follow you around the Internet. The Photos app is adding new filters, and Apple says it has improved the face detection feature. Categories, faces and favorites will be synchronized across devices. Apple is porting its Apple File System to macOS. It’s a mostly under-the-hood change, but users will notice a difference. For example, duplicating a file will be nearly instant. Video compression will be higher quality, according to Apple. “It’s time for a more modern file system,” said Federighi. Advertisement An iMac for pros Apple really wants to hold on to its professional users. Its Mac Pro hasn’t been updated since 2013, and Apple says the next version will be available some time next year. To bridge the gap, it’s built a superpowered version of its all-in-one iMac that will be available in December. The iMac Pro is a matte gray 27-inch computer that Apple says is the most powerful Mac it’s ever made. Starting at $4,999 for the basic configuration, the 5K machine will come with an 8-core, 10-core or 18-core Xeon processors. It can have up to 22 teraflops of graphics power. Apple says the machine is fast enough for real-time 3D rendering, code compiling and designing virtual reality content. “That iMac Pro really is bad ass,” said Cook.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Uh, Apple, Did You Think This Through? Adam Clark EstesMonday 5:29pm Filed to: WWDC wwdc 2017 homepod apple hal 9000 2001: a space odyssey 219 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Apple / Gizmodo The crowd cheered in California on Monday, when Apple announced HomePod, a new smart speaker armed with Siri, the company’s virtual assistant. Minutes later, an image of the product appeared on Apple’s website and, well, holy shit, it looks just like HAL 9000! Is Apple fucking with us? The resemblance is almost too uncanny. Of course, the new HomePod doesn’t normally look like an all-seeing eye of artificially intelligent doom. It normally looks like a very handsome speaker product, as it should. Still, the promo shot on the Apple Store website shows a bird’s eye view of the speaker which features the colorful Siri waveform in the center. Apple says this dynamic image “appears on the top to indicate when Siri is engaged” and the surface offers “integrated touch controls also allow easy navigation.” In other words, the glowing orb responds, when you’re talking to it, just like HAL 9000. It’s almost impossible to imagine that Apple overlooked the resemblance between this view of the HomePod and the murderous AI from Stanley Kubrick’s space opera, 2001: A Space Odyssey. It wouldn’t even be the first time that Apple’s nodded at HAL. Back in 2011, when Apple first released Siri, you could ask the virtual assistant to “open the pod bay doors,” and Siri would sometimes respond, “We intelligent agents will never live that down, apparently.” Sometimes Siri would even quote HAL and say, “I’m sorry, Adam, I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Which is funny because that’s the point in the film, where the main character realizes the robot is trying to kill him. Advertisement Jokes aside, the HAL 9000 visual reference does remind us that Apple now wants to install artificial intelligence and microphones into homes around the world. According to Apple, the HomePod only sends audio back to its servers once you’ve said “Hey Siri,” and even then, the data is encrypted. Nevertheless, it’s unclear exactly how much of your behavioral data Apple is recording and storing with the latest Siri updates, although the company says this data is stored locally on the Siri-powered device. So it’s not like your HomePod is going to go haywire, lock all the doors, and refuse to let you turn the lights on. But if you’ve seen 2001, you know that artificial intelligence can develop a mind of its own.

CEO Tim Cook said Apple wants to "reinvent home music" as he introduced the device at the company's World Wide Developers Conference in San Jose. The HomePod is powered with the same chip used by the iPhone, giving it what senior vice president Phil Schiller called "the biggest brains ever in a speaker." But it's not all brains and no boom. With a 4-inch woofer, "it's one of the best-sounding speakers I've ever heard," said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Apple framed the HomePod more as a music-listening platform, with the digital personal assistant Siri as a bonus.

And yet ... Despite the trauma of Saturday's deadly terror attack, the third on British soil in less than three months, the U.K. doesn't look like a crippled country. To be sure, the news Monday was grim. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to beef up security, and police released the names of two of the three attackers. But life was moving on. On Sunday, Ariana Grande returned with a host of superstars to Manchester, site of the horrific May 22 bombing, for an emotional but uplifting benefit concert that raised money for the attack victims. A viral photo of a man holding a pint of beer as he fled Saturday night's London attack seemed to capture the British mantra to "keep calm and carry on." And a restaurant customer who fled in panic during the attack returned to pay his bill, saying, "These people shouldn't win."

The NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors hasn't been much of a contest. The Warriors followed a 113-91 win in Game 1 with a 132-113 effort Sunday, leaving many wondering whether the Cavs are simply outmatched. No surprise, then, that the biggest news from Game 2 had nothing to do with the game. First, cameras caught the Warriors' Steph Curry on the bench in the fourth quarter lying down as if ready for a nap. That set off a storm of tweets labeling the star "disrespectful." After the game when a wild brawl among fans erupted, the Cavs J.R. Smith pushed the team's star LeBron James to safety. There are several reasons the Warriors have been winning big. But remember: Golden State was up 2-0 on the Cavs in last year's Finals, and LeBron and Co. ultimately won it all.

The memes joked about sensitive subjects, including sexual assault, the Holocaust, minority groups and child abuse. Harvard has said it “reserves the right to withdraw an offer of acceptance” if “a student engages in behavior that brings into question his or her honesty, maturity, or moral character.” And more bad news for the students and their parents: Harvard said its decision is final.

I got to the play with the operating system for a few minutes while handling the tablet, and what stands out the most is just how complicated it’s starting to feel — but in a way that shows the platform is evolving, not getting harder to use. The biggest updates in iOS 11 are on the iPad. And for once, iOS is taking hints from macOS, instead of the other way around. iOS apps are starting to get a lot more interconnected iOS’s new dock, in particular, feels like it’s come straight from the Mac. It can now hold as many apps as you want, and those apps retain their previous windowing state when they’re opened up again — so something you had in split-screen will stay in split-screen when you resume use of it. It’s a little bit like the Mac’s Spaces features. The dock hides much like it does for fullscreen Mac apps, too. But instead of moving your mouse cursor down, you just swipe up to reveal the dock again. Swiping to find the dock feels really natural, and, more importantly, it’s handy. I’ve never felt like I was able to quickly move around iOS, but it already feels like iOS 11 will start to change that. Part of that is because Apple has also brought something that resembles Mission Control to the iPad as well. If you swipe up on the dock (or do a single long swipe while the dock is hidden), all of your open apps, including ones you have in split-screen, will appear in a grid. It’s way more efficient than the existing task switcher, which required you to move through apps one at a time. (One other interesting note about all this swiping: it sure helps to obviate the need for a Home button!) A welcome reprieve from the share sheet This all comes together to help make iOS feel like a big interconnected workspace, instead of a storage container for a bunch of disparate apps. Apple’s new drag-and-drop feature is another example of that. You no longer have to use the awful share sheet to move a single file around; you can just drag an object around the operating system until you find the app you want to put it in. Selecting multiple objects for drag and drop is pretty easy: you press and hold on a single object, then tap any additional objects with another finger. It seems ideal for moving a few items at once, rather than the contents of an entire folder, but it’s still a huge improvement over the old way of moving things around, where every item felt locked into an app until it went through the magic “share sheet” and got spit out on the other side. Apple’s new Files app ties into this, too, as a central hub for moving things around. The app is basically just Finder from the Mac, but it’s been upgraded in a really smart way: cloud services like Dropbox and Box are build right into the sidebar instead of with premade folders for photos and movies. Tags are there, too, and I expect to use them exactly as infrequently (never) as I do on the Mac. But hey, they’re pretty easy to apply thanks to the drag-and-drop feature. On one hand, all of these changes complicate the iPad and could make the device harder for some people to use. The operating system no longer feels like it’s as “on rails” as it used to be. But in my quick use of iOS 11, the interactions all seemed to make sense, especially as someone coming from the Mac. That’s something I’ve been hoping Apple would do for a long time, and it’s shaping the iPad Pro into something much more similar to a traditional laptop. Some other stray impressions: Control Center looks pretty complicated and intimidating and kind of like a Cubist art piece, especially on the iPad where it’s displayed in one long vertical strip. That being said, a lot of people are going to love how many more controls are exposed here, including a toggle just for cellular radio. Press and hold on certain panels, and they’ll pop open to offer even more buttons, too. I couldn’t hear Siri super well given how loud the demo area was, but the updated female Siri voice sounded about the same and still had a robotic edge to it. The swipable key feature, where you’re able to drag down on a key to get a special character, was only present on the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. On the larger model, you still had to use the keyboard with special characters. That may have just been because this was an early demo, and I hope so — the swiping feature was way faster than switching to another keyboard (especially for something like inserting parenthesis). The iPad I was playing with didn’t have any notifications. And without any notifications, the new notification shade (which is just the lock screen) seemed a bit strange. It was the first time I felt a little bit like I was lost. I was able to play with Apple’s ARKit live in the demo room. It works just as advertised, with a cup, lamp, and chair properly settling down on a table and scaling to the right size as I moved the iPad around. There wasn’t much to do beyond that yet, but it worked, and it’s the kind of thing that people will likely have a whole lot of fun with if Apple builds features like this into the iPhone’s camera. Think built-in Snapchat World lenses. Sorry, Snap.

Reuters Jun 5, 2017 at 4:10 pm | Print View SAN JOSE, Calif. — Apple on Monday introduced the HomePod speaker to compete with Amazon.com’s Alexa assistant and Echo devices for users who prefer voice-operated systems for shopping, planning and other tasks. The hardware debut, a rarity at the annual developers conference that traditionally features software and only minor hardware updates, came as analysts and investors watch for signs of the world’s largest publicly traded company’s next blockbuster product a decade after the introduction of the iPhone. Apple’s voice-controlled Siri assistant will be integrated into the $349 speaker, and will make music recommendations that pair with the company’s Apple Music service, send text messages, check news and sports scores and control home gadgets such as light bulbs and thermostats. Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company said Siri, which also competes with Alphabet’s Google Assistant, also will now be able to create appointments on an iPhone after an appointment is booked on a Mac, for example, marking the first time that privacy-conscious Apple has let the assistant work across devices. Apple also offered some hints about new capabilities in the next iPhone, including so-called augmented reality, in which digital information is overlaid on real-world images. New indoor maps of areas such as malls and airports indicated that Apple might be laying groundwork to display information over images of those places in the future. The company rolled out new tools for developers to create augmented reality applications for iPhones and iPads. To show off the tools, Apple invited Wing nut AR, the company formed by “Lord of the Rings” director Peter Jackson, on stage. Taking direct aim at services such as those provided by PayPal Holdings, Apple also debuted peer-to-peer payments for Apple Pay in which users will be able to send money through the Messages app on iPhones. That money immediately can be used in retail stores that take Apple Pay or can be moved to a bank account. Apple also unveiled a key content deal when CEO Tim Cook said that Amazon Prime Video, long absent from the Apple TV product, would come to Apple devices such as the TV, iPhones and iPad later this year.

Techies from all around the world flocked to Apple’s Californian HQ for the Worldwide Developers’ Conference (WWDC) – an annual event where the tech firm shows off its latest gadgets and software. 11 Tim Cook, CEO, said this year’s event would be “the best and biggest” as he prepared to unveil the tech giant’s first new product range since the Apple Watch and a whole host of other treats. Here are all the announcements from WWDC 2017. iPad Pro 10.5 inch 11 These are the two new iPads Apple announced today Getty Images 11 A tech fan checks out the new iPad Pro at Apple WWDC The world’s most famous tablet computer will now come in a new size of 10.5 inches. Two models of iPad Pro are now on sale, with the larger 12.9 coming in at a slightly more expensive price than the new 10.5 inch model. Both of the gadgets are fitted with a super powerful new processor chip and a speedy graphics processor. The tablets aren’t cheap, starting at a price of £619 in the UK. But they are certainly powerful and should be future proof, because Apple has a long-standing history of updating and supporting its gadgets for at least five years. New iMacs and Macbooks 11 Getty Images 11 The new iMacs are versions of a computer which was first unveiled at the beginning of a golden era in which Apple founder Steve Jobs unleashed the iPhone and iPad Apple unveiled new affordable iMacs and Macbooks at a tempting price, but also a massively powerful and expensive iMac Pro. It will have a 27-inch Retina 5K display, up to 18-core Xeon processors and up to 22 Teraflops of graphics computation, making it the most powerful Mac ever made. But at $5,000– it’s not exactly an impulse purchase for most iFans. iOS 11 11 A view of iOS 11, which will be released later this year Getty Images 11 Apple iOS 11 will be released in the autumn, although a beta is already rolling out to developers Tim Cook, CEO, said the new software for iPad and iPhone has been “turned up to 11”. It includes major changes to Apple Pay and Messages as well as the Camera and Photos apps. The software will be released later this year, but a beta version is already rolling out to developers. People who install the software on iPads will notice the bigger change, as it will introduce new apps and workflow refinements which will make Apple’s tablet feel a bit more like a traditional computer. HomePod Apple release new powerful speaker the 'HomePod' giving you effortless access to music 11 The all new HomePod will rival Amazon Alexa and Google's Home Getty Images 11 The gadget comes in black and white and is small enough to be portable This was the big announcement of the night and is Apple's first major product to be launched since the Apple Watch. It's a Siri powered smart speaker and home assistant that can "rock the house", according to Apple. The gadget is a bit like Amazon's Echo, but likely to feature much better sound quality. It will cost about £350 but appears to be a much more luxurious and high end product than competitors' offerings. WatchOS 4 11 The new Apple watchOS4 will have new faces and improved reminder systems Apple Watch owners aren’t going to get much time to sit around. A brand new update will sync the wearable to gym machines and give the device its own High Intensity Interval Training feature. There’s a new flashlight, improved dock feature and even a special playlist which begins automatically when you start working out. MacOS High Sierra 11 The new MacOS is named after a region of California Tim Cook said Mac computers are the 'heart and soul of Apple' as he showed off a new version of the software that powers Macbooks and iMacs. The new operating system is called High Sierra and "delivers important forward-looking technologies and new opportunities for developers wanting to tap into the power of machine learning and create immersive VR content on the Mac,” according to Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering The Mac software has a new file system with built-in encryption to keep your sensitive information safe and super speedy graphics using a system called Metal 2.

(Presumably, Samsung is only just around the corner with something similar, too.) At its annual developer conference in San Jose, California, on Monday, Apple promised its personal assistant software Siri a second home (or third or fourth if you count her macOS or watchOS presence). Having housed her up in iPhones for the past six years, her Cupertino, California-based sugar daddy rewarded her with residence inside a mic'd speaker called HomePod. Like Amazon Alexa in her Echo, Google Assistant in her Home, and Microsoft Cortana's planned appearance in Harman Kardon's forthcoming Invoke speaker, Apple Siri in her HomePod represents an effort to take a voice-based computing interface beyond the desktop and mobile devices. The HomePod has a face for radio. It resembles a large ball of twine, at least the white version. It also comes in hairball gray. Apple's approach, as befits its investment in music, focuses on the output, the speaker. HomePod is cast as a complement to Apple Music, a sensible marketing strategy considering that these bi-directional audio devices haven't yet really found a reason for being beyond demanding that stuff be brought to one's door. Of course, Siri via HomePod will be able to send text messages, recount news and weather updates, and manipulate HomeKit-enabled devices like thermostats and garage door openers. But not everyone wants to buy networked lights just to tell Siri to toggle them. Music, if not the killer app for IoT hubs, is at least something more than a handful of people care about. "Just like iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Phil Schiller, senior veep of worldwide marketing. Déjà vu Apple has been here before, with the iPod Hi-Fi, a semi-portable speaker system panned for its weight, lackluster features, and high price ($350) when launched in 2006. That happens to be the planned price of the HomePod, slated to debut in December. While it's significantly more expensive than Google Home ($130) or Amazon Echo ($180), the HomePod compares favorably to competing speakers like the Sonos 5 ($500) and perhaps to the Cortana-infused Harman Kardon speaker, which has yet to disclose a price. Apple made much of the HomePod's capacity to improve the experience of listening to music, and its forthcoming operating system updates will help in that regard. Its software's pending support for multi-room audio could make managing multiple speakers in conjunction with multiple audio sources less vexing. Staking out a position on Apple's oft-visited privacy high ground, Schiller offered reassurance that the HomePod doesn't record anything until the user addresses Siri. Amazon Echo and Google Home work the same way, maintaining active mics (unless disabled by the user) that supposedly don't transmit data until the invocation phrase has been detected. But Apple's disinterest (or arguably incompetence) in advertising makes it a more plausible privacy partner than its peers. Security researchers consider the presence of these devices a potential privacy risk, though perhaps it's less likely than being fooled by a phishing message or revealing too much via social media. Alongside risks, there may be benefits. In a recent murder investigation, Arkansas authorities sought audio data captured by an Amazon Echo. Amazon resisted the demand, a necessary step to reassure potential customers. Then the defendant in the case subsequently allowed authorities access to the voice recordings Amazon had captured, turning the privacy risk into a bid for exoneration. Beyond evidence, HomePod and its ilk may eventually become indispensable channels to summon service from a cloud of connected devices. Until then, they'll at least be able to play tunes on demand. And that counts for something. The HomePod will be available in Australia, the UK, and the US when it ships in December. ® Tips and corrections 50 Comments MORE Apple Iot Siri Ai Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Apple finally teaches Android music app to validate certificates Cupertino's so keen on Android it took eight months to repair interception bug 3 Comments Apple fights off iTunes patent spat appeal That bit where you said we didn't have to give them $500m – stick with that 7 Comments Apple blocks comms-snooping malware Leaked developer certificate revoked, protection updated 12 Comments Nokia, Apple lawyers make peace over nasty IP wrangle Unspecified lump sum heading for Finland 24 Comments Apple asks FCC to let it run mm-wave tests - for backhaul?!

The new machine will be $4,999 and available in December. 2:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF For WWDC 2017, Apple headed south to San Jose, dogged by damning comparisons with Google, Facebook and Microsoft over its lack of attention to mixed reality (VR and AR), Siri's absence from your smart home in comparison with smart home hubs like the Google Home  and Amazon Echo and other ways in which Apple seems to have fallen behind. Folks were eager to hear about Apple's plans to catch up in these leading-edge markets. 49 Apple's biggest WWDC announcements Even before the conference opening, we began to hear the numbers: iOS app developers earned $20 billion in 2016 (and given Apple's 30 percent cut, that means it made a not-so-paltry $6 billion) and downloads are growing at a nice pace. The company updated its Swift Playgrounds, a teach-kids-to-code-Swift (its proprietary programming language) app, to support control over robots and drones. The keynote began with a video showing how the world would fall apart if we didn't have our iOS apps and the safe and sane App Store. And in a random announcement, we see a small step for Amazon, a huge leap for Apple TV owners: you're getting an Amazon Video app.  And of course, all the inteligence is driven by enhanced Apple AI technology. Later in the conference, Michelle Obama will be talking empowerment. Apple's HomePod is a smart speaker for your home Apple wants the new Siri-powered device to be the center of your home. It will cost $349 and will be available starting in December. by Scott Stein 1:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF HomePod Interestingly, Apple positioned its new home speaker as a music experience rather than just the rumored a smart-home hub, ostensibly to "reinvent home music." You can't get it until later in 2017, though. Dubbed the HomePod, it has better audio specs than other hub speakers -- pretty good audio specs in general for its size -- and an A8 chip for processing (the same chip that's in the iPhone). It uses a wide-array mic that supposedly can hear you over the music, and naturally integrates with Apple Music and can control HomeKit devices. It will ship in December for $350.  16 Say hello to Apple's HomePod smart speaker iOS 11 and apps The latest update of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, has some notable new features: Interface: A redesigned app drawer with horizontal scrolling as well as a redesigned control center with more 3D Touch operations. The lockscreen can show all notifications,  iMessages: Automatic message synchronization across devices via iCloud. Apple Pay: Now it supports person-to-person payments across all iOS devices and works with iMessages. Siri: She's got a more natural-sounding voice and can translate for you and suggest tasks. Plus there's a new more visual interface. And she knows you across your devices. But she'll respect your privacy. Camera: New H.265 video encoding for more efficient storage and a new High Efficiency Image Format based on H.265 to replace JPEG. Threre's a new depth API (needed for AR). It will enable the faux defocus mode for portraits, too. Photos: Welcome editable Live Photos with GIF-like tools like looping and reversing, and a long-exposure effect. Memories now recognizes pets and supports vertical video. Apple Maps: Now with floor plans of the mall! Also lane guidance and a do-not-disturb mode that senses when a car is moving. AirPlay 2: Control multiroom speakers (with supported speakers), and Apple TV. Apple Music will show you your friends's suggested picks. Redesigned App Store with a games tab. And more, of course. Though not a feature, Apple also launched an augmented-reality programming interface, ARKit, so that developers can incorporate AR into apps. It demoed a better-looking Pokemon Go built using it. 29 Here are the iOS 11 features Apple announced at WWDC 2017  MacBooks and iMacs The iMacs get better displays, better storage options, an improved display and 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors. Also, an update to Intel 7th-generation and the new integrated graphics, plus the Retina 4K incorporates the discrete RX500 series and the 5K model gives you Radeon RX500 series options. That puts them on par with Windows 10 all-in-ones. The 21.5-inch starts at $1,100 and the 5K 27-inch starts at $1,800. A 4K 21.5 inch starts at $1,300. A new iMac Pro will ship by the end of the year, the company's most powerful Mac ever. It has better cooling than a typical iMac, it ships with up to an 18-core Xeon, Radeon Vega graphics, up to 128GB of ECC memory and up to 4TB of SSD storage.  And it will start at $5,000 when it ships in December. The MacBooks are refreshed with 7th-generation Intel chips and better graphics, and the 13-inch without Touchbar gets a price drop to $1,300. The Air gets a brush-up. 13 The new iMac Pro is truly a beast iPad and iPad Pro Apple adds an iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch display in the 9.7-inch body, thanks to smaller bezels. Both iPad Pros will get new displays, with True Tone, DCI-P3 gamut, 600-nit brightness and ultralow reflectivity. A new feature, Pro Motion, bumps the refresh rate to 120Hz. Latency drops to 20ms with the Apple Pencil. They're also faster, thanks to the 12-core GPU and six-core CPU Fusion A10X chip. A better camera with 4K and wide-gamut capture is another hardware highlight, along with USB-C fast charging. They both come with 64GB memory and start at $650 for the smaller and $800 for the larger model. They'll be available next week. There are more iPad-specific features in iOS 11. Swipe up to bring up the dock to switch apps or bring one up and drag-and-drop anything. A new Files app brings a more desktoplike file system operation that supports third-party storage providers. There's a special markup mode for use with the Pencil and it does handwriting recognition in Notes. MacOS High Sierra The MacOS desktop operating system didn't get a major update, as you can tell from the name, just some refinements. But a lot of the High Sierra refinements are performance-focused, which is always welcome. The big enhancements: Safari: It "helps give you a serene browsing experience." Whut? But now it's faster, with autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention to filter cross-site scripting and so on. Mail: Split view for the compose window, smaller storage footprint. Photos: New organization and editing tools, filter by keywords and file types, better face recognition, synchronization across devices. The editing tools can now synchronize with other editing tools. And there are new photo book partnerships. The file system: This has needed an update for a long time, and now the much more modern APFS is the default. Video: Support for hardware acceleration and a software encoder for H.265 video. Graphics: An update to its acceleration architecture, Metal 2, with a lot of performance increases. It also supports a new external enclosure for MacBooks, with Thunderbolt 3 and A Radeon RX 580. Metal 2 also adds hooks for VR. Want MacOS High Sierra and iOS 11 sooner rather than later? Sign up for the public betas. 10 MacOS High Sierra has some really cool new features WatchOS 4 New to WatchOS, Apple's watch operating system: New faces: A new Siri watch face and a new complication for showing notifications, a Kaleidoscope face based on your image and faces with "Toy Story" characters. Fitness: Monthly challenges in the Activity tracker; a new interface and new high-intensity workout in the Workout app, two-way data exchange with gym equipment, and more. Music: It integrates better with Apple Music to feed your favorites to the watch. A vertically scrolling interface. Native Bluetooth to connect to sensors. 25 Apple WatchOS 4 preview in pics It was one of the most fast-moving, packed 2.5-hour WWDC keynotes I've seen in a while. I'm exhausted. See you in a year.

At the event, held in San Jose on Monday, Apple touted a new peer-to-peer payments service and announced a deal to bring Amazon video content to Apple TV after years of tension between the two companies. The Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is usually where Apple previews its software updates. But Apple also used the event to introduce a new piece of hardware and give some major upgrades to existing products. HomePod Apple is taking on Amazon and Google with its very own smart speaker, the HomePod. The 7-inch high speaker looks like the top of a microphone. Available in white and black, the $349 device is being marketed as a smart speaker with higher quality audio than its competitors. It has six microphones that are always listening for the trigger phrase “Hey, Siri.” It works with Apple Music and your existing iTunes library to play tunes or podcasts. If you have other devices connected to Apple’s smart home app, you can control them though the speaker as well. It also does the usual smart speaker tasks, like playing the news, setting timers and answering basic questions. Apple TV adds Amazon While Apple is going after Amazon with the HomePod, it’s offering an olive branch with Apple TV. Amazon’s Prime Video app will soon be available on Apple TV. CEO Tim Cook said Apple was pleased about the partnership, and mentioned some original Amazon content like Transparent. The announcement marks a detente of sorts between the two companies, which have been locked in a streaming rivalry for years. In 2015, Amazon went so far as to pull listings for the Apple TV from its online store. The Mac Apple is pushing the Mac as a machine that’s made for virtual reality, with new hardware and software updates built for VR. The company is releasing a new version of its operating system for Macs. Coming this fall, macOS will be called High Sierra. The OS is getting VR support, said Craig Federighi, including support for Unity, Unreal and Metal for VR. There are number of small changes in High Sierra. Safari is adding autoplay blocking, so videos don’t start playing without your approval. The browser is also adding “intelligent” tracking prevention in order to cut down on ads that follow you around the Internet. The Photos app is adding new filters, and Apple says it has improved the face detection feature. Categories, faces and favorites will be synchronized across devices. Apple is porting its Apple File System to macOS. It’s a mostly under-the-hood change, but users will notice a difference. For example, duplicating a file will be nearly instant. Video compression will be higher quality, according to Apple. “It’s time for a more modern file system,” said Federighi. An iMac for pros Apple really wants to hold on to its professional users. Its Mac Pro hasn’t been updated since 2013, and Apple says the next version will be available some time next year. To bridge the gap, it’s built a superpowered version of its all-in-one iMac that will be available in December. The new iMac Pro is a matte gray 27-inch computer that Apple says is the most powerful Mac it’s ever made. Starting at $4,999 for the basic configuration, the 5K machine will come with an 8-core, 10-core or 18-core Xeon processors. It can have up to 22 teraflops of graphics power. Apple says the machine is fast enough for real-time 3D rendering, code compiling and designing virtual reality content. “That iMac Pro really is bad ass,” said Cook. Every Mac gets an update Apple’s other PCs are all getting speed and performance updates. iMacs are getting across-the-board speed improvements and more storage. They’ll also include higher performance graphics chips to support VR. The company had Industrial Light and Magic’s John Knoll on stage for a live demo of a Vive virtual reality Star Wars game using a Mac. MacBook and MacBook Pros are getting updates as well. The company is also adding a cheaper $1,300 MacBook Pro option. The neglected MacBook Air is not dead, but it only got one brief mention. It will have a bump in megahertz. That’s it. iOS 11 In iOS 11, Apple’s forthcoming mobile operating system, the company is introducing peer-to-peer payments through iMessage. Apple is taking on money-sharing apps like Venmo and Square Cash, as you’ll be able to use Apple Pay to send friends money via chat. Siri also got an update — the virtual assistant can translate English into five different languages: Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish, with more coming in the future. Apple is introducing a number of effects into the Live Photos feature. It will use machine learning to turn your Live Photos into shareable looping images and select individual clips from the photo. It’s also adding a feature to block notifications while the phone is in Car Play mode. You won’t get any notifications while in the car, and if you look at your phone, you’ll see an alert reminding you that you won’t receive notifications while on the road. It will automatically send a text message to people who text you to let them know you’ll respond later. Apple wants to get in on augmented reality too Look for more augmented reality in the next version of IOS. Apple announced ARKit, a new developer application for adding virtual objects to real surfaces in the camera. Like Facebook, Apple’s demo started with a fake cup of coffee on an actual table. The tool uses the iPhone camera, processors and motion sensors to make objects look real. Motion tracking, ambient lighting and scale estimation will let developers create augmented reality in their own apps. A revamped App Store Apple is redesigning the App Store, its first major overhaul in its nine years. The store’s 500 million weekly users will see new tabs highlighting curated collections and article-like stories made by Apple, not just developers. A Today section will show off apps the company wants to highlight, a Games tab will do the same for games and also display in-app purchases. watchOS Apple previewed the next version of watchOS 4, its operating system for the Apple Watch. There are new watch faces. A Siri face will show more info from the assistant, like flight times, controls for smart home devices and third-party notifications. A kaleidoscope face shows trippy animations, and new Toy Story character watch faces let Woody tell you the time. The watch can communicate with some gym equipment to share data between the two — like your heart rate or the treadmill’s incline. Starting in the fall, Apple Watch compatible equipment will start coming to gyms from companies like Cybex, Schwinn and Matrix. If you hit workout goals, you’ll now get fancier animations to give you a greater sense of satisfaction. There are new workout updates, like one that can tell when you’re swimming and reach the end of the lane. The free OS upgrade will be available in the fall. iPads Apple is releasing a new iPad Pro with brighter retina displays. It comes in two sizes, the usual 12-9 inch and a new 10.5-inch screen. The bigger surface will fit a full-size on-screen keyboard and an attachable physical keyboard, though there’s no touchpad. It has a number of speed and performance improvements, and has a 12 megapixel back camera. In iOS 11, iPads will have new features that are taken directly from the Mac. You can drag and drop between apps and get an overview of what’s open. There’s a built-in document scanner in the camera and a way to draw inside of your emails. A dystopian future A new Apple ad showed what the world could look like without apps, triggered after a hapless Apple employee unplugged something in a server room. Hipsters panic trying to read paper maps, cars pile up in the roads. and a girl hands out printed selfies. An “app” black market sets up shop in a back alley, complete with a physical Tinder and booth for crushing real candy. NEVER MISS A STORY!

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

Dubbed the HomePod, it's a $349 Siri-powered speaker that will try to outshine its competitors in terms of audio quality. "Just like the iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Apple's head of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Mentioned in this article Amazon Echo Dot (2nd generation)  TechHive rating $49.99MSRP $49.99View on Amazon On stage, Schiller talked up the HomePod's acoustic qualities, which include seven beam-forming horn-loaded tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and a four-inch powered woofer that can adapt to the acoustic characteristics of the room it's playing in. All that's driven by an Apple A8 processor, similar to what's inside the iPhone 6 and fourth-generation Apple TV. Users can also set up two HomePods next to one another, and they'll synchronize for better sound, the speaker will support whole-home audio with other speakers that support Apple's AirPlay 2 wireless audio technology. [ Further reading: The best white LED smart bulbs ] TechHive The HomePod flexes its audio quality muscles. To activate the speaker, users can say "Hey Siri" and then ask to play songs from Apple Music. Schiller talked up the HomePod's "musicologist" features, which can answer requests like "Play something new," "What was the top song in 1983?" and "Who's the drummer in this?" The top of the HomePod is also touch-sensitive for controlling volume and pausing. TechHive Siri can answer all kinds of musical queries on HomePod. Schiller had much less to say about HomePod's broader Siri smarts, although the product page on Apple's website hints that it can perform many of the smart-home tasks that an Amazon Echo or Google Home can do.  In addition to playing music, HomePod can provide news, general knowledge, reminders, podcasts, translation, weather, and HomeKit controls, among other things. But Apple did not announce support for third-party voice skills, like Amazon and Google offer with their smart speakers. Although Siri does support a narrow set of third-party voice actions on iOS devices, it's unclear whether these will be accessible on HomePod. Mentioned in this article Sonos Play:5 (2015 Edition)  TechHive rating $499.00MSRP $499.00View on Amazon Also worth noting: Apple didn't announce support for any music services beyond its own Apple Music. Users might be able to send music from an iOS or Mac device over AirPlay, but it doesn't sound like there's a way to request music by voice from third-party services like Spotify, Pandora, Amazon Music, or TuneIn. (Conversely, HomePod will be the only connected speaker with Apple Music support.) TechHive Siri supports some general queries on HomePod, but there's no word on third-party product integration. In lieu of those skills, Apple is banking on HomePod's superior audio quality to stand out from the competition. HomePod's room-equalization feature sounds very similar to Sonos' TruePlay, but Sonos is relying on Amazon's Alexa for voice control. What's more, that project is still in the works. By the same token, you can drive beefier speakers with a $50 Echo Dot, but Apple's solution is less cluttered and it offers whole-home audio support. HomePod might also have some unique appeal to folks who've invested in Apple's burgeoning HomeKit smart home ecosystem. Still, those users will have to wait a while to get one. Apple plans to launch HomePod in December for $349, starting with the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Apple is not yet taking pre-orders.

Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December. Apple introduced iOS 11, the next version of the software that powers the iPhone and iPad, and rolled out new tools for developers to create augmented reality applications for the devices. And taking direct aim at services like those provided by PayPal Holdings, Apple also debuted peer-to-peer payments for Apple Pay in which users will be able to send money through the Messages app on iPhones. That money can immediately be used in retail stores that take Apple Pay or can be moved to a bank account.

(Gary Rey= es/ Bay Area News Group)=20 By Sal Pizarro | spizarro@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 5, 2017 at 2:32 pm | UPDATED: June 6, 2017 at 4:20 am If you stop by the Hotel De Anza’s Hedley Club Lounge this week, you’ll notice a new drink being served: The Apple Sidecar. At other downtown bars like the Loft and Deluxe, you can get specials on apple martinis. And one of downtown’s biggest night spots, San Pedro Square Market, expects to be busy all week. Apple CEO Tim Cook opened the company’s World Wide Developers Conference on Monday morning by saying it was great to be back in San Jose. And the Bay Area’s biggest city is certainly returning the compliment. “We absolutely love having them here in San Jose,” San Pedro Square Market Manager Joe Horrigan. The market has two trivia nights, plus three bands lined up this week to entertain conferencegoers. One of them, Emergency Third Rail Power Trip, is made up of mostly current and former Apple employees.

(Courtesy Hotel De Anza)  It’s just one way that downtown San Jose is all about WWDC this week. The facade of the McEnery Convention Center has been re-skinned with WWDC’s logo — and it’s such an improvement, the city should find a way to keep it. Developers also will be spilling out into other downtown San Jose venues throughout the week. Though nearly, all the events are limited to registered conference participants, it could still make for some good people watching. Monday night, The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple is hosting the Beard Bash — if you’ve ever seen his whiskers, you understand the name — featuring the tribute band Department of Rock and lots of Heineken flowing at the City National Civic. Developers will be partying at the McEnery Convention Center plaza Tuesday at 6 p.m. with local craft beers and live music, and Wednesday’s they’ll be taking in the IMAX movie, “A Beautiful Planet,” at the Tech Museum’s Hackworth IMAX Dome Theater. Others might skip the Wednesday movie to take in James Dempsey and the Breakpoints’ benefit concert that same day at the City National Civic to support App Camp For Girls, organized by WWDCGirls. Buddybuild is hosting the WWDC edition of its “buddybeers” event at craft cocktail lounge Paper Plane on Tuesday night (where it also happens to be Negroni Week), and former Apple Genius Bar employee and stand-up comic James Veitch has a geek-bent set Tuesday at the San Jose Improv. The party portion of the conference itself concludes Thursday night with a huge outdoor bash at Discovery Meadow, the park next to the purple Children’s Discovery Museum. Downtown bars and restaurants also are welcoming WWDC attendees and Apple fans with open arms. Popular bars and venues including Forager, the Ritz and Haberdasher have been snapped up by developer events on various days this week, but there’s still a lot for the non-developer crowd to enjoy. San Pedro Square Market has two acts playing Monday night — guitarist Jerry Sauceda at 6 p.m. and zydeco favorite Andre Thierry at 7 p.m. — and has opened its new Garage Bar just in time for WWDC, after a successful test run during last Thursday’s SPUR Member Party. Emergency Third Rail Power Trip plays wednesday at 6 p.m. And if you just want to toast the conference, the Apple Side Car is on the Hedley Club lounge menu at the Hotel De Anza this week (It’s got Calvados apple brandy and is served with a small plate of sliced apples). Deluxe, Chacho’s and Loft Bar and Bistro all planned to have specials on appletinis, too.

By Emily Bary June 5, 2017 4:36 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple will make it easy for you to send money to your friends from within the iMessages app. This could be the break that Apple Pay needs. Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto Apple devoted sizable chunks of time at WWDC to discussing VR-content creation, the iMac Pro, and iPads, but one of the real game changers could be something that got only a passing mention. As some had speculated, Apple introduced a way to use Apple Pay for peer-to-peer payments. The product looks better than we expected. Within the iMessages app, you can easily send or request money from a friend. The money you receive gets stored on an “Apple Pay Cash Card.” You can use that card to pay friends and retailers, or you can simply send it back to one of your traditional accounts. It’s all verified with the built-in TouchID. More from Barron’s Next You Won’t Have to Wait for That iPhone 8 Is Venmo the Next Big Social Network? Get Ready for the $1,000 iPhone Of course, Venmo, owned by PayPal, does much of this too, and even within iMessages. But Apple controls iMessages and will work to make Apple Pay as seamless as possible. That could expand peer-to-peer payments beyond the young core audience Venmo has found. Currently, you have to choose to put Venmo onto your iMessages screen. Apple Pay will be built in. And when a friend writes “you owe me $20,” your phone will automatically suggest sending it over via Apple Pay. It’s unclear if Apple will scale back its Venmo support within iMessages. Peer-to-peer functions could give Apple Pay its big break. So far, people have been slow to adopt it as a way to pay retailers. One theory is that the service doesn’t offer much to improve the payment process, so it’s not worth setting up. But paying friends back still isn’t so easy, especially for those who don’t use Venmo. If Apple promotes peer-to-peer payments correctly (and asks folks more regularly to store their credit-card information), the service could take off. Once you’ve received money from friends, you might be more inclined to try Apple Pay within other apps, or at stores. Apple’s stock is down 1% Monday, while PayPal shares are up 0.4%. Big Picture: Apple just announced a peer-to-peer payments service that will compete with Venmo.

It is a little ridiculous to expect Apple to take responsibility for what is clearly a user error, but such is the way of our times. And now Apple will add a Do Not Disturb feature to the iPhone to stop people from becoming distracted while driving. Announced today, Apple will add a Do Not Disturb feature to Apple CarPlay along with iOS 11. As explained by our friends at Gizmodo, CarPlay will use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi doppler effects to detect when you’re in a car and “automatically lock down your phone.” You’ll have nothing but a blank screen to look at. iOS 11: All the Cool New Features Coming to Your iPhone and iPad Can you believe Apple’s iOS is 11 iterations old already?

Users have the option of sending an auto reply to contacts listed in Favorites to let them know they are driving and cannot respond until they arrive at their destination. Oh, the prolonged silence—not that! Thank God for the automated response. Can’t have our friends waiting for more than a few seconds before receiving an answer. But what about iPhones that don’t belong to the driver? There’s a way to turn off Do Not Disturb: Which means your passengers can still use their phones to their hearts’ content. And also, potentially, for drivers to lie and say they’re not driving. I can’t imagine anyone would do that, though. Sponsored Are people really so addicted to their phones that they can’t just put them down for a duration of a drive—that they need an intervention? If it saves lives, fine. Good.

But I recognised that the beauty of this App Store is that we, with no games experience, could have a distribution channel. We could put something out there. We wanted to make the core content. Dan Gray, Head of Studio at ustwo games, had come from a hardcore gaming company, Hello Games, and brought a new approach to ustwo. “The thing I was always most interested in is how do you make games truly for everyone. So, the true test as we developed it, was we’d say, ‘I'm going to put this device in your hand and I'm not going to tell you anything. And then we're going to tell you that there's nothing that you can do that is wrong.’ ” Read more Monument Valley 2 revealed at WWDC 2017 Then they recorded people using it for hundreds of hours, a freedom afforded because there was no deadline for which they had to have it ready. Gray again: “The only thing these guys said was we've put the right team in place, you've got the right environment, the only thing we care about is you make something that you guys are proud of and lots of people love.” In the process, they hardly ever called Monument Valley a game. “We mostly said interactive entertainment or experience, because game makes it sound like something that has scores and leaderboards and achievements and lives. We wanted to take all that out of the equation,” Gray explains. It also meant they could appeal to non-gamers and to a wide age range. And the App Store offered a useful business model. Sinx says, “This sort of free to play gaming definitely wasn't interesting us. We wanted to believe in premium. We want people to pay up front. We think that that means that people probably care more. And all credit to Apple as well, I mean, they really believed in what we were trying to make, that this was the ultimate coffee table experience. We asked ourselves, what would Apple have made if they made games? We'd like to believe that is what Monument Valley was. And it did incredible for us. I don't think it was a shock but I think we probably didn't expect it to be so transformative in terms of the reception. Still to this day it sells really well.” As Mills confirms, “I'm not driven by the financial aspect at all but of course it helps. I think Monument Valley made us more money in the first year than we had done for years before. When you get it right on the App Store, fuck me, you can get it right.” “Now obviously we're making a big bet on the follow-up game which isn't just a sequel, it is more than that. And we just want to continue to innovate around that,” Sinx adds. The plot of the new game sees the player guide a mother and her child as they embark on a journey. As in the first game, there’s impossible architecture and pathways, with puzzles to be solved. Gray says, "I'd say one of the differences here is the bigger emphasis on relationships and emotional impact. Watching the two characters evolve over the experience, not just in terms of their interactions, but the gameplay was a hugely gratifying task. Some of the later chapters are also quite a departure in terms of visuals and interactions, and altogether I'd say we've delivered a game that exceeds Monument Valley in every area." The original game even featured in the TV series House of Cards. It was not a product placement, though, ustwo didn’t pay for the exposure. Gray says, “I always want to say it was a well-though-out strategic decision from us. But it wasn’t. This is the good thing about making something beautiful and something that people want to share. The reality of the situation is there was a player who downloaded the game and loved it. They recommended it to a friend and it just happened to be that the friend was the writer on House of Cards Beau Willimon. He noticed similarities between his own character development and saw our game as a perfect plot device to create parallels between what he was thinking and what our own character was trying to do in the game. “When they originally rang us up I thought it was a bit of a joke. I didn't think it was really them. They said can we use your game in the show and they wanted us to sign a waiver and that was it. Sometimes in television, video games are portrayed in a way that's negative or violent. We knew our game wasn't like that so they sent us the script. I think for the week that the series came out we had about 10 times sales. In fact, someone worked out that it was more effective than a Super Bowl halftime advert.” More about: Monument Valley Monument Valley 2 House of Cards Apple WWDC Tim Cook Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Announcing a new version of the iPad Pro at the opening keynote marking the start of its developer's conference, WWDC 17, the newly announced iPad Pro 10.5 will come with a better, brighter, larger, display, but without swelling the size of this ultra-portable tablet. Apple WWDC 2017: All the announcements that matter iPad Pro 10.5: Design 250.6 x 174.1 x 6.1mm, 469g Thinner bezel Similar design to out-going iPad Pro 9.7 At first glance the new 10.5-inch model looks similar in design to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the larger 12.9-inch screen models. However, it now features a much thinner bezel, allowing the company to create a device that offers more display without swelling the body too much. The new iPad 10.5 is only a few millimetres larger than the 9.7, meaning you're getting more space in a similar footprint. In this sense, Apple is following the industry trend of increasing the screen to body ratio for better results.  The new iPad Pro 10.5 is slightly heavier than the previous 9.7-inch model, as you would expect, but in the hand, the weight difference is barely noticeable. It's still a thin and light device that feels well balanced. The increased size means it is still going to happily slip into a bag in the same way users of the 9.7-inch model have come to expect, and the new thinner bezel doesn't affect holding the tablet, while making everything feel a little more contemporary. Overall, this is still very much the same design, offering that familiar metal back and the range of colours you'd expect. Apple iPad 10.5: ProMotion display 10.5-inch, 2224 x 1668 pixels, 264ppi ProMotion 120Hz adaptable refresh rate Of course, it is not just about a bigger display: the iPad Pro 10.5 gets a number of new enhancements in terms of power, cameras, software, and accessories. The display isn't just larger, but technically much more capable too. Claimed by Apple as the most "advanced iPad display yet", it is certainly bright, crisp, and clear. This is still a Retina display, offering a resolution of 2224 x 1668 pixels, so the pixel density remains the same as the larger 12.9-inch iPad and the smaller iPad 9.7. It's a fully laminated display, offering Apple's True Tone technology, but introducing something that Apple is calling ProMotion. This allows the display to run at a 120Hz refresh rate, which means that if you are viewing fast moving motion, you get the improved screen refresh rate to make things "buttery smooth". This is the sort of thing you'll need to deliver great AR experiences, but the technology isn't just for high-octane, action-packed movies or video games, but used all the time to make web scrolling smoother or boost app graphics. The critical thing about ProMotion is that it's adaptive. Having a 120Hz refresh rate puts much more drain on the battery, so the iPad Pro will adapt the display to suit the content you're viewing. If you're reading a book, for example, you don't need that 120Hz boost, so it drops down to suit the conditions, saving battery drain. Apple iPad Pro 10.5: Boosted performance iPhone 7 cameras A10X Fusion processor 64GB storage starting point 10 hours battery life A new model means more powerful hardware. The 10.5-inch version gets the same front and rear cameras that sit in the iPhone 7, a new A10X Fusion processor, and larger standard storage options starting from 64GB and going all the way up to 512GB. We weren't able to really give the device a run for its money during our hands-on time after the keynote, but what we did see at this stage gave us no cause for concern. Apps loaded fast, graphic demos for images, videos, and AR were smooth, and overall things look just as, if not more as, than what we've seen previously on the two current iPad Pro models. Which Apple iPad is best for you? iPad mini vs iPad Air vs iPad vs iPad Pro Apple iPad 10.5: An iOS 11 future Although the iPad Pro 10.5 is out in June, it will launch with iOS 10 before upgrading to iOS 11 when it's available in autumn. The latest operating system update from Apple offers a range of new features, but in particular a number aimed at really "super-charging" the iPad for pro users, including a new dock, app switching options, and a new app called Files. The changes look to make a huge difference in practical productive use and further push the question of whether you even need a laptop.  Pocket-lint App switching, although looking complicated for the novice user, should make a huge difference for power users, meaning you have more options for multi-tasking, viewing multiple apps in different ways, as well as letting you manage your files more easily than before. Drag and drop will make it easy to move files and folders from one app to another and the Files app will give you a window into a wide range of online document services, meaning it will be really easy to get to your content, whether it's on Box, Dropbox, iCloud, G Drive or elsewhere. For now, new iPad Pro 10.5 users will have to settle for an iOS experience that's very close to the existing iPad Pro models, looking forward to a boost later in the year. We look forward to testing the new software when it's updated first with the public beta at the end of June and then when it's out around September time. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review: The tablet to beat all tablets Apple iPad 10.5: Accessories The new iPad gets Apple's usual array of cases and smart keyboards. The new size means the iPad Pro keyboard is now full size, which means typing isn't so squished, while the introduction of a new smart case gives you a slot to store the Apple Pencil so you don't lose it in the void of your bag. Pocket-lint First Impressions The iPad Pro 10.5 looks like a lovely tablet. The enhanced speed, bigger screen, and eventually, new software options make this a worthy addition to the iPad Pro range - and one that is unlikely to disappoint.  We've yet to properly live with the iPad Pro 10.5 to see whether the addition of the ever-so-slightly bigger screen makes a difference over the 9.7-inch version (which is now discontinued), but we suspect it will make multitasking so much easier. This isn't a drop-everything-and-upgrade revolution, but if you've held off going Pro before, this is certainly going to appeal to those who want their iPad to step up and be more productive than it's ever been before, and maybe even retire that laptop.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) That right there? That's on'a them Homepods. (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Although a new product announcement from Apple isn’t the major pop-cultural event that it used to be, the pitiless taskmaster that is capitalism demands that the company continue pressing ever forward with sleek new gadgets exciting enough to convince consumers that last year’s gadget just isn’t good enough anymore. It did so today at the WWDC (World Wide Developer’s Conference), its annual in-house presentation of its newest innovations for software developers as reported by The New York Times. Chief among those innovations is the Homepod, Apple’s answer to Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Google Home. Aside from its rippity-rappin’ name, the Homepod does pretty much the same stuff all those other home assistants do, but with a more streamlined design. Voiced by a reportedly new and improved Siri, the particular gadget will retail for $349, which is significantly more than its rivals—the Echo currently retails for $179 and Google Home for $129—but its speakers are supposedly better than the rest, thus justifying the higher price tag. It will be available in December. Then there’s the new iPad Pro. Apple may be playing catchup in the home-assistant realm, but it innovated tablets back in 2010 with the original iPad; the only problem is, iPads apparently don’t break often enough, resulting in a decline in sales in recent years. So, to persuade existing iPad customers to buy another one, Apple has unveiled an iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display, in between the 9.7 inch and 12.9-inch models. It’s also got something called ProMotion that’s supposed to ”increase the refresh rate and make motion smoother in video content,” although if it’s anything like the motion-smoothing technology on HDTVs that produces the dreaded “soap opera effect,” that may or may not be a good thing. Regardless, the 10.5 inch iPad Pro retails for $649 and starts shipping next week. Aside from the expected introduction of new versions of its mobile (iOS 11) and computer (High Sierra) operating systems—the latter of which does come with one exciting feature, blocking autoplay videos on Safari—the other big announcement at the unusually hardware-focused presentation was the unveiling of a new version of Apple’s desktop model iMac Pro. The souped-up new version ”will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega,” making it Apple’s most powerful computer to date, according to the NYT. Apple’s been lagging behind in terms of professional-quality hardware in recent years, with its last high-performance desktop model, the MacPro, landing with a thud back in 2013. Giving the new iMacPro another chance won’t come cheap, though: These super-powered new models go for $5,000 a pop and will be available in December. Submit your Newswire tips here.

The company also launched a ton of new hardware, including upgraded MacBooks and a brand new smart speaker powered by Siri. There’s plenty of news to get into, so let’s go ahead and dive right in. Here is everything Apple announced at WWDC today that you need to know about. A Siri smart speaker to control your home Apple announced its long-awaited smart speaker that’s set to compete directly against Google Home and the Amazon Echo. The device itself works a lot like its competitors. You can start using the speaker by saying the wake phrase “Hey Siri” and then ask it to do things, like play music. The smart speaker can also do things like answer questions about the weather or traffic. It’s also meant to be a hub for all the HomeKit-enabled smart home devices that are already out in the wild being sold. Apple's New HomePod Looks Fine as Hell It’s game-time! Apple just announced its long-awaited take on a smart speaker, completing the smart …Read more The real standout technology here is in the thought and engineering that went into the speaker part of the equation. Apple engineers supposedly built this thing for high-fidelity audio. On that front, we’ll have to wait and see how the thing sounds when it ships in December. [Read more about the Apple HomePod here.] MacOS gets way faster and smarter Apple showed off a bunch of performance upgrades made to macOS (10.13) and some of the default applications that ship with all Mac computers. One of the most noticeable changes comes in the default web browser, Safari. The browser supposedly now has 80 percent faster JavaScript performance, according to Apple, meaning that even the clunkiest websites will load faster. Apple also built auto-play video blocking directly in the browser to speed up performance. MacOS High Sierra: The New Features Coming to Your Computer Apple announced the brand new update to macOS (version 10.13), its desktop operating system today.…Read more Mac users will also be happy to find an upgraded version of the Photos app in the newest version of macOS. The application has been reorganized to include a persistent sidebar that will likely make it easier to sort through your photos. If that doesn’t work, other tweaks like improved facial recognition and photo tagging will make it easier for people to quickly search through their photos rather than having to scroll through dozens at a time. Finally, Apple is now working with Steam, Unity and Unreal to bring new virtual reality engines to the operating system. [Read more about macOS updates here.] A powerful new iMac enters the arena Who doesn’t love a super powerful computer? Apple claims that the new iMac Pro is packed with enough hardware to make it the most powerful Mac computer to date. It also has a $5,000 base price to match. The most notable feature on this new iMac Pro is an 8-core Xeon processor that ships with the base version that can also be upgraded to a 10- or even 18-core Xeon processor. This is a critical upgrade now that Apple is making a strong push into graphics-heavy applications. iMac Pro Is Apple's New Super-Powered Workhorse In addition to updated iMacs, MacBooks, and MacBook Pros, today at Apple’s WWDC conference, the…Read more The graphics processing will be powered by the Radeon Vega with up to 16 GB of VRAM. In essence, this means that the computer is powerful enough to handle multiple 4K displays or up to 44 million pixels at any given moment if you have the screens to support it. The new iMac Pro can also be equipped with a beefy 128 GB of ECC memory and 4 TB SSD drive to ensure that it rarely slows down. The computer also ships with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a 10GB ethernet connection. Ahhh, sweet, sweet overkill. [Read more about the iMac Pro here.] Beautiful new Macbooks with Kaby Lake processors Apple has gone ahead and updated all of its new laptops and desktops to Intel’s latest generation of Kaby Lake processors. This is a huge improvement for iMacs and MacBooks and should give them a slight edge n last year’s MacBooks that shipped with Intel Skylake processors. Advertisement Advertisement [Read more about the new MacBooks here.] iOS gets a huge makeover Apple made a bunch of design tweaks that will make it easier for people to navigate native apps in iOS. One of the biggest changes is to the Control Center and Notifications Center. Control Center will now feature an improved vertical slider design for things like brightness and volume controls. This means that you won’t have to slide between two screens anymore. Apple is also combining the lock screen and the Notificaions Center in iOS 11, again streamlining the experience and making it easier for people to get relavant information at a glance. Sponsored Other tweaks include the ability to quickly send payments (encrypted end-to-end) through iMessage. You can use TouchID fingerprint to authenticate any payments, and it works just like Apple Pay. [Read more about iOS updates here.] Siri is getting much smarter Siri is getting some much needed love and attention from Apple engineers. The digital assistant is getting a brand new voice (both male and female) to make it sound less like a robotic drone and more human. Users will most likely notice the difference in things like the inflection and delivery of long words or sentences. Here Are All of the New Upgrades to Siri If you’re someone who’s constantly talking to Siri on your phone, you might be shocked by some of…Read more The digital assistant is also getting the ability to instantly translate anything from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, or Spanish. You’ll now be able to say something like “How do I say, ‘Where’s the nearest grocery store?’” and the assistant will automatically translate for you, and say it out loud. Advertisement Finally, Siri will be getting some much-needed contextual awareness. A great example of this is if you were to receive a message from a friend that asks, “How far away are you?” Siri will suggest responding with things like your location or even a calendar location. The point of contextual awareness is to make replying on-the-go much easier. [Read more about Siri updates here.] Michael Nunez m.nunez@gizmodo.com @MichaelFNunez Technology editor at Gizmodo.

Apple puts on a mostly-annual developers conference in California to showcase new software, software updates, and - sometimes - technologies that developers can leverage in order to make their apps more innovative and up to date. Apple calls this conference the Worldwide Developers Conference, and although it's geared toward developers, consumers are invited to watch. There's usually a healthy dose of consumer excitement in the keynote. This year, for instance, Apple introduced a Siri-powered speaker called HomePod, a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch screen, watchOS 4 for Apple Watch, MacOS High Sierra for Macs, iOS 11 for iPhones and iPads, and more. In fact, here's a round-up of all the announcements. Pocket-lint When is WWDC 2017? Apple's WWDC 2017 conference takes places in San Jose, CA - rather than the usual city of San Francisco, CA - from 5 June to 9 June at the McEnery Convention Center. It means, for the first time, it is on the doorstep of Apple's new Cupertino complex. Where can you watch WWDC 2017? Apple held its keynote address at 10am PST (6pm BST). It was available to watch online through the dedicated Apple website or the WWDC app on iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. It's a two-hour event. We will embed the video here when it becomes available. What happened at WWDC 2017? iOS 11 Apple iOS 11 has a raft of new features, Siri gets new voice and more Apple has announced the new version of iOS, expected for release in September. iOS 11 comes with a raft of new features. For instance, iMessages are now stored as part of iCloud, so they sync across all your devices. All your messages are stored in the cloud, but are still end-to-end encrypted for security. There are also new changes to Apple Pay, including the addition of person-to-person payments. It works as an in-app add-on for iMessage so you can easily send payments to friends and families. Siri has a new, more natural voice and can translate from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, etc. The Camera app improves in iOS 11, using HIEF compression for photos. They will look as good as normal JPEGs but at half the file size. Photos also now has a range of new options. You have the ability to edit live images across the different frames, for instance. And finally, Control Center now packs all the features on one page, with sliders for volume and brightness. Then 3D touch will access individual controls, to tweak different aspects with more depth. Apple is yet to reveal the exact release date of iOS 11, but it should appear alongside the new iPhones later this "fall". WatchOS 4 Apple Apple unveils watchOS 4, new Toy Story faces and much more Apple has revealed some of the new features coming to Apple Watch when watchOS 4 is released later this year. The company explained that there will be new watch faces, including a Siri Watch face to see relevant content, including diary notifications, and news stories. The Music app is also improved. It has been redesigned, can automatically sync music and show cover art on the screen, and more. Apple also showed a demo of the new dock. It will show recently used apps, so you can scroll through more easily than before. New fitness features are coming too, with playlists in Music starting when a workout begins. There are many other new features too, which we'll detail further soon. It is thought that watchOS 4 will be released in "the fall" - so a few months away yet. MacOS High Sierra Apple Apple announces major MacOS Sierra update called... High Sierra Instead of announcing an all-new system with an all-new name, Apple announced MacOS High Sierra. It's a major update to Sierra, which Apple announced and rolled out last year. And Apple executive Craig Federighi wasted no time telling developers that High Sierra is "fully baked". The new macOS is about deep technology but also added some refinements, Federighi explained. Safari is now the "world's fastest desktop browser" with High Sierra and is going after Chrome and its upcoming ad-blocking features. Safari now offers AutoPlay blocking and no longer has intelligence tracking prevention. But one of the biggest area of refinement in High Sierra is in Photos. There's now a persistent sidebar and a view that has all of your imports in chronological order. Another big update announced is the new Apple File System. It's 64-bit, from top to bottom. Other new High Sierra features involve video and graphics; for instance, it now supports the H.256 standard for video. Apple also introduced Metal 2 and Metal VR. Remember, VR and AR apps need heavy GPU power, so we're not surprised to hear Apple announce is doubling down. Steam VR SDK, Unity and Unreal engines are coming to the Mac as well. Refreshed iMacs Apple Apple iMac gets serious spec boost for 2017 Apple's iMac lineup has received an almighty boost. They now have improved brightness of 500 nits and use 10-bit dithering.The processor have had a bit of a boost too. The iMacs will now be fitted with Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors. They be specced with more memory than ever before: up to 32GB on the 21.5-inch display models and up to 64GB of memory on the 27-inch models. Apple's Fusion Drive storage system is now standard on all 27-inch iMacs and can be specced on the 21.5-inch models. The solid state storage drives (SSD) also now work up to 50-per cent faster and can be specced up to 2TB. Also, the entry-level 21.5-inch iMac now has Intel Iris Plus graphics, while the 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display uses discreet Radeon Pro 555 and 560 GPU processors. The 27-inch iMac can now be specced up, too. You can get up to 8GB of VRAM, providing 5.5 teraflops of processing power, ideal for VR creation. Connections-wise, these iMacs will be gifted with two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3. They are now available. The 21.5-inch iMac will start at $1,099, while the 21.5-inch with 4K display is $1,299, and the 27-inch with 4K display starts at $1,799. iMac Pro Apple Apple reveals the iMac Pro, its most powerful Mac ever Not content with updating the regular line of iMac all-in-one computers, Apple's also super-charging the iMac for professionals. The iMac Pro takes things to the next level with a huge amount of power. It comes in Space Grey and is based on the 27-inch 5K iMac design. The starting configuration equips you with an 8-core Xeon, but there will be options for 10-core or 18-core versions too. It's not just the CPU that's ramped up, but it will be equipped with the new Radeon Vega GPUs, offering up to 16GB of vRAM. Apple said this is the most powerful Mac that it's ever made. Of course this $4,999 machine isn't pitched at the average consumer, it's for those who want develop in the VR environment for that new VR support. Apple said it will be available from December 2017. HTC Vive Apple HTC Vive coming to Apple Mac, VR-friendly at last HTC has confirmed that its virtual reality headset, the HTC Vive, will soon be compatible with Mac. Apple revealed that it is adding Steam VR support to High Sierra, its new version of MacOS to be released this coming "fall", and that means it will be possible to use a Mac to control virtual reality experiences. It has been a PC exclusive so far. Demos of HTC Vive support were shown during WWDC. iPad Pro 10.5-inch Apple Apple introduces a new iPad Pro with a larger 10.5-inch screen This iPad follows another new iPad from earlier this year. Called iPad, that device is 9.7 inches. It replaced the iPad Air 2 and starts at $329. Apple said it "take everything you love about the 9.7 inch and give you a whole lot more to love". It looks like an iPad Pro, but with a larger 10.5-inch Retina display and reduced bezels. It weighs 1 pound, but it's 20-per cent larger. It allows for a full-size onscreen keyboard, and a full-sized physical keyboard you can attach. It also comes with a feature called ProMotion, which doubles the refresh rate to 120Hz and supports HDR Video. And its True Tone technology is 50-per cent brighter, Apple said. The new iPad Pro is powered by the A10X six-core CPU, too, with a 12-core GPU included. Cameras have also been upgraded . It has a 12-megapixel camera on the back and a front-facing 7-megapixel FaceTime camera. It also has an embedded Touch ID sensor, LTE model option, 64GB of standard memory, an improved four-speaker sound system, and support for the Smart Connector and Apple Pencil. Oh, and the new iPad Pro uses Lightning, not USB-C. It is available for preorder now with a starting price of $649.99. HomePod Apple's HomePod Siri-enabled speaker is real Apple has announced its own music system in the form of the HomePod speaker. It will be released later this year, but the company revealed a sneak peek during its keynote. The HomePod is designed to take on the Amazon Echo in smart functionality, but it also systems like Sonos in audio quality. It has a seven-beam forming tweeter array to fill a room multi-directionally, plus a 4-inch woofer. The speaker is controlled by Apple's A8 processor. This enables many features, such as multi-channel echo cancellation and separation. However, its the smart functionality, combined with Siri voice control ("Hey Siri") and Apple Music, which, using six microphones around the circumference, streams tracks using plenty of contextual phrases. It can also, set reminders and timers and find out news, etc. Apple's HomePod will come in white and black, and as it comes with HomeKit built into the device, it works to control smart appliances around your home even when you just interact with your iPhone from another location. It'll cost $349 and will ship in the US, UK, and Australia from December. App Store Apple Apple App Store completely redesigned with new daily recommendations Apple has announced that it is redesigning the App Store as part of iOS 11, to be released later this year. It has a cleaner, simpler look on phone with separate Music app-style tabs separating content. There is an all-new Today tab, which shows new games and apps recommended for that day only. You can also see other days' content just by scrolling down. There are also new tabs for Games. The App Store will showcase a selection of the latest games, present gameplay videos and tips, and list popular games and in-app purchases. Apps also gets its own tab and is like Games. Every app and every game gets a new product page on the store with all new features and a friendly design. Apple also announced at WWDC 2017 that Monument Valley 2 is now available on the App Store. Amazon Video Apple Amazon and Apple finally playing nicely, Amazon Video coming to Apple TV After several rumours suggesting it was happening, Apple has confirmed that itself and Amazon have finally settled some differences, as Amazon's Video app will make its way to Apple TV later this year. Amazon Video is the last major video app missing from Apple TV, not including All 4 and ITV Hub, and its addition would make the Apple TV a more attractive option as a set-top box. Want to know more?

How do you think that they can make sub $50 phones? Stabby McKnifington I have 2 Droid X units that my kids play on. jak_341 Well, they’re not wrong. Shane Lee 9.5% is still pathetic over 6 months after release. Apple are right to mock us for sure. Yes I understand it’s easier for apple to do the updates but this has been an issue for years and there’s still nothing close to a solution. Android users are basically forced to buy a phone every year if they want up to date(ish) software. wade_county I’m not trying to make an excuse for Google but it is 9.5% of 2 billion android devices (190M on 7.X) But yeah, I stopped caring about the next version of Android because I upgrade every year and it’ll have the new version anyway. thereasoner Most fragmentation is caused by cheap phones for 3rd world markets like that new dirt cheap phone from Samsung running Android 5 I believe. Apple doesn’t compete there and where Android and Apple phones do compare in the flagship segment the adoption number of new OS versions are much closer really even if you include non Pixel phones.

Unless of course you prefer the hardware innovation and new features first of a Samsung flagship but it will cost you timely updates. I don’t pay any attention to the update adoption stuff, either way be it fast updates or bleeding edge tech/features Android users are well served. AnonymousPerson1 That’s what people have been saying for years but for Nexus devices. The problem is that Google will still drop major OS support after 2 years and security after 3. Look at the Nexus 5 and iPhone 5S. Both came out in 2013. Only one is still getting updates, so…. thereasoner Yes but the Nexus 5 did see 3 major OS versions in it’s life and stayed up to date for roughly 3 years. The Pixels will also only see 3 major OS versions as well and 3 years up to date in total as far as the OS is concerned but the difference is that Google does security patches now and they have promised those will continue for the Pixel into year 4 of the devices life and that’s not bad imo. I know that iPhones update longer but older iPhones often suffer performance issues trying to run the latest OS version. I know people who won’t update older iPhones because of this. Between that and missing features from those updates on older iPhones I don’t feel like I’m missing much, not that I’d ever keep a phone for 4 years. Boomdizzle Yeah, they can update to the newer OS but most of those old iPhone’s and iPad’s are lag monsters after an update. My wife’s iPad mini is practically unusable now and it’s an OS behind what it can get. Sergio You obviously fail to see what Android is; a huge and diverse ecosystem of devices. Do you really want to give up all the various devices just so you can have better absorption of OS updates? So no, Apple isn’t right to mock OS update absorption.

Right. Apple has only 2 phones to choose from, big and small… I guess they have the cheap version too. Android has multiple flagships available at any given time. So if you want basically one type of phone, you get updates that propagate to most phones in the wild. If you want more hardware choices available, then you get a fragmented software eco system with updates dependent on manufacturers and carriers. I’m OK with the latter. Droid 1967 except apples numbers are a lie. every os is not complete on the prior phones. meaning yeah they changed the number but the os is not the same. they had an ios out there at one point that on 1 device was 64 bit and on another device was 32 bit. they are not the same os, they do not have the same features as each new iphone gets features of ios that the previous phone does not get but they both get the same os number. Its just a game, the fragmentation is only less due to the low amount of phones they have. each 2 years they have 4 phones. android has 100 phones in same time period with all different specs low to high. MKader17 X2. My iPad 2 was “updated” through multiple versions, but never got the newest features and ended up being slower with each upgrade to the point of being unusable. Ichigo Uzumaki That’s exactly what I say. How many Pixel or Nexus phones are out there that are not on the latest version other than the phones which happen to be older than 2 years old. Apple supports phones going back to 3 to 4 years but at what price for the user. Phones that old run sluggish and of course don’t have all the latest features from the current version….But at the end of the day OEMs should be more responsible in updating their phones to the latest Android version in a quicker manner. 6 to 8 months is too long of a wait for OEMs to update their devices to the latest version of Android. Maybe back then when Google was just releasing the new version of Android without any beta version of the Android months ahead or the final version, maybe it would’ve been acceptable. For the past 2 or 4 years now Google has been releasing pre-release version of Android and the OEMs are still not updating their phones in a timely manner. Google makes the release public on October and there isn’t any excuse why OEMs shouldn’t be able to update their devices by early January. tnt Side note @Kellen – quite awhile back you said we’d see some changes with the trash ads from Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent, etc. If I remember right you said something like “in a few weeks”. Not necessarily holding you to that time frame, but the trash is still there and trashy as ever. Święty Now that the Pixel exists, Apple really only has the right to make a head to head Iphone to Pixel comparison, until they start offering more than 2 phone choices a year. Shane Lee Pixel users are a tiny fraction of the android user base. If there was any sort of direct comparison it would be with Samsung and they can’t even keep their phones up to date. Święty If referring to phone sales – agreed. But Apple hardware and software controlled phones can now be compared to Google hardware and software controlled phones. I think Iphones are terrific. I just think it’s lame that Apple with all its deserved success has to stoop to pin the “horrible defragmentation” label to what actually is market user choice. Google: Be together, not the same. Apple: Be the same, Comply. CabbageHeadCat. True. thereasoner Well put. thereasoner Actually to be fair comparisons should be made by cost or there flagship designation in which case the adoption numbers are much closer. For Pixel phones they’re very similar obviously. Me Even android “flagships” don’t get timely updates. *cough* S7 *cough* thereasoner With the exception of the Pixels and Nexus nothing gets new OS adoption rates like the iPhone’s but other flagships still get them unlike the cheap hardware that makes up for the bulk of fragmentation, hardware that should never be compared to Google or Apple flagships. Boomdizzle WTH is ‘Nouget’, don’t you mean Android 7?! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72a760a1236936eb661ad4d12e7b2f8efd9bf1e2896da79ae73b3b900a92ea79.jpg JLV90 Yet Nougat 7.1 is still less than 1%. I assume most of that bump to 7.0 is from S8 S8+ S7 and S7 Edge cristianer I’m still waiting Nougat for my S6. Maybe in another 2 or 3 months… twiz0r Crappy carrier? cdm283813 This is pathetic. Android O will make this even more horrific. Kellex B But it’s supposed to fix all the problems with Treble! 🙁 JLV90 Is that like the ever improving battery life promises with Android? RazorSky Battery life is ever improving, but battery size is shrinking to make a thinner phone.. That is the real problem. Give me a brick like the old days with a modern chipset. AKA Make a Pixel as thick as the old Moto Bionic full of battery! Shane Lee It won’t fix it. Manufacturers like Samsung are selling phones based on design and features, not the software version. They really don’t have any motivation to rush out updates. cdm283813 I won’t believe it until it happens. Nothing but empty promises. When Google forces OEM’s to upgrade or else then I’ll start believing. If it’s optional it will be treated as optional. Tojen1981 Then google also needs to strong-arm Qualcomm as well since they decide whether or not to keep updating the drivers to support future builds. CabbageHeadCat. Lol, how many times have we heard that. The story is that it doesn’t really matter. The previous two builds are still better than the new iOS.

Most recently refreshing them last year to include Lightning ports alongside a new Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse. Apple’s packed keynote kicking off WWDC 2017 understandably didn’t have time to touch on a welcomed addition to their peripheral lineup. Now the Magic Keyboard comes in a numeric keypad version. Previously if you wanted an Apple keyboard with the number pad, you needed to stick with the wired version. Otherwise, there are not many differences. It still powers up a rechargeable battery over lightning, and can last about a month between charges. It can be purchased from Apple’s website now for $129. Tagged: Accessories Apple Wireless Keyboard Keyboard Magic Keyboard MORE FROM iDB Twelve South’s new accessory connects your Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2 Confirmed: Apple held talks with Sonder on using e-ink for a dynamic Magic Keyboard Next-gen Magic Keyboard reportedly in the works with e-ink display on every single key So Young A month of current charge? The current magic keyboard can last up to 3 months between the charges. :D The numeric keys alone use up 2 thirds of the power JohnS Is there any word yet as to whether this keyboard has a backlight or not? That would explain the shorter battery life, and that iMac Pro image with the new keyboard made it look like it could be but it’s so hard to tell. If this has a backlight I’d probably get it… If not, I’m not interested. :D It’s already on the apple store and it’s not mentioned so no it doesn’t have a backlight Alex Wilson Very interested, just for the additional F-Keys! With 2 screens and using Spaces this is a big deal for my needs. But $129… ouch.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts HomePod tech specs Anthony Bouchard on June 5, 2017 7 Apple’s HomePod was by far one of the most exciting announcements at WWDC 2017. A totally new kind of technology for Apple’s realm of expertise, HomePod is a speaker system that also acts as a Siri virtual assistant and HomeKit controller, among other things. In this piece, we’ll go over the HomePod’s tech specs so that you have an idea of what kind of technology is packed into the new accessory. Size and weight Dimensions: 6.8 inches high (172 mm) 5.6 inches wide (142 mm) Weight: 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) Available in two colors Audio Technology High-excursion woofer with custom amplifier Array of seven horn-loaded tweeters, each with its own custom amplifier Six-microphone array for far-field Siri and room sensing Internal low-frequency calibration microphone for automatic bass correction Direct and ambient audio beamforming Transparent studio-level dynamic processing Wireless   802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi with MIMO Multiroom speaker support with AirPlay 2 Languages English (Australia, UK, U.S.) These are the official tech specs for the HomePod. It’s worth noting that the device is not Bluetooth enabled, and connects to your devices and HomeKit accessories via Wi-Fi only. Additionally, there’s no battery, so it must be plugged into a power source at all times to remain functional, which might be a downer for some. HomePod isn’t available for purchase yet as of this writing, but it will be available in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States for $349 starting in December 2017. HomePod will join the rest of the world in the beginning of 2018. Will you be getting your hands on a HomePod or two for your household? Share in the comments section below!   Tagged: Apple Apple News Hardware HomePod News Speaker Technology Wi-Fi Wireless WWDC WWDC 2017 MORE FROM iDB Meet HomePod, the new Apple speaker New 2017 iPad Pro tech specs The 13 features in iOS 11 borrowed from the jailbreak community JohnS I still think this is such a missed opportunity. There’s a lot of great hardware in there but it’s limited to sticking in some corner and playing wireless music. Sorry but there are a lot of cheaper options. Why not let us hook this up and do conference calling or record and playback music? There’s a lot of “pro” users that could benefit from something that wasn’t so restricted. But for “non pro” users why can’t it include a 5 hour battery so we can unplug it and take it with us or something? Want to have some music at a picnic why not let us stream off of our iPhone’s data plan? If Apple wanted to get into the game so late they should have made something truly versatile and useful. This is… not what I would have hoped for. Jamessmooth The most surprising thing about this was that I was into it. I was almost certain there was no “Siri speaker” they could show me to get my attention. I was wrong. The two biggest downers: has to be plugged in all the time and won’t be available until December. Late availability is a missed opportunity, because I’m going to keep my Alexa Show preorder. If this was available sooner, I might have cancelled it. :D I just don’t understand the hype around home assistants. If you have an iPhone or Apple Watch you could just use hey siri on that. If you want the speaker alone then there are much cheaper speakers available. Waste of money imo. Robert Stukenbroeker Of course there are cheaper speakers available, but you get what you pay for. Audio reviews of the HomePod are very positive. Even beating out a similarly priced Sonos speaker. :D If you’re buying for the audio quality then fine but most people seem to buy home assistants just for the voice assistant functionality Peter Kussell When Apple enters a market it ALWAYS enters at the high end, and will redefine or reinvent a category. So offering a device with cutting edge audio, a smart integration with home WiFi and its Apple Music service shows how it leverages its software, hardware and service platforms. No one else has this kind of integration, which will feed and build off of each other. Also I have a Sonos 3, which at $300 is good but needs its own network, doesn’t integrate with anything, not least of all a home WiFi network. The other products will be catering to people who never cared for quality in the first place. They all have Androids. Wesh Might wait for HomePod 2 with bluetooth and battery. Unless they sound truly spectacular.

Apple continues to emphasize privacy. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 5:52 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Kevork Djansezian | Getty Apple just revealed what it's been up to in software for the past year ... and it's remarkably Google-y. During the Monday keynote at the company's 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference, the company announced a bunch of catch-ups: Siri got the ability to translate languages, something Google has provided through Google Translate since 2006. For now, Siri can only translate spoken English into five other languages, while Google's service can work with more than 100 languages, but it's a start. A Do Not Disturb While Driving mode, which delivers a different user interface when iPhone users are driving. Google delivered an Android Auto feature for smartphones last year. Improvements to the AirPlay feature for sharing audio from iOS devices, which one-ups Google's invasion of home audio speakers through the Chromecast Audio dongle. Apple will let people play audio in multiple rooms while Google works on introducing that feature to all speakers that have Chromecast built in. Improvements to the Camera app that comes with iOS so it's able to make loops with the Live Photos video snippets that are automatically created out of each photo. Google introduced this feature in an app called Motion Stills last year. Siri will soon be front and center on the Apple Watch, just like the Google Assistant has started showing up on Android Wear smartwatches. A HomePod speaker that plays music and lets you talk to Siri. The Google Home does similar things but comes with the Google Assistant instead of Siri. More broadly, Apple has built tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality, and now the company is starting to let outside developers use those tools to enhance their own applications. The thing is, Google already did the same thing, with the Tango mobile augmented reality system and services running in its cloud. To be clear, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Snap have all been busy in both AI and AR. But Google has put AI at the core of its business, with CEO Sundar Pichai going so far as to call it an "AI-first" company. With Apple doing small things to make AI more visible and powerful across more of its devices, the company appears to be acknowledging people's continued use of impressively smart apps like Google Translate and the Google App. The message is clear: We're getting smarter now, so don't even worry about using the Google stuff. The uncertainties lie in how many Google developers and customers will defect.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts MacBook Air now comes with a faster Intel chip, but that’s about it Christian Zibreg on June 5, 2017 6 It is now definitely clear that MacBook Air is, sadly, on its way out. First and foremost, Apple hasn’t really updated its design following the 2010 debut. And while Apple continues to update MacBook Air with faster Intel chips and graphics, the latest hardware refresh to the popular notebook leaves a a lot to be desired. The notebook now ships with a faster 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor from Intel—a step up from the previous 1.3 GHz one—but that’s about it in terms of hardware upgrades. It didn’t even get Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, introduced in March. The tech giant briefly mentioned the update during the keynote and made only a passing one-sentence mention in the press released announcing other Mac updates. “Apple today also updated the 13-inch MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz processor,” reads the release. Here’s the updated MacBook Air lineup. $999 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 $1,199 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 Apple hasn’t given the notebook faster SSD storage, nor has it updated built-in graphics, like with today’s updates to other Mac notebooks. It still ships with the pixelated non-Retina display and does not include support for the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 standard. The 11-inch MacBook Air models were discontinued last October. I love all Mac notebooks, but that MacBook Air has a special place in my heart and I’m saddened that Apple has decided to phase it out, slowly but surely. Until that slim 12-inch MacBook Air gets a decent CPU, I’ll be sticking with my Air. How about you? Tagged: Apple Mac MacBook Air News WWDC WWDC 2017 MORE FROM iDB Bloomberg: upgraded MacBook lineup coming at WWDC next month More macOS High Sierra features that slipped under the radar Video: Top 6 WWDC 2017 announcements Dylan Ch’ng non-IPS? So it’s TN? kohyuta Sadly, yes. burge The MacBook is a poor machine compared with the Air ok it’s got a Retina screen but that’s all it has over the Air I’ll be sticking with my Air for at least another year then. And the Pro is over priced for what it brings. Vince Reedy Makes sense to just go with the non touch bar 13″ pro at this point which I don’t think is a bad deal at all. Especially after the price drop and spec bump. Can’t see why anyone would want the 12″ or the air now. cdlenfert Does the 12 inch not have a “decent CPU” now? I’m curious, not being sassy. kohyuta The $1299 MacBook uses an Intel Core m3 CPU which emphasizes power efficiency over performance. Good enough for email and web browsing. It benchmarks slower than the i5 & i7 CPUs in the MacBook Pros, and is roughly equivalent to the i3. You can spend more money for an i5 ($100) or i7 ($250). For my $1299, I’d rather get a MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz i5 than a MacBook with a 1.2GHz m3.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said.

Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple's New HomePod Looks Fine As Hell Adam Clark Estes Jun 6, 2017, 6:45am ⋅ Filed to:  apple feature homepod wwdc wwdc 2017 Share It's game-time! Apple just announced its long-awaited take on a smart speaker, completing the smart speaker triumvirate along with Google and Amazon. The gadget itself isn't particularly remarkable, but it is an Apple gadget. That's a big deal for a lot of people. Photo: Apple The new Apple HomePod is a lot like its competitors: Amazon Echo and Google Home. You can activate it with a wake word — "Hey Siri" — and ask an artificially intelligent assistant, Siri, to play music. The HomePod comes with an array of six microphones so that it can pick up your voice from any direction. Apple promises the Siri team has made some updates so that the AI works better for music requests. Apple has also make HomePod a "home assistant" that can answer all kinds of questions and tell you about the weather or the traffic. HomePod also works like a smart home hub for all HomeKit-compatible devices. So now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights or lock the door without moving a muscle. You can also control your HomeKit devices remotely now, using the Home app on any iOS device. Yes, you can do the same thing with an Amazon Echo or a Google Home, but remember: This is an Apple gadget. GIF: Apple / Gizmodo Where Apple hopes to stand out in its late entry to the smart speaker market, however, is by putting extra emphasis on the speaker part of the equation. While the Echo and Home aren't known for great sound quality, Apple engineers — presumably with some help from Beats engineers — built the HomePod for high-fidelity audio quality. That includes a "seven beam-forming tweeter array", "precision acoustic horns" and "directional control". Apple says that you don't need to know what that means but the seven-inch-tall speaker sounds really great. There's also a "virtual surround sound" feature that helps the small speaker fill up a room with your sick jams. In other words, Sonos is now an Apple competitor. Photo: Alex Cranz That's all fun and games until you start to wonder if Siri is now spying on you and your loved ones. Apple says that "only after 'Hey Siri' is recognised locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier". It's unclear what happens to the data once its on Apple's servers. The new speaker will cost $US349, with Australian pricing to be confirmed — we expect around the $499 to $549 range. It will come in white and space grey and will start shipping in December in Australia, the UK and US. And even though it isn't as feature packed as the latest Echo, you're probably going to want it, if you're an Apple fan. Even if you're not, it's a fine-looking gadget.

Reply -1 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:59am Much higher audio quality, and fits into an ecosystem that millions of people are already using. I think they will be okay, and not a lot of luck will be required. I think people constantly miss that this is what Apple does. They start developing a product when a new product category is looming, they let others enter the market space and kludge around, and then after a year or two they enter the market with a (usually) more refined product. They did it with the iPod, it wasn't the first or the cheapest MP3 player by a long shot, but it did okay for them. This is still a nascent market, and this is really the first product to integrate personal assistant stuff with a good quality speaker system. A single SONOS speaker costs this much or more, if it sounds as good or better, then it will probably do more than okay. Reply 1 soldant @soldant Jun 6, 2017, 10:58am This. Apple aren't new or innovative, and they haven't been for decades now. Instead they take existing concepts and refine them into a product the general population likes to use. Very few tech companies do much that's innovative or novel these days - they're iterating on existing ideas most of the time (or bringing ideas back from the dead). I think Apple's HomePod has the potential to be as successful as Alexa or Google Home. Whether or not it will ultimately depends on if people actually want these devices. Reply 0 gtasoz @gtasoz Jun 6, 2017, 4:33pm That was my reaction too. Unless they make the thing SING with connectivity and be truly useful in the Internet-of-Things world :: Home Control, Spatial smarts and other clever things, I can see this status symbol tanking big time. May be wrong but they will have to get it VERY right or people will be severely pissed. Reply 0 zak @zak Jun 6, 2017, 2:26pm Apple engineers — presumably with some help from Beats engineers — built the HomePod for high-fidelity audio qualityDoes that mean it will include extra bits of metal just to make it heavier?

By Barbara Ortutay Associated Press, By Michael Liedtke Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called  machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera -- the same one found in the iPhone 7 -- along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. --The Associated Press Published on: Jun 5, 2017 Advertisement

After all, the company can’t include anything obvious in its early iOS 11 builds that might pull back the curtain prematurely on iPhone 8 details. But we can’t even think about the iPhone 8 right now because Apple just unleashed a truckload of hot new iOS 11 features. Whether or not you were following along live as Apple unveiled iOS 11 during its big WWDC 2017 keynote, you’re obviously going to want a recap of all the biggest new iOS 11 features coming to the iPhone and iPad. In this post, you’ll find everything you need to know about the most exciting new features coming in iOS 11. Don't Miss: Last chance: Amazon’s secret sale on the Echo and Echo Dot ends today Messages iOS 11 gets a redesigned app drawer that make iMessage apps and stickers much more accessible. Messages in iCloud is another new feature that will synchronize all of you conversation history across any new device you sing into. This also means that less needs to be stored on the device, freeing up precious storage. Apple Pay Apple Pay will support person-to-person payments in iOS, and it’ll be integrated into Messages as an iMessage app. Users will be able to send and receive money just like they can with Paypal or Venmo. Siri Apple used deep learning to give Siri a much more natural sounding voice, and there’s a new male voice option. More importantly, Siri gets a new visual interface that makes results much more easy to digest. Siri can also translate into different languages now, just like other virtual personal assistants. SiriKit gets a ton of new features in iOS 11, offering all kinds of new APIs for third-party app integration. Siri’s contextual capabilities have been expanded as well, and a user’s (encrypted) data is now synchronized across devices. Camera HEVC video encoding for videos is now used in the Camera app, and JPEG capture has been updated with new tech that allows photos to take up half as much space on your iPhone or iPad. On the iPhone 7 Plus, users also get new features like HDR, enhanced Portrait Mode quality and more. Control Center iOS 11’s Control Center has been completely redesigned. All of the features have been squeezed onto a single page, and 3D Touch will expand each different card, giving access to more options. Lock Screen Lock Screen and Notification Center have been combined, which is a nice consolidation that further simplifies the UI a bit. Maps Apple’s Maps app in iOS 11 gets huge enhancements for indoor mapping beginning with malls and airports, allowing users to quickly and easily navigate shopping centers and airports when traveling. Speed limits and lane guidance have been added to Maps navigation. Do Not Disturb While Driving mode will automatically black out the user’s display while driving, and notifications will not be displayed while driving. Auto-responses will be sent to anyone who texts, and certain users can be made allowed to break through (white list). HomeKit Speaker support has been added to HomeKit, and AirPlay 2 supports multi-room configuration and playback. More than a dozen wireless speaker manufacturers will support the new protocol, as will any speakers controlled by an Apple TV. Read More Apple Music Apple now has 27 million Apple Music subscribers, and they’ll all now have access to music history for friends who have configured their playback to be public. A new MusicKit for developers offers Apple Music APIs that can be used to integrate with third-party apps. App Store Apple announced that there are now 500 million weekly visitors to the App Store who have downloaded more than 180 billion apps to date. As for new features in iOS 11, developers will appreciate that Apple will review newly submitted apps much faster than before.Phased releases will also be supported, so that updates can be released in phases. For consumers, the App Store has been completely redesigned. A new Today tab will help users discover new apps, and a new Games tab gives games a dedicated tab. In-app purchases can be features on their own now as well. A new Apps tab features all apps that aren’t games, and an Updates tab shows installed apps that have available updates or have been updated recently. Finally, a Search tab offers a new dedicated search interface. Augmented Reality iOS 11 offers enhanced augmented reality features courtesy of ARKit, a toolkit for developers. It allows apps to use computer vision for object recognition, and virtual objects can be placed on the display that are actually context-aware. Thanks to Apple’s massive ecosystem of iOS devices, ARKit will be the largest augmented reality platform in the world when iOS 11 is released. UPDATE: Apple also announced new iPad-only features in iOS 11: The apps dock on the bottom of the iPad home screen will be available if you slide up on any screen, and it can hold many more apps. A new app switcher view can be accessed by dragging the dock up and then continuing to drag upward. Split view is enhanced with new app pairings that allow users to open multiple apps at once. Drag and drop support allows users to drag and drop content between apps, and also drag UI elements inside apps to enable all sorts of different functionality. A new Files app provides an oft-requested file manager on the iPad. — Apple will release iOS 11 beta 1 for developers (and anyone else who has the beta configuration profile installed on their iOS devices) sometime this afternoon. As has been the case in years past, the first public beta will be releases sometime later this month once all of the major bugs are addressed. Then the final version of iOS 11 will be released this coming September ahead of Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s launch.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → In the Year of iPad, Mac Not Forgotten  June 5, 2017June 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink This WWDC has two big winners: iPad software and Mac hardware. Yes, there’s that new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and yes, we’ll be running macOS High Sierra come this fall, but I think these two categories are the biggest stories to come out of the keynote. iOS 11 is finally giving iPad users the tools they need to get work done more efficiently and with more power. It all looks amazing, and I cannot wait to try it out. But I really want to talk about Mac hardware. Right off the bat, the entire notebook line got a bump. The MacBooks and MacBook Pros are now shipping with Kaby Lake Intel processors, but the latter is still capped at 16 GB of RAM. Everything got updated GPUs, and the entry-model MacBook Pro without Touch Bar now runs $1299. These moves signal that Apple is committed to the pro notebook, as the updates come just months after releasing these computers. I hope Apple keeps its foot on the gas here, and works to keep things updated more aggressively from here on out. The MacBook Air also got an update to the “newer processors,” but Apple didn’t even give the dead-man-walking notebook a “New” badge on its website. That’s just cold. Even colder? The Mac mini was not mentioned or upgraded. It is, however, still for sale. The iMac line got refreshed as well. Fusion Drives are now standard on all 27-inch configurations and the top-end 21.5-inch iMac. The updated, brighter displays are powered by new GPUs. All the systems — thanks with Kaby Lake processors — are noticeably faster than the ones they replace. Around back, the four USB A ports remain. The full IO list is now: Headphone SDXC card slot Four USB 3 (Type A) Two Thunderbolt 3 Gigabit Ethernet Then there’s the big story. The iMac Pro. Apple mentioned it was working on “pro configs” of the iMac, and when this think ships at the end of the year, I’d say they would have delivered. Donned in Space Gray, this iMac is just as thin as its Retina 5K sibling, but is all-new inside: 8, 10, or 18-Core Up to 128 GB EEC RAM Up to 4 TB SSD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU Four USB 3 (Type A) ports Four Thunderbolt 3 ports 10Gb Ethernet Even its periphals are in Space Gray. It looks dope: A post shared by Ren Caldwell (@settern) on Jun 5, 2017 at 1:20pm PDT All of this is made possible by an all-new cooling system that has added those intake slots along the bottom part of the back case. I hope Apple’s learned their Mac Pro-shaped lesson about that sort of thing and that this thermal arrangement will allow for component updates down the road. (I did notice the lack of a RAM door in Serenity’s photo. I’m hoping that it is there on the finished product, but I think I’m going to be sad.) Update: Apple says the RAM is not user-replaceable. Starting at $4,999 when it goes on sale later this year, the iMac Pro is pushing the sometime-after-2017 Mac Pro to the fringe. We don’t know anything about that machine yet, but assuming it has expansion slots, that, multiple processor support and a freedom of display choice may be its biggest selling points.1 The iMac Pro’s price point also says something about the upcoming Mac Pro. Ouch. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Sponsor: Working Copy Your sourcecode, websites, and images on your tablet and phone, even when offline.

You can now send and receive money via Apple Pay on iMessage, Apple has announced. This is coming as part of iOS 11. Aside from being able to send and receive money on the chat app, you will also be able to spend the balance via a virtual Apple Pay card, TechCrunch reports. Apple will integrate the new feature into iMessage as an app, which will basically allow you to request payment with your contact with a single tap. Most importantly, the new feature will show up a notification when someone says “you owe me $10” and will automatically prompt you to pay your debt. Integrating Apple Pay into iMessage will come as a big competition for Venmo; a company that has been offering similar service to users of the chat app for a while now. However, Apple seems to have the upper hand considering the fact that it owns iMessage as well as Apple Pay. What this means is that, every iOS user will now be issued with a virtual card, which of course, will hold the balance of whatever is left from any payment made. Balance left, according to Apple, can be used to make payment anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. You can also cash out any balance on your virtual card to your bank account. Apple Pay continues to expand to new territories since launch, and integrating it into iMessage is one of the shrewdest decisions taken by Apple. The payment service already launched in Japan, New Zealand, Russia and China. “We are incredibly excited to bring iPhone 7 to customers in Japan so they can experience the magic of Apple Pay. Apple Pay will transform your daily routine, from making your commute easier and more convenient than ever with Suica right on your iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, to using your favorite cards to make secure and private purchases with a single touch,” Apple said while announcing that the payment service was coming to those countries. PayPal, one of the biggest payment platforms in the world, was integrated into Facebook Messenger in 2016. The partnership with Facebook could yet be PayPal’s biggest opportunity to reach billions of people. The new feature allows select users in the U.S [more users and countries could soon follow] to easily link their PayPal and Messenger accounts. Users will also be able to receive payment alerts directly within the Messenger app. When you shop online, you can easily make your payment with PayPal in addition to other available options, and also receive notification. Today at its 2017 WWDC event, Apple unveiled the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which effectively replaces the 9.7-inch. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is faster, and larger than previous one, and still light. As a matter of fact, the new iPad weighs just one pound, and comes with a refresh rate of 120hz. Got something to add to this story? You can do that by using the comment section below.

TrendsViral Australia’s consumer watchdog launched the sting that began after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a software update that rendered their devices useless if a previous repair had been carried out by an ‘unofficial’ technician. ‘Error 53’ is a message that would appear if some iPhones and iPads with TouchID fingerprint sensors had been updated to iOS 9.0 between September 2014 and February 2016. If the update detected that the fingerprint sensor had been tampered with by a non-Apple technician, the device was disabled or ‘bricked’. READ MORE: Apple taken to court by Australia over alleged iPhone ‘bricking’ In February 2016, Apple issued an update that put the devices back into working order, although without the fingerprint technology. That wasn’t enough to appease Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) who started to build a case against Apple, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian Australia. In June last year, employees from ACCC posed as Apple customers and called all 13 Apple retailers across the country complaining that their iPhone speakers stopped working after their screens were replaced by a third party, according to the documents. In all 13 instances, an Apple employee told the ACCC worker that, under Australian Consumer Law, they were not required to fix the speaker if a repair had been carried out by a non-authorized third party service provider. ‘We follow the law’: Apple reportedly paid 0 tax in New Zealand over past decade https://t.co/FnMdfT8pxkpic.twitter.com/iATLOIjwqt— RT (@RT_com) March 23, 2017 The ACCC argues that Australian Consumer Law stipulates that any customer is entitled to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of an unacceptable quality. Court documents from the case, which is going to trial in mid-December, accuse Apple of misleading customers by telling them they were not entitled to assistance if they had previously sought the services of a non-Apple entity – even if the repair was not related to the fault at hand. Apple has yet to publicly respond to the case but did deny the allegations in court documents, according to the Guardian Australia.

The new Pro has a 10.5in display, designed to fit the space between the traditionally sized 9.7in and the large 13in versions. It also features technology called ProMotion, which increases the refresh rate of the screen, meaning everything appears smoother. This includes interactions with the Apple Pencil, which Apple says will feel more "fluid" than ever, as well as reducing battery consumption. A new processor chip - the A10X Fusion - makes the new iPad Pro up to 30 per cent faster, Apple says. The camera has been updated, and now features the same front and rear-facing versions as the iPhone 7 - 12 megapixel in the rear and a seven megapixel front-facing camera. As part of the iOS 11 software update due in the autumn, the iPad will soon feature a customisable dock which will enable users to add more apps to the space at the bottom of the screen.  Read more Meet London's brightest iOS developers heading to Apple's WWDC 2017 North Korea launches rival to iPad... with a very familiar name Apple finally reveals how to take a perfect photo on your iPhone Drag and drop is also being introduced to the tablet for the first time as part of enhanced multitasking tools, meaning users will be able to drag content between apps more easily.

(Gary Rey= es/ Bay Area News Group)=20 By Sal Pizarro | spizarro@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 5, 2017 at 2:32 pm | UPDATED: June 6, 2017 at 4:20 am If you stop by the Hotel De Anza’s Hedley Club Lounge this week, you’ll notice a new drink being served: The Apple Sidecar. At other downtown bars like the Loft and Deluxe, you can get specials on apple martinis. And one of downtown’s biggest night spots, San Pedro Square Market, expects to be busy all week. Apple CEO Tim Cook opened the company’s World Wide Developers Conference on Monday morning by saying it was great to be back in San Jose. And the Bay Area’s biggest city is certainly returning the compliment. “We absolutely love having them here in San Jose,” San Pedro Square Market Manager Joe Horrigan. The market has two trivia nights, plus three bands lined up this week to entertain conferencegoers. One of them, Emergency Third Rail Power Trip, is made up of mostly current and former Apple employees. An Apple Sidecar is being served at the Hotel De Anza’s Hedley Club lounge<br />in honor of Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference, which is being held<br />in San Jose June 5-9, 2017. (Courtesy Hotel De Anza)  It’s just one way that downtown San Jose is all about WWDC this week. The facade of the McEnery Convention Center has been re-skinned with WWDC’s logo — and it’s such an improvement, the city should find a way to keep it. Developers also will be spilling out into other downtown San Jose venues throughout the week. Though nearly, all the events are limited to registered conference participants, it could still make for some good people watching. Monday night, The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple is hosting the Beard Bash — if you’ve ever seen his whiskers, you understand the name — featuring the tribute band Department of Rock and lots of Heineken flowing at the City National Civic. Developers will be partying at the McEnery Convention Center plaza Tuesday at 6 p.m. with local craft beers and live music, and Wednesday’s they’ll be taking in the IMAX movie, “A Beautiful Planet,” at the Tech Museum’s Hackworth IMAX Dome Theater. Others might skip the Wednesday movie to take in James Dempsey and the Breakpoints’ benefit concert that same day at the City National Civic to support App Camp For Girls, organized by WWDCGirls. Buddybuild is hosting the WWDC edition of its “buddybeers” event at craft cocktail lounge Paper Plane on Tuesday night (where it also happens to be Negroni Week), and former Apple Genius Bar employee and stand-up comic James Veitch has a geek-bent set Tuesday at the San Jose Improv. The party portion of the conference itself concludes Thursday night with a huge outdoor bash at Discovery Meadow, the park next to the purple Children’s Discovery Museum. Downtown bars and restaurants also are welcoming WWDC attendees and Apple fans with open arms. Popular bars and venues including Forager, the Ritz and Haberdasher have been snapped up by developer events on various days this week, but there’s still a lot for the non-developer crowd to enjoy. San Pedro Square Market has two acts playing Monday night — guitarist Jerry Sauceda at 6 p.m. and zydeco favorite Andre Thierry at 7 p.m. — and has opened its new Garage Bar just in time for WWDC, after a successful test run during last Thursday’s SPUR Member Party. Emergency Third Rail Power Trip plays wednesday at 6 p.m. And if you just want to toast the conference, the Apple Side Car is on the Hedley Club lounge menu at the Hotel De Anza this week (It’s got Calvados apple brandy and is served with a small plate of sliced apples). Deluxe, Chacho’s and Loft Bar and Bistro all planned to have specials on appletinis, too.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What’s New in macOS 10.13 High Sierra, Arriving Fall 2017 By Justin Pot on June 5th, 2017 The next version of macOS is coming this fall, with improvements to Safari, Mail, Photos, and a lot under the hood. Here are the best features you’ll see in macOS 10.13 “High Sierra”. No, that’s not a typo—they’re calling it High Sierra, after the highest region of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. And yes: Apple made a few weed jokes after announcing the name, because the most powerful corporation on Earth is nothing if not counter-cultural. The High Sierra developer beta is available today; the public beta will be available later this month. The final release will come later this fall, but here’s what you can expect according to Apple’s presentation. Safari Will Block Auto-Play Videos and Ads That Track You RELATED ARTICLE Mac Users Should Ditch Google Chrome for Safari Apple took the time to brag about the speed increases in the new version of Safari, which is the browser macOS users should be using anyway. Time will tell how accurate Apple’s bragging here is, but it’s exciting. There are also a few very interesting features. Safari will now automatically stop auto-playing videos from interrupting you, a move we’re certain Facebook is already angry about. They also announced that Safari will block ads from tracking users out-of-the box, which we’re certain Amazon is already angry about (particularly because Apple announced Amazon Prime video on Apple TV just ten minutes before this). Regardless of which companies might be upset, these moves seem like they’ll make browsing better for everyone, and we’re excited to try them out. Spotlight-Powered Search Comes to Mail If you use Safari, you know that Spotlight-powered search results often pop up while you’re trying a URL. Sometimes these will be recommendations from Apple Maps, but mostly they’re just websites you tend to visit often. The macOS Mail app will have this same feature, with Spotlight-powered suggestions at the top of your search results recommending particular emails. It’s a small tweak, but it could make finding particular emails just a little bit faster. Apple also announced support for split-screen mode while composing a message. Hey: not every new feature can be amazing. Photos Now Supports External Editors Perhaps the biggest visual changes are coming to Photos. First of all, there’s a persistent sidebar. You can also browser your photos on a per-import basis, allowing you to see which photos you imported when. Syncing with other devices is also easier: if you change categorizations on one device, they’ll sync to another. But the real highlight here is editing features. You can now edit curves and selective colors, right inside photos. If that’s not enough, you can open images with a third party editor like Photoshop: any saved changes will immediately show up in Photos. This probably isn’t going to make Photos the organization tool of choice for Photographers, but it’s a step in the right direction. Finally, third parties can now offer printed books within Photos itself, so if you want a Photo album you could in theory put it together entirely in Photos. Apple File System Becomes the Default Step aside, HFS: The Apple File System (AFS) is already in use on iOS devices, and it will be the default for macOS High Sierra. This file system is built from the ground up with modern computers in mind, and was first announced one year ago. This should result in faster file transfers, and also introduce new features like native encryption and crash protection. RELATED ARTICLE How to Format a Drive With the APFS File System on macOS Sierra You can already format a drive with AFS if you want to, but this file format is now the default file system for all macOS systems. It’s not clear whether upgrading to the new version will mean your file system is changed, or whether users will need to do a fresh installation in order to take advantage of the new file system, but we’ll let you know when we find out. Macs Get Official Support for External Graphics Cards RELATED ARTICLE The Best Ways to Connect an External Graphics Card to Your Laptop If you want an extremely powerful graphics card in a MacBook Pro, too bad: there’s not enough room in these thin laptops to accommodate the latest and greatest. But macOS High Sierra offers a compromise with official support for external graphics cards over FireWire. Apple is even releasing a a developer kit with an AMD Radeon 580 graphics card. The target audience here is developers, not gamers, so don’t expect a consumer version anytime soon, but it’s still an interesting way to give developers access to more graphics power now that the Mac Pro is seemingly never getting an update. Metal 2 Improves Graphics Performance, Will Run the Desktop Interface Last year Apple announced Metal, a new graphics engine for macOS Sierra. The new High Sierra will come with the next version, boringly named Metal 2 (sadly, they didn’t call think to call it “High Metal”). It will supposedly improves on the framework in all kinds of ways, most of which are going to be primarily interesting to developers. But users should be excited about one thing: Metal will now power desktop effects, like Mission Control. This should result in a snappy desktop, but we’ll have to mash the Mission Control Button repeatedly to find out how well it works. Developer Support for Virtual Reality Virtual Reality has long been a no-show on macOS, with major headsets not offering drivers or software. High Sierra aims to change that with Metal for VR. The SteamVR SDK is coming to macOS, and so is Unity and Unreal’s VR Engines. Final Cut Pro X will also now work for editing spherical video. Gamers hoping to user VR on their Mac shouldn’t get too excited: the focus is on developers for now. But this is progress, and maybe someday playing VR games on your Mac will be an option (particularly if you buy an external graphics card.) There are likely to be other small improvements to macOS, but we’ll have to wait until we get our hands on it to find out—when that happens, be sure to check back here for more details.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What’s New in iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad, Arriving Fall 2017 By Chris Hoffman on June 5th, 2017 iOS 11 is on its way, and Apple announced a number of new features and changes at WWDC 2017 this year. From improvements to Messages and Apple Pay to powerful multitasking and file management on the iPad, here are the best new features of iOS coming this fall. iMessage Apps Are Easier to Access, and Messages Are Synced Between Devices The Messages app has a redesigned app drawer to make iMessage apps and stickers more discoverable and easier to use. These apps were added in iOS 10, but were hidden behind a button, which was kind of annoying. The new layout makes things much more accessible. Your messages will now be stored in iCloud, too. All of your conversations will be synchronized between your devices when you sign in with your iCloud account. That way, you can delete a message on one device and it goes away everywhere. Messages remain end-to-end encrypted, even while stored in the cloud. This also allows Apple to optimize device storage. Since your messages are stored in the cloud, they don’t have to all remain on your device. This means more free space and smaller and faster device backups. Pay Your Friends Over iMessage with Apple Pay Apple Pay will now allow person-to-person payments. It’s integrated right into Messages as an iMessage app, making it easy to send money while chatting. Money you receive goes into your Apple Pay cash card and you can send it to someone else, make a purchase with Apple Pay, or transfer it to your bank account. You’ll have to authenticate with Touch ID before sending money, just as you do when making purchases. It’ll even try to detect when you want to use it. If you receive a message in iMessages saying you owe money, for example, the keyboard will automatically suggest Apple Pay as an option and automatically fill in the amount of money. Lastly, 50% of US retailers will be accepting Apply Pay in the US by end of 2017, according to Apple. Siri Gets a More Natural Voice and Other Improvements Siri’s voice is being upgraded: Apple has used “deep learning” to create a more “natural and expressive” voice. Siri has both a male and female voice, and it can even say the same word in different ways for a more realistic conversation experience. Apple’s virtual assistant is gaining built-in translation features as well. Siri will speak the translation aloud for you, so you know exactly how to pronounce it. It’ll support translation from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish initially. In addition to suggesting apps, and when you should leave for work based on traffic, Siri will use on-device learning to understand more about topics of interest to you. Siri can suggest news topics you might be interested in, more easily respond with your location in messages, or make calendar events after you book hotel reservations in Safari on the web, for example. The keyboard will learn words you might want to use based on what you read. This is all done on your device, and not in the cloud. Lastly, developers can now take advantage of SiriKit to integrate Siri with more types of apps, everything from task management to notes to banking. So hopefully, Siri will be able to do more as developers jump on board. Camera Improvements Mean Videos and Photos Take Up Less Space iOS 11 will use HEVC video encoding, which means videos you capture are up to two times smaller in storage size. Apple is also switching photo capture from JPEG to HEIF for up to two times better compression as well, so photos you take on your device will use up to two times less space. You can still share those photos with people on other devices. Improved Memories and Live Photos The Memories feature in the Photos app can now use machine learning to identify activities like anniversaries, memories of your children, your pets, or sporting events. It uses computer vision to identify photos and automatically pick the best videos and photos. It can also work in portrait mode as well as landscape mode, so you can watch in whatever aspect ratio you prefer. There are improvements for live photos, too. You can now more easily edit live photos, trimming them and marking any frame of the photo as the “key photo” in the live photo. It can also turn a live photo into a seamless loop using computer vision technology. Control Center Consolidates to One Unified, 3D Touch-Capable Page The Control Center that appears when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen has been redesigned. It’s now a single page that includes all the features—You don’t need to swipe left and right to use them (which is sure to be less confusing for many people). In addition, you can now 3D touch an option to access more controls. For example, you can 3D touch the music control to see more information and playback controls. The Lock Screen and Notification Center Have Been Combined The lock screen and notification center are now the same screen. When you swipe down from the top of the screen, you’ll see all your notifications. You can still swipe to the left to access your widgets or the right to access your camera. Apple Maps Improves Navigation and Adds Indoor Maps Apple Maps is, once again, improving navigation a little bit. Apple Maps will display the speed limit and provide lane guidance to guide you into the appropriate lane while navigating. In addition, Maps is getting indoor maps of malls and airports, with directories and a search feature. Apple is beginning with many malls and airports, but will be adding more as time goes on. Do Not Disturb Will Auto-Enable While Driving iOS 11 includes a new “Do Not Disturb While Driving” feature that uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to determine whether you’re driving.  It will automatically hide your notifications if you are (though you can tell the iPhone you’re not driving if you want notifications to show up). The Messages app can even automatically auto-respond to people who text you, saying that you’re driving and can’t respond right now. They can text you to say it’s urgent if they need you to respond as soon as possible. AirPlay 2 Becomes Part of HomeKit, and Brings Multi-Room Audio HomeKit will now support speakers, so you can configure and control your speakers alongside your other smarthome devices. Apple has a new AirPlay 2 protocol that enables multi-room audio, too. You can finally play music to different speakers throughout your home from apps in iOS—no need for iTunes on the desktop. You can now also play audio to your Apple TV from your iOS device or Mac, enabling those speakers connected to your media center to become AirPlay speakers. Apple Music Gets Some Social Improvements Apple Music will now show you what your friends are listening to, so you can more easily discover new music you might want to listen to. You can create a profile, make it public or private, and follow people with similar taste. Developers will have a MusicKit for Apple Music API they can use to gain full access to Apple Music, too. For example, Shazam can automatically add songs it identifies to your Apple Music collection, and DJ apps can provide access to the entire Apple Music library. The App Store Has Been Redesigned The App Store is being completely redesigned to make it easier to discover new apps and games. Launch it and you’ll see a new “Today” tab that provides better app discovery. Every day there’s a new app of the day and game of the day, and you might also see how-to guides with information about apps you already use on the Today tab. You can scroll down to see older information from previous days, too. At the bottom of the page, you’ll see that apps are now sorted into both “Games” and “Apps”, so you can easily browse either games or apps that aren’t games. Apple Has Improved Many iOS Core Technologies Alongside the improved Metal 2 graphics API and HEVC video encoding technology, iOS will gain machine learning and augmented reality features for developers to build on. iOS is also making machine learning easier for developers to use with Core ML. There’s a vision API that provides developers with an easier way to recognize faces and landmarks, for example. There’s also a natural language API for understanding text. Again, this all happens on the device, not in the cloud. Augmented reality (AR) features will be easier for developers to use. ARKit will make it easier for developers to make augmented reality features in their apps—Pokémon Go used AR to show Pokemon superimposed over a video of the real world, for example. Apple showed off an improved Pokémon Go app that showed Pokéballs bouncing more realistically over the ground. Apple also demonstrated a developer app that allowed you to add virtual objects to a table. The app used surface detection to place the objects. Apple says this will make iPhones and iPads “the largest AR platform in the world” overnight. The iPad Gets new Multitasking Features There are a lot of new features in iOS 11 that make iPads more powerful. The dock at the bottom of the screen can contain many more apps, and you can now swipe up from the bottom of the screen in any app to more easily switch between apps. You can drag an app icon from the dock and position it on your screen to easily start multitasking. There’s also a new app switcher. iPads will now support drag-and-drop for text, images, and links between apps. You can select multiple things and drag them, too. You can drag in the multitasking interface, or drag content from the dock. In addition, the iPad’s keyboard allows you to flick on keys to access punctuation and numbers, making typing faster. A File Management App Finally Comes to the iPad There’s a new Files app for iPad that supports nested folders, list view, favorite, search, tags, and recent files. It supports not only iCloud, but also third-party storage providers like Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. When you search or view recent files, you’ll see all your files in one place. You can drag-and-drop email attachments to the Files app to save them, for example. Or you can tap and hold on the Files app on the dock and then drag and drop files from the Files app into any other app. Apple didn’t say this app wouldn’t appear on iPhone, but it was strongly implied that this app will only be for the iPad. The iPad Gets More Markup Features for the Apple Pencil Apple is offering more markup features throughout iOS 11, making the Apple Pencil more useful. When you take a screenshot, you can tap a thumbnail that appears and use an Apple Pencil to mark up and draw on those screenshots. Anything you mark up can be saved as a PDF. You can draw in emails, too. Your handwritten text is now searchable, thanks to machine learning detecting what you’re writing—so you can find handwritten notes with Spotlight search. Notes now includes a built-in document scanner that can scan paper notes. You can then mark them up with your pencil, so it’s a convenient way to digitally fill out paper forms. You can draw even in notes you’re typing in Apple Note, too. Many More Features Apple also mentioned a few features targeted at users in China, including a QR code reader application integrated into the main Camera app and integrated on the lock screen. There are many other features Apple didn’t mention, too. The above slide reveals that it will contain a one-handed keyboard, Wi-Fi password sharing, screen recording, flight status information in Spotlight, and lots more. We’ll explore these in greater detail once we get a chance to play with iOS 11, which is launching this fall. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

It will be powered by a A10X CPU which is a “powerhouse” that’s 90 percent faster than the older A9 chip. 2 These are the two new iPads Apple announced today 2 The two new iPads are more powerful than any previous models Apple unveiled two new versions of its iPad Pro: the larger with a 12.9 inch screen and the new 10.5 inch version. The new version of the iPad features a new glossy display which can show “crisper, smoother” video and smoother moving graphics. It will come with the same 12 megapixel camera as the iPhone 7, as well as a 7 megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and Facetime. “The iPad is truly a magical piece of glass that transforms into anything you want,” Tim Cook said. Apple’s iOS 11 will also be “the biggest release” for iPad ever. It features a new dock to store apps, which looks a bit like the dock from Mac computers. The software introduces drag and drop facility which lets you move stuff around. You could, for instance, drag a web address from a browser into an email, rather than having to copy and paste like the olden days. MOST READ IN TECH AND SCIENCE OH CRINGE!

Apple also confirmed the arrival of a new app called Files which lets you manage files and data in the sort of detail normally associated with desktop or laptop computers. Pencil can also be used to annotate pictures and even screenshots of websites which can then be shared along, removing the need to print out documents.  The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes in silver, space grey, gold and rose gold and starts at £619 for the 64GB wifi model. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is available in silver, space grey and gold and starts at £769 for the 64GB wifi version. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The new iPad doesn’t stray dramatically from the current iPad Pro lineup with generally the same physical design, but what you will notice immediately is the much thinner bezels around the device. In other words, Apple managed to pack in a larger display in what is only marginally bigger than the 9.7-inch Pro model. The device notably weighs the same 1 pound as the previous 9.7-inch model. Apple was using the new 10.5-inch model to demo ARKit, the company’s new Augmented Reality platform that will let app developers easily build AR features into their own apps with iOS 11. Apple said ARKit will be the largest AR platform in the world when it’s released with hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of supporting it. Apple is introducing a new platform for developers to help them bring high-quality AR experiences to iPhone and iPad using the built-in camera, powerful processors and motion sensors in iOS devices. ARKit allows developers to tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build detailed and compelling virtual content on top of real-world scenes for interactive gaming, immersive shopping experiences, industrial design and more. During the demo, we got a look at some of what ARKit can do with placing objects in a physical space and rendering light and shadows, including gaming demo with an AR game called “Holochess Star Wars”.

The new case is available from both Logitech and Apple, offering a protective case and detachable keyboard. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover The Slim Combo is touted as the “most versatile” case of the iPad Pro and includes four different use modes: typing, viewing, FaceTime, and reading. The accompanying keyboard connects via the iPad Pro Smart Connector, which means there’s no need for Bluetooth pairing or charging. The keyboard is full-size and back-lit, making it a perfect companion for on-the-go use. Additionally, the keyboard is detachable from the iPad, which means you don’t always have to carry it around and can leave it behind for times when you need to lighten the load. Much like Apple’s new case, the Slim Combo includes an Apple Pencil holder to help you keep track of it when not in use. Four use modes —Typing, Viewing, FaceTime, Reading. Full-size, backlit keyboard connects to the iPad Pro using the Smart Connector, so there’s no pairing and no charging. 360 degrees of protection and tilts your iPad Pro within a 50-degree range, giving you the perfect viewing angle so you can be productive, creative, connected, relaxed. Includes Apple Pencil holder to makes sure it’s always by your side – where it won’t get lost, or in the way. As far as pricing and availability, the Slim Combo is available today from both Logitech and Apple’s online store and retail stores. The case comes in at $129.99 for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro model and $149.99 for the 12.9-inch model. The full press release is below: New Logitech Slim Combo for iPad Pro: The Next Generation of Personal Computing New Slim Combo Case with Detachable Keyboard Makes Computing Easier, Faster and More Fun Than Ever Before LAUSANNE, Switzerland & NEWARK, Calif. — June 5, 2017 — Today Logitech (SIX: LOGN) (NASDAQ: LOGI) announced the Logitech® Slim Combo, a protective cover and detachable keyboard for Apple’s new, 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The Logitech Slim Combo is a versatile case and keyboard, designed so you can experience the full potential of your iPad Pro. “In the past, you were bound to a workspace with a PC, and used your tablet for quick messages or entertainment when you weren’t in the office; that’s not the case anymore,” said Michele Hermann, vice president of mobility at Logitech. “To be a pro today, you need the power of the PC, but more easily available whether you’re on a train, at the park, in a meeting or wherever you need to be. The Slim Combo unleashes the power of iPad Pro to bring you the future of personal computing; a future that’s easier, faster and more fun.” The Slim Combo for iPad Pro provides versatility through its four use modes — typing, viewing, FaceTime and reading. You can comfortably shoot off an email using the full-size keyboard, pop off the detachable keyboard to sketch out an idea with Apple Pencil, or just sit back and watch a show or get lost in an e-book without distractions. And if a call comes in, simply switch Slim Combo into portrait mode for a hands-free FaceTime experience that captures less background and more of what matters. The detachable keyboard connects to your iPad Pro through its Smart Connector andgets all of its power directly from the iPad Pro – there’s no need for charging cables, batteries or pairing. The Slim Combo’s full-size keyboard features well-spaced, backlit keys and a dedicated row of iOS shortcut keys for comfortable, efficient typing. Two micro hinges allow the Slim Combo to smoothly recline within a 50-degree range and stay in place once you’ve found the perfect setting. The Slim Combo adjusts to the viewing angle you need so you can be productive, creative, connected and relaxed. And because the Slim Combo was built to support any way you want to use your iPad Pro, it even gives you a safe place to store your Apple Pencil so it won’t get lost. Pricing and Availability The Logitech Slim Combo comes in black or blue and is available for purchase in Apple retail stores, apple.com and logitech.com beginning today. The suggested retail price for the Slim Combo for 10.5-inch iPad Pro is $129.99 and for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $149.99. For more information, please visit www.logitech.com or our blog.

By Sonya Mann Sonya Mann is a staff reporter with the San Francisco Inc. bureau. She covers the business side of technology, with a focus on enterprise companies, the sharing economy, and marketplaces that empower informal entrepreneurship. @sonyaellenmann Staff reporter, Inc.com@sonyaellenmann 1 COMMENTS Apple CEO Tim Cook. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple announced a lot of things at its developer conference on Monday. The company's various operating systems will be improved, and there's a powerful new iMac Pro, for instance. What Apple didn't announce is anything that will change the trajectory of its business or the future of technology. For the moment, at least, it has become a staid old company limping after younger, more innovative peers. Apple excels when it comes to hardware differentiated by software. It stumbles when it comes to software services. And that's bad news for the world's most valuable public company because innovation has once again moved up the stack from hardware, as it did when the OS wars were won (by Windows) and web browsers became the important battlefield. Similarly, now that everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, the important thing is how they use it, not who made it. That leaves Apple playing catch-up to other tech behemoths like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Apple will continue to make gobs of money selling iPhones, but based on today's keynote announcements, it has plenty of ground to make up in the race to own the platforms of the future. The HomePod has Siri built in, and some fancy lights to know she's activated #WWDC17 pic.twitter.com/BLoTiSYBcx-- Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 The most significant WWDC launches were ARKit, which will allow apps to incorporate augmented-reality features, and HomePod, a music-focused clone of the Amazon Echo and Google Home. It's a clone that relies on Siri, widely regarded as the weakest AI voice assistant on the market. A clone that costs at least $200 more than competitive products. ARKit has the potential to enable amazing gaming and social experiences, but Apple's track record as a platform is, to put it plainly, terrible. Sure, it pulls in tons of money, but only because of other things that Apple has done well, namely selling iPhones. The company has hamstrung developers for years by refusing to build out robust pricing features. The App Store flourishes to the extent that it does because Apple's millions of iPhone users are such a tempting demographic. Developers will put up with opaque, seemingly arbitrary rules in order to reach them. That will continue to be true, but it points to Apple's incompetence when it comes to making phenomenal, complex apps economically viable. Furthermore, even in the free-to-play and social sectors that the App Store is designed to encourage, the bulk of the benefit will be reaped by Candy Crush and Snapchat rather than Apple itself. This is not to downplay the value of being the default platform for AR apps, but to doubt Apple's ability to leverage that advantage for any endeavor other than selling more iPhones. The assessment changes if Apple can introduce and popularize AR glasses (a la Snapchat Spectacles) or a similar product. As for HomePod, Apple is emphasizing its sound quality, likely because the company knows that Siri is inferior to the other options. The device is projected to be available in December at the price of $349. As New York Times tech reporter Mike Isaac pointed out, Amazon and Google can use their AI voice assistants as loss leaders, but Apple seems to be going with its usual strategy of charging premium prices for a physical product. So Apple starts with quality audio and adds smarts to it. Google/Amazon are starting with smarts, adding audio quality secondarily.-- Andrew Martonik (@andrewmartonik) June 5, 2017 This is a tricky area to handicap. As stated earlier, Apple excels at integrating hardware and software. But in the HomePod's case, "software" mean an AI-powered voice interface, which is totally different from a visual operating system. We already have a sense of what Apple's capabilities in this area look like based on Siri. That's not hugely promising. Apple is by no means doomed. The company still makes great products for which there is plenty of demand, especially in countries like China and India that are rapidly getting richer. But in terms of its ability to reinvent the tech landscape, Apple may have misplaced its magic touch. Published on: Jun 5, 2017 Advertisement

At its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Monday it would bring active virtual reality support to Mac from developers, including Valve’s SteamVR, Unity and Epic Games’ Unreal Engine. The partnerships come as part of an update to Apple’s Metal developers app that will come with the upcoming macOS High Sierra update. As part of the update, Metal will be able to support external graphics card setups that’ll allow for additional graphics processing overhead. The update isn’t necessarily relevant for most home macOS users, who typically have a consumer-level laptop or desktop, but targeted more toward studios and other creative professionals.

It still remains to be seen if Apple will make a significant push into consumer-level VR — Apple’s Tim Cook previously has been ambivalent about the medium — but Apple’s willingness to be more active is a plus for developers. At WWDC, Apple also showcased several notable developer features for augmented reality. First, Apple highlighted its ARKit tool for developers, allowing them to build AR experiences for iOS users more easily. In an early demo, Apple’s Craig Federighi showcased a basic AR interface onstage. The tool was fairly simple — Federighi placed a virtual lamp and coffee cup onstage — highlighting how well the platform accurately rendered and tracked both objects in space. Read: Apple HomePod, A Siri-Powered Speaker, Revealed At WWDC 2017 More impressively, Wingnut AR — a studio from director Peter Jackson — showcased an ARKit-powered demo where a table was overlaid with an elaborate live combat scene. The studio said it will be releasing an AR game for iOS later this year. Both moves make Apple the latest company to invest significantly in VR and AR. While Snapchat helped popularize augmented reality with features like its portrait image overlays, the field has seen similar entries from companies like Facebook and Google. With Apple’s existing iPhone and iPad base, the company said ARKit would be the “world’s largest AR platform” for developers.

Software support for the popular smartphone ends this year. Rumors leading up to Apple’s WWDC 2017 announcements hinted at the end of iOS support for older devices and today Apple’s made it official. The iOS 11 update is confirmed and it’s confirmed for a select group of iPhones and iPads, among them, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. Apple’s iPhone 5s will also be getting the bump from iOS 10 to iOS 11. Other devices, like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, will not it seems. No iPhone 5 iOS 11 Beta Apple’s released an iOS 11 beta ahead of the official iOS 11 release date this fall. The beta is open to many older devices including the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 but the iOS 11 beta isn’t available to iPhone 5 users. An iPhone 5 iOS 11 beta is MIA. If you own an iPhone 5 and you want to try out the iOS 11 update ahead of its official release date you need to buy, find or borrow a newer version of the iPhone. No iPhone 5 iOS 11 Update The lack of an iPhone 5 iOS 11 beta means that an iPhone 5 iOS 11 update in the fall is unlikely. In fact, Apple says that iOS 11 will be released in the fall “for iPhone 5s and later, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation, iPad mini 2 and later and iPod touch 6th generation.” This appears to close the door on a release for older models like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. iPhone 5 Probably Won’t Get New Emoji If the iPhone 5 stays put on iOS 10, and at this point there’s no reason to believe Apple will surprise us this fall, the device won’t get the new batch of emojis. New emoji characters are on the way to the iOS keyboard. They’re scheduled to be released in June but they probably won’t be released for iPhone in June. Instead, they’ll probably be released in an upcoming iOS 11 beta or in an official iOS 11 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch this fall. Unless Apple surprises with a release inside an upcoming iOS 10 update, the iPhone 5 will probably miss out on Person In Steamy Room, Genie, and Grinning Face With Star Eyes. iOS 11 Features You’ll Miss + No watchOS 4 Emojis won’t be the only features iPhone 5 users are missing out on if Apple fails to release an iOS 11 update for the device. Apple’s iOS 11 update is packed full of new features including improvements to Siri, an overhauled Control Center, a redesigned App Store, AirPlay2, and improvements to the camera. The company’s also upgraded Do Not Disturb, improved Apple Maps, and tweaked Apple Music and Apple News. There’s also a new one-handed mode on iPhone. On top of that, it looks like Apple Watch owners who pair the device with an iPhone 5 (or iPhone 5c) won’t be able to upgrade to watchOS 4 in the fall. Apple requires iPhone users to be running the latest iOS software in order to run the latest watchOS software. So, for instance, you need to have iOS 10 installed in order to install watchOS 3 on an Apple Watch. Unless Apple changes its protocol between now and the iOS 11 release date, iPhone 5 users who want the latest Apple Watch features will need to upgrade. For a full list of iOS 11 features, take a look at our iOS 11 vs. iOS 10 walkthrough. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.3 Update What this means is that the iPhone 5 will probably stay put on iOS 10. Currently, the device is running Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update but it will soon be upgraded to Apple’s iOS 10.3.3 software. The iOS 10.3.3 update is in beta ahead of an unknown release date.   iOS 10.3.3 looks like it will be another maintenance update which means it will likely focus on fixing bugs and improving performance. With just a few months to go before the iOS 11 release, we’d be surprised if Apple released another milestone iOS 10 upgrade with new features. With no other iOS 10 releases in sight, it’s possible that iOS 10.3.3 will serve as the final update for the iPhone 5. 10 Things to Do Before Installing iOS 11 Beta Get Familiar with iOS 11   1 / 10 One of the first things you'll want to do is dig into the early version of the iOS 11 update to get familiar with its changes. This way you'll know exactly what you're getting into if and when you decide to install the early version on your device.  The iOS 11 beta 1 is a huge update and it brings tons of changes to Apple's fleet of iOS-powered iPhones and iPads. Remember, the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c will stay on iOS 10. Apple's put together a guide that will take you through the most important things to know about the first version of the iOS 11 beta and you'll want to take a look before you take the plunge. We've also released a detailed iOS 11 vs. iOS 10 walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the differences between the two pieces of software.  Make sure you get familiar with iOS 11 and its changes right now now so there aren't any surprises after you install the software on your device.    1 / 10 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 Update Apple’s iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 update is small upgrade but tiny updates can have an eno… 06/07/2017 7 min read 5 Things to Know About the iOS 11 Update Apple’s next operating system is official and today we want to go over the most impo… 06/07/2017 16 min read New MacBook Pro: 6 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons Not To The new MacBook Pro is a great machine for many users, but for others, it is tough to use … 06/07/2017 7 min read Load More In Apple Click To Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Apple Announces Its First Home Speaker Anna Gaca // June 5, 2017 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Among the announcements from the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference today is news of Apple’s new standalone Bluetooth speaker, dubbed the HomePod. It’s a seven inch tall mesh bubble with a Siri interface on top, and while it’s marketed primarily to music fans, its features are intended to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers as well as with Sonos. The HomePod will come in white or space gray and costs $349. It’s expected to ship in December. It’s connected to Apple Music, of course, and can play from that service’s library independently. Six microphones around the speaker’s top edge will listen for users to say “Hey Siri,” and alongside regular Siri functions (messages, weather, etc.), the HomePod promises to answer more in-depth music questions such as chart history or names of individual performers. In an apparent response to privacy concerns about the Echo, Apple says Siri requests will be encrypted and anonymized. The HomePod promises better sound quality than its rivals, and it’s also supposed to do something called “spacial awareness,” which involves adjusting its sound to suit a room’s acoustics. Buyers will be able to put two HomePods in the same room for enhanced sound. Separate updates to Apple’s AirPlay technology and Home app will allow listeners to use their iOS device to control audio in multiple rooms, whether on HomePods or other paired Bluetooth speakers. In other music-related news from AWDC today, Apple’s Music app is getting some new social features, including a “Friends are listening to” section under the “For You” tab. Apple will also allow third-party developers to fully integrate with Apple Music, starting with Shazaam and the radio app Anchor. These updates will arrive with iOS 11, out later this year.

Both revealed at WWDC 2017 today, the new iPad Pro and the new iOS version go hand-in-hand. Indeed, Apple pointed out, iOS 11 will be the biggest iOS update for iPad ever. First, though, the new hardware. At first glance the iPad Pro 10.5 looks terribly familiar; it’s only really when you see it in photos alongside the old version that you can see the main changes. Although it’s almost exactly the same size – it has increased in size a little, Apple tells me, though it’s still about a pound in weight – the bezels have been shrunk dramatically. The upshot is a 10.5-inch display where previously you got 9.7-inches. It doesn’t sound like much, but it nudges the delta between this new iPad Pro and the larger 12.1-inch version even closer. Whereas before, if you really wanted a notebook replacement, you’d probably want to go for the bigger iPad Pro, suddenly that looks even more unwieldy than it already kinda did. In the artificial conditions of Apple’s demo room – and without an old iPad Pro 9.7 to compare with directly – it’s hard to say how much of a difference the new display makes in terms of color and brightness. The impact of the new 120Hz refresh rate, though, is far easier to observe. Suddenly, scrolling of webpages that might once have left the screen a smear until it came to a halt is now far crisper and smoother. Spinning around a 3D plan of a city, the iPad Pro 10.5 kept up exactly with where my fingers were. None of the smudging and catch-up you might experience on the 9.7-inch version when you’re using graphically-intensive apps. It’s not just down to the new display, of course. Apple’s new six-core A10X Fusion chip is bizarrely potent for a tablet. Indeed, the Cupertino firm is claiming it’s more powerful than many laptops. If there’s a downside to the new display, it’s if you got used to gripping the tablet by the edge. You may well have to change how you hold the slate, since there’s more likelihood of your fingers overlapping the edges of the touchscreen. There’s rejection technology to try to avoid that – it’s based on the same thing that stops your palm from triggering the display when you lean on it to write with the Apple Pencil – but it’s not infallible. As for iOS 11, even with this small taste of the new platform, it’s not hard to see how it’ll move the iPad Pro far further into the realm of “true laptop replacement”. In many ways it’s the simplest features which make the biggest difference. The new dock, which can now expand for easier multitasking, and be swiped up onto the screen from within any app. Being able to collect up a set of photos, links, text, or whatever else, drag them into a different app, and drop them there. Combined with the task switcher, which now does a far better job of keeping your last-state – including split-screen setup – for multiple apps, it’s all starting to feel a lot more like macOS. That’s by design, naturally, and I’m sure Apple would be quick to point out that there’s plenty macOS proper (whether in new High Sierra form or otherwise) will do that iOS 11 still doesn’t even want to attempt. Nonetheless, I feel like we’re closing the gap even further between what the typical, average user expects from their notebook on a day to day basis, and what an iPad can do. What that percentage is down to now I wouldn’t want to say until iOS 11 actually arrives. Nonetheless, it’s good news for those hoping to replace their notebook with an iPad Pro with its 10 hours of battery life and a display that suddenly puts a MacBook to shame. Throw in the improved Apple Pencil – something Apple continues to stubbornly refuse to even countenance on its Macs – and it stops being anything close to a compromise and starts to look like the alternative for the mainstream that Apple always claimed it was. The irony, of course, is that while the new iPad Pro 10.5 may be available to order from today, iOS 11 won’t be ready for the public until the fall of 2017. That means that, for the moment at least, out of the box it’ll run iOS 10 instead. No fancy drag-and-drop, no flexible launcher bar, just the same iOS 10 we already know. Still, the iOS 11 upgrade will be a free one, and until then the iPad Pro 10.5’s hardware has plenty of appeal. I’m not sure I’d upgrade if I were a current iPad Pro owner, but even this first, early taste suggest that those who have been on the fence have even more reason to make the switch.

As usual, all of the Developer Beta builds are available now, including tvOS 11, which hasn't even been formally announced. As with all first betas, you should proceed with caution here. There's a reason that Apple hasn't seeded this to the Public Beta Program yet, although those should be coming later on this month for iOS and macOS. For example, the iOS 11 release notes show a number of known issues to be aware of. In fact, many third-party apps are cited as possibly crashing, including DirecTV, Kindle, MobileIron Mobile@Work, Facebook Messenger (when Facebook isn't installed), Amazon Video (playback controls might not work), Pinterest, Tencent Video, and Skype. Also, migrating from an Android phone might not succeed. There are dozens of other known issues. When upgrading to macOS 10.13 High Sierra, you'll be prompted to convert to Apple File System, but HDD-only Macs won't do it by default. Some Macs aren't supported yet, such as iMacs with 3TB Fusion drives and BootCamp, and the mid-2012 Mac Pro. But those aren't the only four betas that Apple seeded today. Xcode 9 beta is available, which should support the new APIs that are included in the new operating systems. There's also Swift Playgrounds 2, macOS Server 5.4, Classroom 2.1, and Apple Configurator 2.5.
