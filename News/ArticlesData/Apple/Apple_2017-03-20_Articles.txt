By Necta Casiple on March 21, 2017 12:35 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Apple | Rumors are rife that Apple is holding an event this spring, but until now, we haven’t seen any invites rolled out yet. With a few days left until the month ends, the possibility of a quiet release for the company’s new products increases by the day. While the said event could happen anytime in the next two weeks, hints are all pointing that the surprise launch will happen tomorrow. Is there a MacBook 2017 and iMac 2017 release announcement? MacRumors discovered that Apple’s system status page indicates that the Apple Store will close for maintenance tomorrow morning from 3 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. This could mean nothing but merely a scheduled maintenance. However, it’s worth noting that the latter time is when Apple usually issues press releases for announcements, including new products. There might be a strong possibility that once the site comes back on, a new product will already be there. Apple also traditionally takes down its online store for a few hours when there are new products arriving. The downtime allows landing pages and purchasing options for those devices. Combine this coincidence with the speculation about its product updates that has been circulating on the rumor mill for a while now, some fans definitely cannot help but be suspicious. If our instinct is correct, what would Tim Cook and the company release tomorrow? The MacBook 2017 line is one to consider. Macbook 2017 According to MacWorld, the Cupertino-based tech giant didn’t update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. After that event, Apple discontinued the 11-inch MacBook Air, a move that highly suggests that the 12-inch MacBook could fill in the Air lineup’s shoes as its consumer-oriented Mac laptops. And since the 2015 version was launched during the company’s spring event, we’ll hopefully see this year’s version introduced at the same schedule as well. However, there’s still a chance that we won’t. The site notes that Apple only revealed the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro, and new Apple Watch straps at its spring event last year. Instead, Apple quietly launched the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. If we don’t see it at its spring event, we can anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch not long after. Apple iMac 2017 The iMac is also due for an update. Rumors have it that the company will utilize AMD’s latest RYZEN chips for the iMac 2017 instead of Intel’s i7 chips. Apart from exceeding Intel i7 in a CPU performance benchmark, AMD’s new chips also agree with Apple’s shift to focus more on the economy of energy consumption than maximum performance. If we’re lucky, we might see its newest version in the spring event too. Otherwise, it’ll probably launch during the WWDC 2017 on June 5 to 9. Other good guesses would be updated iPads and spec-bumped version of the iPhone SE. But then again, these are all but confirmed, so everyone should take them with a grain of salt. Update: As anticipated, Apple released a new range of devices and accessories today, but the MacBook 2017 and iMac 2017 were not included. Among the new items that hit Apple’s online store earlier this morning were a new 9.7-inch iPad, red iPhone 7, iPhone SE storage bump, Apple Watch bands, and iPhone cases. 9Also Read: MacBook Pro 2017 Release Update: ARM-based Laptops To Appear This Year?

Stock Surges Past $140. What's Next? As smartphone sales slow, where will Apple's growth come from next? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 20, 2017 at 10:12PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has seemingly been hitting new highs every week recently. And now the tech giant's stock has passed $140 and is trading just over $141 this week. With shares rising 21% in the past three months, it's a good time to take a look at Apple's overall business and ponder what's next for the tech giant. Still an iPhone-driven business Believe it or not, just over nine years after Apple introduced the first iPhone, the smartphone is still Apple's bread and butter. In Apple's most recent quarter, for instance, the iPhone accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's revenue. Of course, this means Apple's other product segments pale in comparison. Mac, services, iPad, and other products segments represented about 9%, 9%, 7%, and 5% of the total revenue, respectively. Image source: Apple. When iPhone sales were soaring, its significant share of revenue was a good thing. But now iPhone's share of revenue is creating a problem for Apple. iPhone unit sales during the trailing 12 months are down 7% compared to the year-ago period, highlighting how difficult it is for Apple to grow sales of its flagship product. Sure, iPhone units and revenue are up about 5% year over year in the company's most recent quarter, providing a glimpse of a possible rebound in iPhone sales -- particularly if Apple's upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone is as big of an improvement as rumors suggest it will be. But, given the growth headwinds iPhone has faced recently, investors shouldn't count on a sharp rebound in iPhone sales. With iPhone sales slowing and Apple stock trading at a new all-time high above $140, this may have some investors wondering: Where can the growth come from next? What's Apple's next big catalyst? Fortunately, even if iPhone sales struggle to grow from here, two areas of Apple's business are offering promising prospects: services and other products. Services is probably Apple's most important catalyst. Indeed, while Mac revenue in Apple's most recent quarter was greater than services revenue -- thanks to the company's recent introduction of its new MacBook Pro laptops -- on a trailing-12-month basis, services revenue is now greater than Mac revenue. During this period, services accounted for a strong 12% of total revenue -- slightly higher than Mac's 11% share of total Apple revenue. Image source: Apple. Apple's services revenue in the company's most recent quarter hit an all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year. And there's good reason to expect Apple's services revenue will continue growing. For instance, Apple's App Store revenue, which is part of the company's services segment, was up 43% year over year in Apple's holiday quarter. Furthermore, management has forecast annual services revenue will double over the next four years, growing to just over $50 billion in 2020. Apple's other products segment is more of a wild card than services. Accounting for just 5% of trailing-12-month revenue, the segment is still very small as a proportion of total revenue. However, the 2014 introduction of Apple Watch has proven the company can carry over its brand power to new product segments. Sure, the product hasn't transformed into a major revenue driver for the company. But it's still faring well several years after its launch, with Apple reporting Apple Watch revenue was at an all-time high in the company's most recent quarter. Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with a promising outlook for its services and other products segments, I'm still betting on Apple stock -- even above $140.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

LGBT? Oh, no, that's sensitive More like this Apple New Zealand Tax Business New Zealand puts the bite on Apple over taxes Australia, of all places, is a tax haven for Apple New Zealand 21 Mar 2017 at 02:04, Richard Chirgwin New Zealand has joined the international criticism of Apple's tax arrangements, with NZ$4.2 billion worth of sales over ten years yielding zero tax in the country. It did pay some tax in that period – a paltry $37 million – but that was remitted to the Australian Tax Office. The revelations made by the New Zealand Herald prompted the country's revenue minister Judith Collins to say she's working to strengthen tax laws. Apple's response is straight from the template: it's following the law (almost certainly true) and it pays most of its taxes in the USA. The second claim may be so, but it hasn't kept Apple free from criticism in Washington. Last year, Tim Cook first refused to consider repatriating profits that had pooled overseas, only to reverse his stance in the face of a US$14.5 billion back tax claim from the European Commission. Apple, like other companies, is also waiting for United States president Donald Trump to follow through his campaign thought bubble about allowing an amnesty that would allow US companies to repatriate cash without paying tax. Even though American companies are taxed locally, current US law insists they also pay US taxes on foreign earnings. Trump suggested an amnesty to allow US companies to bring cash home and invest it in stateside projects. In part because of the United States' odd attitudes to taxing profits earned abroad, countries like the UK, Australia, and New Zealand have found it difficult to prise tax dollars out of international tech companies. The New Zealand Herald's calculation is that if Apple were paying tax according to its reported margins, its bill over a decade would be north of $350 million. ® Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register IRS kills off PINs citing increasing suspicious activity Pulls plug early 14 Comments The IRS spaffed $12m on Office 365 subscription IT NEVER USED Taxman can audit all your accounts, but can't tell cloud from on-premises 38 Comments Apple ordered to cough up $2m to store workers after denying rest breaks Now, each of you, take this check for $95 and get the hell out of my sight 35 Comments Microsoft slaps Apple Gatekeeper-like controls on Windows 10: Install only apps from store Configurable switch on software spotted in latest Insider build 68 Comments Thief dresses as Apple Store drone, walks off with $16,000 in iGear 'Genius Bar' didn't quite live up to its name this time 73 Comments IRS 'inadvertently' wiped hard drive Microsoft demanded in audit row Sure, we'd love to help your case against us.

As noted by CNBC, Munster today spoke on the effect the upcoming iPhone 8 could have on the market, saying the device will lead to a “paradigm shift.” Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Munster explained that because of the iPhone 8 will feature “augmented reality as its foundation,” the device will lead to a “paradigm shift” in the computing industry: It’s not gonna be something that’s going to be a catalyst for Apple’s sales over the next few years, but that’s going to lay the foundation of the next computing paradigm. We think Apple has a lead in terms of this paradigm shift coming in computing. Munster goes on to explain that the combination of Apple’s lead in augmented reality technology, as well as its ever-growing Services business makes it one of the top technology stocks right now. “You start to get more comfortable when you put together the services side of the business on top of the augmented reality side,” Munster said. On other the hand, tech investor Paul Meeks sat opposite of Munster on CNBC and explained that he isn’t as big of a fan of AAPL right now. He explained that when he looks at Apple’s Services business, he needs to see “more cloud and more content” before he truly buys into the potential of the business. Earlier today, a Bloomberg report offered more details on Apple’s augmented reality plans. The report claimed that in the interim, Apple has “hundreds of engineers” devoted to the technology, including some from the iPhone camera team. The goal here is reportedly to add “AR-related features for the iPhone.” Furthermore, the long-term goal here is to reportedly release “AR-enhanced glasses.” Munster isn’t the only analyst to speak highly of AAPL in recent weeks. Analysts at Citi increased their target price for AAPL from $140 to $160 based on iPhone 8 rumors, while Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities expects Apple’s new iPhone 8 to significantly impact the supply chain this year. Furthermore, Kate Huberty at Morgan Stanley recently stated that she doesn’t think Wall Street realizes the full potential of the upcoming iPhone 8.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 20, 2017 at 8:01PM We already know that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is extremely interested in augmented reality (AR) thanks to a string of comments made by CEO Tim Cook over the past year or so. Given Cook's statements, it should be obvious that the company is working on something in AR; what's less clear is how Apple plans to create and deliver AR experiences. Will it be a function of future iPhones? Perhaps a new hardware product designed specifically for AR? Probably both. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman now has new details on the Mac maker's AR ambitions. Tim Cook hopes augmented reality will be Apple's next big thing. Image source: Apple. With our powers combined Unsurprisingly, Apple has already assembled a team of experienced hardware and software engineers, while also tapping "talented outsiders," according to the report. The team includes engineers who have worked on Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift and Microsoft's HoloLens. Some special effects artists from the movie industry are supposedly even in the mix. The company has also made a handful of AR-related acquisitions to accelerate its efforts, such as the 2015 purchase of AR start-up Metaio or the 2016 acquisition of spatial perception start-up Flyby, among others. Gurman believes that Apple AR glasses will launch after Apple attempts to include AR functions into future iPhones. The challenge will be keeping the form factor thin and light while being able to deliver compelling experiences. For this reason, AR glasses may be tethered to the iPhone, which has more processing power and can transmit data to AR glasses wirelessly. Keeping costs down will also be important, since the inevitable price point needs to be justifiable to mainstream consumers. Mike Rockwell, a former executive at Dolby, is reportedly in charge of the team. Rockwell reports to hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio. The report also details many other members of the team, and a diverse range of experiences and skill sets that will contribute to Apple's AR vision. This all comes shortly after IDC recently predicted that while virtual reality (VR) may be the early winner in the AR/VR race, AR very likely has greater revenue opportunities over the long term. In other AR news Facebook may be prioritizing VR with Oculus, but a report yesterday from Business Insider details some of the social network's other hardware projects within its Building 8 division. Facebook has been ramping its hardware efforts, and has no less than four projects that it is currently pursuing, notably including one that involves cameras and AR. The company is betting big that the next big computing revolution will come in the form of VR and/or AR, and being relatively new on the tech behemoth scene, it is determined to help shape the technology. Once upon a time, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the poster child for AR with Google Glass. While Google Glass flopped on the consumer front, NPR reports that Google Glass is still very much in use in industrial settings. Manufacturing companies are exploring ways to improve productivity with Google Glass and AR, which allow workers to access more information more easily while still being able to use their hands. Workers previously used tablets, but wearable AR technology delivers many of the same benefits. In the coming years, the AR front is going to get a whole lot more exciting -- and crowded.

The Apple boss probably does now. Mr Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardising its winning formula elsewhere, Mr Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: He’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Mr Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Mr Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. His first product was the Subor gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo’s classic Entertainment System. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Mr Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Mr Duan said. Mr Cook said last weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China — not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Mr Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

The company’s own System Status webpage was the tip-off, and since Apple always takes its store offline ahead of product releases the interent is flipping out over the possibility of something new showing up on the page. Apple’s online store will be down from 3 AM until 8:30 AM eastern time (or 1 AM to 6:30 AM mountain time) on Tuesday The Apple System Status page lists all current and scheduled service down times, including the Apple Online Store. In this case, it shows the store unavailable from 3 AM until 8:30 AM eastern time, which coincides with the down time we typically see when new products or refreshes come out. Speculation on what’s in store ranges from a Product(RED) iPhone to updated iMacs, to the rumored 10.5-inch iPad. While a completely new iPad doesn’t sound like the sort of thing Apple would release without a media event, a RED iPhone or refreshed iMac is totally plausible. Still, Apple likes its surprises and telegraphing a product update the day before it’s announced doesn’t seem like the sort of thing the company would overlook. That means it’s just as likely the store is going offline for backend ser Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple Store, offline, web One Comment Add a comment geoduck March 20, 2017 The other thing is that product refreshes usually take just a few minutes. Sometimes it goes down and they wait an hour or two for the Keynote to finish, but otherwise they can do it very quickly. This is a five and a half hour outage. Strikes me as far more likely that they are making major changes to infrastructure. Also I understand that online Phoptos services will be impacted as well. This all points to back end upgrades and service. March 20, 2017 at 5:46 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The Verge reported the album was streamed 89.9 million times on the first day. That was not only a record-setting debut, it crushed Spotify’s first-day totals for the album of 61.3 million streams. That’s significant, because that was itself a record for the larger streaming service. The cover of Drake’s More Life Drake’s previous album—Views, released in May of 2016—was the record holder. Among other things, it was the first album to get a billion streams. Apple Music vs. Spotify Apple Music has lagged behind Spotify for users from the get go. The latter has some 50 million paying subscribers, compared to somewhere north of 20 million for Apple. Spotify also has legions of non-paying users of its service. That makes Apple Music’s performance quite the accomplishment for Apple, and it was likely helped by Drake’s debut of the album on OVO Sound Radio on Beats 1. The Verge reported that Apple said it was also a record day for any Beats 1 show. Apple has been pursuing a strategy of cosy relations with top acts, including promotions with various Beats 1 shows. That hasn’t allowed the company to catch up to the older Spotify, but it’s clear Apple’s audience is engaged. Monday’s news will also eventually be seen as another milestone in the streamification of the music industry.

This has sparked speculation that the company could unveil new devices tomorrow without a press event. The online Apple Store will go down at 3:00 am and remain under maintenance until 8:30 am. The store would be back up just in time for a morning announcement from the company. Apple Online Store - Upcoming Maintenance Tomorrow, 3:00 AM - 8:30 AM All users will be affected The Apple Store will be updated and unavailable during this time. Notably, recent reports have suggested that Apple may release a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro without a special event. Apple is also believed to be unveiling a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro mini, 10.5-inch iPad Pro with slim bezels, and an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro in the near future.

Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks to members of the media at an event in 2015. (Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images) Mark GurmanBloomberg Privacy Policy Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple's chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR's game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all "have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you." Investors impatient for Apple's next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company's plans say Apple has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses — an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. As previously reported by Bloomberg, Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content — movies, maps and more — to the wearer. While the glasses are a ways off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It's an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80 percent to $165 billion by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. "It's something they need to do to continue to grow," he says, "and defend against the shift in how people use hardware." Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it's less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be "enclosed in something." Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn't a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they'll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key too. If Apple's AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multi-disciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who's in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. "He's a really sharp guy," says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. "He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going." Last spring, in a sign that it's serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell's team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say: Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple's first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. "To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments," Munster says. "Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off." Bloomberg's Alex Webb and Mark Bergen contributed. Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Apple Inc.

Echoing previous reports, Bloomberg said Apple is working on augmented-reality glasses, but it also said Apple plans to integrate augmented reality features into the next iPhone.

The scheduled downtime is due to a period of “Upcoming Maintenance,” that Apple says will take place on Tuesday, March 21 – between the hours of 7:00 AM – 12:30 PM (London). “All users will be affected,” the company notes in its pre-warning of the maintenance period, as the firm reiterates that the online store will be “updated and unavailable during this time.” The announcement has renewed speculation that surfaced earlier this month which suggested the company may be planning to introduce new products, as soon as this week. … and while any major changes to Apple’s product line would likely require a media event, (like the one yet to be confirmed but said to be happening – next month), it is possible that we will see some small spec bumps to the firm’s current Mac and iPad line-ups, come Tuesday afternoon. UPDATE Ahead of today’s potential product announcements the Apple Online Store is as expected down – this morning, with the regular “We can’t wait to show you what we have in store” holding message. Last time the store went down for a period of maintenance, it was unavailable for about 6 hours. Today’s maintenance session is expected to last a little less, at 5.5 hours.

By Corazon Victorino On 03/20/17 AT 7:04 PM Close The next major update for macOS Sierra is not ready for release yet, but developers and beta testers can already have a glimpse of what the official software update would be like. Apple just released the eighth beta of update 10.12.4, and it comes with features and tweaks that will be fully implemented once the final version is out.  Just like the seventh beta version, this new pre-release software does not come with big changes save for the previously outed ones by the earlier betas. In fact, the difference in the build numbers of the seventh and eighth betas is only one digit — from 16E191a to 16E192b, as per Apple Insider. Given this small increment, it will not come as a surprise when developers and beta testers find no visible changes when the new beta is installed. As previously reported, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 will be an update that introduces Night Shift to the Mac devices. The display mode was first launched in iOS when iOS 9.3 was released. Night Shift for Mac will change the way Apple computers behave at certain times of the day. The display will shift from the usual blue color to yellow to reduce the user’s exposure to the former when it is already nighttime. The blue light in the display panels of laptops was found to disrupt the circadian rhythm, so Apple intends to eliminate the sleeping problems this disruption typically leads to.  According to MacRumors, the 10.12.4 update will also bring dictation support for Shanghainese language, Siri support for cricket scores, improved PDFKit APIs as well as iCloud Analytics options. The cricket scores will be generated from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. As for the new iCloud Analytics options, previous betas revealed that this simply pertains to how iCloud Analytics has become an opt-in step during setup.  As per usual, the new beta software comes with bug fixes and improved implementations of the macOS Sierra features. Finally, given the short interval between the new betas — the seventh beta was released four days ago — it’s clear that the Cupertino giant is close to launching update 10.12.4 to public users.  A new beta version of the upcoming macOS Sierra update has been released.

With 89.9 million streams on Apple Music during its first 24 hours of availability, More Life was significantly more popular on Apple's streaming service than on Spotify, where it was streamed 61.3 million times. The 61.3 million number was also a record for Spotify. Apple Music has far fewer users than Spotify, hitting 20 million subscribers in December of 2016. Spotify recently announced that it has 50 million paying subscribers, but when counting those who listen to the company's free tier, Spotify has over 100 million subscribers. More Life, released on Saturday, also set records on Apple's Beats 1 radio service, marking the biggest Beats 1 show in its history. More Life was not an Apple Music exclusive this time around, but Drake's previous album, Views, also set Apple Music records when it was released. Views was the first album to reach over 1 billion streams on Apple Music.

It took over, evolved with every generation. It will be here for a while before a new form takes over. Er no it won't. I don't actually know anyone that likes any of it (and I am not just making that up). Rap/hip-hop isn't really music in the same sense that rock and roll was/is.

Rap/hip-hop isn't really music in the same sense that rock and roll was/is. Most of them don't play any instruments. Took over? Come on. You have a narrow and old-fashioned view of what qualifies as a musical instrument. In my book, anything that can be used to create a sound which can then be creatively manipulated is a musical instrument. That includes the genre's staple piece of kit - an Akai MPC of some flavour - and a Mac or PC. Samplers like the MPC's allowed the artist to turn any everyday object or found sound into a potential music making object (as did tape decades earlier). Experimentation like that has been going on since humans started crudely banging on fallen logs with their hands. I find this narrow view of what qualifies as music, or what qualifies as a musical instrument quite bizarre. Rating: 2 Votes WRChris 3 days ago at 04:28 pm I know it was a day one record. Also, I assuming the reason why there are a lot of hip-hop and/or rap songs in the top charts is because I'm guessing there were a good chunk of Drake fans that stuck around after "Views" came out last year. I'm not doubting that genre of music is popular, I just don't understand how 7+ songs from this just released album is already in the top 10 on Apple Music. Maybe I'm just over thinking it and it's as simple as Apple pushes drake on us because he works for them. Rating: 2 Votes 2010mini 3 days ago at 06:17 pm Er no it won't. I don't actually know anyone that likes any of it (and I am not just making that up). Rap/hip-hop isn't really music in the same sense that rock and roll was/is. Most of them don't play any instruments. Took over? Come on. Your anecdotal experience doesn't count. Take a harder look at culture from the 80s onward and you will find hip hop influences all over the globe. As I've said hip hop, like rock and roll has evolved over the decades. Hip hop is music in the same sense as rock and roll. Stop limiting yourself and open your mind. Personally I don't listen to hip hop. But I am not blind to its influences Rating: 2 Votes now i see it 3 days ago at 03:57 pm Why would anyone but Eddy Cue care about this stat?

Nevertheless, “More Life” set records on Apple’s streaming service, while also besting performance on Spotify… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case According to The Verge, “More Life” was streamed 89.9 million times on Apple Music during the first 24 hours of availability. This number “shatters” the previous record for streams in 24 hours on Apple Music, which is believed to be held by Drake’s last album, “Views.” Additionally, the performance of “More Life” on Apple Music significantly outpaced the performance of the project on Spotify. On Spotify, “More Life” was streamed 61.3 million times in the first 24 hours of availability, some 28.6 million fewer times than on Apple Music. Nevertheless, “More Life” bested previous Spotify records and is now holds the title of most streams in 24 hours. In this case, Drake bested Ed Sheeran’s latest album, which was streamed 56.7 million times in the first 24 hours of its availability. The Verge also notes that Drake’s “More Life” set records on Beats 1, as well. This weekend’s episode of “OVO Sound Radio,” where Drake premiered “More Life,” was the biggest Beats 1 show to date. It’s unclear how many listeners tuned in, however. The fact that streams for “More Life” on Apple Music bested streams on Spotify is notable considering the difference in subscribers between the two platforms. Apple Music, according to the latest statistics made available by Apple, has “well past” 20 million subscribers. Spotify, on the other hand, was recently revealed to have 50 million paying subscribers. The most interesting part of this to me, however, is the Beats 1 tidbit. I’d be really interested in hearing more about how many listeners tuned in to “OVO Sound Radio” this weekend. Apple has been relatively quiet regarding Beats 1 listener numbers, leading some to question the success of the always-on platform. Drake has been a big part of Apple Music since the service’s unveil. Recently, Drake and Apple partnered for the the use of his and Future’s song “Jumpman” in an Apple Music ad starring Taylor Swift. The ad reportedly drove sales of Drake’s music up over 400 percent in iTunes. Despite Apple not gaining exclusivity to “More Life,” this is good news for the company. Apple will likely use these statistics as a measure of comparing its reach to the reach of Spotify, despite the 30 million + difference paying subscribers.

Mariana Mazzucato's 2013 book, "The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths," is required reading in the office of Navdeep Bains, and offers a glimpse at some of the ideas behind Ottawa's so-called innovation strategy. On Wednesday, the Trudeau government's second budget will provide additional details of its plan to foster an innovation economy across all industries as a means of recharging Canada's long-term economic growth. Bains, who as economic development minister has been overseeing Canada's innovation agenda, has had discussions with Mazzucato. Her concepts have significantly influenced both him and his policy team, insiders say. Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, seeks to dispel the belief that innovation only happens in a free-market setting, with the public sector staying well out of the way. She says risk-wary private-sector investors are often ill at ease with unfamiliar new technology, and points to success stories like Apple's iPhone as evidence of what can happen when governments make bold, early investments. Indeed, when it comes to Mazzucato's book, Bains's office has paid particular attention to Chapter 5: "The State Behind the iPhone." In it, she writes that U.S. government support was at the root of many of the technologies found in Apple's popular iPod, iPhone and iPad devices. The early development behind what eventually became known as Apple's virtual personal assistant, Siri, was a direct result of support from government investment and research, she argues. Enabling companies to take risks with emerging technologies is "much easier in a country in which the state plays the pivotal serious role of taking on the development of high-risk investments" until the private sector gets involved, Mazzucato writes. "Thus, while 'free market' pundits continue to warn of the danger of government 'picking winners,' it can be said that various U.S. government policies laid the foundation that provided Apple with the tools to become a major industry player in one of the most dynamic high-tech industries of the 21st century so far." Those who argue against "picking winners" often overlook an important fact, Mazzucato adds: States that are seen to "fail" are usually aiming at a goal far more difficult than those attempted by private firms — launching a new technology like the Internet, for instance. "While the role of the private sector has typically been hyped up," she writes, "the public sector's role has been hyped down." When it comes to industrial policy, some of Ottawa's most influential economic advisers have recommended it take more of a hands-on approach in order to boost growth. Last month, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's economic advisory council called on the government to identify between six and eight key sectors "where Canada has a strong endowment, untapped potential, and significant global growth prospects." From there, the report suggested Ottawa focus on carefully designed policy actions, such as deregulation and boosting skilled labour, for each industry to make the most of their opportunities. The report listed several industries: agriculture and food, energy and renewables, mining and metals, health care and life sciences, advanced manufacturing, financial services, tourism and education. It remains to seen if the government will specifically target policies and funding to what it considers as key sectors. The council, chaired by Dominic Barton, managing director of global consulting giant McKinsey & Co., has helped guide the Trudeau government's policy direction in the past. The advisers also recommended Ottawa take on a bigger role by assembling "innovation marketplaces" that unite entrepreneurs and researchers with public and private customers. They said the marketplaces should be centres of technology and industrial activity that are driven by the private sector. The Liberal government is expected to hold a competition when it follows through on its $800-million commitment in last year's budget to support "innovation networks and clusters." The plan is part of Ottawa's central goal to help budding firms scale up into global players. The funding will support researchers, post-secondary institutions and companies that can persuade Ottawa they're best positioned to help young, high-potential firms prosper.

The emulator, known as Giovanni (named after the infamous Team Rocket villain from the Pokémon game), is built out of an existing iOS emulator called Gambatte. But O'Flaherty-Chan has managed to use that as a starting point and build out the watchOS version from there, although he notes that the Apple Watch lacks support for OpenGL or Metal, which made it a little difficult to write the pixels to the screen. O'Flaherty-Chan has also managed to cleverly work his way around replicating the Game Boy’s controls using the Apple Watch’s limited button set. The D-pad is replaced with panning on the touchscreen, the A button by tapping on a screen, and the Start, Select, and B buttons with virtual counterparts. The digital crown can also be used for scrolling through lists, and the whole thing actually looks fairly usable for controlling a game. Giovanni’s biggest limitation (aside from the fact that Apple would never allow such an app to be disseminated through official App Store channels) is the limited hardware of the Apple Watch itself. Even on the most recent Series 2 hardware, the emulator is only able to play games at a fraction of the speed of an actual Game Boy. But that could be solved by Apple simply releasing a more powerful version of the Apple Watch, which logic dictates would likely happen eventually. For now, it’s an interesting proof of concept that serves as a reminder of what the miniature computers we wear around every day are capable of. O'Flaherty-Chan has made Giovanni available as an open-source project on GitHub, if you’ve got the technical know-how and want to try it out for yourself.

This iPhone 8 concept design is the best we've seen yet — check it out Nick Vega Mar. 21, 2017, 9:43 AM 380,318 facebook linkedin twitter email print Gabor Balogh This fall, Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPhone. And because 2017 marks 10 years since Steve Jobs first introduced the revolutionary Apple product, expectations are high.  Predictions for what new features Apple might introduce with the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or iPhone X) are wide-ranging. However, the consensus seems to be that augmented reality is the new frontier for smartphones, and Apple reportedly has "hundreds" of people currently working on ways to bring AR into the mainstream.  With the expected September launch of the new iPhone still half a year away, enterprising designers have taken it upon themselves to create concepts of what the next iPhone might look like.  One of our favorite concepts comes from Budapest-based product designer Gábor Balogh. Check it out: View As: One Page Slides Balogh's iPhone 8 concept features a beautiful edge-to-edge screen that many analysts predict will make its debut in 2017. Gabor Balogh Despite having the same footprint as an iPhone 7, Balogh's edge-to-edge screen makes the device seem much larger. His concept also features a dynamic background that changes based on whatever the phone's camera is pointed at.  More impressive, however, is his interpretation of how Siri would use augmented reality to answer context and location-based questions. Gabor Balogh In Balogh's iPhone 8 concept, the dynamic background comes in handy when you ask Siri a question, as the virtual assistant will be able to recognize landmarks and locations around you to tell you what you need to know.  Here's where AR could be truly helpful: Balogh foresees an iPhone that will take the guesswork out of following tricky directions on Apple or Google Maps. Gabor Balogh Here, the augmented reality would use your camera to present you with an easy-to-follow blue line that will take you all the way to your destination.  Since apps towards the top of the iPhone screen can be difficult to reach, the problem would only be exacerbated by an edge-to-edge screen. This iPhone 8 concept counters that issue by shifting the apps down towards the home button. Gabor Balogh Last but not least, this iPhone 8 concept also pictures future AR integration with the Health app, so that you can simply point your phone at someone and ask Siri how they are. Gabor Balogh It's a stretch, but what's a concept without some wishful thinking? The iPhone 8 event isn't expected to take place until September, but these concepts are getting us excited for the future of the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim CookREUTERS/Stephen Lam There will be countless rumors between now and then, and only time will tell how close they end up being, but we hope Apple takes note.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Indeed, when it comes to Mazzucato's book, Bains's office has paid particular attention to Chapter 5: "The State Behind the iPhone." In it, she writes that U.S. government support was at the root of many of the technologies found in Apple's popular iPod, iPhone and iPad devices. The early development behind what eventually became known as Apple's virtual personal assistant, Siri, was a direct result of support from government investment and research, she argues. Enabling companies to take risks with emerging technologies is "much easier in a country in which the state plays the pivotal serious role of taking on the development of high-risk investments" until the private sector gets involved, Mazzucato writes. "Thus, while 'free market' pundits continue to warn of the danger of government 'picking winners,' it can be said that various U.S. government policies laid the foundation that provided Apple with the tools to become a major industry player in one of the most dynamic high-tech industries of the 21st century so far." Those who argue against "picking winners" often overlook an important fact, Mazzucato adds: States that are seen to "fail" are usually aiming at a goal far more difficult than those attempted by private firms — launching a new technology like the Internet, for instance. "While the role of the private sector has typically been hyped up," she writes, "the public sector's role has been hyped down." When it comes to industrial policy, some of Ottawa's most influential economic advisers have recommended it take more of a hands-on approach in order to boost growth. Last month, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's economic advisory council called on the government to identify between six and eight key sectors "where Canada has a strong endowment, untapped potential, and significant global growth prospects." From there, the report suggested Ottawa focus on carefully designed policy actions, such as deregulation and boosting skilled labour, for each industry to make the most of their opportunities. The report listed several industries: agriculture and food, energy and renewables, mining and metals, health care and life sciences, advanced manufacturing, financial services, tourism and education. It remains to seen if the government will specifically target policies and funding to what it considers as key sectors. The council, chaired by Dominic Barton, managing director of global consulting giant McKinsey & Co., has helped guide the Trudeau government's policy direction in the past. The advisers also recommended Ottawa take on a bigger role by assembling "innovation marketplaces" that unite entrepreneurs and researchers with public and private customers. They said the marketplaces should be centres of technology and industrial activity that are driven by the private sector. The Liberal government is expected to hold a competition when it follows through on its $800-million commitment in last year's budget to support "innovation networks and clusters." The plan is part of Ottawa's central goal to help budding firms scale up into global players. The funding will support researchers, post-secondary institutions and companies that can persuade Ottawa they're best positioned to help young, high-potential firms prosper.

 Here’s how Apple’s iPhone sales break down by region Jeff Dunn Mar. 20, 2017, 5:42 PM 3,953 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Apple last week announced its plans to set up two new R&D centers in China, its latest effort to boost its standing in the world’s second-largest economy. The company said it’ll invest more than $500 million in research in the country. The commitment to China could help Apple curry favor with local officials. Either way, as this chart from Statista shows, any boost would be a big help for the iPhone maker. Though China remains by far the second-biggest market for Apple’s flagship product after huge gains a few years back, its sales have cooled significantly over the past year. Analysts at UBS expect it to be the one major region where iPhone sales keep falling in 2017.  In lieu of the iPhone, Chinese consumers have flocked to increasingly competitive (and typically more affordable) devices from local brands like Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo. Beyond those more traditional opponents, though, Apple’s success in China may also be affected by President Trump back home. As everyone waits to see how Trump follows through on his staunch, "America First" trade rhetoric, it’s no wonder that Apple CEO Tim Cook effectively defended globalization in a speech in China last week. He has a lot on the line. Business Insider/Mike Nudelman/Statista EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Mac owners wanting a new Surface device now have a… Mac owners wanting a new Surface device now have a free tool for easy migration By Kevin Parrish — March 20, 2017 12:01 PM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you For Mac owners eyeing a Surface from Microsoft, the company now provides an easy way to move their data and settings over to the new device. Mac owners wanting to purchase one of Microsoft’s Surface devices now have a tool to make the data migration quick and painless. Called the Mac to Surface Assistant (DMG file), it’s freely available for moving everything over to a Surface device spanning pictures to applications to locally stored files synced with Creative Cloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox. The latest Surface-branded devices from Microsoft are the Surface Book “with Performance Base” ($1,300 starting), the Surface Pro 4 ($700 starting), and the Surface Studio all-in-one PC ($3,000 starting). Prior to offering the new migration tool, Microsoft provided lengthy, step-by-step instructions on how to move photos, files, and mail from a Mac to its family of Surface-branded products. More: With Windows 10 Creators Update around the corner, Microsoft keeps fixing bugs Microsoft’s new tool is the company’s latest move to lure customers away from Apple. In addition to targeting designers and architects with the new Surface Studio all-in-one PC in October, the company also dished out a $650 trade-in discount to Mac owners to apply toward a new Surface device. Microsoft even provides a dedicated website for Apple customers who are considering a move to the Surface family. According to Microsoft, its Surface products work great with Apple’s devices and services. The site provides a FAQ to answer questions such as syncing an iPhone to a new Surface device, where to find the migrated applications, how to use keyboard shortcuts, where to find the system settings, and more. Microsoft even talks about all the concern regarding Windows-based machines catching a nasty virus. “Your Surface comes with Windows Defender and Windows Firewall to help protect you from malware, so you don’t need to purchase antivirus software,” the company states. “Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC.” The website introduces Windows 10 to long-time Mac users as well. The tour starts with creating a Microsoft Account, checking out the desktop and Start Menu, and learning how to get around Microsoft’s latest operating system. There are quick instructions on how to use the Surface Pen, too, followed by a detailed manual right here. However, getting customers to jump the Apple ship may be an impossible feat. The malware-based issue surrounding Windows-based PCs is just one example, but Apple’s MacOS has also served as the main platform for Adobe’s Illustrator and Photoshop programs since the late 1980s and early 1990s. While these are currently offered for Windows along with other utilities in Adobe’s Creative Suite portfolio, Mac devices seemingly serve as “home base” for many designers and architects. Regardless of the Windows versus MacOS debate, there are customers who may be considering a Surface device, and the new tool should make the migration process an easy move. The tool scans the Mac device and provides a simple checklist for transferring select data and settings. It requires an external drive that is larger in capacity than the storage unit used for the Mac.

Apple Music far outpaced Spotify, which streamed the album 61.3 million times in its first day, a record for the service. More Life also helped set records on Beats 1, as Saturday’s episode of OVO Sound Radio was the biggest Beats 1 show to date. Outpacing Spotify by nearly 30 million streams is no easy feat — especially with about 80 million fewer users — but it looks like Drake’s ties to Apple Music and his radio show on Beats 1 helped push listeners to the service in droves. As for the top song? “Free Smoke” the first song off the playlist took the top spot on Apple Music. “Portland” and “Passionfruit” round out the top three tracks. More Life is on pace to shatter every streaming record to date — most of which were set by Views, Drake’s last album.

With time running out for a March event to happen, it’s increasingly possible that Apple could be planning to quietly release updates to some products with no event and minimal fanfare. And based on hints coming from Apple’s own website, it could happen tomorrow morning. As MacRumors spotted, Apple’s system status page currently shows that the Apple Store will be down tomorrow morning from 3.00AM to 8.30AM. The Apple Store traditionally goes down before new products are announced; 8.30AM is also a common time for Apple to send out press releases. Combine that with the rumors that have been swirling about product updates, and it’s definitely time to be suspicious. Don't Miss: Siri has a very unfortunate response when you ask it for prostitutes So, what’s Tim Cook & Co got cooking? The likeliest new product that wouldn’t merit a launch event would be a spec-bumped version of the iPhone SE. We’ve been hearing that Apple might be updating it to include a 128GB storage option, bringing it in line with other new iPhones. It’s also very possible that other minor components get an update, like moving to the second-generation Touch ID sensor or a newer camera module. The iPhone SE was launched this time last year, so an update at this point would make sense, but changing the physical design and form factor wouldn’t. Moreover, with the launch of an iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 both expected in September, it wouldn’t make sense for Apple to release a splashy new design in spring, which would potentially cannibalize iPhone 8 sales in the fall. But on the other hand, Samsung is launching its latest and greatest on March 29th, and releasing a new handset at the same time would be a classically trolly move from Apple. Other good guesses for spec-bumped products would be updated iPads, which we were all half-expecting to see at an event this spring. It would be uncharacteristic for Apple to launch a brand-new iPad size (as had been rumored) without a launch event, but a spec bump and slimming-down of the current lineup would make sense. There’s also the Mac line to consider. Although the MacBook Pro just got a once-in-a-generation overhaul, the iMac is due a minor update, and Intel’s recently-released Kaby Lake processors are yet to find their way inside.

Since the launch of iOS 10 and the iMessage App Store in September 2016, nearly 5,000 apps have been listed. While that’s a rate of growth on par with the iOS app ecosystem, new app growth is slowing, according to Sensor Tower analysis. Games and entertainment make up more than 40 percent of the iMessage App Store. Other popular app categories include social networking (6.4 percent), photo and video (5.4 percent), and utilities (9.2 percent). The best apps in the iMessage App Store can be hard to find because there are so many stickers. “Top Paid” and “Top Grossing” categories are almost entirely stickers. For example, 99 of the top 100 in the Top Paid category of the iMessage App Store right now are stickers. (Maybe that’s why Apple released an iMessage ad about stickers last week.) To unearth the best of what the iMessage App Store has to offer, we looked through the “Top Free” category of the iMessage App Store to see what’s available six months after launch. Above: GamePigeon iMessage app Sitting at No. 1, GamePigeon may very well be the most popular app in the iMessage App Store. It includes nine different games, from flicking basketball shots with your thumb to board games, mini golf, and poker you can play with friends. No. 2 in the Top Free category is the Giphy iMessage app, a great tool for inundating family and friends with your favorite memes on repeat. Double-tap GIFs to add them to your favorites. GIF Keyboard is also listed among the top 10 iMessage free apps. Above: Fam iMessage app At No. 3 is group video chat app Fam, which allows users to speak with up to 16 people at once inside iMessage. Once inside Fam users can draw, play games, and do trivia in a live video chat. Fam was previously listed by VentureBeat among some of the best iMessage apps in 2016. Given the spread of video chat to most messaging apps in the past year, perhaps Apple will offer its own group video chat option with iOS 11 to compete with apps like Fam. Until then, enjoy the app from Boston-based startup Smack. Above: Cobi Hoops screenshot The best part of the game Let’s Puck It!, a game of classic pong at No. 4 on the list, is that every time a person initiates a game, they get a challenge: Loser has to do whatever challenge the winner has filled in the blank. Then they pong it out for the win. Games and stickers round out the top 10 free iMessages apps. Games with Friends, similar to GamePigeon, lets users play beer pong, Skee-Ball, and 14 other games from Zynga. Other games sometimes found in the top 10 include Mr. Putt, 8 Ball Pool, and Cobi Hoops. Apps worth trying beyond the top 10: * Tumblr app extension makes GIFs. Be sure to turn on live photos if you’re going to use this app extension. Above: The Weather Channel iMessage app * The Weather Channel iMessage app looks up and shares with one tap the single day, five-day, and weekend forecast for cities around the world. * Some popular games are pretty rudimentary, like Four in A Row and Rock, Paper, Scissors. Fast Thumbs literally measures how fast users can type and gives them a fat thumbs penalty. Might seem strange that people enjoy typing “Starboy” or “Too Much Sauce” as fast as they can, but many of the popular iMessage games — like Boggle and Words with Friends — are word games. Above: EatMessage iMessage app * The EatMessage game challenges you to eat virtual emojis. Using your camera, it gives you a virtual mouth for a cartoon monkey to throw food into. Share the game in iMessage and compete with friends. Each round ends with the monkey taking a pretty unflattering selfie. * Truth or Dare iMessage app will send random dares like “Text your parents asking for condoms” and truth questions like “Would you rather be an ugly genius or a hot moron.” The app also has Never Have I Ever, Would You Rather, and College, and holiday editions available. Want to try any of these apps? Here are instructions, because the iMessage App Store is so hard to find. First, open iMessage, then open a message, tap the gray arrow in the left hand corner, then tap the App Store icon (listed alongside drawing and camera icons), then tap the four gray dots in the bottom left hand corner, then tap the plus sign with “Store” written underneath it. Oh, and if you leave the story at any time, you have to start all over. Above: The elusive iMessage App Store ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook took a look at secretive billion-dollar startup Magic Leap Kif Leswing Mar. 20, 2017, 5:05 PM 7,792 facebook linkedin twitter email print Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz (left) and Apple CEO Tim Cook Reuters/Getty Here's one big sign that Apple is serious about developing a pair of smartglasses: CEO Tim Cook visited Magic Leap's offices last summer to check out their augmented reality technology, former Magic Leap employees said.  Cook has been signaling that the company is working on AR, and eventually a pair of smartglasses as Apple's "next big thing." AR, an emerging technology, integrates computer graphics into the real world. Magic Leap is a secretive billion-dollar startup working on a headset and the company is widely seen as one of the leaders in the burgeoning field. Bloomberg first reported the Magic Leap meeting with Cook in a in-depth look at Apple's AR plans.  Cook isn't the only VIP to check out Magic Leap's secretive headset. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is on Magic Leap's board of directors, and the people said that Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz loves to give demos to investors, entertainers, and other important figures.  For example, Beyoncé has tried the Magic Leap headset, Business Insider previously reported. Apart from celebrities, "everyone in the valley has tried Magic Leap," one of the people said. Nearly everyone who tries the headset is asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement, although its unclear if Cook received a full demo.  Magic Leap declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for more information. Magic Leap was put in touch with Apple through Allen & Co, a boutique investment bank, one person said. Abovitz and Cook both attended Allen & Co's Sun Valley conference last year. Magic Leap has raised $1.4 billion from investors, valuing the company at $4.5 billion.  Magic Leap gives demos all the time. Since a board meeting presentation seen as a major milestone in February, the company has shown its secretive technology demo to investors and potential content partners, such as the PGA Tour and other sports leagues.  So, a while ago I said that seeing Magic Leap was the coolest thing I'd seen since the iPhone. It's now much cooler than that. — Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) March 16, 2017 Know anything about Magic Leap and its relationship with Apple (or Google)?

That’s when the company is holding its f8 developer conference in San Jose, California — an event that could double as a coming out for Facebook’s secretive “Building 8” R&D unit. Officially unveiled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April of 2016, Building 8 is tasked with building hardware products that “advance our mission of connecting the world,” as Zuckerberg put it. The group is headed by DARPA and Google veteran Regina Dugan, and has been working on four separate projects, including brain scanning, cameras, drones and augmented reality, according to a Business Insider report. Building 8 is expected to play a big role at f8, according to that report, and job listings indicate that the company has been hiring to sell hardware products in retail stores in the near future. Related Peter Jackson: Augmented Reality Will Be Bigger Than Mobile Apple’s augmented reality efforts may take a bit longer to reach consumers, but they could be just as ambitious, if not more so. The company has a group working on AR technology that includes former Oculus and HoloLens engineers, according to a new Bloomberg report. Some of the projects of that group include AR glasses that overlay digital imagery and information over a person’s view of the real world, as well as efforts to bring AR to the iPhone. Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge its AR work, but CEO Tim Cook has on multiple occasions talked enthusiastically about the potential of the technology. For Apple, AR wouldn’t just be an attempt to once again release a genre-defining product, something the company hasn’t been able to do since the release of the iPad in 2010. The company also wants to prevent to lose out in an area where others are making major investments. In addition to Facebook, AR has also gotten a lot of attention from Google, which already has AR-enabled phones in the market. Microsoft has also been an early pioneer in AR with its HoloLens headset, and is now looking to gain market share for devices that combine AR and VR. And then there is magic Leap, the much-hyped and heavily funded AR startup that is expected top unveil its first consumer hardware soon. All of these efforts suggest that many companies believe that AR could be the next big thing — and Apple and Facebook clearly don’t want to be left behind when the AR land grab begins.

Courtesy: Apple January 31st 2017 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Apple tipped to back augmented reality as it looks for the next big thing to follow the iPhone. Picture: AFP/Josh Edelson Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network APPLE has apparently picked its next big thing and the focus for the future, from smart phones to smart wearables, is augmented reality. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been spruiking the benefits of AR for a year, earlier this year calling it the technology “for everyone: and likely to have as big an impact as the iPhone. “I think that AR is that big,” he said. “It’s huge.” Last year, inspired by the success of Pokemon Go, he made similarly bold statements, saying that people would all “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day — it will become that much a part of you”. But a new report by leading Apple reporter Mark Gurman today shows just how much Cook is backing AR as the way ahead for Apple. Apple is expected to release AR features in the 10th anniversary iPhone 8, also being called the iPhone Edition, later this year. But Gurman reports that Apple has set up a special AR division, hiring experts and buying companies just as it did in the lead up to the Apple Watch release. Apple CEO Tim Cook shows off the latest iPhone to dancer Maddie Ziegler. Picture: AFP/Josh EdelsonSource:AFP The AR division reportedly includes hundreds of engineers and key people formally from the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality sets, 3D gaming companies and Hollywood special effects firms including Peter Jackson’s Weta Digital. Apple’s stock has hit a record high today with long-term analyst Gene Munster telling Bloomberg that AR would replace the iPhone in the long-term as Apple’s key moneymaker. The new report today follows recent leaks by KGI analyst Ming Chi-Kuo that the flagship iPhone this year would have a 3D camera that could make a model of a person’s face to be used with augmented reality applications. There was also a recent patent granted to Apple showing how augmented reality might revolutionise Apple Maps, adding a layer of GPS and factual information onto images of a scene. In another report today, a Korean news agency is reporting the new iPhone 8 will have a “water drop design” that will echo the original iPhone rather than the flatter designs of recent years.

When Apple introduced its latest MacBooks, some users complained that the new butterfly mechanism in the keys was a turnoff. They criticized the keyboard for its lack of travel, and said the experience of typing was not much different to tapping on a touch screen. Other users felt okay with the change. Whichever side people fell on the debate, everyone could agree that how a keyboard actually feels beneath the fingers matters a great deal. With the lofree Bluetooth keyboard, the designers have tried to re-imagine the typing process in a more radical way, by recreating the experience of operating a traditional typewriter, but in an elegant retro-modern design. The desirability of such a product is in no doubt – lofree's Indiegogo campaign set out to raise $10,000 over 30 days, but has already garnered $364,443 from over 4,000 backers, with several weeks to spare. We got a hold of a finished unit to see if the lofree keyboard can live up to expectations. Design and Features The first thing that struck me about the lofree was its sheer heft. At 800 grams, it's pretty heavy – the Apple Magic Keyboard is just 321 grams – but the extra weight has a stabilizing influence and adds to the retro feel. It features a sturdy rounded plastic base, with two rubber legs at the back that raise the keys high off the desk at a six degree angle. On the right-hand side of the keyboard is a micro-USB port for charging as well as for connecting in wired mode using the included cable. There's a switch next to the port to turn Bluetooth on/off. The second switch sets the keyboard for use on Mac/iOS or Windows/Android, but a quick look at the layout shows the lofree has been designed primarily with Apple users in mind. The functional layout on the top row houses the usual controls you'd expect of an Apple keyboard, like Mission Control, Launchpad, volume, and so on. However, overall the keys are more crowded, and there are some changes to the layout, the main one being the fact that the number key row lines up differently, so 1 is slightly right of Q, 2 is right of W, and so on. Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed key numbers 1, 2, and 3 all have Bluetooth symbols. These are used in combination with the fn key to quickly switch between up to three paired devices. The keycaps are raised off the base in pseudo-typewriter fashion, which makes the backlight one of the signature features of the keyboard's design. I found that in a dimly lit room, it gave each key a lovely muted corona, but if you find the bed of light too glaring you can dial down the intensity by choosing from three levels of brightness, or simply switch off the backlight altogether. To save battery, the light also sleeps if you don't use the keyboard for a few minutes, but they snap back on just as quickly with a tap. Instead of the squishy rubber membrane you'd find under most notebook keycaps, lofree has chosen to use Gateron Blue mechanical switches. The decision reflects lofree's attempt to mimic not only the look of a typewriter as closely as possible, but also the sound and the tactile sensation of hitting traditional typewriter keys. In practice, this means there's a slight bump when the key is actuated, more force is required, and there's a lot more travel when the key is fully depressed. The replaceable keycaps also have a concave shape to fit your fingers. Performance I had no trouble pairing the keyboard with my MacBook Pro, iPad, or iPhone. The lofree appeared in Bluetooth preferences as soon as I switched it on, and the LED beside the caps lock key flashed to confirm the connection. The ability to switch between devices worked well too, and I didn't experience any dropouts when testing the keyboard within a reasonable range. I type heavy-handed at the best of times, but tapping at the lofree's keys was enough to create an echo in the hallway leading to my office room. Gateron switches are loud and "clicky" compared to Apple keyboards, which is obviously why they were chosen. Whether you (or anyone within earshot) can get on with the sound will depend on taste as well as circumstance. Some people feel the continual clackety-clack has a focusing influence on the mind. Others are likely to find the din positively off-putting. As such, it's probably a bad idea to use the lofree in an open plan office, unless you really want to annoy your co-workers. The best place to use this keyboard is probably at home in a personal office or study with the door firmly closed. That said, such precautions are unlikely to muffle the volley of verbal abuse you may find yourself hurling at the lofree during your first few days together. The oddly aligned number keys certainly take some getting used to, but personally they were the least of my worries. On an Apple keyboard, the right shift key is a large oblong target in both US and UK layouts, but on the lofree, the right portion of this area is home to the up arrow key. This seemingly small change meant my little finger kept hitting the up arrow and taking me up a line instead of capping the next letter, which was incredibly frustrating. I kept having to look down at the keys to orient my fingers, making touch typing pretty impossible. Despite the early irritation though, I stuck with it, and within a week I was able to type up a few paragraphs without error. At the moment, the lofree is still sitting pretty, albeit connected to my iPad on a separate desk in another room. I've been using it to journal, reply to emails and tap out quick notes, but I continue to prefer a wireless Apple keyboard to do the majority of my work on my Mac. Typing on the lofree after a couple of hours started to fatigue my fingers a bit, which could be an RSI harbinger for some users. I didn't manage to drain the battery over seven days of use, but lofree claims that with the backlight set at low, the Bluetooth working time is around three weeks on a single charge, and that extends to around six months with the backlight off. (To compare, I've gotten about two months of real-world use out of a single charge on an Apple Magic Keyboard with no backlight). Bottom Line There's no denying the lofree's inviting looks – its retro aesthetic is an immediate eye-catcher that's sure to brighten up any computer desk or study space. As for invoking the bygone spirit of typewriting, it broadly accomplishes what it sets out to achieve. It's just a shame the tweaked layout distracts from your creative flow and forces you to relearn where certain keys are located. For those with nostalgia and patience in abundance, however, the lofree should prove a delightful keyboard to use in the long term. Pros Impressive retro design Beautiful adjustable backlight Supports switching between up to three paired devices Decent battery life Cons Some odd layout decisions More fatiguing on fingers Not great for touch typing Noisy compared to Apple keyboards How to Buy The lofree typewriter-inspired mechanical keyboard is available in pure white, turquoise blue, or sandstone black, and costs $79 for Indiegogo early adopters. According to lofree, the keyboard will retail for $129 and pre-order shipping will start immediately after the Indiegogo campaign ends. Note: lofree supplied the keyboard to MacRumors for the purposes of this review. No other compensation was received.

So, this keyboard offers an antiquated style with the fringe benefit of being mechanical. Can't say that's reason enough to be a 'good' product. Oh well. To each their own. I'll stick to Mathias Pro 4 with ALPS-inspired switches! Feels quite a lot like the Apple Extended Keyboard II, which is also lovely and works if you have an ADB to USB adapter. =) Rating: 1 Votes aleksoctop 3 days ago at 02:25 pm Why is the sound a con? The clickety clacks are a feature. They were trying to make a typewriter-like keyboard, not something to replace your bluetooth apple keyboard. This is a niche keyboard.

Monday, March 20, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Building a Hackintosh Pro Dan Counsell (tweet, Hacker News): If Apple made a mini tower that was upgradable and could take a full sized graphics card (or two), I’d have purchased it in a heartbeat. However, they don’t. There’s no doubt that Apple has a refresh for the desktop market in the works, I just don’t know if it’s going to be enough to satisfy the creative market who seem to be slowly migrating to Windows. […] Building a Hackintosh is not for everybody. It’s not a simple process, there is an overwhelming number of parts to choose from, and on top of this you need to pick the ones that are compatible. When you’ve built the machine you need to get macOS running on it, it’s not a quick process. If you want to do it, do your research and take your time. I’d probably say this build took me around 8 hours from unboxing the components to getting macOS installed. I’ve been running this machine for a couple of weeks now and I couldn’t be happier. It’s super fast and I can easily switch between Mac and Windows. I’ve switched off auto-updates in Sierra. While system updates should work just fine, I prefer to hold off until the community over at tonymacx86 have confirmed there are no issues. This is probably one of the major drawbacks to running a Hackintosh. Michael Rockwell: The performance this machine was able to achieve, at the price he paid, is staggering. On single-core tasks, it’s faster than any Mac Apple currently sells and, if you forgo all the bells and whistles, it can be built for about $1,800. Previously: Video Pros Moving From Mac to Windows for High-End GPUs, Building My $1,200 Hackintosh. Update (2017-03-20): See also: Stephen Hackett, Kirk McElhearn. Update (2017-03-22): Dave Mark: Have your heart set on a speedy new Mac Pro? Given that nothing appears to be on the horizon from Apple, your best bet is to build your own Hackintosh. […] I’d also make your way through both of the Dan case studies above just to get a sense of the process and, most importantly, to understand the caveats that come with building a Hackintosh. Hackintosh Mac Mac Pro macOS 10.12 Sierra 4 Comments 4 Comments Keir Thomas March 20, 2017 5:31 PM Since upgrading to a retina MacBook Pro a few years ago, I really don't think I could use daily a computer without retina. My eyes start to water if I can see the antialiasing take place. This is a powerful remind that the "Mac experience" is about more than specifications. I'd hate to use a non-Apple keyboard and mouse with a Mac too. Again, it wouldn't be the Mac experience. Chucky March 20, 2017 5:57 PM "Since upgrading to a retina MacBook Pro a few years ago..." But the point of a Hackintosh is not to replace your laptop. It's to build a desktop Pro machine for doing Pro work on a regular basis. "I really don't think I could use daily a computer without retina. My eyes start to water if I can see the antialiasing take place." Unless I'm missing something, this one is just weird. The Hackintoshes being discussed all involve 4K graphics cards... "I'd hate to use a non-Apple keyboard and mouse with a Mac too." This one baffles me as well. ----- I'm not in the market for a Hackintosh because I'm not doing Pro level work on a regular basis. But if I were, the option seems quite compelling. You can live with delayed OS updates in a Pro work machine, for various reasons that should be obvious. cremes March 20, 2017 6:19 PM I built a really nice PC and loaded up Ubuntu 16.10 on it. I now run OS X under QEMU/KVM and it rocks. I followed these instructions: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM Took me a few days to figure out bridged networking in QEMU. I contributed some docs on that topic to the above project. I run OS X in a window on my main desktop but with some more effort I could pass the video card through (via PCI pass through) and get HW accelerated video and all of the goodies. But I don't play games or use anything that requires video acceleration so I'm content with running it in a window. Marc Edwards March 20, 2017 6:37 PM @Keir Thomas What makes you think you can’t have a Retina display, and use an Apple keyboard and mouse? This is only talking about swapping out the main box for something else. And as for displays, you can’t have an Apple external display these days anyway. Who knows if or when they’ll decide to stop making mice and keyboards. Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

However, in the mobile technology calendar, it’s also the month that Apple traditionally announces a new iPhone. And this year according to rumor will be the same, except that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the device. Yes, it’s 10-years since the first revolutionary handset changed the world. As such, this year’s iPhone 8, will apparently set the world alight with a new suite of technologies which includes an OLED display. FunkyFocus / Pixabay Why an iPhone 8 with OLED? In answer to the above question, there is no official answer or proof that this technology will feature. But, Apple in recent times has found itself in the position of not being able to innovate technologically. One example of this was seen in the design of its iPhone 6 and 7 devices, with them remaining relatively the same across a range of handsets. As such it’s been on the receiving end of criticism from fans and reviewers, so this could be a reason. Additionally, iPhone sales have been in decline for some time. There’s no doubt, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have managed to sell well. However, compared to historical sales figures the number is still down. Now, as you can imagine, a company’s priority is to its bottom-line or more accurately its shareholders. So, a reversal of this downturn is a task it must complete. As you can see, technological innovation is a must for the iPhone 8. It’s something that will push Apple to incorporate new tech like OLED panels. However, another driver could be the anniversary, but we expect financial pressures to have a bigger say. OLED Technology According to rumors coming from Apple’s own supply chain the use of OLED panels in the iPhone 8 is a real consideration for the company. Why? Becuase it no longer wishes to lag behind the likes of Samsung. It would rather seize the opportunity to gain some ground on the Korean manufacturer which is recovering from a terrible 2016. As for the tech, it’s much sought after by producers the world over because of its superior properties to other display techniques. OLED panels are known to have better contrast, deeper blacks, and improved energy efficiency when compared to IPS LCD panels. In fact, these are but a few of the reasons other handset manufacturers also want to use them. Supply Headaches As manufacturers move away from older display technologies, it seems as thought the go-to solution for 2017 is OLED. With companies such as HTC, Huawei, Oppo, LG, Google, and of course Apple and Samsung all wanting the tech. However, of the brands mentioned only two have the capacity to produce their own, They are Samsung and LG, but, according to rumors worldwide supply is short. Right now, publications like the Ditigimes are reporting that Samsung commands the Lion’s share of production somewhere around 70%. But, considering it’s set to release the Galaxy S8 soon, the majority of its stockpile is reserved for its needs. However, a report suggested that Apple has struck a deal with Samsung to acquire up to 14% of what’s available. Meaning, that while Samsung and Apple will launch handsets with the latest display tech, other companies will struggle. One manufacturer with issues is Huawei; it apparently has not been able to guarantee a supply that matches its requirements. As for other’s BGR recently stated that both Oppo and the little known Vivo have managed to secure a supply. However, compared Samsung and Apple their requirements are much smaller and easier to accommodate. Final Thoughts Whatever the reason behind a possible switch from the outdated iPS LCD to OLED. Apple’s legions of followers will be ecstatic if this major upgrade becomes a reality. In fact, if the rumor mill is accurate with just 50% of what is doing the rounds, Apple will inevitably turn its iPhone sales around. As such the 6-month that’s ahead is going to be a long one filled with rumors and leaks to digest.

If you were to read the latest comparisons, you might get the impression Siri is a bit behind the other guys, mainly because Amazon Echo is doing well as the first real standalone speaker product for a personal assistant, and Google Home is following closely behind with its new ‘Assistant’. But with what’s rumored to be in store for iPhone 8 from good sources, I think Siri and Apple’s standalone Siri speaker product will have some big advantages. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Multi-language support An always-on, Wi-Fi connected Siri speaker in your home could be the next major step we see for Apple’s assistant this year. The latest reports claim the secretive Siri speaker product is far along enough to be in prototype testing after a couple of years of development and will likely debut this year. It sounds similar to connected speaker products already on the market, but Apple’s big advantage is Siri. And Siri’s first big advantage versus Amazon Echo and Google Home: Multi-language support. It already supports a long list of languages and region-specific accents and data, something Amazon and Google are way behind on. How behind? Alexa speaks English and German with varying support for features, Google Home/Assistant speaks only English. Siri, on the other hand, speaks over 20 languages with localized accents for many and support for all the big markets including English, French, Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese and many more. HomeKit It also already has a quickly growing ecosystem of home automation products through the HomeKit platform— homebuilders in the US and UK are now preinstalling HomeKit accessories— and controlling those kind of products will undeniably be a big part of these always-on personal assistant speaker products. Apple has expanded with support for new types of accessories and features each year at WWDC, and I’d expect this year will be the same. It’s already a step ahead of the competition with HomeKit, and that will make for a ton of possibilities at launch for a Siri speaker. Apple is also said to be working on facial recognition features for the Siri speaker, according to recent reports from Bloomberg and others, which means it could have a camera and that would allow for many features the current assistant speakers don’t have. If a camera and facial recognition do indeed show up in a Siri speaker, that could also mean built-in HomeKit security camera features and other HomeKit functionality, for example, intelligent multi-user support. The ability to recognize who is in a room and or talking seem like natural possibilities, but a tie-in to Apple’s work with augmented reality is another… AR/Camera features – Facial recognition – Apple TV A camera and facial recognition sound like huge differentiators for the in-development Siri speaker versus the competition. It could mean Apple’s Siri speaker could be truly context aware, versus just voice-activated. A number of reports claim Apple is working on 3D sensing and augmented reality tech for the next-generation of iPhones. Most of those reports seem to indicate Apple will first debut the tech by way of some sort of facial recognition camera applications for the iPhone 8. It wouldn’t be much of a stretch to imagine that Apple’s facial recognition tech for iPhone 8 might be similar or even tie-in to Siri speaker functionality in some way. And with a camera attached to an always on Siri speaker with facial recognition in your living room, perhaps also connected to an Apple TV, a whole new category of app possibilities will emerge. Apple TV apps could tap into the Siri speaker’s camera, for example, giving Apple TV apps a camera for things like video chat, security, gaming and AR applications. A recent concept (pictured above and below) imagined how Apple could use Siri for its augmented reality camera experience with the new iPhones. But it’s not just a concept. With all the recent reports, it’s looking like AR is going to be a big part of the next iPhones, so we know it’s likely on Apple’s radar for a Siri speaker too. Apps/SiriKit Last year’s Siri updates were notable. Siri debuted on the Mac for the first time, and it finally gained the ability to integrate with third-party apps with a Siri SDK. So far the app support is limited to a handful of categories like messaging, payments, VoIP calling, and ride booking. However, expanded SDK support to include functionality for any kind of app could supercharge Siri with new abilities quickly and often as developers inevitably look for innovative ways to approach integration. At the very least, a few more app categories for the SDK could get added at WWDC. Especially for third-party music, video and podcast apps could make Siri much more powerful. Either way, SiriKit has already prepared developers well ahead of time, which means lots of apps will already support Siri features by the time a Siri speaker rolls around likely later in the year. Apple’s Siri Speaker advantage  If you start to imagine a Siri speaker with these features–a camera for facial recognition, 3D sensing and augmented reality, an already robust and quickly growing home automation accessory ecosystem with HomeKit, multi-language support, and Apple TV apps–it’s easy to see Apple’s advantage. With the right timing alongside iPhone 8, these features could make Siri speaker look more like an innovative new product from Apple versus just its answer to the current crop of Amazon Echo and Google Home products.

Michael Potuck - Mar. 20th 2017 1:23 pm PT @michaelpotuck Apple Pay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Whether you always keep your eye out for new places to use Apple Pay or you’re new to Apple’s fast and secure payment service, one thing is for sure, it’s growing and changing fast. Let’s take a look at what stores and businesses are accepting Apple Pay now and the different ways you can use it. AirPods Just a few years after launching Apple Pay we’re seeing strong adoption and growth both from consumers and merchants. We’re constantly seeing new implementations beyond just retail and grocery stores such as huge fleets of vending machines being upgraded with Apple Pay support, table side order and pay terminals at restaurants, and even in-car support. Apple has also increased the payment services availability and use with support for the web, in apps, and in the US and the UK a variety of non-profits are now accepting Apple Pay. For now, there are 14 countries where Apple Pay is available with Taiwan rumored to be next up plus Germany and Italy possibly coming soon as well. You can find a full list of regions and financial institutions on Apple’s website. Figuring out who accepts Apple Pay while on the go If you’re not sure what stores and merchants will accept Apple Pay and you haven’t taken a look at the current list ahead of time, here are some ways to quickly find out: Look for one or both of the symbols shown above (in rare cases a merchant may display one or both of the symbols and not accept Apple pay). Hold your iPhone near the payment terminal while the cashier is ringing up your items (your debit or credit card associated with Apple Pay will automatically pop up, with Apple Watch you’ll need to double-press the side button) if it does, it should work. Use Touch ID or your passcode to approve the purchase. Ask small business owners if they accept Apple Pay (sometimes I help them realize they do and weren’t aware of it). Even if they don’t it helps build awareness. Ask an employee (at chains and larger stores). I list this last as often times employees aren’t the most knowledgeable on this topic, but you may get some help (I’ve experience a few employees who were sharp about knowing which terminals were having issues). Don’t forget when shopping at small businesses, they often accept Apple Pay through Square, Clover, or another payment processor. Even if you don’t see either the contactless payment or Apple Pay symbol, give it a shot! Keep an eye out for the small white square as shown above or similar devices at checkout. Figuring out who accepts Apple Pay ahead of time Over 100 major brands and retailers in the US are now accepting Apple Pay, check out Apple’s website to see who is new on the list. You can also see which apps support the payment service. Lastly Apple shares the list of non-profits that are also on board. “Use Apple Pay in these stores. And millions more” as seen on Apple’s site sounds like an exaggeration at first, but when you consider all the small businesses, 300,000+ vending machines, and the hundreds (or thousands) of chain locations, the numbers add up. With these tips and resources you shouldn’t have to wonder “where can I use Apple Pay?” anymore.

In this article, I’ll cover: What’s the latest iPad Pro 2 news? When is the iPad Pro 2's release date? What’s new about the iPad Pro 2's specs and design? What’s the iPad Pro 2's price? Should you wait for the iPad Pro 2? Update (23 March 2017): Apple may have revealed its first new iPad of 2017 – an upgraded 9.7-inch model – but we haven't (yet) got the iPad Pro 2 upgrade many of us were hoping for. Hit the link below for everything you need to know about that tablet, or read on for what to expect from the iPad Pro 2 when it does land. Related: New iPad 2017 (9.7-inch) When the first iPad launched back in 2010, Apple created a product category all on its own, driving rivals to bust out their own competing devices. Sales boomed, and tablets became a must-have for gadgeteers everywhere. But since then, the size of smartphone screens has ballooned, and the tablet industry has taken a major hit as a result. Apple still regularly releases iPads, but the line-up has become confusing and unwieldy. That’s why we’re not entirely sure what Apple has planned for the future. We’ve already been inundated with rumours about the next iPad (or iPad Pro?), believed to be the iPad Pro 2. Tipsters suggest we’ll see a middling 10-inch(-ish) iPad launched this year, in a bid to woo as wide a range of consumers as possible. Now that we’re starting to get a good idea of what to expect from the iPad Pro 2, we’ve rounded up all the information we could find about the mooted device, plus heaps of speculation and educated guesswork, too. Related: Best tablets iPad Pro 2 News – the latest news and rumours Here’s a rundown of the latest iPad Pro 2 news, in chronological order: March 21, 2017 – Apple unveils new iPad, but where's the Pro 2? As expected, Apple launched a new iPad, but it wasn't the Pro 2 many of us were expecting. Could it still land later in the year? March 13, 2017 – No grand entrance for iPad Pro 2? Apple is reportedly planning to launch refreshed iPad models without hosting a major launch event. March 7, 2017 – iPad Pro 2 launch event confirmed? The Apple World Today blog claimed that Apple would be holding an event for new iPad models on April 4, possibly at the new Steve Jobs Theater on the recently completed Apple Park campus. February 28, 2017 – Budget-friendly model incoming? As well as two high-end iPad models, Apple is reportedly working on a third budget version with a 9.7-inch display that could be priced as low as $299. February 24, 2017 – iPad Pro 2 delayed? A Digitimes report claimed that new iPad Pro models have been delayed, with a possible release pushed back to May or June. iPad Pro 2 release date – when does it come out? Apple has a very sporadic release history when it comes to tablets, so we can’t really rely on previous launches to guide us. Instead, we turn to the abundance of rumours pointing to an early 2017 launch. Most industry sources suggest supply chains are gearing up to deliver components for a product release in the first or second quarter of this year. So as expected, we saw a new Apple iPad before July 2017 – it just wasn't the Pro 2. Which means we're still wondering when the next iPad Pro model, provisionally dubbed the Pro 2, will come out. We previously heard rumours that Apple would hold a special event around April 4 to coincide with the opening of the new 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater at Apple's new Apple Park campus, but that now seems a bit close to the stealth March launch of the latest iPad. Realistically, this means we can't give you an exact release date at this point, but based on experience, another new iPad now seems unlikely to break cover before the autumn. Could the iPad Pro 2 debut alongside the iPhone 8? Stay tuned as we're sure the rumour mill will reignite shortly. Related: iPhone 8 iPad Pro 2 design – what’s new? What’s tricky about the iPad Pro 2 is that there might not be any one singular model, but several. According to Digitimes, here’s how Apple’s iPad line-up will look this year, in terms of screen sizes: 7.9-inch 9.7-inch (premium) 9.7-inch (budget) 12.9-inch 10.5-inch And then there’s a report from Japanese site Macotakara that claims we’ll see a 10.9-inch iPad. All this makes it extremely difficult to get a good idea of what Apple has planned for the iPad in 2017. There’s no denying that the range has become increasingly confused, with Apple selling tablets under a growing roster of brand names, including: iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini. There’s a chance that Apple may settle on one single brand name in 2017, and stick with a generally popular screen size in the 10-inch range. We’re also expecting to see a major design overhaul from the new iPad, which could tease long-rumoured changes to the iPhone aesthetic – those are expected in September 2017. For a start, 9to5mac reports that Apple may remove the Home button on the new iPad, testing the waters ahead of a similar move for the iPhone 8. And Macotakara cites a supply chain source in Taiwan as saying that the 10.9-inch iPad will have the same footprint as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, thanks to significant size reductions to the bezel. However, the site also reports that the thickness of the device will increase to 7.5mm – the same as on the original iPad Air – to accommodate these changes. It’s believed that the larger 12.9-inch iPad will gain 0.3mm in thickness thanks to a slimmed-down bezel, too. In other design news, Apple is reportedly planning a sequel to the Apple Pencil – the so-called Apple Pencil 2. A report from Letem Svetem Applem, which cites Chinese supply chain sources, details how the new Apple Pencil 2 will include a magnet that allows it to attach to the iPad Pro's smart cover, as well as a shirt clip. It's reportedly intended to make the Pencil much more difficult to mislay. This report is lent credence by several Apple patents that have explored ways of attaching the Pencil to the tablet. The first Apple Pencil was launched as an accessory alongside the 12.9-inch iPad Pro back in the autumn of 2015. Creative types have praised the £99/$99 accessory for its near lag-free responsiveness, and its ability to draw lines of differing weight by varying the pressure. Users can also add shading by tilting the pencil, just as you would with a conventional pencil. iPad Pro 2 specs – what’s new? We may be many months away from the iPad Pro 2 launch, so rumours about actual specs and hardware are thin on the ground. Most of what we can say about the next iPad is based on common sense and guesswork. For instance, Apple introduced a dual-camera configuration on the iPhone 7 Plus, which proved very popular amongst reviewers. If Apple really is working on a new premium iPad, it follows that the tablet would also get the same upgrade. Similarly, we’d expect to see the usual features like a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and a 3D Touch display. There’s also a rumour that Apple might finally scrap the Home button, instead embedding its functionality into the display in a bid to reduce the size of iPad bezels. We’re expecting a significant upgrade to raw performance, too. Specifically, Digitimes reckons Apple will introduce a new A10X chip that builds on the existing A10 processor used in the iPhone 7. For the unaware, the A10 ‘Fusion’ chip was special in that it was Apple’s first chip to combine high-power and low-power cores, which can be activated depending on the difficulty of the task you’re trying to get done. If it’s an easy job, the low-power cores will handle the grunt work, saving battery life as a result. Excitingly, Dutch tech blog Techtastic has already leaked what appear to be Geekbench benchmark test scores for the Apple A10X chip, with the new processor earning a 4,236 single-core score and a 6,588 multi-core score. That’s compared to the A10 Fusion’s respective 3,490 and 5,580 scores. However, it’s not clear how similar the two chips will be. While the A10 was built on a 16nm manufacturing process, Apple has reportedly already enlisted chipmaker TSMC to begin producing far more efficient 10nm A11 chips for the iPhone 8. There’s a chance that Apple’s 2017 iPad range might also feature a 10nm chip, which would offer significant performance and efficiency improvements. There’s pressure to make such a move, too. In November, Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 835 chip, which is built using Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. That chip is expected to appear in mobile devices starting with the Samsung Galaxy S8 in March, and is believed to offer either 40% lower power consumption or 27% higher performance, depending on how it is configured. Apple may not want to run the risk of releasing a tablet with outdated chip technology on board, although we’re not entirely convinced either way. The other potential upgrade would be a move to OLED displays, which is also another improvement tipped for the iPhone 8. Apple currently uses standard LCD panels with an LED backlight, while rivals like Samsung and OnePlus use more efficient OLED screens. With OLED displays, each pixel emits its own light, eliminating the need for a backlight. This reduces power consumption, as individual pixels can be turned off – also resulting in deeper (and more true) blacks. Unfortunately, a report from KGI Securities claims that the new iPad Pro won’t be fitted with an OLED display after all, with that change reserved for the 2018 models. Stay tuned. We may also see wireless charging, finally! In February 2017, Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium, leading to rampant speculation that Apple would finally add wireless charging to the iPhone 8. After all, the WPC is the regulatory body that oversees the Qi wireless charging standard – the same one used in Samsung's Galaxy S7. But there's little reason why Apple couldn't extend its apparent wireless charging ambitions to the iPad Pro 2 as well as its next flagship smartphone. Related: Best laptops iPad Pro 2 software – will it run on iOS 10 or iOS 11? What software the next iPad runs on really depends on when the tablet is released. If, as rumours suggest, the iPad Pro 2 lands early this year, then it will almost certainly run on the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 10. But if it arrives later in September, landing alongside the expected iPhone 8, then it’s far more likely to run on iOS 11. That OS hasn’t been announced yet, but will probably be confirmed next summer at Apple’s annual WWDC developer conference. Our money is on an early iPad launch, and thus iOS 10 – and that’s no bad thing. Apple released iOS 10 in September 2016, debuting the software on its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. New features included changes to 3D Touch, the lock screen, and the addition of ‘widget’ support. Apple also added additional emojis to Messages, a redesigned interface to Maps, and a new algorithmic categorisation and search system called ‘Memories’ for Photos. Siri also finally bagged support for third-party app-specific requests, so you can, for instance, request an Uber using your voice alone. iPad Pro 2 price – how much will it cost? We haven’t seen any leaked pricing for upcoming iPad models yet, so all we have to go on is the cost of existing devices. Here’s what Apple’s tablets currently retail for in the UK: 7.9-inch iPad Mini 2 – £239 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 – £379 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 – £379 9.7-inch iPad Pro – £549 12.9-inch iPad Pro – £729 So if Apple was to release a 10-inch(-ish) iPad in 2017, we’d expect it to cost anywhere from £300 to £700, depending on the specifications. In fact, prices could even be higher given the waning value of Sterling – we already saw a price jump from Apple thanks to currency fluctuations last year. Should you wait for the iPad Pro 2? Thinking about picking up an iPad Pro 2? Here’s our advice: If you don’t have a tablet but want one, it’s worth waiting. Apple basically kickstarted the tablet industry, so it’s got a decent reputation for turning out solid slates. With as many as three new iPads in the pipeline for the first half of 2017, it would be foolish not to wait to see what Apple has up its sleeve. If you’ve just bought a new iPad, be happy with your purchase. It’s highly unlikely that the new iPads (if they exist) will be significantly different than last year’s iPad. So unless you’re a real stickler for specs, you’ll probably get on fine with your existing slate. Consider the alternatives, including Android and Windows. It goes without saying that buying older generation iPads could save you a lot of money. But don’t forget that there are plenty of non-Apple alternatives to the iPad. On the Android front, you’ve got Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S3, while you’ll find good use out of a Windows hybrid like the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 or the Samsung Galaxy Book. iPad Pro 2 – summary Here’s what you really need to know: iPad Pro 2 release date: There’s no clear consensus on a new iPad release date – we’ve heard dates in March, April, May, and June rumoured, as well as the obvious September event. An April reveal seems most likely at this point, but it’s too early to say either way. iPad Pro 2 specs: We’re expecting a number of upgrades, including a more powerful A10X chip, a new slim-bezel design, and a revamped Apple Pencil. iPad Pro 2 price: Apple is reportedly plotting three different iPad variants, so we’re likely to see a wide range of pricing. Expect anything from £240 to £799 for base spec models. Related: Best gaming laptops What would you like to see from the next iPad? Let us know in the comments.

One of the key people behind Essential was Android inventor Andy Rubin. It was very surprising to learn that Apple's number one supplier was now working against Apple in backing the new smartphone company. Our report also covered Essential's trademark and patent filings. The patent showed a completely new design methodology for a smartphone and one made with a ceramic back which would technically support wireless charging as reported on earlier today.   Today the Wall Street Journal reports that "SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter."   What's not clear exactly is whether Bloomberg's earlier foxconn references made in January were really a part of the Softbank investment or a separate investment. If it was really a Softbank vision fund investment framed as a Foxconn investment, then that investment is now dead.   However, if it was a true independent Foxconn investment then it's a complication for Apple. Politics could be at play being that Apple is working with Winstron in an Indian iPhone plant and with Pegatron hinting that they would be willing to work with Apple for a plant in the U.S. should they decide to close their Mexican plant.   Was this a part of the true behind the scenes manuevering by Apple to send Softbank and Foxconn a messages to back off their investment in Essentials?   The Wall Street Journal further reported that "The planned investment would have valued the startup, Essential Products Inc., at $1 billion, these people say, a lofty amount for a startup that has yet to sell a product in one of technology's most cutthroat industries. The offer banked on the pedigree of Essential's founder Andy Rubin, who sold his previous startup, Android, to Alphabet Inc. 's Google in 2005, then helped turn its software into the world's most used smartphone operating system, powering devices rivaling Apple's iPhone.   The episode is a window into the unpredictable investing style of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who is set to enhance his position as one of the tech industry's most powerful investors with his $100 billion tech-focused Vision Fund. That mammoth fund is expected to close as early as this month, according to a person familiar with the matter.   As part of the proposed deal with Essential, Mr. Son had promised that SoftBank's telecom subsidiary in Japan would provide a big marketing push for the release of Essential's high-end smartphone, scheduled for this spring, the people said, ahead of Apple's expected fall release of its 10th anniversary iPhone.   In January, Apple agreed to commit $1 billion to the Vision Fund. Though Apple didn't block the Essential deal, according to the people, its investment complicated SoftBank's interest in a competing smartphone company. In February, after months of negotiations and when final investment contracts were being drawn up, Mr. Son backed out of the deal.   Masayoshi Son began discussing an investment with Mr. Rubin last fall, according to people briefed on the talks. They outlined the basic structure of a possible deal, including the funding amount and valuation, as well as plans for SoftBank's mobile subsidiary to put its marketing firepower behind the Japan launch of Essential's first phone. The deal had proceeded to the stage where final investment contracts were being drawn up.   From Mr. Rubin's perspective, the investment was nearly complete, according to people familiar with his thinking, having progressed to the last steps before such venture deals are typically signed. But Mr. Son did another gut check on the deal after Apple committed to investing in his new fund, say people familiar with his thinking, deciding to kill it rather than align himself too closely with an Apple rival."   What may still be hanging in the wind is whether Foxconn is still involved in the deal with Essentials so as to win over the production contract. It may surface in a future report or we may see Apple continually making plant deals with more of Foxconn rivals.   While this ongoing story can't be concluded today with the Wall Street Journal's report, it sure hit a home run in showing us the chess games that companies like Apple have to be constantly playing behind the scenes so as to protect their interests. Business is business and Apple will strike out against a potential enemy or current supplier as needed and do it as quickly as a King Cobra without mercy.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The first song I transferred was 50 Cent’s “Disco Inferno,” which hit No. 3 on Billboard—and which I’ve heard maybe twice in the last ten years. That iPod replaced the Walkman I’d brought with me to Winnipeg, the one with The Black Album and Like Water for Chocolate and the whole book of CDs that I’d lugged around for most of my adolescence. I stole a lot of music to put on that iPod. Most of my friends did the same. We all brought our iPods to school, scrolling with tight, right-thumbed circles through our collections: 50, Kanye, Wayne, Jay, Lupe. If we had been of the age or inclination, we would have been reading online articles about how our iPods were shifting the future of music, how consumers would curate their own playlists, no longer bound to albums as conceived by artists and their record companies. While digital technology had already begun to rattle the record industry’s foundation, the shift had only affected the business, not the art itself. I’m writing this in 2017, a handful of hours after Drake, the world’s most popular rapper, released new music on his radio show, a program he broadcasts bi-weekly (or thereabouts) to Apple Music subscribers—that is, consumers who pay $9.99 a month ($4.99 for students, $14.99 for a “family license”) for access to Apple’s library of songs, albums, and other media, which can be streamed on phones, computers, tablets, or the watches Apple manufactures. This collection of songs is called More Life. Drake has gone to great lengths to communicate to his fans that this work is a playlist, as opposed to an album, EP, or mixtape—even going so far as to include the word on the artwork, which otherwise features a picture of his father and a nod to October Firm. More Life is not a playlist in the typical sense of the word. It’s not a collection of songs by various artists, anchored by a broad theme, like “sex” or “rainy Mondays”; it’s not a collection of songs by a single artist, culled from across their discography. To Drake’s credit, his claim to the label is compelling. In an interview with the British radio broadcaster and DJ Semtex, he explained that More Life was conceived as an episode of his radio show, reflecting his current regional and stylistic tastes—except each song would happen to be a Drake original. But there was another, more revealing quote in that interview with Semtex. Discussing his most recent album, last year’s Views—which was met with massive commercial success but tepid reviews from fans and critics—Drake said, “There was a time where I thought about actually taking the rap off of Views and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fan base is, and so toward the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best I could on the rap end.” Drake goes further, conceding that while the album’s success was “incredible,” it “wasn’t the one.” Three of the album proper’s four singles (“Too Good,” “One Dance,” and “Controlla”) ditch rap completely. Until More Life, Drake’s toying with form had been strictly semantic. This wasn’t the first time that Drake, press savvy though he is, has admitted that the album-making process frustrates him. In a 2011 interview, also with Semtex, he said that he regretted how his debut LP, Thank Me Later, had been rushed—so much so that “9AM in Dallas,” one of his best-received songs to that point, missed the deadline for mastering. His next two albums, that year’s Take Care and 2013’s Nothing Was the Same, were well-received, though they represented opposite approaches to the form: Take Care dove down a variety of rabbit holes, leaving a long, messy, idiosyncratic work, while Nothing Was the Same was far more concise and focused. To the dispassionate observer, Drake was trying to find the right balance. Until More Life, Drake’s toying with form had been strictly semantic. His surprise 2015 release, If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, was nominally a mixtape, but it featured entirely original production, counted as an official release on the Cash Money and Republic calendars, was sold on the iTunes store for as much money as any other new album, and was eventually issued on CD with no changes except for a pair of bonus tracks. There was no practical difference between If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late and Nothing Was the Same. If you look at Drake’s career and see that he’s spent more than 400 consecutive weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100, a chart that measures the success of singles; that Views was a monumental success despite its singles existing in a different musical world than the bulk of the album; and that he’s ruled some years (like 2014) with little more than a loosie (“0 to 100”), you might wonder why he bothers with full-length records at all. A cursory look at its history will show you that rap, like so many other types of music, was primarily a singles genre for years after its birth, and that some of its greatest artists and stylistic movements lacked definitive albums or album artists. Unfortunately for Drake (and for Whodini, and for the New Boyz), the album is the format people are generally interested in—or perhaps more specifically, the format that people find most worthy of serious parsing, praise, and attention. The album is the canvas for the masterpiece. The album is where art is made. Supposedly. This is why any one of the inane Twitter conversations about Drake devolves into a single question: does he have a classic album? Whatever meaning you derive from More Life, it’s satisfying to watch an artist think critically about his means of presentation. There are other parallels to rap’s past worth mentioning. More Life is subtitled “A Playlist by October Firm,” which recalls records like Jay Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was conceived as a Roc-A-Fella compilation before Jay, Dame, and Biggs figured it would sell more if it was billed as a solo album. Compilations by the Diplomats and the Ruff Ryders helped solidify crews as alphas in their time; Rawkus became one of indie rap’s flagships largely due to its comp game. (For what it’s worth, when Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega Nature linked up as the Firm, they made sure that their debut was called The Album.) No matter the artist, label, or era, though, compilations were generally seen as a welcome bonus, rather than the yardstick by which great, canonical artists were measured. It’s easy to position More Life’s playlist tag as a cynical way of skirting expectations, a means to cast a wide net of potential summer smashes while mitigating critical blowback. But I think there’s something more interesting at play. For as tech-literate as most of today’s artists have to be, very little music is made with an eye to how it’ll interact with a phone, or a watch, or the Macbook you’re using to read this article. (The artists whose work does seem uniquely attuned to a digital landscape—take Lil B for example—are both closer to the genre’s avant-garde edges and seem to have been more comfortable in the murkier, more mysterious internet that’s quickly sanitizing itself.) And to Drake’s credit, the work takes on characteristics of a radio setlist or a DJ mix; his comments in the Semtex interview were more than a quick reframing after the fact. The sounds change how they might on radio, too: after lapsing into his London self on More Life’s second song, “No Long Talk,” Drake invites a hard left turn into a five-song dance suite, then into a period that’s slower, more somber, darker. There are breaks between songs where a voice other than his—be it Giggs, Moodymann by way of a years-old sample, his mom—serves as a brief reprieve. The project has a kinetic sort of forward motion, rather than momentum built by narrative or familiar arcs. Whatever meaning you derive from More Life, it’s satisfying to watch an artist think critically about his means of presentation, both as it pertains to his strengths and weaknesses and to the personal, physical lives of his audience. Here Drake’s free to pick up and put down any sound he’s been toying with for the last handful of months, free of (most of) the narrative baggage that comes with the fight to craft a Great Album. None of this is to say that this form is inherently superior—it isn’t. But this time, it works.   WatchNow Tags: Features, Essays, Drake  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories Snoop Dogg Reveals the First Person He Ever Smoked a Blunt With in New Nardwuar Interview BY Trace Cowen 20 minutes ago Kendrick Lamar May Have Just Announced His Fourth Album and Fans Are Freaking Out BY Edwin Ortiz 2 hours ago Mike Will Made-It Releases "Aries (YuGo)" f/ Pharrell Williams and "Station Wagon P" BY Joshua Espinoza 10 hours ago Beyoncé FaceTimes a Fan Who's Battling Cancer BY Shawn Setaro 10 hours ago Would You Rather See Kanye Make an Album With Drake or Jay Z?

Seems the company is exploring AR glasses, like Google did with Google Glass, and will target our eyes after tackling the iPhone. Apple has plans for augmented reality, or AR, glasses Insider sources speaking with Bloomberg say Apple plans to put AR-enabled glasses on our faces after it brings the features to the iPhone. Apple’s glasses will reportedly pair with the iPhone to display information, video, maps, other images that overlay what you’re seeing. The lead for Apple’s AR project includes a former Dolby executive, presumably Mike Rockwell. He ran Dolby’s Advanced Technology Group and was part of the Dolby Vision display team and was involved in the company’s mobile products, too. He also served as an advisor for Meta, which already makes AR glasses. Other team members previously worked on Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Oculus, now owned by Facebook. Apple’s Augmented Reality Vision Moving into the AR space seems like an obvious move for Apple since company CEO Tim Cook already confirmed it’s an area he’s keenly interested in. The iPhone is a good place to start since it includes cameras and it’s an always with you device. Moving into glasses, however, will be a more tricky prospect. When Google Glass was the hot tech topic Mr. Cook pointed out that wearing glasses is something you do because you have to, and not because you want to. Making glasses with the radios, cameras, and projectors they’d need for an AR experience are bulky. So far the products we’ve seen in that space reflect that and are less than stylish, to say the least. Apple will need to figure out how to make glasses that are light weight, comfortable, and good looking. That’s no small task because they’ll need batteries, antennas, cameras, projectors, and possibly microphones, too. The company still has plenty of time to figure that out because its AR project for the iPhone is still in the development phase. Apple’s glasses won’t come until some time after AR finds its way onto the iPhone, and considering the company already knows glasses are a hard sell it’s a safe bet the team is working hard to get everything right.

To my knowledge, Apple doesn’t have retail presence in New Zealand, so all sales are through Australia to companies incorporated in New Zealand to sell those products. It seems to me that Brian just wanted to bang on about Apple and taxes, nothing new there 🙄, but these rants, specially when the trigger point is so off the mark, become a tad boring after a while. Most of the time yours is my daily favorite podcast. PJT March 20, 2017 at 5:53 EDT PM Jeff Gamet March 20, 2017 Hi PJT, and thanks for the feedback. Bryan has that rant out of his system, so we’re good for a while. I suspect most of his rants will get saved for his new Pop.0 podcast with John Keit. And thanks for listening! You rock. 🙂 March 20, 2017 at 5:56 EDT PM Laurie Fleming March 20, 2017 Peter, it doesn’t have a direct retail presence, but it is an incorporated company in this country, has offices in Auckland and Wellington, and has employees. Leave aside that its staff pay tax if they are contractors, or that Apple pays income tax on their behalf if they are employees: not having a retail presence is irrelevant. It may be boring to you, but your not liking it doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be spoken about. The argument that has been raised that JK Rowling doesn’t pay taxes here despite making a lot of money doesn’t make sense: she doesn’t live here. Apple has a presence here. I agree with Bryan that it’s hard to discern how much tax Apple should pay here, but it should be non-zero. I’ve been trying to find out under the Companies Act exactly what a company’s fiduciary responsibilities are (I don’t read legalese), but I believe that we don’t have the “sole responsibility is to the shareholders” as the US does. Apple (and Google and Facebook and Microsoft and IBM) must follow local laws. March 20, 2017 at 8:04 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Tech News | 20 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (10) 27 Conferences for Mac and iOS Professionals in 2017 by Adam C. Engst and Josh Centers Despite the loss of Macworld/iWorld, which many in the industry continue to mourn, there’s no shortage of Apple-focused conferences for professionals to gather with peers. We have once again collected details — or at least dates — for all the Apple-related conferences we can find; if we’ve missed any, let us know in the comments. We’ve sorted them by date so you can scroll through and see which might fit into your schedule. If you want to meet part of the TidBITS gang, Adam Engst will be at the ACEs Conference in May, and he and Tonya are likely to go to MacTech Conference in November. Josh Centers is planning to attend the iBooks Author Conference in October. If regular TidBITS contributors are asked to speak at any others, we’ll be sure to mention that in a future article.

Sessions are identified as being appropriate for beginners or intermediate users. FileMaker Developer Conference: July 24–27, 2017 -- This one’s pretty specific, but since the FileMaker Developer Conference is open to the public and FileMaker is an Apple subsidiary, we’re including it.

Scheduled for October 16th through 18th in Chicago. Details about speakers, sessions, and registration prices aren’t yet available, but you can sign up to be alerted when they’re decided upon. Last year’s speakers included Christina Warren of Gizmodo, David Sparks of MacSparky, Stephen Hackett of Relay FM, Jaimee Newberry of MartianCraft, and Rich Siegel of Bare Bones Software.

Registration fees range from $499 to $1099, depending on when you sign up and if you’re in the education market. MacTech Conference: November 15–17, 2017 -- While the MacTech Pro events fit into a single day and travel around the country, the Los Angeles-based MacTech Conference offers attendees three days of sessions, seminars, and vendor interaction, plus pre-conference workshops and a pair of superlative evening activities. We’ve attended a number of times (see “MacTech Conference 2012 Opens Mental Doors,” 22 October 2012, “MacTech Conference 2013 Abounds with Networking and Fun,” 11 November 2013, and “Three Highlights from MacTech Conference 2015,” 9 November 2015) and recommend it to Apple IT professionals. It’s too early for there to be a list of speakers or sessions, but now is a good time to pencil MacTech Conference onto your calendar for November 15th through 17th, with pre-conference workshops on the 14th. Early bird tickets currently cost $949; the price will rise to $1599 eventually.

Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-20 19:20 Thanks, we've added it in. Reply Henry Larsen  2017-03-20 23:41 Sorry, but in this article you guys repeatedly set off a loud annoyance buzzer for me and, I expect, more than a few others. What's the problem? Well, here are a few examples: Mdevcon: ... Amsterdam, Netherlands IOSCon: ... London, England Don't all educated people (such as those who might be interested in attending a tech conference) know where Amsterdam is?!? (And it's 'the Netherlands' by the way.) If you mean Amsterdam, New York, then, OK, specify that. Otherwise the city name suffices. Likewise London. CocoaConf: ... Chicago, IL Is there even another Chicago, anywhere? App Builders Switzerland: ... Zürich, Switzerland Gosh, do you really think your readers are so stupid that they might think the App Builders _Switzerland_ conference is possibly in Zürich, Alabama? &c., &c., &c. Now, I understand that most of your readers are American and many observers have noted that Americans may be more geographically challenged than others -- but that's no reason to pander to them. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 09:06 From a publishing standpoint, we juggle completeness versus brevity all the time. For this article, we chose to be complete in terms of providing U.S. states or countries with the city name in most cases. I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the place names this time around in favor of focusing on the dates and other details. Now that you point it out, it does look a little awkward, so I'll go through and trim out the obvious ones. I somehow doubt that most people know where Crystal Lake and State College are, so I'll leave those. Reply Richard Smith  2017-03-21 18:08 On that note, a consistency issue, you have the list mostly sorted by date, so I'm wondering why MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017, is listed above X World: June 29–30, 2017. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 19:21 Good eye — fixed! Reply Tom Harrington  2017-03-21 21:36 Thanks! There's also the upcoming iOSDevCamp Colorado, next month! It's an informal developer conference in Colorado Springs. http://iosdevcampcolorado.com/post/158134864828/iosdevcamp-colorado-springs-2017 Reply Darren Wallace  2017-03-22 13:20 Not sure how well this would fit in but we've just finished the second ever MacADUK conference (http://www.macad.uk) this year (2017). Although not to the letter of the article title, it is more than 12 months away :) Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-22 13:26 We'll put it on the list to include next year! And next year we'll try to get this article done in January. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Augmented reality — which differs from virtual reality in that it is not completely immersive — will be the key to not just Apple's future but the future of tech. And while it may not impact the company's sales in the short-term, Muster says it will "lay the foundation of the next computing paradigm." That shift will ultimately be good for Apple's stock, he said. "You start to get more comfortable when you put together the services side of the business on top of the augmented reality side," Munster said. Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality, though both acquisitions and hiring new talent, according to a report in Bloomberg.

The company also announced results from the 2017 Denver International Spirits Competition where Five Wives Vodka and Porter’s Peach Liqueur received gold medals and Madam Pattirini Gin and Porter’s Apple received silver medals. These were the companies only products entered in this year’s competition. Both silver medal winning products, Madam Pattirini Gin and Porter’s Apple Liqueur, will be shipped to the state of Utah on April 3, 2017 and the company anticipates they will begin to appear on DABC store shelves around April 11. “We’ve been waiting for a few months on the DABC to send us an order for our most recent creations,” managing partner Steve Conlin explained. “It’s nice that it coincided with the release of this great news regarding contest results.” Madam Pattirini Gin is made from juniper, bergamot, coriander, cardamom, Nigerian ginger, and Sicilian lemon in small runs of less than 1,000 bottles at a time. All bottles are individually hand-numbered by batch and bottle. As the 35th child of LDS Prophet Brigham Young, B. Morris Young AKA Madam Pattirini was one of the more interesting and little know figures of the Old West. In 1895, he began publicly performing in drag as an “Italian opera diva” under the pseudonym "Madam Pattirini." Young performed as Pattirini in north and central Utah venues from 1885 to the 1900s. He could produce a convincing falsetto, and many in the audience did not realize that Pattirini was Young. Much like people will be surprised that a great gin comes from Utah. Porter’s Apple Liqueur extends the company’s flavored whiskey brands which pay homage to the infamous Porter Rockwell - a legend during the early days of the LDS church where he was bodyguard for founder Joseph Smith and served as a deputy marshal in Utah. Rockwell was known for heavy-handed enforcement and the killing of many men. Porter’s Apple joins Porter’s Fire cinnamon-vanilla and Porter’s Peach in the Porter’s family of whiskey liqueurs. “We now have eight award-winning products on shelves in Utah as well as other states like Michigan and in stores like Total Wine & More across the country,” Conlin said. “Utah’s largest locally-owned distillery keeps growing!” Underground Herbal Spirit, produced by Ogden’s Own Distillery, was honored with a gold medal in the 2014 Denver International Spirits competition. The Denver International Spirits Competition is judged by a panel consisting of top sommeliers, retail buyers, journalists, mixologists and beverage directors from around the world. Learn more at www.denverspiritscomp.com. About Ogden's Own Distillery: For nearly eight years Ogden's Own Distillery has been making craft spirits in Utah. As Ogden's first licensed distillery since the 1800’s their first product, Underground Herbal Spirit, captures the feeling of the rowdy, early days of Ogden. Underground Herbal Spirit won a prestigious "Double Gold" at the 2010 San Francisco World Spirits Competition and "Best Liqueur" at the 2012 Spirits of the America’s. Ogden’s Own also makes the critically acclaimed Five Wives Vodka brands, Porter’s Fire, Peach and Apple Whiskey Liqueurs and Madam Pattirini Gin. www.OgdensOwn.com Contact Information Ogden's Own Distillery Steve Conlin 801-458-1995 Contact Ogdensown.com Click here to view the list of recent Press Releases from Ogden's Own Distillery Promote Your Business Affiliate Program Link To Us Email this page to a friend PR.com Contact Us About Us Terms of Use Help

Let’s Talk iOS 179: Not just a virtual or augmented reality The top stories of the week on iDB The best smart scales   skip to main content skip to main menu     iPhone 8 said to feature rounded water drop design similar to the original iPhone By Christian Zibreg, Mar 20, 2017 Tweet 7 Comments Apple’s next iPhone, affectionally dubbed by the media “Tenth Anniversary iPhone”, will have curves similar to those of the original model, which was released ten years ago in 2007, Korean site ETNews said Monday. In paying homage to the original iPhone, the casing of Apple’s next phone is thought to adopt “water drop design” with rounded curves on both its front and back, just like the original model. “Apple’s next iPhone will have a rear case made of glass,” an industry official said. “This glass case is a curved wall surrounded by four sides,” as per machine translation of the original article. iPhone 8’s rear curve is reportedly a bit gentler and a tad rounder than existing metal case models, ETNews said. The company will achieve this by using a three-dimensional glass material on the back to give iPhone 8’s top, bottom, left and right edges deeper curves resembling the original model. Apple’s been re-using designs based on a flat backplate since iPhone 4. As there have been no leaks of iPhone 8 backplates, only time will tell if the device will be sandwiched between two pieces of glass that’s slightly curved or feature an all-glass front and back akin to the iPhone 4/4s series, as KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo predicted. At any rate, the rumor-mill seems to be in agreement that the Cupertino company will be moving away from aluminum to glass for the next iPhone. In January, Apple celebrated the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone’s unveiling so it’s possible that the company may have something really special in store for the upcoming refresh. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube “We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging,” Kuo wrote last November in a research note. The following month, Nikkei reported that all 2017 iPhone models would adopt Apple’s new glass-on-glass industrial design. KGI later added that all 2017 would have wireless charging. Other sources think Apple will release a pair of iterative updates this year in the form of LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, augmented by a new flagship iPhone 8 model boasting an all-new industrial design with a bezel-less AMOLED screen. Due to advanced technologies, iPhone 8 could potentially cost upward of $1,000. Due to manufacturing issues, iPhone 8 may not go on sale in September alongside the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus.

Josiah They are packing so much stuff into the iPhone 8 that I will almost be suprised if any of the storage variations is under $1000. Which to be quite honest is ridiculous if you ask me. My phone should not cost more than my MacBook Air. That’s just wrong Kaptivator I agree! I LOL @ “Due to advanced technologies, iPhone 8 could potentially cost upward of $1,000”. Has to be some major advancements outside of going back to glass. Josiah Supposedly it will have in screen fingerprint sensor, VR capabilities, 3D mapping camera, no home button, the entire front of it is supposed to be a screen, even surrounding where the front camera, light sensor and speaker goes, and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → On the Hackintosh  March 20, 2017March 20, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I really like my iMac, but every once in a while I do wish Apple was shipping a cheese-grater Mac Pro with modern internals. I’d love to shove some of my external drives into a tower that could keep my desk nice and tidy, not to mention having more horsepower for audio and video editing. In the current vacuum of updated Pro hardware from Apple, some are turning to Hackintoshes. These custom-built PCs are designed to run macOS, giving users great flexibility to build their own setups for running Mac software. A couple of days ago, RealMac’s Dan Counsell shared a bit about his new desktop: I spent a week or so researching how to build a Hackintosh, I watched plenty of YouTube videos, read articles, and spent a lot of time on the tonymacx86 website. As many others have pointed out, this is time well spent, and probably the best way to learn how to do it. There are basically three parts to building a Hackintosh; picking the right components, actually building the thing, and finally getting macOS installed and running. As long as you take your time, and research each part properly you’ll be fine. I wanted to build a machine that was faster than my current Macbook Pro and would be able to replace my gaming PC. This basically boiled down to picking the fastest CPU and GPU that macOS supports without resorting to any hacks. Dan’s machine isn’t quite as fast as the 2013 Mac Pro in multi-core scoring, but beats both it and the MacBook Pro in single-core tasks. While he didn’t include it on his charts, it also appears to beat the current iMac at the Geekbench 4 benchmark test. tonymacx86 publishes monthly guides that make picking compatible hardware easy. Dan spent less than $2,000, and you could spend far less than that if you didn’t want an all-SSD system. I’m not feeling particularly itchy about building my own macOS-compatible computer. My iMac is great, and even though keeping macOS happy on these computers is easier than ever, I am hesitant to run my business on unsupported Mac hardware.

In fact, it was originally This Is My Next -the former online moniker of tech site, The Verge- that first claimed to have an exclusive surrounding the then iPhone 5‘s purported design. That design, at the time, was said to be “teardrop”-like in shape and thus was closely compared to the late 2010 MacBook Air. An old mockup showing the iPhone 5’s then purported ‘teardrop’-like design “The versions of devices our sources are seeing could be design prototypes and not production-ready phones,” the site reported in its exclusive back in April 2011. “Still, there are strong indications that Apple will surprise a public that’s expecting a bump more along the lines of the 3G to 3GS — and this is some insight into where those designs might be headed,” This is My Next concluded. Of course, we now know that the site was way off in its assumption that the iPhone 5’s public introduction would be marked with a ‘teardrop’-style hardware refresh. Now though that claim is being renewed, this time by Korea’s ET News – who reports the Cupertino company is reading a major redesign of its flagship smartphone offering that will boast a “water drop design.” “Apple’s next iPhone is expected to be closer to ‘water drop design’. It [will] embody the back side design with curved emphasis, resembling the initial iPhone,” the roughly translated report reads. The site claims the introduction of an iPhone model that carries a ‘major’ hardware redesign is somewhat warranted, given that 2017 also marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone’s birth. “Apple’s next iPhone will have a rear case made of glass,” an industry official reportedly told the paper, adding that this glass case would be a “curved wall” surrounded by four sides. Apple is currently expected to unveil its next iPhones, which are likely to follow the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen form-factors we have today … and could also see the company adopt the recently bantered, era-defining brand name: “iPhone X” – this fall. / 9to5Mac (h/t) / Image Credit: Imran Taylor Continue Reading You may also like...

OS Blog: Windows, Linux Highlights From Around the Web Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell The current state of healthcare delivery, and specifically electronic medical records (EMR), is reminiscent of the state of office productivity software in the business world during the '90s. During the late '80s and into the '90s, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and a host of lesser word processors battled for supremacy in the business world. Each had their pros and cons, but the global economy would really explode in the late '90s once one of these titans became the industry standard.  Apple had conceded the desktop operating system wars to Microsoft well in advance of the battle for word processing champion. By the time the best OS Microsoft has ever produced (prior to Windows 10) -- Windows XP -- was released, Apple was well into its process of reinventing itself as a consumer oriented, and not an enterprise-focused, company. We know what’s transpired since Microsoft out marketed both Apple (for desktop computer OS supremacy) and the makers of WordPerfect as the word processing gold standard. Apple went on to claim smartphone dominance -- and Microsoft similarly handled rival Novell and Corel versions of WordPerfect to become office productivity suite king. Apple beat out the late-to-the-table Windows Phones and holds on to the top spot today over Android-based versions. So, to date: Microsoft becomes king of the desktop computer operating system and achieves recognition as business world, word processing and office productivity suite software standard bearer. Apple becomes king of the smartphone before Microsoft even becomes a player. Number 1 actually encompasses two things, but they happened around the same time and were interrelated by virtue of the fact that Word, Excel and PowerPoint run on both Windows and Macs -- the unquestioned business world, office suite standard for both computing platforms. Number 2 is just a statement of clear cut dominance by Apple in the smartphone vertical segment. What the world is waiting for now is a good old-fashioned heavyweight rubber match between Apple and Microsoft; well, it might not be waiting for it, but in the name of healthcare, it should be hoping for it. Some would say this is not likely as neither is a company that competes so much as complements one another at this time. Microsoft recently closed on its acquisition of LinkedIn. (I’m still waiting to see how that one turns out. LinkedIn has received somewhat of a facelift and makeover. It also doesn’t let me post the same material twice anymore on the social network for professionals going places, but I digress.) The 800 lb. gorilla in the room is EMR Healthcare delivery is set to simultaneously explode and implode. Baby boomers will stress an already overtaxed system ill-equipped to keep up accurately with present, modern-day demands. What nobody is talking about is how difficult it will be to make advances in healthcare delivery with the overwhelming number of EMR choices available to private practices, medical groups and hospitals. This is because variation, whether in EMRs or office productivity suite choices, is surely the enemy of quality. There are literally dozens of EMR choices and they are all being utilized to some degree. There are no clear cut favorites, either, regarding which, if any EMR, will win out as a standard in the end. And the end of multiple EMR choices cannot come soon enough. In fact, an Obamacare replacement will be hindered by the lack of an EMR standard. We’ll only get so far with the status quo. Enter Microsoft and Apple wearing Everlast boxing gloves, just like the good old days, or not. Healthcare is a multi-billion dollar industry and all too plentiful EMR choices are thwarting efforts at cost containment, redundancy elimination and advancements for real progress in medical procedure, pharmaceutical and surgical development, not to mention actual delivery of high-quality patient healthcare. One argument against Apple ever competing in this space is they no longer serve the enterprise except in ancillary or augmentative capacities. An argument against Microsoft throwing their hat in this ring is that creating an EMR standard -- and all it entails -- is just too complex and costly a venture to enter into at this late stage of the game. The final piece of this heavyweight tilt may just be the unexpected. That is, the fight for EMR supremacy between Apple and Microsoft might never come to pass because they end up actually partnering to achieve a mutually beneficial solution in the EMR space. How can this be? Apple already promotes Apple Watch heavily as a fitness device. Accordingly, it feeds data into systems which mine, filter and regurgitate this info to consumers and healthcare practitioners in a variety of ways -- all in the name of promoting healthy and active lifestyles. Could Apple continue to play the consumer card it is known for and Microsoft be relied upon to do the heavy lifting on developing an EMR standard of its own? I think there is room for the possibility of both. For Microsoft to succeed in its part, however, it’d have to incorporate advanced OCR, handwriting analysis and dictation capabilities into its product. Finally, EMRs would have to network easily and effectively with hospital-based equivalents and the very data-feeding consumers that Apple would serve in this scenario. It could happen. It should happen. I dare it to happen. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

New, 15 comments Drake and Apple are calling More Life a playlist instead of an album, but that doesn’t mean much by Lizzie Plaugic and Micah Singleton Mar 20, 2017, 3:15pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images for iHeartMedia This past Saturday Drake released More Life, a 22-track collection of songs that he’s calling a “playlist.” Reviews are already out, and music writers seem to have accepted this term quickly and without any caveats. But what does “playlist” mean in this context, and is it really any different from an album? Lizzie: Micah, I’m having some trouble understanding Drake’s (or Apple’s) insistence on calling this thing a “debut playlist.” From my perspective as a listener, More Life is still an album, even if it has several guest spots and covers a lot of musical ground. It’s a bunch of new songs from one artist. Drake is the primary writer on most of the tracks. It’s available for $10.99 on iTunes. It’s listed as an album on Spotify. What’s really non-album-y about it? Micah: The playlist, if anything, is meant to rebrand the mixtape. Unlike most people over 25 who grew up during the 50 Cent / Lil Wayne mixtape run from 2001–2008, younger millennials may not have the same emotional ties to mixtapes. They do (presumably) have those ties to playlists. It’s a smart marketing move for brands, but I don’t think it fundamentally changes anything for the listener. Do you think the public will buy into it? It’s a smart move for the brands that are Apple or Drake Lizzie: I think More Life will do well, but only because it’s a Drake project, and not because of any arbitrary label made up by Apple. And I would argue that, thanks to younger artists like Lil Yachty, Lil Uzi Vert, and Chance the Rapper, who are still releasing mixtapes, kids do probably know what mixtapes are (and they probably also know that mixtapes are usually free). At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica defines the playlist as "a collection of moods, impressions, influences and references" and "a river that flows in one direction." Hypebeast points out that it has been described as a "bridge" between major releases. Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos writes that the term might be a reflection of "how [Drake] has curated the varying locales, inspirations and relationships of his most recent years." Those are all reasonable suggestions, but it feels like some critics have been forced to do Apple's job here. Why redefine the word playlist, when “playlist” already has a fairly universally accepted definition? It’s that thing average people make for parties and road trips. Micah: Drake and Apple Music have a shared love of creating cultural events, and I think that’s what’s really behind the playlist push. If the rebranding works, it increases the importance of playlists, which could help Apple Music / every other streaming service. If they can change playlists from a format that’s an afterthought to something that you pay attention to, then it’s a huge win for streaming services. This mixtape is sort of a Trojan horse. People suddenly see the playlist as an object that confers value upon a selection of music. But that’s a long shot at best. Personally, I doubt even the King Meme Maker and the deepest corporate pockets in the world can turn playlists into something critical and valuable. I do wonder how many artists will follow Drake’s footsteps and release a “playlist” of their own. Lizzie: I think the idea of rebranding the playlist makes sense for streaming services — if you squint really hard. It makes much less sense for artists. Just because people will listen to a new Drake playlist or a new Kanye playlist doesn’t mean they’ll start listening to Apple’s in-house curated ones like Workout Wednesday or Hot Pop Hits For Your Hot Summer. And if you’re some random indie band, don’t count on changing the naming convention of your releases to help you get more listeners. Micah: Yeah, I think it was a ridiculous plan to begin with, but I’ve got a feeling Apple — much like Spotify and Tidal — will keep throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. They’re all burning through cash and that will continue until they can get enough users to make the bleeding stop. (It doesn’t affect Apple like it does Spotify and Tidal, but losing millions isn’t fun no matter how much money you have to fall back on.) It’s really going to be strange if one of Drake’s best projects is tied to a format that won’t mean anything in 30 years, but that’s where we’re at. Or maybe we’re wrong and the playlist could be the new album. Maybe normals will love it. Is it possible we’re wrong? Maybe the Drake mixtape will get people to care (and even purchase) the playlists made by MusicFanDrakeRulez420. What if one of Drake’s best projects is a playlist? Lizzie: I hate to suggest that we’re infallible Micah, but in this case I think we just might be. There’s no way the playlist is the new album; the playlist is already the playlist. And no matter how many times we read the album its last rites, it keeps coming back. Music industry execs can keep trying to reincarnate a living thing, or they can make sure it’s really dead first.

They questioned the quality of the tools the government had used to extract data from some of the more than 200 hard drives that were submitted as evidence in the case—including one from Moussaoui’s own laptop. When the government fired back, it leaned on a pair of official documents for backup: two reports produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that described the workings of the software tools in detail. The documents showed that the tools were the right ones for extracting information from those devices, the government lawyers argued, and that they had a track record of doing so accurately. It was the first time a NIST report on a digital-forensics tool had been cited in a court of law. That its first appearance was in such a high-profile case was a promising start for NIST’s Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project, which had begun about three years prior. Its mission for nearly two decades has been to build a standardized, scientific foundation for evaluating the hardware and software regularly used in digital investigations. Some of the tools investigators use are commercially available for download online, for relatively cheap or even free; others are a little harder for a regular person to get their hands on. They’re essentially hacking tools: computer programs and gadgets that hook up to a target device and extract their contents for searching and analysis. “The digital evidence community wanted to make sure that they were doing forensics right,” said Barbara Guttman, who oversees the Software Quality Group at NIST. That community is made up of government agencies—like the Department of Homeland Security or the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department’s research arm—as well as state and local law enforcement agencies, prosecuting and defense attorneys, and private cybersecurity companies. In addition to setting standards for digital evidence-gathering, the reports help users decide which tool they should use, based on the electronic device they’re looking at and the data they want to extract. They also help software vendors correct bugs in their products. Today, the CFTT’s decidedly retro webpage—emblazoned with a quote from an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation—hosts dozens of detailed reports about various forensics tools. Some reports focus on tools that recover deleted files, while others cover “file carving,” a technique that can reassemble files that are missing crucial metadata. The largest group of reports focuses on acquiring data from mobile devices. Smartphones have become an increasingly valuable source of evidence for law enforcement and prosecutors, because they’re now vast stores of private communication and information—but the sensitive nature of that data has made the government’s attempts to access it increasingly controversial. “It’s a very fast-moving space, and it’s really important,” Guttman said. “Any case could potentially involve a mobile phone.” It’s an odd feeling to flip through these public, unredacted government reports, which lay bare the frightful capabilities of commercially available mobile-extraction software. A report published just two weeks ago, for example, describes a tool called MOBILedit Forensic Express, which is made by San Francisco-based Compelson Labs. The tool works on Apple iPhones 6, 6S, and 6S Plus, two versions of Apple’s iPads, as well as several Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets. It can extract the following types of information from a mobile device: … deleted data, call history, contacts, text messages, multimedia messages, files, events, notes, passwords for wifi networks, reminders and application data from apps such as Skype, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, etc. The product page for MOBILedit Forensic Express claims the software is capable of cracking passwords and PINs to get into locked phones, but it’s not clear how effective that feature is. Getting into a locked, encrypted smartphone—especially an iPhone—is difficult, and it’s unlikely MOBILedit can bypass every modern smartphone’s security system. When the FBI tried to break into an iPhone 5C it found at the scene of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, it initially wasn’t able to access the phone’s data, and asked Apple for help. (Presumably, the FBI would have had access to MOBILedit and other commercial tools.) Apple refused, and the FBI brought a lawsuit against the company—but withdrew it when agents finally found a way in. Guttman says NIST doesn’t address phone encryption in its testing. “Encryption is certainly an issue for law enforcement access to phones and other digital media, but that issue is outside of our expertise and the type of work we do, which is focused on software quality and software understanding,” she said. The NIST report on MOBILedit describes how the tool fared against different combinations of smartphones and mobile operating systems. It found, for example, that the tool only obtained the first 69 characters in particularly long iOS notes. Besides that issue and five others, though, the tool largely behaved as it promised it would on iOS devices, the report says. “None of the tools are perfect,” Guttman said. “You really need to understand the strengths and limitations of the tools you’re using.” Unlike some more complex tools, MOBILedit doesn’t require an investigator to open up a smartphone and manipulate its internals directly—the software connects to the target phone with a cord, just like a user might to update his or her device. But law enforcement doesn’t necessarily need to force its way into a phone that it’s interested in searching, either by cracking open its case or by brute-forcing its passcode. In certain cases, officers can just ask—or pressure—the phone’s owner to open it. That’s what happened when Sidd Bikkannavar, a NASA engineer, was stopped by a customs agent on his way back to his native United States from a vacation: The officer just asked Bikkannavar to turn over his PIN, wrote it down, and took his smartphone to another room for about half an hour. When the agent returned the phone, he said he’d run “algorithms” to search for threats. It’s possible Bikkannavar’s phone was searched with one of the mobile acquisition tools that DHS has tested. The government’s growing library of forensic tool reports is supplemented by other testers. Graduate students at the Forensic Science Center at Marshall University in West Virginia, for example, do some of the same sorts of testing that NIST does. They often work with West Virginia State Police, which runs its own digital forensics lab on campus, to test extraction tools before they’re deployed. They post their results online, just like NIST does, to grow the body of shared knowledge about these tools. “If we weren’t validating our software and hardware systems, that would come up in court,” said Terry Fenger, the director of Marshall’s Forensic Science Center. “Part of the validation process is to show the courts that the i’s were dotted and t’s crossed.” A new NIST project called “federated testing” will make it easier for others to pitch in with their own test reports. It’s a free, downloadable disk image that contains all the tools needed to test certain types forensic software, and automatically generate a report. The first report from the project came in recently—from a public defender’s office in Missouri, an indication that digital forensics isn’t just the realm of law enforcement. I asked Fenger if the technical information being made public in these validation reports could help hackers or criminals circumvent them, but he said the validation data probably wouldn’t be of much value to a malicious hacker. “It’s more or less just the nuts and bolts of how things work,” Fenger said. “Most of the hackers out there are way beyond the level of these validations.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video Ovarian Psycos: The L.A.

Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by J. Scott Applewhite / AP What Devin Nunes's Bombshell Does and Doesn't Say David A. Graham The House intelligence committee chair, a Trump ally, muddied waters and gave comfort to the White House, but he provided no evidence of wrongdoing or support for Trump’s “wiretap” claims. Updated on March 22 at 5:24 p.m. In a head-spinning development on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Representative Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, revealed that … well, what Nunes revealed isn’t totally clear. Nunes held a brief press conference Wednesday afternoon saying that “on numerous occasions the Intelligence Community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.” But Nunes’s vague statements raised a host of questions, and his decision to announce them publicly and then go to the White House to brief President Trump, having not informed Democrats on the committee about his new findings, cast a pall of politics over the proceedings. Continue Reading Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters A 130-Year-Old Fact About Dinosaurs Might Be Wrong Ed Yong New research on the creatures’ family tree could “shake dinosaur paleontology to its core.” When I first read Matthew Baron’s new dinosaur study, I actually gasped. For most of my life, I’ve believed that the dinosaurs fell into two major groups: the lizard-hipped saurischians, which included the meat-eating theropods like Tyrannosaurus and long-necked sauropodomorphs like BrontosaurusYes, Brontosaurus. It’s a thing again. ; and the bird-hipped ornithischians, which included horned species like Triceratops and armored ones like Stegosaurus. That’s how dinosaurs have been divided since 1887. It’s what I learned as a kid. It’s what all the textbooks and museums have always said. And according to Baron, a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, it’s wrong. By thoroughly comparing 74 early dinosaurs and their relatives, Baron has radically redrawn the two major branches of the dinosaur family tree. Defying 130 years of accepted dogma, he splits the saurischians apart, leaving the sauropods in one branch, and placing the theropods with the ornthischians on the other. Put it this way: This is like someone telling you that neither cats nor dogs are what you thought they were, and some of the animals you call “cats” are actually dogs. Continue Reading Jim Bourg / Reuters Schiff: 'There Is More Than Circumstantial Evidence Now' David A. Graham “There is evidence that … is very much worthy of investigation” of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, the Democratic vice chair of the House intelligence committee tells Meet the Press Daily. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said MSNBC Wednesday afternoon that there is evidence that is “not circumstantial” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Schiff’s statement escalates the rhetoric on Capitol Hill about allegations of ties between Russia and the president’s circle. It follows two major developments. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his bureau is investigating collusion. Then, on Wednesday, Representative Devin Nunes, the chair of the House intelligence committee, made a puzzling announcement about so-called incidental collection of information from Trump team members. Nunes made that announcement without informing Schiff first. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Can Trumpism Last Without Minority Voters? Ronald Brownstein The president wants to convert the GOP into a “worker’s party” for voters of all races. But it may be too late. Compared with the ongoing firestorm over Russia and impending showdown over health care, President Trump’s meeting with Congressional Black Caucus leaders Wednesday might seem peripheral to a presidency careening through constant turmoil. But the session, which aired but didn’t resolve differences about the federal budget and other domestic issues, captured a critical test of his political movement’s long-term viability. One of Trump’s most frequently expressed goals is reconstructing the GOP as a “worker’s party” that appeals to blue-collar Americans across racial lines. Key Trump supporters recognize that building an enduring coalition will depend on attracting more working-class black, Hispanic, and other minority voters to the agenda of economic nationalism that has riveted their white counterparts. Continue Reading Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Maybe the Economy Isn't the Reason Why So Many American Men Aren't Working Alana Semuels Many experts have blamed a poor job market, but new research indicates that an overlooked cause may be poor health. CHARLOTTE, North Carolina—John LaRue is having a tough time of it these days. He used to move things for people, advertising his services on Craigslist. But work slowed up, and he became homeless and started sleeping in his truck, until, that is, someone stole it. Now, he told me, he’s fighting alcoholism and his health is deteriorating from living on the streets. I met LaRue at a Social Security office outside of Charlotte, where he was hiding his belongings in the bushes because he didn’t have anywhere to keep them and wasn’t allowed to bring them inside. “I feel like there’s a cloud over my head,” he told me. “It’s just been one thing after another.” LaRue is one among many. In 1957, 97 percent of men in America ages 25 to 54 were either working or looking for work. Today, only 89 percent are. Italy is the only OECD country with a lower labor-force participation rate for men in their prime years. Just why there are so many men who aren’t working is a matter of debate. In a 2016 report, President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers examined the declining labor-force participation rate and suggested that a drop-off in good jobs for low-skilled men was part of the explanation. Wages, the report theorized, are so low for many jobs that don’t require a college education that men don’t find it worth it to seek out bad jobs. A lack of job training and job-search assistance—when compared to other OECD countries—makes it more difficult for men to move into more lucrative fields. And a surge in incarceration has made it more difficult for men to find work when they leave prison, according to the report. Continue Reading Alkis Konstantinidis / Reuters Two Glimpses of a Grim Post-American Future David Frum New books point to gathering trouble in both Asia and Europe. As the United States under President Trump recedes from world leadership, things are not looking so good elsewhere on earth. Two new books—with similarly morbid titles—have arrived to warn of big trouble ahead for both the European Union and the emerging economies of Asia. The End of the Asian Century by Michael Auslin offers a point-by-point debunking of the “Asiaphoria” that gripped so many imaginations a decade ago. James Kirchick’s The End of Europe tours a continent in which democratic and liberal forces are losing ground to Russia-infatuated extremists of right and left. The conclusion left behind by a reading of the two together: The post-American world predicted by Fareed Zakaria a decade ago is shaping up as an exceedingly unstable and uncomfortable place. Continue Reading Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Steve Bannon's Would-Be Coalition of Christian Traditionalists Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins and Brittany Pheiffer Noble From American evangelicals to Russian Orthodox, they're united against Islam. Is that enough to overcome all that divides them? “If we do not bind together as partners with others in other countries then this conflict is only going to metastasize,” said Steve Bannon in 2014. He was referring to a conflict he perceived between “Judeo-Christian values” and “Islamic fascism.” Speaking to a conference held at the Vatican, he seemed to call for Christian traditionalists of all stripes to join together in a coalition for the sake of waging a holy war against Islam. The rhetoric of a looming civilizational war has proved persistent. Recent years have seen religious leaders from both the American Christian community and the Russian Orthodox community coming together to bemoan the decline of traditional values. One example is the 2015 Moscow meeting between Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Franklin Graham, son of the evangelist Billy Graham. The Patriarch lamented to Graham how, after decades of inspiring underground believers in the Soviet Union with its defense of religious freedom, the West has abandoned the shared “common Christian moral values” that are the bedrock of a universal “Christian civilization.” Continue Reading Lucas Jackson / Reuters Trump's Credibility Crisis Arrives James Fallows Warnings that the president’s cavalier disregard for truth would have real-world consequences were vindicated on Tuesday. Donald Trump’s first two months in office have obviously been rocky. But the disruptions have mainly been internally generated—Trump’s tweets, the tensions and shakeups in his staff, his battles with the press, the investigations—rather than responses to genuine external emergencies. By historic standards, not much has really “happened” in the outside world since January 20. Sooner or later, something will happen, and Trump and his administration will have to respond. In mid-April of his first year in office, the new president John Kennedy had to deal with Bay of Pigs fiasco that he had authorized. In early April of his first year, the new president George W. Bush had to manage the repercussions of Chinese and U.S. military planes colliding midair off Chinese territory, and the U.S. plane being forced to a landing at a Chinese base. (Not to mention what happened in September of his first year.) Continue Reading Reuters What Happens If Uber Fails? Adrienne LaFrance Even if the ride-sharing service goes under, it won't necessarily set off a bubble-popping chain reaction. The thing about a market bubble is that you don’t really know how big it is until it pops. So it doesn’t pop, and doesn’t pop, and doesn’t pop, until one day it finally pops. And by then it’s too late. The dot-com collapse two decades ago erased $5 trillion in investments. Ever since, people in Silicon Valley have tried to guess exactly when the next tech bubble will burst, and whether the latest wave of investment in tech startups will lead to an economic crash. “A lot of people who are smarter than me have come to the conclusion that we’re in a bubble,” said Rita McGrath, a professor of management at Columbia Business School. “What we’re starting to see is the early signals.” Those signals include businesses closing or being acquired, venture capitalists making fewer investments, fewer companies going public, stocks that appear vastly overpriced, and startup valuations falling. Continue Reading Jason Madara / Erik Tanner / Paul Spella / The Atlantic Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women? Liza Mundy Tech companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve conditions for female employees. Here’s why not much has changed—and what might actually work. One weekday morning in 2007, Bethanye Blount came into work early to interview a job applicant. A veteran software engineer then in her 30s, Blount held a senior position at the company that runs Second Life, the online virtual world. Good-natured and self-confident, she typically wore the kind of outfit—jeans, hoodie, sneakers—that signals coding gravitas. That day, she might even have been wearing what’s known as the “full-in start-up twin set”: a Second Life T-shirt paired with a Second Life hoodie. In short, everything about her indicated that she was a serious technical person. So she was taken aback when the job applicant barely gave her the time of day. He knew her job title. He knew she would play a key role in deciding whether he got hired. Yet every time Blount asked him a question about his skills or tried to steer the conversation to the scope of the job, he blew her off with a flippant comment. Afterward, Blount spoke to another top woman—a vice president—who said he’d treated her the same way.

Enrique Marroquin and Sam Beetham Image: Ashton Mucha Apple Music, Point counterpoint, Spotify 2 Comments Mar 20, 2017 Spotify Music streaming isn’t all about having access to a shit load of songs, it’s about changing the way you experience music. Spotify is undoubtedly the expert when it comes to streaming content in a unique and exciting way. Apple Music is Spotify’s next biggest competitor, but it fails to live up to Spotify’s allure. While Apple Music boasts around 40 million songs to Spotify’s 30 million plus (sadly, only Apple Music has been graced by the T-Swift collection), that number means nothing if the service is not user friendly. While you scroll through Apple Music’s main menu, you’ll see the familiar seamless and compact design Apple loves so much. But this is crap when it comes to this app, because Apple sacrifices usability for this sleek look. The main tabs are slides of album art covers and scattered lists of songs and albums that quickly become cumbersome to browse through. Spotify gives you a no-bullshit yet elegant layout, where you can find exactly what you’re looking for when you want it. One of Spotify’s biggest strengths is its focus on presenting you with playlists you’re going to care about and enjoy. My personal favourite is “Discover Weekly,” which is an algorithmically generated 30 song list made using your listening preferences and the preferences of other people with similar music tastes to you. This beautiful collection is handed down from Spotify heaven right to you, newly refreshed every Monday, and I’ll guarantee you’ll always find something to fall in love with. While Apple Music has genre specific DJ curated playlists, there’s a lot of unnecessary clutter when you’re looking for music from diverse styles and artists. Both Spotify and Apple Music charge the industry standard $10 a month for a single subscription, or $15 a month for a family account for all of these neat features. But if you’re a casual music listener who just wants to sit back and enjoy a couple albums for free, Spotify’s free ad-based mode has you covered. However, Apple Music has no such free service, so you’ll have to hand over that hard earned cash for a slightly less usable and limited service. — Enrique Marroquin Apple Music  In this constant battle for subscribers’ money, the one thing that sets Apple Music apart from Spotify is just how much they want to better Spotify at everything. And if you ask me, they’re doing a good job of it, too. In terms of layout, it’s a close battle. Spotify’s ugly yet usable layout is fine, I guess. But Apple Music’s layout is really just an expanded iTunes, meaning in addition to the sleek aesthetics and easy-to-use layout, it enables you to add old songs from your library or import your own .mp3 files. With Spotify, you won’t have the ability to store all your mixtapes from Datpiff.com, so what’s the point of listening to music then? Apple has muscled its way to getting the rights to exclusively stream some of the most-anticipated releases of recent memory. It’s cutthroat and capitalist to the core, but Apple Music wants to treat their subscribers right, and if that means fucking-over Spotify subscribers in the process, all the power to them. Sorry you didn’t get to listen to Blond or Views until the hype had already died down, but that one is on you. Taking a different approach to playlist, Apple Music offers musician-curated playlists and even its Beats1 Radio shows, which are collaborations with musicians ranging from Run The Jewels to Elton John. It’s this star power that separates these two services — would you rather put on “Generic Toronto Rap” playlist on Spotify, or OVOSOUND Radio courtesy of Drake himself? That said, Apple also has a constantly growing collection of playlists for every occasion. While both streaming services have similar costs — the $9.99 a month is the industry standard — both services offer a student discount at half price. Syke! Spotify’s student discount is not applicable in Canada, while Apple Music offers its service for $4.99 for every Canadian student. While Apple Music does not have a free version of its service, it generously offers an extended three-month free trial, instead of Spotify’s 30-day trial. Besides, nothing is more annoying than handing someone the aux cord and the first thing you hear is “The next 30 minutes are brought to you ad-free.” — Sam Beetham  Which is better?

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 20, 2017 2:13pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Technical Analyst: Apple Is Due For A 'Garden Variety' Correction, Not 'Carnage' Snap's Fortunes May Be Tied To Apple And Vodaphone iPad Refresh: What Analysts Are Missing (Seeking Alpha) Few people outside of China are familiar with the billionaire entrepreneur Duan Yongping. He is the founder of Oppo and Vivo, two of the leading smartphone brands in China and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s most resilient competitors. As of July of last year, Oppo was China's largest smartphone maker with a 22.9 percent market share versus Apple's 9 percent stake. Apple Is 'Stubborn' Yongping spoke with Bloomberg in an extremely rare interview and offered his take on why he is beating Apple in the Chinese market — a market that is vital to Apple's growth. Yongping said that Apple's biggest problem is that it failed to adapt its phones to local markets. He recognized this flaw and conquered the Chinese market by designed phones Apple refused to do, namely a more price sensitive device that boasts high-end features. In fact, he even said Apple is "too stubborn sometimes" and this is why the company "couldn't be us in China." He did, however, acknowledge that Apple does make a lot great products, including its operating system which is why the iPhone is one of the four devices he personally uses. Ironically enough, Yongping is also a large investor in Apple as he recognizes and appreciates the company's dominance across the world. He also said that Apple's profits could reach the $100 billion mark in five years. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from," Yongping said. "We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves."

The iPhone and Mac behemoth hit a new high on Monday as another analyst sees the stock on its way to $155. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Mar 20, 2017 at 2:36PM The bullishness for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment continues. The world's most valuable consumer tech company saw its shares hit a new high on Monday, after another Wall Street firm jacked up its price target. Apple has now soared 33% over the past year, a big move for a stock that seemed to be losing favor in a climate of sluggish growth and thinning margins. Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri was the one talking up the stock's prospects on Monday, reiterating his outperform rating while boosting his price goal from $135 to $155. The move itself isn't a surprise. Apple shares have been rising so quickly that Arcuri's bullish rating didn't make sense with the earlier $135 price target. You have to go all the way back to mid-February to find the last time the stock has closed below $135.  Arcuri is excited about the prospects for the iPhone 8, which should roll out later this year. He's obviously not the first Wall Street pro to hype up Apple's next iPhone. The game-changing iPhone rolled out 10 years ago this summer, and all of the rumblings point to Apple raising the bar this time around to celebrate the milestone. Arcuri feels that a lot of iPhone users have been reluctant to upgrade to the latest generations, but that aging base -- particularly in China -- should lead to hearty demand for the iPhone 8. Image source: Apple.    True calling Analysts have been nudging their profit forecasts higher instead of lower these days, particularly for next fiscal year as many expect the iPhone 8 to hit the market in September -- just as fiscal 2017 is coming to a close. Wall Street's profit targets for fiscal 2018 have gone from $10.04 a share three months ago to $10.15 now. Arcuri feels that a return to accelerating growth fueled by the iPhone 8 will justify multiple expansion for Apple's stock. The stock is fetching less than 16 times this fiscal year's earnings estimates and less than 14 times next year's forecast. Rising earnings and multiple expansion can be a one-two punch to big stock gains despite Apple hitting new highs already on Monday.  Arcuri isn't alone. RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani is reiterating his bullish rating on the stock and sticking to the same $155 price target where Arcuri is now perched. Daryanani is also encouraged by some of the expected features for the iPhone 8 that include wireless charging and a complete redesign that may include a curved OLED screen on a high-end model. He feels that it will match or beat the iPhone 6.  Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson is also parked at $155, but he may be even more bullish. He's talking up Apple's services revenue, a segment that's still a smart part of the revenue mix but growing quickly. There are chunkier margins to be had on the services end, and as that segment continues to grow, Olson argues that Apple could be worth as much as $195 in two years. So, yes, $155 may be the next stop -- but it won't be the final destination.   Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple’s Tim Cook speaks up for globalization during speech in China By Levi Sumagaysay / March 20, 2017 at 9:49 AM Apple CEO Tim Cook defended globalization and cautioned against isolationism in a speech in China over the weekend — in a stark contrast to the policies being pursued by the new U.S. president. “I think the worst thing would be to — because it didn’t help everyone — is to say it’s bad and do less of that,” Cook said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “I think the reality is you can see that countries in the world…that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people.” The speech at the China Development Forum came after Cook announced last week that Apple would boost its investment in research centers in China. Cook, who spoke at the annual forum for the first time, also called for China to continue to “open itself” to other global trade, Reuters reported. Apple has a delicate relationship with China — an important market for it and any global company — and also is facing pressure from President Trump to make its products in the United States instead of in China and other countries. While Cook did not mention Trump, his comments seem to be an implicit criticism of the administration’s hostility to globalization and embrace of isolationism. U.S.-China relations are growing increasingly fragile under Trump, whose comments and plans for tariffs have sparked concerns about a possible trade war. Apple and other Silicon Valley companies could be greatly affected by such a war, something that Chinese media has warned about. Apple also joined other tech companies in speaking out against Trump’s isolationist policies, including the president’s first attempt to ban refugees and immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries from the United States, an effort that was struck down by the courts. Cook said hundreds of Apple employees were affected by the ban. In his speech, Cook also reportedly spoke of Apple’s commitment to its users’ data privacy, something that it has had tensions with both the U.S. government and the Chinese government over.   Photo: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at a product launch event on March 21, 2016, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino.

Tim Cook should move to China. dalethorn Tim Cook can stay there. What a creep. QZ888 In developed countries, winners of globalization are capitalists, whereas losers are middle class. dalethorn Capitalism is investment – building capital, loaning it to entrepreneurs or individuals for profit. Good capitalism is about competition, where the best succeed and the lazy or incompetent lose. Bad capitalism is monopolistic, greedy, uncaring about labor or the environment, and tries to elect “leaders” who will pass legislation to protect their monopolies. Globalism is the ultimate in greed, and concentration of power in the hands of the elite, who regard labor as serfs on the global plantation, and who regard the environment as resources to plunder for profit.         Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Will AirPods end up being bigger for Apple than the Apple… Amazon ‘ripping consumers off’ by tricking them… Elon Musk unhappy with Trump’s NASA bill Sexual assault on Facebook Live: Girl, 15, allegedly… AT&T halts its advertising on YouTube over content…     Archives Archives Select Month March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

The change was first spotted by MacRumors, who cites an unnamed senior AppleCare advisor and multiple other tipsters, and while it has yet to officially hit the AppleCare+ product page, customers can input the serial number of their device in Apple’s extended coverage eligibility tool to see the new purchase option. MobileSyrup was able to confirm Apple’s updated AppleCare+ policy is active in Canada by inputting the serial number of an iPhone 7 that was purchased more than 60 days ago. The change brings AppleCare+ for iPhone in line with the Mac and Apple TV programs, which can be purchased within the standard one-year limited warranty period. According to MacRumors, the change is being instituted retroactively so that any iPhone sold that is still within its first year is eligible for AppleCare+. The publication states its sources also insisted that the change applies to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch, though there’s been no confirmation on that front yet. AppleCare for iPhone also covers EarPods, Lightning to USB cables and defective batteries that retain less than 80 percent of their original capacity. With iPhone AppleCare in Canada, screen damage incidents cost $39 CAD to repair, while any other damage costs $129 CAD.

Leaked photos & illustrations of the iPhone 7s When will the iPhone 7s be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus handsets for 2017? (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) Welcome to our iPhone 7s rumour roundup, in which we gather and analyse the latest clues and speculation about the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, new features and more. If you've come here in search of information about the current iPhone range, allow us to direct you to our iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7 Plus review, iPhone buying guide 2017 and best iPhone deals UK. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus, during a special event on 7 September last year. But we're already looking ahead to the next iPhone in 2017. In this article we sift through the clues and evidence pointing to Apple's iPhone 7s launch later this year, and predict the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, design and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information emerges, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone 7s rumours. Updated,  21 March 2017, with the announcement of the (Product)Red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; 20 March 2017, with news that the third model of iPhone to be announced might be called iPhone Edition, along with 'confirmation' that the larger iPhone will feature a curved display; on 13 March, with the worrying prediction that sourcing components for the new iPhone's 3D camera is proving so difficult that months of delays are to be expected; on 6 Mar, with another report predicting that the late-2017 iPhones will have the biggest screens yet; on 20 Feb, with patents showcasing an embedded fingerprint scanner, along with claims that wireless charging might only be available on the top-end iPhone, and maybe not until 2018.

From around £600 to around £940. Read more here. What new features will the iPhone 7s get? Wireless charging, edge-to-edge screen with integrated Home button, augmented reality features. Read more here. When will the iPhone 7s be released? The iPhone 7 was announced on 7 September, and pre-orders began on 9 September; it went on sale on 16 September. (Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Sep 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 2 Sep 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Any hopes for a surprise spring announcement were scuppered when Apple rolled out its March update for 2017. As expected, Apple didn't announce any major new iPhone models, but instead just upgraded the storage of the iPhone SE and launched a new (Product)Red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  'Months of delay' due to 3D camera This isn't what we wanted to hear at all. SlashGear's sources say that STMicroelectronics, reportedly the firm in line to make the 3D camera on the new iPhones, is struggling to hit production targets and has asked for more time. "That would mesh with earlier rumours that Apple won't even start mass producing the iPhone 8 until September," says the site, "the very month the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are scheduled to launch. Depending on the yield rate for the revolutionary iPhone, we probably don't expect to see it in the market until a month or two later." iPhone 7s production 'to start earlier than expected' Before the 3D component delay story broke, we'd been hearing the opposite: that Apple was gearing up to start production of the new iPhones earlier than normal. So said analysts at BlueFin Research Partners, quoted by Barron's Tech Trader Daily. "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next-generation iPhones earlier than historical norms," write John Donovan and Steve Mullane. "Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL's normal build cadence." The researchers play down any suggestions that this indicates an earlier launch date, however, so we are left to wonder why the company feels it needs longer to produce the iPhones. Are they going to be technically more demanding to manufacture, or is it a question of volume? Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump did not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. More of this sort of vague thing has emerged since then. Trump stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means.  To be frank, these statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was originally going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) It was understood, rather boringly, that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the company has since stated that it will merely be receiving, configuring and distributing servers from this hub rather than building any products. Any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the iPhone, will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) What will the new iPhone be called? Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". iPhone X Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at the research firm Cowen and Company, has sent out a client note predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - the letter X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. It's rather leftfield, and we'll count it as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, but it's actually not the worst idea in the world: those relentlessly rising model numbers draw attention to quite how long Apple has been churning out iPhones, and make each one seem like merely the latest update in a long line of identikit devices. This would be a statement of intent, a declaration that this one is different. We'll talk a bit about Timothy Arcuri's other predictions later in this article. iPhone Edition There are also rumours suggesting that there will be an 'iPhone Edition' announced alongside the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus at this year's iPhone event in September, boasting a body made from new materials (prototypes include glass and ceramic) and possibly a Home button-less design. Not much else is known about what the high end iPhone Edition might offer, just that it'll be "vey much behind" the release date of the standard iPhone 7s and 7s Plus.  Macworld poll: What will Apple call the next iPhone? What will the iPhone 7s look like? What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. Edge-to-edge screen, with no Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s. Technology that could help with this development was announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Funnily enough, Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple is plotting the use of an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, refers to "Electronic devices having displays with openings", and appears to cover various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them, thanks to small (and in most cases tiny) holes in the screen. This in turn means Apple can expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it doesn't need to leave space around the edge for the various apertures and controls we've grown used to. The holes could be filled in with a material that doesn't block radio signals, for instance, although in many cases they will be so small that the user wouldn't notice them. Then, in February 2017, another patent appeared detailing another method of embedding a Touch ID sensor within the display of the iPhone - although this one is a little different. Rather than featuring ultrasonic- or electric field differences to scan your fingerprint, the latest patent suggests using infrared emitters and sensors placed along the RGB LEDs in an OLED display. Interestingly, the requirement of an OLED display suggests that the option may only be available on the high-end 2017 iPhone.  No physical buttons at all A February 2017 report by Fast Company, which made headlines primarily for its prediction that an iPhone could top the thousand-dollar mark for the first time, also raised the possibility that the late-2017 iPhone might not have any physical buttons at all. "Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button from the iPhone," says the site, basing its comments on a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans. "It would become a button to touch, not press. There's even a chance that the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away, our source says, replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal." Read Fast Company's full report for more juicy details - there's lots of good stuff. Larger screen Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, who we quoted earlier, has also made some predictions about the screen to be included in what he predicted will be called the 'iPhone X'. There will be three models, Arcuri says: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones, to match the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a new 5.8-inch iPhone - the biggest ever iPhone screen. This latter, clearly flagship model, will have an OLED screen and a "wraparound" design with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated under the glass, with no separate Home button. Incidentally, The Investor reports that Samsung will be making LED panels for the late-2017 iPhone. A new deal struck between Apple and subsidiary company Samsung Display is worth 5 trillion won, or about £3.5m, and involves the supply of 60 million units. (Apple will need more than that - the company sold 78.29 million iPhones in Q1 2017 - and usually makes deals with multiple screen suppliers.) Further weight has been added to the theory that one of the new iPhone models to be unveiled this autumn will have a bigger screen than ever before: a whopping 5.8 inches, if a report from Nikkei is to be believed. "The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations - two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display," the site predicts. "By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet growing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700." Curved/flexible screen There have been consistent rumours, stretching back years, that Apple is going to make an iPhone with a curved or flexible screen - although flexible might be a misleading word to use here. Very few people imagine that an iPhone in the near future will actually be able to 'flex' in any meaningful way (being folded in half to fit in a pocket, for example); most pundits just mean that it will have curved edges so that the screen continues a little way down the sides, like the Samsung S7 Edge. Some relatively firm evidence was added to this theory in January 2017, when the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, confirmed [paywall article] that it is ready to start building flexible displays. (Again, this is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the company didn't mention Apple by name, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and analysts are understandably putting two and two together. This idea seems to be backed up by a recent report from Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, which claims that the larger iPhone will feature a curved display, although it'll be "gentler than screens in Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge handsets". Why? The site claims that it's mainly due to making curved glass covers that match the screens. Despite the curved nature of the display, the source claims that it'll add no extra functionality to the phone.  However, MacRumors' sources think otherwise: the site quotes analyst Wayne Lam as saying: "We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design." Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 - that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. In March 2017 Apple did announce a red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but as part of its partnership with HIV/AIDS organisation (Product)Red. This is the first time it's launched an iPhone as part of the (Red) range, though it's possible it could do so again for the 7s - though if so we wouldn't expect it at launch. It seems more likely that we might see the 7s in September 2017, and a (Red) version the following March 2018. Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. What new features will we see in the iPhone 7s? Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts 3D-sensing camera After the dual-lens camera and associated Portrait Mode offered in the late-2016 iPhone generation (on the iPhone 7 Plus only, of course), many pundits believe Apple will again try to lead on a headline camera feature for the iPhone 7s, this time focusing on the front-facing camera. Ever-quotable analyst Ming Chi Kuo predicts a "revolutionary" front camera in this year's iPhones, including an infrared component (transmitter and receiver) that "can sense the 3D space in front of it", in the words of 9to5Mac. Infrared signals are beamed from the phone, and then detected when they bounce back. Having the ability to map out the 3D space in front of an iPhone has numerous possible applications but two are most obvious: 3D selfies, and games. Kuo believes that Apple will upgrade to rear-facing 3D sensors in future if the front-facing version goes down well. Apple's iPhone updates have an enormous effect on the company's bottom line, and accordingly numerous Wall Street analyst firms have dissected the state of augmented reality technology and the likely nature and impact of a mooted 3D camera/scanner appearing in the late-2017 iPhone. Stephen Milunovich of UBS strikes an optimistic note, predicting that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" and citing Apple's hardware expertise and large coherent user base as reasons why it can make AR work. Morgan Stanley's researchers are less convinced, raising doubts over widespread consumer appeal (noting the rapid drop-off in interest seen even by Pokemon Go) and questioning whether smartphones will have sufficient processing power to deliver the concept satisfactorily. And KGI's famed Apple expert Ming Chi Kuo thinks that developing successful AR applications will enable Apple to redefine currently popular products such as the iPhone, boost low-takeup products such as the Apple Watch and move into new areas such as car tech. For more detail on analysts' take on the mooted iPhone 3D scanner, we recommend Business Insider's comprehensive review of the material. Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component. Despite the suggestion that wireless charging will come to all three models of the 2017 iPhone, a new report from Macotakara citing sources inside Apple's Asian operations claims otherwise. The site's source claims that wireless charging will only be made available on the most expensive iPhone 8, and you'll also need to buy an adaptor on top of the initial cost of the phone. However, while some may be initially shocked by the news that you'll have to buy the accessories separately, this is commonplace amongst Android smartphones that offer wireless charging capabilities. If you thought that was bad, the latest counter rumour suggests that we could be waiting yet another year for Apple to introduce wireless charging on the iPhone. Anonymous 9to5Mac sources claim that while Apple is looking into wireless charging, the company might wait until 2018 to introduce it - although we're not so sure about that. With so many sources, including Ming-Chi Kuo who has an impeccable record when it comes to Apple leaks, suggesting that it will make an appearance on the 2017 iPhone, we're inclined to believe it. While it seems that analyst and anonymous sources can't decide on whether wireless charging will appear on one- or three 2017 iPhones, what we do know for sure is that Apple is seriously considering the technology. Why? Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, the group behind the Qi wireless charging standard, to rub shoulders with the likes of Samsung, Lenovo and others, all of which offer wireless charging solutions for their smartphones. Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours Updated 3D Touch AppleInsider is predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will feature second-gen 3D Touch with greater sensitivity and greater gesture versatility than the current version, thanks to changes in the underlying design. According to a research note from the respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by the site, the next iPhone will have 3D Touch based around thin film instead of flexible printed circuit boards. While this would improve the way the technology works, it would create design headaches; for one thing, thin film sensors don't incorporate the metal conductive plate that protects the current screen from deformation, so Apple would have to add a passive metal backplate or risk a repeat of the Bendgate scenario. The development would also add to manufacturing costs, and with UK prices already up to account for the weakness of the pound, Apple hasn't got much room for manoeuvre if it wants to protect its profit margin. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts What will the iPhone 7s cost in the UK? We think the iPhone 7s will start at a little over £600 in the UK. Here are the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which are already higher than the previous generation were at launch after Apple's wide UK price increases. It's likely that the iPhone 7s will be priced at a similar point. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 iPhone 7 Plus (32GB): £719 iPhone 7 Plus (128GB): £819 iPhone 7 Plus (256GB): £919 But it's felt that there will be another price jump, even if only a small one. One theory holds that the next iPhone will break the thousand-dollar barrier in the US for the first time (this is according to Fast Company, citing a source "with knowledge of Apple's plans"). A thousand-dollar US price tag would most likely translate to a UK price of £940 or so, although obviously that would be the top-end model. For comparison, in the US the 128GB cellular-equipped edition of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,029; in the UK this model costs £939. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of storage costs £919, or $969 in the US. Leaked photos & illustrations of the iPhone 7s It's a little early to expect leaked photos from Apple's supply chain - we'd imagine the iPhone 7s is still in the design stages - we have seen our first concept illustrations. These are imaginative images created by talented artists and design illustrators with ideas about what they'd like to see in the next generation of Apple's smartphone. Thadeu Brandao has come up with some lovely, minimalist concepts for the iPhone 7s: Brandao described his thought process as "mixing the design of iPhone 4 and 7", and you'll note the lack of a headphone port once again, and the Home button integrated into the screen. Brandao also worked on the following concept video posted by the YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone: On the next page: Everything you need to know about 2016's iPhone 7 launch >> >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: iPhone , Rumour , iPhone 6 , iOS 9 , iPhone 6s , iPhone 7 Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Bringing back a glass or ceramic backside to the iPhone is designed to support Apple's new wireless charging technology.   In a new report by DigiTimes this morning they note that "Wireless charging demand is expected to pick up with the arrival of the next-generation iPhones and the trend is also expected to prompt smartphone vendors to adopt glass or ceramic-based chassis instead of the traditional metal one because of its new charging method.   Chassis makers have also been pushing physical direct connection (PDC) technology to help improve these new chassis' yield rates and costs. Sources from chassis makers pointed out that the PDC technology is to use chemicals to etch nanometer holes on raw materials such as metal, glass and ceramic and then use an injection method to laminate the materials with plastic parts.   Since metal chassis will create interference with the wireless charging's induction coil, glass or ceramic type of chassis has become popular among smartphone vendors that are looking to release wireless charging smartphones."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple is reportedly planning to bring augmented reality to the masses. Recommended for You Andrew Ng Is Leaving Baidu in Search of a Big New AI Mission The Curious Case of the Quantum Theory of Humor How a Boy’s Lazarus-like Revival Points to a New Generation of Drugs Self-Driving Cars’ Spinning-Laser Problem Google’s New Tool Says Nearly 80 Percent of Roofs Are Sunny Enough for Solar Panels According to Bloomberg, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, plans for the company to add AR features to the iPhone and, later, launch a pair of smart glasses that allow users to augment their reality. The hope: to make the technology a widely available and compelling consumer product before other companies manage to, in order to provide a much-needed new reason to stick with Apple. Apple will be playing a high-stakes game, betting that we’ll all want to improve our digital lives with augmented reality. But while software for a phone is one thing, the company will have to work hard to avoid repeating past mistakes in the arena of wearable devices like the Apple Watch and Google Glass.  This is by no means the first time we’ve heard reports of Apple’s AR ambitions. Last summer Cook said it was a technology that Apple was “doing a lot of things on behind [the] curtain.” And late last year reports surfaced that Apple was interested in building AR spectacles. The latest report, though, suggests that Apple has been doubling down on its efforts to advance the technology. It has amassed a large team of software developers and hardware engineers with experience working on the Oculus Rift and Microsoft HoloLens VR headsets, as well as staff with backgrounds in visual effects and computer games. Sources tell Bloomberg that progress is being made, most notably with software for the iPhone. It describes, for instance, SnapChat-esque real-time video effects, as well as new ways to manipulate photographs. It’s likely that some of these features are similar to those already being developed by Baidu, whose software makes use of machine learning to add detail to the real world. The new Apple software might not necessarily make it onto the iPhone as is. But its development certainly suggests that AR features may soon find their way onto the handsets. The glasses are “further down the road,” according to Bloomberg. Rightly so. That’s a much larger challenge, with far more to go wrong. First, there’s the hardware to nail: if Apple doesn’t want a Google Glass-style failure on its hands, it’ll need to create something that’s both polished and (relatively) affordable. While Bloomberg says the device would lean on the processing power of an iPhone for the most part, there are still plenty of tricky design choices to be made, not least relating to optics and batteries. Second, as we’ve argued before, Apple runs the risk of repeating its Watch mistake and building a new piece of hardware without a clearly defined use. The company will perhaps be hoping that its legion of experts can create, not just a compelling hardware offer, but also the kinds of software that will make the device fun and useful—maybe even something people soon find they can’t live without. But those are ambitious goals for an unproven technology. It will be interesting to see how Apple’s AR turns out in reality—and whether or not its gamble pays off.

Photo / AP Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple's chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. In his quest to further Apple's ambitious bid to bring AR to the masses, Apple has opened a Wellington office and lured several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Cook has likened AR's game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all "have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you." Investors impatient for Apple's next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say people familiar with Apple's plans, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. As previously reported by Bloomberg, Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content-movies, maps and more-to the wearer. While the glasses are a ways off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It's an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80 per cent to US$165 billion by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. "It's something they need to do to continue to grow," he says, "and defend against the shift in how people use hardware." Continued below. Related Content Retro iPhone 7 Plus inspired by vintage Apple Mac goes on sale US Apple users urge company to 'do the right thing' and pay NZ taxes Apple pays zero tax in NZ despite sales of $4.2 billion Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it's less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be "enclosed in something." Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn't a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they'll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key too. If Apple's AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments. Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off. Gene Munster, analyst When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multi-disciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes US$950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who's in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. "He's a really sharp guy," says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. "He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going." Last spring, in a sign that it's serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell's team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say: Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple's first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. "To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments," Munster says.

This enhanced status page is important as Apple is the source of a growing number of services that users rely on daily. This page makes it easy to see if Apple is the one to blame, or if it is a problem with a specific device or carrier. The new Apple System Status Page is much more detailed than earlier versions, offering a status light for over 30 individual services and features. The page includes a timeline of events, to show when outages start and end as well. Apple’s new system status page shows if iMessage is down, and the status of other Apple services. Apple services are mostly reliable, but “iMessage down”, became a popular search term in September and again in November for days as the service went offline for extended periods. This page also shows if the App Store is down, or if iTunes is down, which occurs for a small section of users on a fairly regular basis. The timeline shows the iTunes store was down for an hour for some users on Wednesday. Check if IMessage is down and see who is affected. If you can’t send an iMessage, make a Facetime call, or use Siri this is the place to start. Some of the most important services monitored on this page are, iMessage Sirie Game Center Dictation Maps FaceTime Photo Stream Find My iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac iCloud data When any of these services go down, this page will offer more information on the outage and a link to support if there is no reported issue. There is no help, like how to send an iMessage as a text, but it’s a big improvement over the earlier version. It’s a good idea to bookmark this page, http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/, on the iPhone or iPad so it’s easy to check while mobile. There is no mobile friendly version of the page, but it’s easy enough to use on a smaller screen.

Apple’s online store typically goes offline due to product refreshes. MacRumors points out that the page specifies that the Apple Online Store “will be updated” which could mean that the site will either have backend upgrades or new products will be available. With so many products desperately needing upgrades, any sort of updates could be warranted. Last week it was reported that something new could be coming as soon as this week. Apple has typically held spring events in March in the last few years, but rumors have suggested that it has been delayed until April this year. Apple also lists Photo Print Products are also scheduled for maintenance at the same time, which could mean that they’ll be updating the infrastructure for that or suggest that this maintenance is not related to new products.

Let’s Talk iOS 179: Not just a virtual or augmented reality The top stories of the week on iDB The best smart scales   skip to main content skip to main menu     Galaxy S8 may capture slow motion video at 1,000 FPS & cost less than iPhone 8 By Christian Zibreg, Mar 20, 2017 Tweet 15 Comments According to prolific smartphone leakster Evan Blass, Samsung’s regular Galaxy S8 and the rumored Galaxy S8 Plus models will occupy prices between Apple’s iterative iPhone 7s and a new premium iPhone 8 model that will likely cost more than $1,000 unlocked. Blass also shared genuine-looking press renderings of the next Galaxy smartphone. Meanwhile, SamMobile is reporting that Galaxy S8’s slow motion video capture mode could blow iPhone 7 out of the water with the ability to capture a thousand frames per second. Apple’s camera partner Sony recently announced a new 19-megapixel CMOS sensor (IMX400), built it into the new Xperia XZ Premium, that can capture slo-mo video at 960 frames per second. Samsung’s upcoming flagship phones could be priced as follows: Galaxy S8 with 5.1″ AMOLED screen: 799€ (about $860) Galaxy S8+ with 6.2″ AMOLED screen:899€ (about $965) Galaxy DeX docking station: 150€ (about $162) Galaxy GearVR headset: 129€ (about $140) Galaxy Gear360 camera: 229€ (about $247) Please keep in mind that direct currency conversions don’t really work in this case due to a lot higher cost of doing business in Europe than in the United States causing consumer electronics and other products to cost a premium in Europe. The quoted European prices could be marked up or down, depending on factors like value-added sales tax, carrier promotion and so forth. As an example, a contract-free 32GB iPhone 7 is priced at $649 in the United States. Over in France, however, the same phone costs €769, which works out to about $830. When it releases later this year, the iterative iPhone 7s refresh could be priced the same, with the iPhone 7 series becoming a $100 or so cheaper. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube As opposed to the Galaxy S8 model with a 5.8-inch AMOLED display, the new Galaxy S8 Plus edition show come outfitted with a massive screen measuring 6.2 inches and featuring Quad HD+ resolution of 3,200-by-1,800 pixels. Other rumored features could include an in-screen fingerprint reader, a reworked Home button embedded into the display assembly, iris scanning, wireless charging, a 64-gigabyte baseline and more. The upcoming Galaxy phones will run Samsung’s new virtual assistant, called Bixby, which will focus on completeness, context awareness and cognitive tolerance, the South Korean conglomerate announced this morning. The new Galaxy phones will  be offered in several color options, including Black Sky, Orchid Grey and Arctic Silver, as seen from left to right on the leaked press renderings top of post. SamMobile recently pointed us to a Chinese-language Naver report claiming that Samsung’s engineers built more DRAM directly into the camera sensor to give the next Galaxy the ability to capture slow-motion video at an astounding thousand frames per second. The rear-facing iSight camera found on the iPhone 7 series is capable of capturing Slo-Mo video at either 120 frames per second in full HD (1080p) video resolution or twice the FPS at 720p. As per SamMobile’s sources, the next Galaxy won’t use Sony’s new 19-megapixel IMX400 CMOS sensor. The phone’s front-facing selfie camera will have eight megapixels and come with autofocus (iPhone 7 has a seven-megapixel FaceTime HD camera out the front). An additional 3.7-megapixel RGB camera sensor for iris scanning could be part of the Galaxy update as well. Samsung will release new Galaxy phones along with new tablets and other products at its Unpacked media event, scheduled to take place on Wednesday, March 29 and with first shipments scheduled to commence on April 21. The event will be live-streamed via samsung.com/galaxy.

Both macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 8 (build 16E192b) and watchOS 3.2 beta 7 (build 14V5249a) can be deployed over-the-air on devices running a prior beta and a using a special configuration profile that can be downloaded from Apple’s portal for developers and beta-testers. The latest Sierra beta follows the previous release four days ago. watchOS 3.2 beta 7 follows a sixth beta, which was seeded to registered Apple developers six days ago. Apple should release the major iOS 10.3, macOS Sierra 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 software updates later this month, maybe even later this week following possible product refreshes that could occur tomorrow morning. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 features macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings Night Shift Mode to your Mac. Night Shift mode was originally designed to help iOS users adjust the temperature of their display from cool to warm, manually or based on the time of day. You can access Night Shift for Mac in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri. A dedicated preference pane makes it easy to quickly adjust when a Mac’s display should start gradually shifting from blue to yellow in order to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is said to cause sleeping problems. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube In addition to Night Shift, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 includes Dictation support for Shanghainese, an updated PDF API fixing a few annoying bugs and a new iCloud Analytics feature while enabling Siri look-ups of cricket schedules, scores and rosters for two new cricket leagues and other perks. Keep in mind that macOS betas are available for public beta testing to those enrolled to Apple’s Beta Software Program. watchOS 3.2 features watchOS 3.2 brings Theater Mode to Apple Watch via a new toggle in Control Center. With Night Mode on Apple Watch, features like Raise to Wake and audible alerts get disabled or muted temporarily while still keeping system haptics on. According to Apple: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. Be sure to read our full coverage of Theater Mode in watchOS 3.2. watchOS 3.2 will also let you control apps via Siri, like you can on iOS 10. You’ll be able to tell your Apple Watch to send a message, make a payment, book a ride, start a workout, call a contact or search photos in compatible apps. We’ll update the article with any changes found in the latest betas. Send us your own findings via tips@iDownloadBlog.com or share them in the comments below.

Monday, March 20, 2017 by: David Gutierrez Tags: Apple, E-waste, Heavy metals (Natural News) Every time Apple releases a new version of one of its bestselling mobile devices, consumers eagerly line up to upgrade their devices as quickly as possible. But what happens to all those discarded iPhones, iPads and iPods, along with the countless devices that are lost or broken every day? Mostly, they end up buried in landfills or burned in incinerators, poisoning our land, air and water with toxic heavy metals. “Electronic waste isn’t just waste — it contains some very toxic substances, such as mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, beryllium and brominated flame retardants,” according to the organization e-Stewards. “When the latter are burned at low temperatures, they create additional toxins, such as halogenated dioxins and furans — some of the most toxic substances known to humankind.” And while Apple says it has removed flame retardants from its products, there is no real way to remove toxic heavy metals that are essential for the functioning of batteries and circuit boards. Heavy metals such as those contained in Apple’s products are elements, meaning that they can never be broken down into less toxic forms. That’s part of what makes infamous toxins such as arsenic, mercury and lead so insidious. Many of these metals, like the three mentioned above, also accumulate in the body or environment over time. They have been linked to health complaints as severe as cancer, endocrine disruption, reproductive disorders and brain damage. Toxic metals included in Apple’s products include cadmium, lead, lithium and nickel in batteries; lead in wiring boards; arsenic in light emitting diodes; beryllium in power supply boxes; mercury in LCD monitors and some batteries; and rare earth elements in microchips. Very few of these toxic elements are responsibly reclaimed when a product reaches the end of its life. In the United States, 70 percent of e-waste is simply dumped into landfills. That includes about 30 million computers per year. In Europe, 100 million cell phones are discarded annually. Other sources of e-waste include tablets, office electronics, televisions and other entertainment devices. Globally, they add up to about 50 million tons of e-waste each year. This amount is expected to balloon as everyday devices continue to become more computerized and information technology continues to spread around the world. But what about the 25-30 percent of e-waste that gets “recycled?” As it turns out, most of that e-waste still ends up in incinerators or contaminating local water supplies. But most of that contamination (70-80 percent) is “outsourced” by the wealthy world to poorer countries in Asia and Africa. E-waste “recycling” practices in China, India and Pakistan typically involve practices such as riverside acid baths to leach out a small fraction of the rare metals contained in electronics. This produces significant water contamination. The rest of the “recycled” product is usually dumped or incinerated. A Greenpeace report found that an e-waste “recycling” site in Ghana consisted mostly of an incineration site found to contain “severe contamination with hazardous chemicals.” “In the yards, unprotected workers, many of them children, dismantle computers and TVs with little more than stones in search of metals that can be sold. The remaining plastic, cables and casing [are] either burnt or simply dumped,” the report reads. “Some of the samples contained toxic metals including lead in quantities as much as one hundred times above background levels.” Of course, Apple is not the only source of dangerous e-waste. The average US household contains 24 electronic devices, of which only a fraction are made by Apple. As our society becomes increasingly high-tech, e-waste is a problem that will need to be grappled with. In a 2010 study, Dustin Mulvaney of the University of California-Berkeley warned that the supposedly “green” industry of solar panels is poised to become a major source of toxic e-waste. Because solar panels have a lifespan of 20 years, manufacturers have given little thought to recycling or disposing of them. But breakage is already causing the waste to pile up, and a projected explosion in solar panels may give us a new e-waste crisis a few decades down the line.

The watchOS 3.2 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General --> Software Update after installing the proper configuration profile on the iPhone. To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. watchOS 3.2 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install and will only be available to developers. Apple does not make watchOS betas available to the public as there is no way to downgrade the software on an Apple Watch. watchOS 3.2 includes a "Theater Mode" designed to let customers quickly mute the sound on the Apple Watch and disable Raise to Wake, preventing the screen from lighting up with arm movement. Customers are still able to receive haptic feedback-based notifications, and information can be viewed by either tapping the screen or pressing down on the Digital Crown. watchOS 3.2 also brings SiriKit to the Apple Watch, allowing customers to ask Siri to do things like send messages, send payments, book a ride, log a workout, make a call, or search through photos. SiriKit has been available on iOS devices since the release of iOS 10, but is new to the Apple Watch. With seven betas now having been seeded to developers, we are likely close to a public release. watchOS 3.2 may see an official launch within the next few weeks.

By Mary-Ann Russon March 20, 2017 17:28 GMT Apple hasn't paid any income tax at all in New Zealand for at least a decade, a newspaper has discoveredReuters Apple has not paid any income tax in New Zealand for the last 10 years due to an unusual treaty with Australia, despite having made billions from selling iPhones, iPads and Macs in the country. The revelations come from the Weekend Herald, which examined annual financial statements filed with the New Zealand Companies Office as well as 10-K forms filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The statements reveal Apple has not been paying any income tax within New Zealand because its operations in the country are wholly owned by an Australian parent company. According to a tax treaty between the two countries, if there are dual income tax claims, then the tax claim defaults to the location where the company is controlled from. What Apple is doing is completely legal – it has been paying income tax at the Australian rate of 30%, rather than the New Zealand rate of 28% – however the tax itself has been being sent to the Australian Taxation Office since at least 2007. NZ$37m in taxes have gone to Australia for the last decade The financial statements showed that Apple Sales New Zealand made NZ$4.2bn ($3bn, £2.4bn) over the last 10 years, and that it has paid NZ$37m in taxes for the period – but none of that money has been seen by New Zealand, even though Apple employs several dozen workers. The issue is now making waves in the country as opposition politicians express displeasure and call for greater transparency over how multinational corporations manage their taxes. All eyes are now on New Zealand's Revenue Minister Judith Collins, who proposed reforms on 3 March to try to stamp out tax avoidance by multinationals. However, she has said that she cannot comment on individual cases. In any case, the reforms will aim to ensure that all multinationals with a large internet footprint are taxable on any profits made from selling any kind of goods or services in New Zealand if they employ people within the country, and submissions on the consultation document are open until early April. The measures would also prevent companies from using interest payments to shift profits offshore, but will not go as far as the diverted profits tax introduced by the UK and Australia. New Zealand's Labour revenue spokesperson Michael Wood said that citizens have "every reason to feel outraged" by the news.

Mar 20, 2017, 12:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "STMicroelectronics Time of Flight Proximity Sensor in the Apple iPhone 7 Plus" report to their offering. Located in the front above the main speaker, the proximity sensor is packaged using optical LGA. The iPhone 7 Plus features the smallest Time of Flight sensor provided by STMicroelectronics. As always, Apple has ordered a custom version of the device. Compared to STMicroelectronics's portfolio, the custom device is two time smaller (2.80 x 2.40 mm) than the actual proximity sensor proposes by the firm. The sensor is based on FlighSenseTM technology that featured an illumination device which is a Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) and a collector which is based on the Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) developed by STMicroelectronics. To provide such device, STMicroelectronics has made some improvement on the SPADs and the VCSEL from the actual devices that are studied and detailed in the report. The report featured also a function and a field-of-view comparison with the VL53L0X and VL6180X.

 Apple is on the defensive as it prepares the iPhone for the fight of its life Matt Weinberger Mar. 20, 2017, 1:00 PM 28,973 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty/Chris Hondros Apple is working on a pair of Google Glass-style smart glasses powered by your iPhone, Bloomberg reports. And it's no surprise why: Apple CEO Tim Cook has said augmented reality, the technology used to project computer-generated imagery onto your field of vision, is "a big idea like the smartphone." What Cook won't say, however, is how Apple's move to AR is a defensive move to preserve the supremacy of the iPhone, its most important product, for another decade. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Microsoft technical fellow Alex Kipman, the chief inventor of Microsoft's pioneering HoloLens "hologram" goggles, said he saw augmented reality as replacing the need for a smartphone. After all, if your text messages, photos, and phone calls are projected onto what you see, why use a separate device? Now Apple has to figure out a way to make sure the iPhone stays relevant in that world. Meanwhile, its biggest competitors are preparing for an all-out assault on the concept of the smartphone itself. Self-contained Companies like Microsoft and Facebook are working hard to accelerate the demise of the smartphone and the rise of AR, attempting to sidestep the iPhone's dominance entirely. Importantly, Microsoft's HoloLens is a self-contained device, not requiring a connection to a PC or phone to function. That's a big deal for Microsoft, which has almost no presence in the smartphone market. It means that if the HoloLens takes off, Microsoft owns the whole thing. Similarly, companies like Facebook's Oculus and the mysterious Magic Leap are trying to build standalone augmented-reality and virtual-reality devices. The opportunity is tremendous — if they can capture that market, it wouldn't matter that they don't have smartphone operating systems because they'd own the next big thing. And Google is more committed to the Android operating system than to the traditional concept of a smartphone. The original Google Glass didn't need a phone to function, and it seems unlikely that the long-rumored Google Glass 2.0 would need one either. As long as whatever next-generation glasses come out run on Android, Google's strategy is satisfied. Microsoft's HoloLens is self-contained, requiring no PC or smartphone to function.Microsoft HoloLens All of this is an existential threat to Apple. Removing the need for a smartphone would demolish the market for the iPhone, the product Apple's strategy hinges on. We're years away from AR truly being mainstream, but the foundation is being laid. Now the burden is on Apple to get there first. If it can build an AR headset that depends on the iPhone to function, it can keep its all-important phone business alive for a long time. In Apple's ideal world, the iPhone sits at the center of the AR market. But if Apple fails, Microsoft, Google, Magic Leap, and Facebook are circling, ready to take advantage.

Read the latest rumours about the 2017 iPhone specs, price and UK launch date, celebrating 10 years of the iPhone. 10 years of iPhone mean one thing: the iPhone 8 should be the best iPhone update yet By Chris Martin | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so if you're anticipating the usual annual upgrades to the iPhone you might have a big surprise in store. Too awesome to be called simply '7s' the upcoming iPhone 8 or iPhone Edition should be the 'revolutionary' iPhone we've all been waiting for. See also: Best phones 2017. But the iPhone isn't the only thing at Apple celebrating 10 years in 2017 - the company's partnership with AIDs charity (RED) is also hitting double digits. To celebrate, Apple has in March 2017 announced a brand-new red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and if the colour proves to be a hit we could also see the hue added to Apple's line-up for the iPhone 8. If you are viewing a mobile version of this page, click here to see the latest version of this story. Here's a summary of what to expect from the iPhone 8: iOS 11 software 5.8in edge-to-edge screen with no bezels and no physical home button 3D front-facing camera could replace Touch ID Long-range wireless charging - may not come until 2018 Apple A11 processor 64- or 256GB with 3GB RAM Latest Intel LTE modem Possible change in case material to glass or ceramic - or just glass back That's the main specs covered, but here are the other rumours: The main logic board will be in two pieces instead of the traditional one Apple may move the SIM tray to the bottom edge (this could be to allow room for other internal components or to include a Smart Connector) Quick charging will be supported when using a cable New speaker design could make the phone the thinnest ever It will use an OLED screen from Samsung - read more. Facial recognition in addition to fingerprint scanner Laser sensor for gesture recognition - read more. The latest video from ConceptsiPhone does a decent job of showing what the iPhone 8 might look like. It's interesting to see an idea of how the bottom of the display might be used, similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. Find the best Apple deals. When is the iPhone 8 UK release date? iPhone 8 UK release date: September or November 2017 (TBC) Although still months away, we can fairly confidently predict the iPhone 8 release date. Assuming the annual September announcement tradition continues, the iPhone 8 release date will be in September 2017. However, 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone launch, so we wouldn't be too surprised if Apple mixed things up a bit (it launched the SE - pictured below - in March). The latest rumour, though, says there are production delays because of supply issues with the 3D camera system. This could push back availability to November, or even later. What will the 2017 iPhone be called? It seems the name may have been confirmed with an Apple employee referring to the new device by the name 'iPhone 8' unprompted when speaking to Business Insider. However, there is another suggestion as Apple Insider claims that Apple could call this year's iPhone the iPhone X. As we've mentioned, the iPhone for 2017 is slightly harder to predict because it will mark a big anniversary for the smartphone. According to Mac Otakara, the 2017 model may well be simply called the iPhone Edition alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus making up three options as per the below suggestion. One of the latest rumours says that Apple will release three new iPhone models as part of the main lineup. This could well be the 'S' versions of the 7 and 7 Plus, and the extra 'iPhone 8', an even more premium flagship with 'revolutionary' features. The Wall Street Journal says: "Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter. "At a meeting with an Apple executive, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model [the iPhone 7] lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement. People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren’t ready for this year’s models," it added. If Apple follows the usual pattern, the iPhone 7 that launched this year will be followed by the iPhone 7S in 2017. The fact that it's 10 years since the original iPhone means this could all go out the window. Apple will want to do something special to celebrate the occasion so an 'S' model, which usually just brings small tweaks, won't suffice. It's pretty much anyone's guess at the moment, hence, we're calling the 2017 model the iPhone 8 at the moment but it's perfectly plausible that the new phone won't conform to the traditional naming system at all. The iPhone SE (special edition) is already a thing, so perhaps Apple will go with 'iPhone Pro', iPhone Anniversary Edition' or even just 'iPhone' - although naming the iPad 3 as 'the new iPad' didn't go down too well. A report from Nikkei suggested that in 2017 there would be three new iPhone models. It sounded as though we were in for the usual 4.7- and 5.5in models (the regular and Plus), plus a third new 'Pro' model with a 5.5in or above curved screen. Its source said the screen would be "bent on the two sides" making it sound like a Galaxy Note 7 rival. Of course, this didn't happen with the iPhone 7, though it doesn't mean we won't see a curved-screen iPhone 8. Vote in our poll to let us know what you think Apple will name the anniversary iPhone. How much will the iPhone 8 cost in the UK? We're speculating for now, of course, as the iPhone 7 has only recently gone on sale. Whether Apple will introduce a price increase for the potentially special iPhone 8 is anyone's guess. However, the iPhone 7 price jumped up to £599 in the UK thanks to Brexit and we hope that it will stay the same with next year's anniversary model. However, in light of the latest leaks, the 'anniversary' model seems to be an ultra-premium device that could cost more than any iPhone yet. At least one report claims it will be more than $1000 in the US.  Although one analyst predicts the iPhone 8 will be the best selling model ever - with up to 150m sales - another is worried that following the anniversary edition, Apple will see a possible 10 year slump afterwards. It is believed that moving to OLED for the iPhone 8 will push up costs as much as $50m for Apple, eating into the firm's profit margin. Whether the firm takes the hit and keeps the price of the phone the same or not remains to be seen. What are the rumoured new features? If Apple does indeed do something special for the iPhone's 10th anniversary, which is ever more likely from all the leaks, the iPhone 8 will be one which fans will no doubt want to upgrade to on launch day. Could we see the biggest queues ever? A combination of design and hardware changes will make the iPhone 8 the most radical new iPhone to date, if we are to go by the rumours and leaks. Latest feature rumour: KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo refutes other reports saying Apple will use USB-C instead of Lightning on the iPhone 8 in order to introduce fast charging. Via TechTimes, he says that Apple will make a few power-management tweaks to enable the battery to be charged faster when using a Lightning cable. OLED screen: Will the iPhone 8 feature a next-gen display? It seems certain that the iPhone 8 will have an OLED screen - like the Samsung Galaxy S7 - rather than the traditional IPS tech Apple has used previously.  A recent KGI report says that it will be a 5.8in screen which will fit into a chassis a similar size to the current 4.7in iPhone and that the phone will have a significantly higher capacity battery. Another report (Nikkei) backs up the suggestion of the iPhone 8 having a 5.8in OLED screen. Here's a diagram from the report which illustrates how the iPhone 8 will slot into the range: As you can see, the screen will have two parts. A 5.15in 'main' screen with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 pixels and a separate 'function area' across the bottom. This is likely to be where the integrated fingerprint scanner will live, and it may operate like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro laptops. Whatever turns out to be the case, the screens are coming from Samsung. The Korean Herald reported that a source confirmed the order from Samsung and that - like the screen on the Galaxy S7 Edge - it will be made from plastic and not glass. Typically glass is only used for flat screens, so this is not too surprising. It's backed up by a report from Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, which claims that the next iPhone will feature a curved display, although "gentler than screens in Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge handsets". It's due, in part, to the challenges associated with creating and applying curved glass screen protectors that match the display. It's interesting to note that while the site claims it will receive a curved display, it won't boast any additional functionality.  However, a report from analysts at TrendForce says that the iPhone 8 won't have a screen with curved edges. Based on information from the iPhone supply chain, TrendForce said, "Apple will not implement the curved display design for the high-end iPhone because there are issues with the 3D glass in terms of production yield and drop test results. Thus, the next high-end iPhone is expected to have the same 2.5D glass for display cover as the current models.". This was backed up by another report quoting IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam. According to Lam, the 5.8in iPhone won't have a curved display. "We anticipated Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design" he said, speaking to MacRumours.  But what should we expect instead? According to Lam, we should look to the LG G6 for inspiration. "Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month". According to GSMarena, the deal between Apple and Samsung for the screens is now finalised. The iPhone 8 won't be the first to have a bezel-less screen. Xiaomi has already launched the Mi Mix, reviewed. It's a stunning device and the first of a new category of phones with it's 91.3 percent screen-to-body ratio, according to the firm. Controversially, a Facebook post by Robert Scoble - a well-known tech strategist - says that the iPhone 8 will be "a clear piece of glass... which will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does". He also says the phone will have an OLED screen and that Apple has 600 engineers working on a next-generation 3D sensor and that the phone will have eye sensors. These will bring "a new kind of interface". He also says that you'll "pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." Plus, he says that new sources revealed we can "expect battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone." These sound like ridiculous predictions, especially the part about the phone being transparent - battery tech is not yet good enough to make one small enough to "hide" - but if true, the iPhone 8 will be a revolution rather than the evolution we've seen with the iPhone 7 this year. We'll continue to update this article as new information appears, but here's how things stand right now. This concept image via ConceptsiPhone shows what an edge-to-edge OLED display iPhone might look like: Another concept, via AlHasan Husni, gives us another look at what the iPhone might look like with a bezel-free design. This shows what some of the interface and apps might look like with the screen almost wrapping around to the back on either side using a curved glass display like Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge. Glass frame: Will the iPhone 8 feature Gorilla Glass? Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone which resembles a single sheet of glass for a long time and the 2017 anniversary iPhone could be the one. It's rumoured that at least one iPhone in 2017 will use a glass body, according to Apple supplier Catcher Technology. Glass on the front and back would make it like a hugely updated version of the iPhone 4S. This, combined with the rumour that the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED screen makes things rather interesting. Allen Horng, chairman and chief executive of Catcher Technology, a key supplier said: "As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year. I don't think this move will have an impact on Catcher's revenue as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model." However, don't get your hopes up. Although Foxconn - the manufacturer of iPhones in China - has been experimenting with building a glass chassis for around a year, it is likely too early to put it into mass production. Current tooling is all for aluminium chassis and that's where the expertise and investment is. A switch to glass - or ceramic or some other material - would be such a massive change that there would be far more leaks backing up these rumours. Put simply, we don't believe that the iPhone 8 will be an all-glass machine. Touch ID: Will the iPhone 8 have a home button integrated to the screen? What's much more likely is that the home button will be 'virtual' in the iPhone 8.  This makes sense, and is surely one of the features of the 'function area' in the diagram earlier. But will Apple ditch Touch ID? Previous rumours say no but another new Apple patent for an "Acoustic Imaging System Architecture" suggest otherwise. It's impossible to know what Apple will do, since there are so many patents. One Apple patent shows that the new iPhone's Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is usually situated beneath the Home button, could be built-in to the entire display, eliminating the need for a Home button and making room for a larger display without enlarging the overall size of the smartphone. These rumours seemed pretty far fetched to begin with, but it might just happen. Sonavation recently announced that it has found a way to insert ultrasonic biometric sensors underneath a Gorilla Glass display, still being able to read a user's fingerprints. The newly developed tech is "well suited for through-the-glass fingerprinting and specifically architected to deliver advanced security  and ease-of-integration into mobile and IoT devices” Sonavation’s CTO Rainer Schmitt said. The company claims that it can even do one better than the existing Touch ID (and most other fingerprint scanners on the market) by being able to scan fingerprints on a finger that's wet, dirty or oily. Though it's not clear which devices will be the first to feature this new technology, but we assume it'd either be the iPhone or a flagship Android smartphone. Another patent has been awarded to Apple for a button which places the fingerprint sensing technology underneath the screen. Named a 'capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens', it means the Touch ID fingerprint sensor can work through various layers of the display.  Yet another patent, via Apple Insider, deals with the light sensor - the one which adjusts the screen brightness automatically. It's called 'Electronic Devices With Display-Integrated Light Sensors' and explains that having a light sensor can result in an increase in the size and weight of the device so "it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with light sensors and displays." Face-recognition: Will the iPhone 8 feature a 3D camera? However, Macrumours says that a JP Morgan analyst claims there will be no fingerprint recognition at all, and that Apple will instead embed a front-facing 3D laser scanner that will be able to accurately recognise your face. This will avoid the problem where Touch ID doesn't work if you have wet fingers - or the sensor has water on it. He says it will also be more secure, which could lead to more companies - including banks - supporting Apple Pay. This theory is backed up by Kuo of KGI Securities whose latest report, via 9to5Mac, says Apple will put an enhanced front camera and an IR sensor in order to build up a 3D model of the user's face. A patent filed by Apple shows that the firm is looking into depth maps for smart facial detection. It's based on infrared tracking and can detect how close or distant someone is. Whether or not it will be part of the iPhone 8 remains to be seen but it seems unlikely with the focus on the 3D camera mentioned above, but that's not to say this can't be a feature as well.   The report also says that Apple's 3D algorithms are "years ahead" of Android, and such a feature could be an iPhone exclusive for a couple of years before Android phone makers catch up. As pointed out by Patently Apple, yet more patents suggest a curved-glass design and also that the sides of the phone could be used for virtual buttons. For example, this could be used for certain controls when the camera app is in use. If true, the phone would rival Samsung's edge screen features. There were also some rumours we heard about the iPhone 7's screen that never made it to fruition. It's possible that they could see daylight with the iPhone 8. Economic Daily News speculated that the iPhone 7 could feature a 3D display, and one that doesn't require the use of those annoying 3D glasses. The website claimed at the time that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project that could produce a glasses-free 3D display, though we're not holding out much hope for this as its been done before (remember the LG Optimus 3D?) and has never done well. There were also some rumours to suggest that the iPhone 7 could have a sidewall display, similar to that found on the Galaxy S7 edge and Note 7. This came from an Apple patent that was published in 2015. The patent hints at a future iPhone with a display that extends onto the sides of the device, providing interactive or touch sensitive portions that give access to slide-to-unlock functionality, music player controls, messaging readout, called ID, system controls and more. One of Apple's partners, Japan Display, is working in flexible an foldable screens similar to Samsung and LG. Whether this will end up in the iPhone 8 remains to be seen - it's unlikely but still interesting. Apple has plenty of patents describing bendable and folding devices, according to TechnoBuffalo. More details on the screen tech include that Apple is supposedly working on a new generation of 3D Touch. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the firm will make it from a thin film in order to introduce enhanced sensitivity - via AppleInsider.

Rubin's company, Essential Products, is reportedly planning to release a new high-end smartphone this spring, and SoftBank planned to market the phone in Japan, the Journal said. But Apple subsequently agreed to commit $1 billion to SoftBank's Vision Fund, a move that "complicated" SoftBank's investment in Essential Products, the Journal reported Monday. show chapters Why this analyst has a 'buy' rating on SoftBank    Sunday, 26 Feb 2017 | 10:58 PM ET | 01:47 Apple did not directly block the deal, the Journal said, though Rubin's premium phone would be released ahead of the highly anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone. The deal was "nearly complete," sources told the Journal. Rubin was the CEO of Android, which Google bought in 2005 to form the basis of its smartphone operating system. At Google, Rubin's leadership of its smartphone business helped turn Android into the world's most widely used smartphone platform. Rubin left Google in 2014 to start various projects, including an incubator for hardware start-ups. He has not publicly discussed Essential or its plans. The deal's fallout highlights the growing influence of SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, who made a splashy announcement last year to invest $50 billion in the U.S., aiming to create 50,000 jobs.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung's Galaxy S8 will introduce a new Side Button for Quick Web Searches and Eventually Instant Access to Bixby | Main | Apple's iPhone 8 with Glass Backside may use Physical Direct Connection Technology to Enhance Wireless Charging » March 20, 2017 Rumor Claims that the Anniversary iPhone will have a 2007 Retro-Design Modernized with Curved 3D Backside Glass   According to a newly published Korean report, Apple's next iPhone is expected to embody a back side design with curved emphasis, resembling the initial iPhone and an anniversary symbol.   According to the publication's sources, Apple has adopted a three-dimensional glass material on the back case of the iPhone 8 (tentative name). This 3D glass case makes curves around the top, bottom, left and right edges. The edge curve is said to be more gentle and rounded than the existing metal case edges. Samsung used 3D glass to make their Galaxy 'Edge' design. Apple's design isn't to offer that dramatic a curvature.   One industry official stated that "Apple's next iPhone will have a rear case made of glass. This glass case is a curved wall surrounded by four sides." He further noted that only the edges are slightly curved. The concept is to look like a modernized version of the original iPhone. The Korean's call it a 'drip design.'   While you could understand Apple trying to modernize the original iPhone design for their aniversary model, it's hard to image this simplistic iPhone at the moment as being a breakthrough design that many were hoping for.   While I'm not a fan of retro designs, many around the globe are. And with a larger display and powerful new specifications, it just might be a design that long-standing Apple fans will love – especially those fans who saw Apple's CEO stand on stage and introduce it back in 2007.     Perhaps this is why some rumors are claiming multiple iPhone designs for 2017. One with a cutting edge look and one celebrating it's original roots. For now it's just the latest rumor that may or may not have a piece of the truth and I'm sure that there will more rumors to surface on this design as we get closer to September.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The upcoming version of macOS Sierra is the first to bring Night Shift to the Mac. Sony A6500 macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is currently only available to developers and public beta testers. Public beta versions usually come a few days after developer versions if not the same day. macOS 10.12.4 beta also includes changes to Siri, Dictation, and Apple’s PDF API: Night Shift now available on the Mac. Dictation support for Shanghainese. Ask Siri about cricket scores, schedules and player rosters. Siri knows about statistics and data from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. Updated PDFKit APIs for better displaying of PDFs in apps that use the framework. This is how Apple describes its Night Shift feature: Night Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset. Many studies show that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes. In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings.

It’s not even the second. Or the third. In fact, people would rather buy a handset made by the likes of Huawei, Oppo, or Vivo. Those three are most popular smartphone brands in China, accounting for just under half of the new smartphones shipped in the country, as Bloomberg recently pointed out. Apple languishes in fourth place, accounting for just 9.6 percent of sales. It wasn’t always so bad for Apple. The iPhone was the favorite smartphone in China for five years and accounted for 14.3 percent of smartphone sales in 2015. So what went wrong? According to Duan Yongping, the cofounder of Chinese smartphone manufacturers Oppo and Vivo, it’s all down to a reluctance to cater to the whims of foreign markets. In an interview with Bloomberg, Duan said that “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” and that “they’re maybe too stubborn sometimes.” He’s referring to the company’s single-minded focus on a slim product range that must ultimately fit all users who wants to buy into the Apple experience, wherever they happen to live. Duan points out, for instance, that Apple wouldn’t dare make cheap devices with high-end features in the same way that Oppo and Vivo do, for fear of diluting its brand elsewhere. But, it seems, Chinese consumers would now rather get their specs and have a little change to spare. Devices like Oppo’s F1 Plus, pictured above, provide most of the looks and features of an iPhone—but for somewhere in the region of $430, versus $770 for the cheapest iPhone 7 Plus. What it lacks in polish is meant to be made up in savings, and that selling point is now proving popular. Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing this weekend, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, claimed that the company doesn’t have a specific market-share goal for China. It is, however, clearly committed to cracking the market. Last week, it announced that it was committing over $506 million to research in China, with plans to open two brand new R&D centers—one in Shanghai, the other in Suzhou. They will join two existing centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. And Apple is still planning to focus its manufacturing efforts in the country. Speaking at the same event, Cook took the opportunity to expound on the virtues of globalization, no doubt to the annoyance of a certain President Trump. That shouldn’t come as a surprise: expertise and established supply chains make China a no-brainer as a manufacturing base for any tech company building products at scale. What may need to change, though, are some of the products that are leaving the production line. If Duan is correct and sales continue to elude Apple, Cook may have have little choice but to cater to the whims of the market.

The investment will be pumped into four research centers in China, including one in Shanghai which will be open “later this year,” Apple said on Friday. It is the first time that Apple will establish research centers in China, its second-biggest regional market. “Apple has to adapt strategies to make itself more localized in China when it faces aggressive Android phone rivals here,” said Jia Mo, a Shanghai-based analyst at researcher Canalys. Apple aims to use the centers to compete more effectively with domestic rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. Apple’s revenue in China has declined 12-16 percent year on year in recent quarters amid tough competition from low-cost domestic smartphones. At the end of 2016, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo ranked the top three in the domestic smartphone market. They have developed high-end models to challenge Samsung and Apple. Huawei is set to narrow its market share gap with Apple to under 5 percentage points in the global smartphone market this year, said research firm TrendForce, while Samsung has developed models specifically for Chinese consumers.

Staying In Tech and Gaming Samsung unveils Bixby voice command service to rival Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa The new spoken word interface will be included on the Galaxy S8 Ben Travis Monday 20 March 2017 17:49 GMT Click to follow ES Entertainment Technology has taken a futuristic turn in recent years with the increased implementation of voice command. From Apple’s Siri commands to Amazon’s Alexa, featured in the Echo speaker, we’re able to do more and more with simple vocal instructions. Now Samsung has officially unveiled its own spoken word interface – and it’s called Bixby. The forthcoming Samsung Galaxy S8, due on March 29, will include some Bixby features from the off, while the service is set to grow over time. Read more Samsung Galaxy X expected to be a foldable phone and tablet hybrid “Bixby will be our first step on a journey to completely open up new ways of interacting with your phone,” the official announcement reads. “Our plan is to eventually release a tool (in SDK) to enable third-party developers to make their applications and services Bixby-enabled easily.” 10 years of Apple's iPhone 7 show all 10 years of Apple's iPhone 1/7 Unveiled Steve Jobs with the first iPhone AFP/Getty Images 2/7 iPhone The original iPhone Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel PA 3/7 iPhone 3G Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel AFP/Getty Images 4/7 iPhone 4 Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 5 megapixel Getty Images 5/7 iPhone 5 Screen size 4in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 6/7 iPhone 6 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 7/7 iPhone 7 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 12 megapixel PA While Bixby will initially be a feature on Samsung phones, the technology will later be implemented in other Samsung products including TVs and air conditioners.

Amazon’s system interacts with other apps and smart home devices to perform functions including ordering Uber cars and meals from Just Eat.

That pretty much kills the idea that Apple was about to release a Siri-based Amazon Echo and Google Home competitor. Apple’s A1844 FCC device filing is a door lock for Apple Park The filing describes a small device with Bluetooth and NFC support, and without any images to go along with it. That left the pundits and the public to run with whatever ideas they had, which led to speculation—or more accurately, hope—that Siri was about to get a stand-alone box, possibly as part of a new Apple TV model. With the photos the FCC published over the weekend, it’s clear the mystery device is all about keeping people from going where they shouldn’t on Apple’s campus. The FCC also released the usage instructions which include a step saying, “Present the company provided credential to the reader.” Apple’s photos are for a device tagged as A1844. Another similar device, tagged A1846, was also submitted to the FCC, but photos haven’t been released yet. Since the A1844 device is a security lock system, it’s a safe bet it’s just for Apple’s own use and won’t be a HomeKit device. Apple isn’t a smarthome device maker and this lock system won’t be a consumer product. Designing a lock system for Apple Park fits with Apple’s long standing policy of secrecy. By creating its own lock security system Apple cuts down on the likelihood someone could take advantage of a hack for commercially available lock systems. No Siri Box for You Unfortunately for everyone hoping to get a counter top Siri device are out of luck, at least for now. Apple may be looking at such devices in its labs, but they don’t fit well with the company’s stance of user privacy and security. Siri binds to your voice when set up on an iPhone or iPad to keep anyone else from accessing your personal data or controlling HomeKit devices without your express authorization. Creating a Siri device anyone can talk to goes against that. Apple also seems to like the idea that our Siri controller is always with us in the form of our iPhone and Apple Watch. That’s not a truly hands-free interface, like we see with Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, but it is a device you typically have with you. Unless Apple finds an elegant way to link multiple voices to a Siri appliance, don’t count on seeing one in your home. If anyone can access your schedule and contacts, or order two tons of creamed corn without your permission, your personal data isn’t safe or secure at all. For now, it looks like if you want to see device A1844 in action you’ll need to be an Apple employee, or get a personal tour or the new Apple Park campus.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Mar 20, 2017 8:24 AM PT Credit: This working 40-year-old Apple-1 will be auctioned in May. / Photo by Auction Team Breker More like this Sold! Antique Apple-1 brings a record $671K Rare working Apple-1 computer to hit auction block this month Vintage Apple-1 sells for a record $905K Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell A German auction house that hopes to rap the gavel on an antique Apple-1 personal computer in May has pegged its likely sales price at between $190,000 and $320,000. The Apple-1, one of a handful verified to work, will be put on the block May 20 by Auction Team Breker of Cologne, Germany. The first pre-assembled personal computer, the Apple-1 lacked such amenities as a power supply, keyboard or display. Those were supplied by the computer hobbyists who bought the boards direct from the embryonic Apple or from the Byte Shop, an early computer store in Mountain View, Calif. In 1976, the first Apple-1 personal computers were sold for $666.66, or approximately $2,830 in today's dollars. They remain rare, with about 60 of the original 200 known to exist, several in the hands of museums such as the Smithsonian Museum of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Henry Ford Museum of Innovation in Dearborn, Mich. Breker's estimate was lower than recent sales prices of other Apple-1 computers. Interest in the machine has surged since 2010 as Apple itself blew through one revenue record after another, and as co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011, marking to some the passing of an era in personal computing. Auction prices jumped from $242,000 in 2010 to $671,000 in 2013, then topped out at the $905,000 paid by The Henry Ford Museum in October 2014. The lower projection by Breker may be because the auction house believed interest has waned or perhaps because of minor modifications to the circuit board. Mike Willegal, an engineer with a major technology company whose hobbies include tracking Apple-1 computers, noted that the system had an extra capacitor and additional logic on the board. Breker's Apple-1 is in working order, the auctioneer asserted, and backed up the claim with video of the computer loading several short demonstration programs from a cassette and running them. It has had but one owner, whom Breker identified only as a Berkeley, Calif., computer engineer. The computer will be accompanied by some paper documentation -- not unheard of in sales of technology antiques -- that includes the receipt for the original Nov. 30, 1976, purchase, a letter from Apple's customer service department dated from 1979, and a record of phone conversations with company founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

The team, run by former Dolby Laboratories executive Mike Rockwell, includes researchers who were previously working on Oculus virtual reality headsets, Amazon’s Lumberyard virtual reality platform and Meta’s augmented reality glasses project. Hundreds of engineers are now working on the project, which includes plans for wearable glasses and big improvements to the iPhone’s camera. Apple is reportedly working on making the iPhone able to “take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later,” using algorithms acquired in 2013 from PrimeSense. Other improvements would allow users to manipulate specific elements within the image — like rotating a person’s head 180 degrees while leaving the rest of the frame as-is — or place visual effects on top of a person much in the way Snapchat’s filters operate. The report didn’t shed any light on when 3D sensors or augmented reality applications would land on the iPhone, but recent rumors have hinted Apple may be testing its AR capabilities as early this year. The rumored glasses project is likely to take longer, the sources said. After observing the demise of Google Glass and seeing its own Apple Watch fail to become much of a mainstream success, Apple is focused on making sure that its next wearable doesn’t make the same mistakes others have. While Apple declined to comment, people close to the development said both hardware and software are essential. Battery life is likely to be an issue even if the tethered iPhone does most of the processing work, and the glasses will likely require their own operating system if not an entirely new type of chip. On the software side, Apple is working to make sure that the glasses have enough useful apps, interesting content and entertaining games to make the product worth buying. While the challenge is daunting and notable companies have proved not to be up to the task, Apple analyst Gene Munster pointed out that the company is at its best when it waits for other companies to try something first and then swoops in to improve where others have failed. “To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments,” Munster says. “Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.” Comments « WebMD launches pregnancy study using Apple’s ResearchKit Daily Deal: PDF Expert 2.2 for Mac » Related Stories Apple introduces Clips video app Apple unveils new upgraded entry-level 9.7” iPad, replacing iPad Air 2 Apple Store going down for ‘maintenance’ tomorrow morning, sparking rumors of product launch Politicians in New Zealand raise alarm about Apple’s tax arrangements Apple extends AppleCare+ purchase timeframe to one year Apple announces two more R&D centers in China Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Hackers claim to have access to millions of iCloud accounts, demand ransom from Apple Apple’s Siri in the running to voice control room functions at Marriott’s Aloft hotels Apple releases iTunes 12.6 with new cross-device movie rental feature Apple introduces Clips video app Apple reveals(RED) iPhone 7, 7 Plus models, doubles storage of iPhone SE Apple drops 32GB iPad mini 4, reduces price of 128GB model and discontinues iPad mini 2 Apple unveils new upgraded entry-level 9.7” iPad, replacing iPad Air 2 Apple Store going down for ‘maintenance’ tomorrow morning, sparking rumors of product launch Politicians in New Zealand raise alarm about Apple’s tax arrangements Fabricate announces Nearbuds for AirPods Recent Reviews Blue Sadie Headphones Circle with Disney Parental Control and Internet Filtering System Pioneer Rayz Plus Lightning Connector Earphones BEEM United BeMe D200 Lightning Connector Earphones Jam Audio JAM Xterior Max Rugged Wireless Bluetooth Speaker HiFiMAN Edition S Headphones Divoom Timebox Mini Bluetooth Speaker iClever BoostSound BTS-09 Bluetooth Speaker Soundcast VG1 Bluetooth Speaker PureGear PureSwitch HomeKit-enabled Wireless Smart Plug Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents tvOS 11 release date & new features New TV app for iPad, iPhone and Apple TV TV app podcast - Apple's 27 Oct launch event Which Apple TV models can run tvOS 10? How to update your Apple TV to tvOS 10 What's new in tvOS 10? WWDC 2016 wrapup show tvOS 11 new features wishlist Just as iOS and macOS receive regular free updates, patching bugs, tweaking the interface and unlocking new features, tvOS has a major update on the way: tvOS 11. tvOS is the operating system software platform that runs on the fourth-gen Apple TV. It's the Apple TV's equivalent of iOS on the iPhone or macOS on the Mac; it manages the apps you can install on the device and offers various features of its own. Read on for tvOS 10 features, how to get tvOS 10 now, and what we know so far about tvOS 11. Updated 20 March with news that a developer log has seemingly revealed the existence of tvOS 11. Read next: iOS 10 review | macOS Sierra review | watchOS 3 new features tvOS 11 release date & new features tvOS 10 was released on 13 September 2016 alongside iOS 10 and watchOS 3, after releasing the tvOS golden master on 7 September after the iPhone 7 event. That means, if you have a compatible Apple TV (more on that below) you can update to tvOS 10 now. Still, in the world of tech we're always looking forward to the next big thing, and in this case that means tvOS 11. March 2017 brought our first apparent confirmation that the next major tvOS update is on the way, as a game developer spotted a mysterious Apple device identified as 'TV6,2' in the Apple TV logs, reportedly running tvOS 11.0. Naturally, the current speculation is that this is a development version of the fifth-gen Apple TV device, which will potentially launch alongside the new tvOS version some time later in 2017 - likely in September. New TV app for iPad, iPhone and Apple TV At its 27 October new MacBook Pro launch event, Apple also announced a new app for the Apple TV. It's just called 'TV'. In fact, TV is an app for the iPad and iPhone too, and thus a potentially valuable unifying tool for syncing the content you play on multiple devices: watch part of a TV show on your iPad, say, and then open it on the Apple TV and it should pick up at the exact point where you left off. It's designed to provide what Apple calls "a unified experience for discovering and accessing TV shows and movies from multiple apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad". TV is a bit like an electronic programme guide, and the place from which most activities naturally begin: the presenter said it was the first app she opened up each time she switched on the Apple TV, and a member of the Macworld team immediately reacted by wondering why the features of the TV app isn't just baked into the Apple TV's natural interface. You can access TV shows and movies from the TV app, but Apple is also trying to use the TV app to replicate the discovery elements from Apple Music. Here are the main features of the TV app: Watch Now: Your basic content library. This is where you'll browse your TV shows, films and on on - anything downloaded from iTunes or similar services and apps. Up Next: A smart system that automatically queues up the TV episode or whatever that you're likely to want to watch next; you can tell Siri to continue watching a programme and it will automatically find the next episode. Netflix does something similar, and it's rather handy. Recommended: The equivalent of Apple Music's For You and Browse discovery features, this section contains curated playlists and what Apple calls "trending" TV and films - we're not sure exactly what that means. There will also be content organised by genres and categories - again, something that Netflix is very good at currently. Library: This is where you view all the films and TV programmes you've rented or bought from iTunes. Store: Where you buy new stuff. "Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. "The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place." The TV app became available in December 2016 as part of the point upgrade tvOS 10.1.

The UK Tech Weekly Podcast comes out every Friday. Follow the team on Twitter to get notifications of new episodes. Which Apple TV models can run tvOS 10? The fourth-generation Apple TV is the only Apple TV that can currently be updated to tvOS 10.  Apple cannot extend support back to previous generations: they're simply not equipped to run apps and a full iOS-esque OS, which means that Apple TV gen 1, 2 and 3 users are out of luck. How to update your Apple TV to tvOS 10 tvOS 10 is a free update that, as we explained above, will work with all fourth-gen Apple TV models. Updating your Apple TV to tvOS 10 is easy. Head to the Settings app, then select System and go to the Maintenance submenu. Click 'Software updates', then 'Update Software'. Once the installation file has been downloaded, you'll see an update prompt; select the option 'Download and Install'. When the update is finished, the Apple TV will restart. If you'd like to read about the process in more depth, take a look at How to update Apple TV software. Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best TV streaming devices What's new in tvOS 10? As we've already mentioned, tvOS got a fair bit of love at WWDC 2016 on 13 June during Apple's keynote for press and developers (some would say a little too much love, given the number of important upgrades in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra that Apple didn't have time to mention). Introducing the new operating system for the Apple TV, Eddy Cue revealed that developers have created 6,000 native apps in the seven months since the Apple TV got an App Store. But what's new from Apple? Here are the new features available for your (fourth-gen) Apple TV. Siri Siri has some big improvements in the new update. It can now search your Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex and more natural-language-based queries. The example Apple gave was "high-school comedies from the 80s" - although it should be pointed out that this didn't work perfectly in the demo. Siri can also search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then whatever the channel is. ESPN, for example. And it can be used to control HomeKit-compatible smart-home appliances, with phrases such as "set thermostat to 72". Read next: How to fix the most common Siri problems Dark Mode Dark Mode for Apple TV went down rather well. You can activate it to turn the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. Good for those situations when you're settling down with your popcorn to watch a movie in a dark room. If you're wondering about the Dark Mode we were expecting in iOS 10, fear not: we're fairly sure that's on its way soon. Remote app Another bit of big news is the redesigned Apple TV remote app, which brings all of the Siri remote features to the app. It can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic, but you can also input text thanks to the keyboard. That's not all either, as Apple also claimed that the Remote app would use the iPhone's built-in sensors to be used as a gamepad, allowing users to play two-player games without having to fork out for another Siri remote.  Read next: New Apple TV Remote iPhone app review Single Sign-on Single Sign-on lets you sign in once to authenticate all apps, and any Apple TV-compatible app you download on iOS will automatically show up on your Apple TV. This feature is more useful than it looks, as it allows a quick access to your apps, without having to download them on your Apple TV. We see this as one of the major steps forward in the newer revision of tvOS. Photos Like iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, tvOS brings the new features of Photos to the Apple TV. The most appealing of these is Memories. Memories is designed to build digital albums for you automatically. It will recognise faces and places, and combine this data with the time and location where images and videos were taken to combine them intelligently into themed groupings - even selecting the best bits of video clips to use. Apple promises that these albums will be easily customisable (you can pick a different preset 'tone', for instance, and the accompanying music will change) and they looked decent in the (obviously pre-prepared) demo version, but we'll need to test its performance in everyday use. Apple Music Like Photos, Apple Music has had a revamp, and this affects the Apple TV just as it does the iPhone, iPad and Mac. This means you can enjoy the cleaner, simpler new look of Apple Music in tvOS. (And presumably the new onscreen lyrics feature? Logically that ought to be part of the package, but Apple hasn't specifically told us that tvOS will get this feature.) Automatic app downloads This is a small thing, but if you download a Universal app to your iPhone it will automatically be installed on your Apple TV. We assume this feature will be optional. Games controllers One thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been removed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote and provide a more comfortable and enjoyable gaming experience on the Apple TV.

Apple’s online store typically goes offline for several hours ahead of product refreshes. Sony A6500 Apple cites scheduled maintenance for the offline period, as MacRumors first pointed out, but the page specifies that the Apple Online Store “will be updated” which could mean either backend components or new product pages. With so many products due to be updated at any point, the speculation that this could mean new product releases is warranted. Without specifying which products, MacRumors reported last week that trusted “supply chain analysts” believe Apple will release something new as soon as this week. Apple has typically held a spring event in March to unveil new hardware and some have suggested such an event could take place in April this year instead. Rumored new products include both 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads as well as a rumored 10.5-inch model with new design. The current sizes are expected to be a minor refresh which may not warrant an event, however, while the new size would surely need stage time to present. A red version of the iPhone 7 and a higher capacity iPhone SE are also expected. As we mentioned last week, a new color mid-cycle would be a first for the iPhone, so a press release without an event wouldn’t be surprising. Upgrading the iPhone SE to offer 128GB of storage is also a minor update. Macs including both Retina iMacs and even the 12-inch MacBook are due for updates as well (not to mention the 2013 Mac Pro and 2014 Mac mini). Last week the first signs of a new Apple TV running tvOS 11 was also spotted, although the new software version would likely not be revealed until WWDC 2017. Apple also lists Photo Print Products as going offline during the same time which could be related to the same infrastructure or suggest the maintenance is not related to new products. Apple refreshed the design of its system status page last month with the new layout that highlights ongoing, upcoming, and resolved issues.

Firm reveals online store will be 'down for maintenance' as it prepares iPad Pro updates Three new iPad models were expected to be hitting the market in March  But it's claimed the launch of the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPads has been delayed  Latest models are expected to have an edge to edge display and no home button By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 12:18 EDT, 20 March 2017 | Updated: 07:48 EDT, 21 March 2017 e-mail 40 shares 1 View comments Apple could be set preparing to launch the next generation of iPad Pros tomorrow, it has been claimed.  The firm today confirmed its online store would be down - a usual sign of incoming new products. It was first rumoured that the firm would release a trio of iPads at an event in March. Despite claims the launch of the large-sized devices, the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models, had been rescheduled for 'May or June', and it now appears they may go on sale without a launch event. Scroll down for video    Apple is set to launch three new iPad devices, including an entirely new edition with a 10.5-inch screen. But fans hoping to get their hands on the devices may be left waiting longer than the estimated March release date. Pictured is the 12.9-inch iPad Pro THE RUMOURED IPADS  Apple will be releasing three new models this year - a 9.7-, 10.5- and 12.9- inch model. All three of the new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with quad microphones.  And surprisingly, they will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets that were unveiled last year.  The existing 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also be getting the True Tone display, which is currently limited to the current 9.7-inch model. Apple has updated its System Status page to indicate that its online store will be 'updated and unavailable' due to 'maintenance' tomorrow, Tuesday, March 21, between 3:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time - the time the firm usually sends out press releases announcing new products. The move would be the first major overhaul of Apple's iPad Pro line, replacing ageing models with sleek models that may feature an edge to edge display and no home button. Rumors have widely suggested a trio of new 'thin' iPads with far smaller bezels. No even has been announced, leading some to speculate they will simply go on sale. However, Apple has hosted March events four times in the past six years, and in 2011 and 2012, it introduced new iPad models at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The latest rumours on the new iPads come from an unnamed source in the supply chain speaking to DigiTimes. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Large Hadron Collider finds FIVE new subatomic particles...

They said they were 'certain' that the release of the large-size tablets 'would not come until May of June'.   Mac Otakara said the 10.5-inch—will have the same overall footprint as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro thanks to its edge-to-edge design. The earlier report claimed the top bezel will remain in order to provide space for the front-facing FaceTime camera, but it will likely be slimmer. In October, reports suggested that Apple would be launching its three new iPad devices in March 2017.  All three of the new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with quad microphones and will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack, reports Japanese tech site Mac Otakara.  Apple controversially dropped the traditional headphone port from its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets which it unveiled last year. 'Mac Otakara does not have a perfect track record with Apple rumors, but its sources have proven accurate on multiple occasions in the past' said Mac Rumours. The Japanese site was the first to correctly report on Apple dropping the 3.5mm headphone port from its latest handsets and introducing the new jet back colour, says Mac Rumours.  The site also reports that the existing 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be getting the True Tone display, which is currently limited to the 9.7-inch model. Apple first unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September 2015, making it the firm's biggest tablet to date The larger iPad model is also expected to gain the 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone flash from the smaller model.   Apple first unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September 2015, making it the firm's biggest tablet to date. The Apple Pencil digital stylus was also introduced at the same time, enabling people to draw on the tablet more easily.  The smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro was then introduced in March. Apple has been contacted for comment concerning the delay of the launch of the trio of new iPads, but is yet to respond.  Read more: 2017¿¿¿¿¿iPad¿iPad Pro¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac¿¿¿¿¿ blog¿¿¿¿¿ Apple to Launch Trio of iPad Pros in Spring 2017, Including 7.9-Inch Mini Model - Mac Rumors iPad supply chain makers likely to report disappointing 1Q17 sales 2017¿3¿¿¿¿iPad Pro¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone SE¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac¿ ...

 Nintendo's first Mario game for smartphones is headed to Android on March 23 Kif Leswing Mar. 20, 2017, 12:14 PM 4,512 facebook linkedin twitter email print Nintendo 99 days after Mario's smartphone debut hit iPhones, "Super Mario Run" is launching for Android phones. On March 23, Super Mario Run will become available on the Google Play app store, Nintendo announced. The platformer's first three levels are free, and users can pay $10 in-game to unlock all of its levels. Apple struck a deal with Nintendo to bring the game to iPhones exclusively first. Before Apple announced the iPhone 7 in September, Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto introduced the game on Apple's stage. Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto at an Apple launch event. Getty Plus, Apple participated in marketing for the game — it even required Apple Store employees to wear Mario pins.  But the game was always going to launch on Android as well, which is the most common mobile operating system. A January estimate suggested that Nintendo fans downloaded Super Mario Run 78 million times in its first month and a half. Nintendo is hoping Android users can blow through that number.  Read our review of the game here.  SEE ALSO: The creator of Mario says 'Apple and Nintendo have very similar philosophies' More: Apple Super Mario Run Nintendo Android Super Mario mario Games Mobile Games Video Games Gaming iOS facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Nintendo's first Mario game for smartphones is headed to Android on March 23 Nintendo's first Mario game for smartphones is headed to Android on March 23 99 days after Mario's smartphone debut hit...

The three patents are for three different pairs of headphones: an in-ear pair with an ear hook, a conventional pair of in-ears and a pair of over-ears. Apple AirPods review: Wire-free future or design disaster? In the patents, there is a note to say that at least one of the built-in sensors will make contact with the tragus, the small bit on the inside of your ear in front of the ear canal. By coming into contact with the tragus, the biometric sensor will be able to collect health information via a photoplethysmogram sensor (PPG), which shines a light onto the tragus and and measure the reflectivity. This information can reveal heart rate, temperature and VO2, the maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Apple already employs a similar technique in the Apple Watch to measure the wearer's health information, and as the Watch is in constant contact with the wrist, the information can be considered quite accurate. It's unlikely an earbud will have the same constant contact with the ear during wearing, so the accuracy of the data will be questionable. It's also thought that Apple's new headphones could offer noise-cancellation thanks to microphones that can block external sounds. The headphones would then provide varying levels of noise-cancellation, so you could let some external noise in, for example, when riding a bike in traffic, so you're still aware of your surroundings.

(TSMC), a major chip supplier to Apple, is set to decide on opening a U.S. plant next year, according to Reuters. TSMC, which is the largest contract chipmaker, supplied chips for Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 7. Read: Samsung vs. Apple: SK Giant Suppliers Doubt iPhone Display-Embedded Touch ID The chip company had previously said it had not ruled out the idea of opening up a facility in the United States, however, a spokesperson told Reuters recently TSMC “won’t make a decision until next year.” The company makes 65 percent of its revenue from the U.S., but said there would be downsides to building a plant in America. "We would sacrifice some benefits if we move to the States. But we have flexibility in Taiwan. If an earthquake happened for instance (in Taiwan), we could send thousands of people here as support, whereas it's harder in the States," the spokesperson said. The comment draws from a previous experience. In February 2016, an earthquake struck Taiwan and affected the company months before the release of the iPhone 7. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reports the chipmaker will decide on opening a U.S. plant in the first half of 2018 and is considering investing $16.41 billion on the facility. Read: iPhone 8 Release Rumors: New iPhone Will Come With 'Gentler' Curved OLED Display TSMC’s consideration of opening a U.S. plant comes after previous reports pointing to Apple’s interest in Intel, especially after President Donald Trump criticized American companies for manufacturing their products overseas (Intel is based in the U.S.). Previous reports say Apple could switch to Intel chips for its 2018 iPhone generation. Foxconn technology Group, another Taiwan-based company and Apple supplier is also looking into opening a facility United States. Last December, the company confirmed to International Business Times its exploration of an expansion in the U.S. However, the company’s chairman, Terry Gou, raised uncertainties over the plans earlier this month because he wasn’t sure U.S. officials could work quickly enough to attract foreign companies like Foxconn to build large plants in the states.

Well, today Apple did something it’s never done before—via its System Status webpage, the firm announced that its online stores will be undergoing maintenance tomorrow morning, March 21. “The Apple Store will be updated and unavailable during this time,” reads the message first spotted by MacRumors. It’s become a tradition for Apple to take its store offline ahead of major media events and product launches. Apple Online Store will be undergoing maintenance tomorrow, March 21, between 8:00am and 1:30pm. All users will be affected. Apple hasn’t sent out any invites for an impending media event, suggesting any updates tomorrow would take the form of a press release and a silent website refresh rather than a major announcement of a trio of new iPad Pro models. It’s also possible that this could be an ordinary maintenance, period. For what it’s worth, Apple typically publishes press releases at 8:30am Eastern Time. It’s interesting that Photo Products service are scheduled to undergo maintenance during the same period. “Photo Print Products will be updated and unavailable during this time,” reads the message. This points to the possibility of impending updates to features in Photos and other apps that let customers order prints of photographs directly from their devices. A reliable Japanese blog, which shared accurate information about Apple’s unreleased products in the past, said recently that a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro model could launch this week, running a faster variant of iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip.

The Cupertino company appears to have paid out $37 million in income taxes from sales generated in New Zealand, but to Australia’s tax authority. Since 2007, Apple’s sales in New Zealand have totaled $4.2 billion. “Apple aims to be a force for good and we’re proud of the contributions we’ve made in New Zealand over the past decade,” said a spokesperson for the Cupertino firm. “Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that’s where the vast majority of our tax is paid.” What the documents clearly reveal are tax payments of $37 million that were sent abroad to the Australian Tax Office. The publication states that this is part of an arrangement between Apple and the governments of Australia and New Zealand that has been in place since at least 2007. Money is the likely reason for this move as Apple sold billions of dollars worth of iPhones and iPads to New Zealanders over the past decade. “Had Apple reported the same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally it would have paid $356 million in taxes over the period,” reads the report. The Cupertino company sold 221,000 phones in the country during the three months ending December 31, IDC estimated. Green Party co-leader James Shaw said Apple was not paying its fair share. “It is absolutely extraordinary that they are able to get away with paying zero tax in this country,” local Green Party co-leader James Shaw was quoted as saying. “I really like Apple products—they’re incredibly innovative—but it looks like their tax department is even more innovative than their product designers.” On the other hand, Apple is operating completely legally. “It’s just that age-old distinction between legality and morality,” noted Massey University senior lecturer and Labour Party candidate Deborah Russel. Revenue Minister Judith Collins proposed tax reforms to curb this practice. “The new measures proposed earlier this month will help ensure that multinationals with a large Internet footprint will be taxable on the profits from their New Zealand sales when they have people working for them in New Zealand,” he said. Apple is also on the hook for $14.5 billion in due taxes in the European Union. In 2016, the iPhone maker was fined $422 million by French watchdog over its controversial tax practices in the country.

The U.S. stock market has been on a record-setting spree since the election of Trump as president, but the rally has faltered in recent weeks as investors fret about a lack of clarity on his proposals to reform taxes and cut regulation. The S&P 500 and the Dow ended lower after FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing he had seen no evidence to support a claim by Trump that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped his campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in New York. His unsubstantiated tweet distracted from the claims of Russian interference in the election - as well as efforts by Republicans to push through a healthcare overhaul. "It's just one more day delaying talking about policy," said Ian Winer, director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "The market wants tax reform, and you need to get healthcare done before you get tax reform." The SPDR S&P Retail ETF fell 1.5 percent, all but erasing its gains since Trump's election as investors fretted that a border adjustment tax being pushed by Republicans in Congress would lead to higher prices for consumer products. The S&P 500 is unchanged from a week ago, but since the presidential election on Nov 8, it has surged 11 percent, heightening concerns about valuations. The S&P 500 is trading at nearly 18 times expected earnings, compared with a 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 0.04 percent to end at 20,905.86 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.20 percent to 2,373.47. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.01 percent to finish at 5,901.53 after briefly hitting an intraday record high. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the financial index's 0.9 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil fell as investors continued to unwind bets on higher prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve's conservative rate guidance is also keeping the market in check. A host of Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. The Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year and it could be more or less aggressive depending on inflation and fiscal policies from the Trump administration, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday. Last week, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time this year but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market. Apple rose 1.05 percent to a record-high close of US$141.46 after Cowen & Co upgraded its price target on the stock. Caterpillar rose 2.68 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, after it reported a smaller decline in sales for the 3 months through February versus the period ending in January. Walt Disney rose 0.85 percent after the company's "Beauty and the Beast" topped box-office sales. The stock was among the biggest gainers on the Dow. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 38 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The Apple-1, one of a handful verified to work, will be put on the block May 20 by Auction Team Breker of Cologne, Germany. The first pre-assembled personal computer, the Apple-1 lacked such amenities as a power supply, keyboard or display. Those were supplied by the computer hobbyists who bought the boards direct from the embryonic Apple or from the Byte Shop, an early computer store in Mountain View, Calif. In 1976, the first Apple-1 personal computers were sold for $666.66, or approximately $2,830 in today's dollars. They remain rare, with about 60 of the original 200 known to exist, several in the hands of museums such as the Smithsonian Museum of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Henry Ford Museum of Innovation in Dearborn, Mich. Breker's estimate was lower than recent sales prices of other Apple-1 computers. Interest in the machine has surged since 2010 as Apple itself blew through one revenue record after another, and as co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011, marking to some the passing of an era in personal computing. Auction prices jumped from $242,000 in 2010 to $671,000 in 2013, then topped out at the $905,000 paid by The Henry Ford Museum in October 2014. The lower projection by Breker may be because the auction house believed interest has waned or perhaps because of minor modifications to the circuit board. Mike Willegal, an engineer with a major technology company whose hobbies include tracking Apple-1 computers, noted that the system had an extra capacitor and additional logic on the board. Breker's Apple-1 is in working order, the auctioneer asserted, and backed up the claim with video of the computer loading several short demonstration programs from a cassette and running them. It has had but one owner, whom Breker identified only as a Berkeley, Calif., computer engineer. The computer will be accompanied by some paper documentation -- not unheard of in sales of technology antiques -- that includes the receipt for the original Nov. 30, 1976, purchase, a letter from Apple's customer service department dated from 1979, and a record of phone conversations with company founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

Apple seems to know this, which is why CEO Tim Cook is reportedly preparing to make a splash in the realm of augmented reality. Obviously, Apple wouldn’t be first out of the gate with AR technology. Google’s Tango platform, while still new, already has a handful of phones pledging support to it. A new report from Bloomberg, however, suggests that Apple may look to move beyond augmented reality that’s limited to just your phone. According to Bloomberg’s report, which is based on conversations with unnamed sources, Apple has formed a group of heavy hitters to develop augmented reality platforms for the Apple ecosystem. They say that the team is run by a former executive from Dolby Laboratories and includes engineers who previously worked on Oculus Rift and HoloLens. When we take some of Apple’s recent acquisitions into account, it becomes even more clear that the company wants to pursue AR. The end result is team of “hundreds of engineers” working on a number of different augmented reality projects. While an iPhone with an AR camera would almost certainly be the first of these projects out of the gate, Apple also envisions a future where it offers a set of AR glasses that rely on the iPhone to stream content. By having those glasses depend on the iPhone, it means that Apple can make a lightweight wearable that doesn’t have to be underpowered as a result. Bloomberg says that these glasses are still a ways off, but with Apple really beginning to focus on augmented reality, we could very well see an AR-capable iPhone sooner rather than later. Of course, don’t treat this rumor as the whole truth until we get some confirmation from Apple, especially when it comes to those rumored AR glasses. While Apple’s AR team may be developing a pair of glasses now as a proof of concept device, there’s no guarantee they’ll ever make it to retail. That’s especially true when you consider that wearables have largely struggled to gain a foothold with consumers. Still, this report offers some interesting food for thought. We’ll see if AR is a major feature in the new iPhone when it’s released later this year, but for now, hit up the source link below to read Bloomberg’s full report.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is said to be exploring features that would allow iPhone owners to change the depth of photographs taken with the phone's camera after they've been captured. Another potential implementation would let users isolate a specific object in an image, such as a person's head, and tilt it 180 degrees, the report says. Apple is also developing a feature that would make it possible to overlay virtual effects and objects onto a photo, similar to Snapchat. The report cautions that Apple may not roll out these features, but that the company has iPhone camera engineers working on them. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus has two cameras, one specifically tailored for better zooming, which allows the phone to shoot images that sharpen a subject against a slightly blurred background. Apple has reportedly assembled a team of experts specializing in augmented reality technology, camera sensors, 3D video production, and wearable tech hardware. This group reportedly includes Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies team at Dolby, as well as Cody White, who was formerly a lead engineer for Amazon's Lumberyard VR platform. Last year, The Financial Times also reported that Apple was building a secret team dedicated to developing virtual and augmented reality products. The iPhone maker is also said to be working on a pair of augmented reality glasses, as Bloomberg previously reported. This new headset combined with the upcoming iPhone camera features could put Apple in direct competition with Snap Inc., which released its first pair of glasses in September. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said that augmented reality is an area of interest for the company, although he hasn't discussed plans for future products. "I think AR is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology," Cook told The Washington Post in August. "So, yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain we talked about." Apple declined to comment for this story.

Bloomberg Says Apple Developing AR For Device By Corazon Victorino On 03/20/17 AT 11:44 AM Close Apple CEO Tim Cook has, on more than one occasion, asserted that augmented reality (AR) is going to get bigger than virtual reality (VR). Could his statement be the biggest clue on what the Cupertino giant is planning to do with its 10th anniversary iPhone? If Bloomberg’s latest report is to be believed, then it’s possible that Cook could be indeed teasing the iPhone 8 all along.  On Monday, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple has hired a bunch of people to work on AR technology for its products. Some engineers are also said to be focused on developing AR-related features for the next iPhone. “Apple is exploring … the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later,” Gurman stated.  Gurman further claimed that another application of AR the Cupertino giant is testing has to do with the isolation of objects in the image, so they can be tilted to 180 degrees. Another use of AR in the iPhone pertains to how users can utilize augmented reality in adding or placing virtual effects and objects on the person or subject of the image, just like how Snapchat’s filters work.  To do these, Gurman said that the next iPhone must have advanced technologies like depth sensing and the use of algorithms made by PrimeSense. Gurman noted that should Apple not choose to bring these features to its iPhones yet, they are bound to inevitably become a trend in the smartphone industry.  In relation to the AR features of a next-generation iPhone, Apple is also rumored to be developing AR glasses. However, creating something that would be sturdy and could complement the iPhone will be a Herculean task for the Cupertino giant’s engineers. Thus far, AR glasses in the market are either thin and underpowered or powerful but extremely thick. Given the company’s obsession to thin and light devices, it likely wouldn’t settle for anything that would break its releases of thin or small and powerful products.  While the Apple AR glasses seem to be a long way from reality, an iPhone with AR functionality is believed to come sooner. The Verge points out that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said last month that the upcoming iPhone would feature a “revolutionary” camera that would stand out from the lenses found on its predecessor due to the addition of an infrared projector and receiver. These components will reportedly make it possible for the camera of the iPhone 8 be capable of depth sensing and 3D mapping.  Per usual, Apple declined to comment about these speculations. What’s certain for now is Apple will hold a September launch event for its new phones, like what the tech giant always does.  The successor to last year’s iPhone 7 could come with AR functionality.

The timing of the downtime is notable given that Apple is rumored to launch new products as early as this week. Moreover, Apple commonly issues press releases at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, which is exactly when the so-called "maintenance" update is scheduled to be completed. Last week, a well-known research firm that requested confidentiality told us that, based on their own sources, it expects Apple to announce new products later this month, most likely during this week. The research firm did not say which products it expects Apple to announce, but rumors have widely suggested new iPad Pro models could be unveiled as early as this month, including updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models and an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, although the latter is less likely without an Apple event. At this point, it remains unclear if the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is even ready, so its introduction could be delayed until a future Spring event or WWDC 2017. However, a press release would be appropriate for the more iterative updates expected for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, along with any other smaller announcements. Given that it is already March 20, and that Apple usually invites the media to its launch events at least 10 days beforehand, an update to its online store accompanied by a press release is likely at this point if new products are imminent. Japanese blog Mac Otakara said Apple will host a March event to debut its new iPad Pro lineup, an iPhone SE with 128GB storage, new Apple Watch bands, and a red color option for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but an event this month is looking increasingly unlikely with only 11 days remaining in March. Apple recently redesigned its System Status page to provide more granular details about the statuses of its services, so there is no precedence for the page foreshadowing new product announcements this way. Accordingly, it is certainly possible that the downtime will indeed be related to maintenance and nothing else. (Thanks, Nathan!)

Today, a Bloomberg report has gathered all of the speculation surrounding Apple and AR together, while also providing some insight into a few lesser-known areas of Apple's AR project. Apple's augmented reality team is said to combine "the strengths of its hardware and software veterans," along with new additions within the company, according to people familiar with Apple's plans. The team is run by Mike Rockwell, who came from Dolby, and also consists of Yury Petrov (formerly of Oculus), Avi Barzeev (formerly of HoloLens), Cody White (formerly of Amazon's VR project "Lumberyard"), Tomlinson Holman (formerly of Lucasfilm), and more. A concept image of what AR on future iPhones could look like. The total scope of Apple's AR team is rounded out by many camera and optical lens engineers, as well as "people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses." Apple has even included talent from 3D animation company Weta Digital, which worked on films like Avatar and The Lord of the Rings. This team of individuals, along with AR advocate Tim Cook, see the new technology as a way for Apple "to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem." Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. The separate glasses are said to still be "a ways off," but AR integrated iPhone devices could show up much sooner, said the inside sources. Bloomberg compared the AR glasses to the Apple Watch, mentioning that the technology would come with its own OS and likely be tethered to an iPhone to send images and content to the user while consuming a lot of power, forcing Apple to find a battery life solution that would fit in the wearable's small frame. In addition to battery problems, Apple will have to find a way to convince users to wear the glasses in the first place. Explanations regarding the usefulness of AR on an iPhone remain scarce, but some feature details were also provided by Bloomberg today. The camera-specific abilities include ways for users to change the depth of an entire photo, or the depth of a specific object in the photo. In the past, Apple has cited interest in such technology, filing a patent for a digital camera with a refocusable imaging mode adapter that could be included in an iPhone. Former CEO Steve Jobs even met with a company, Lytro, who created the first light field camera. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. Apple is believed to be working on virtual reality technology, in addition to its interest in augmented reality, but with the success of apps like Pokémon Go the rumor cycle has taken to suggest that the company is betting more on AR. It's still unclear when a product including either piece of technology might launch. Recent concept images of the "iPhone 8" have taken a crack at visualizing AR features on an Apple smartphone, baking in "enhanced Siri" abilities and augmented reality directly into the user interface. Although many companies continue to invest time and money into both AR and VR, data collected by a number of market research firms late last year suggested that sales for such devices were weakening amid consumer apathy, grown out of a lack of interesting content and expensive prices.

Me too, I just mean there's so much more they could allow to enhance it. Sadly they don't really like the options of customization it can do when using xcode so they reject app updates I've done with it. I'm still holding out that they do allow for more enhancements to take place in IOS itself as well. Would be really nice to press on the wifi button to get a list of information or press the battery.. headphones.. alarms.. there's so much they could do it with it.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Yogi Adityanath Trivendra Singh Rawat Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home Money US STOCKS-Wall St swings to gains as Apple hits record-high Shares1 Mon, 20 Mar 2017-08:54pm , Reuters U.S. stocks reversed course to trade slightly higher in late morning trading on Monday, helped by a rise in technology stocks including Apple. Apple rose nearly 1 percent, hitting a new record-high of $141.34, lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to yet another intraday high. The iPhone-maker's stock could rise another 10 percent in six months, Barron's wrote in an article posted Saturday. The U.S. stock market has been on record-setting spree since the election of Donald Trump as president, but the rally has faltered in recent weeks as investors fret over the lack of clarity on his proposals to reform taxes and cut regulation. Analysts have also said the Trump administration is spending too much of its political capital to pass a Republican-proposed healthcare bill, which may leave it wanting for support when it tries to reform the tax code. "With tax reform and infrastructure spending getting pushed to the end of this year or even next year, it will eventually weigh on sentiment and business confidence," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "Eventually, the market will lose patience," Frederick said. At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.91 points, or 0.18 percent, at 20,951.53. The S&P 500 was up 0.93 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,379.18. The Nasdaq Composite was up 12.01 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,913.01. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.68 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil fell as investors continued to unwind bets on higher prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve's conservative rate guidance is also keeping the market in check. All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans when he speaks later in the day. In an interview with Fox Business Network TV earlier on Monday, Evans said the Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year. A host of Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. Last week, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time this year but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market. Among stocks, Movado fell 5.70 percent to $22.25 after the watchmaker's quarterly results missed expectations. Walt Disney rose 1.1 percent to $112.96 after the media and entertainment company's "Beauty and the Beast" topped box-office sales. The stock was the second-biggest boost on the Dow. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,242. On the Nasdaq, 1,460 issues fell and 1,229 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 77 new highs and 20 new lows.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 March 2017 by Military News Lookout Expands Mobile Endpoint Security Solution to Enhance Productivity Across iOS Enterprises SAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Lookout, the global leader in securing mobility, has expanded its enterprise security solution, Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security, to address the most pressing needs of iOS-centric organizations and accelerate the adoption of secure mobility. Lookout and Apple understand mobile is transforming the way business is done, and as mobile productivity increases, enterprises are developing their own apps to take advantage of this transformation. As a new Apple mobility partner, Lookout is introducing enterprise app review to enable enterprises building their own iOS apps to rapidly analyze them for data policy compliance and security risks. With enterprise app review, custom iOS apps are uploaded into the Lookout Security Cloud for correlation against a 40-million-app database to uncover anomalies before distribution via internal app stores. Many enterprises have unique compliance policies that specify how corporate data should be stored and transmitted, including while in use on mobile devices and in apps. Some mobile apps or public Wi-Fi networks compromise company or industry policies. For example, enterprise apps developed by third parties and distributed through internal app stores may lack sufficient encryption to protect customer or patient data.      „Enterprises must be confident that their data is secure while employees are working anywhere in the world,” said Santosh Krishnan, Lookout chief product officer. „This new functionality is addressing mobile compliance as part of our collective mission to help organizations seamlessly embrace mobile productivity in the workplace.” In addition to reviewing custom apps, Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security can also review apps downloaded from the App Store. While vetted and approved through Apple’s stringent App Store approval process, some apps may automatically send contact or location information to an external server which may directly contradict corporate policy. Plus, with the rise of mobile productivity on the go, employees are frequently connecting to public Wi-Fi networks which could expose corporate data in transit.  Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security extends the built-in security of the iOS platform by leveraging the Lookout Security Cloud to provide enterprises with visibility and protection across network threats and suspicious behaviors for apps that are built in-house and distributed via MDM for iOS. Lookout customers will be able to: Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security is sold through Lookout’s Channel Partner Program. For iOS-specific enterprise employees, the Lookout app can be downloaded from the App Store. To learn more about Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security visit www.lookout.com. About Lookout Lookout is a cybersecurity company that makes it possible for tens of millions of individuals, enterprises and government agencies to be both mobile and secure. Powered by a dataset of virtually all the mobile code in the world — 40 million apps and counting — the Lookout Security Cloud can identify connections that would otherwise go unseen and predict and stop mobile attacks before they do harm. The world’s leading mobile network operators, including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, EE, KDDI, Orange, Sprint, T-Mobile and Telstra, have selected Lookout as its preferred mobile security solution. Lookout is also partnered with such enterprise leaders as AirWatch, Ingram Micro, Microsoft, and MobileIron. Headquartered in San Francisco, Lookout has offices in Amsterdam, Boston, London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto and Washington, D.C.

By Staff Reporter Updated March 21, 2017 08:54 GMT Apple's Siri likes a good chat, but there are some things that should be left unsaidiStock In the five years since Apple's digital assistant Siri first graced our iPhones (and then iPads, iMacs, Apple Watches, and more), the Cupertino giant has added a multitude of funny, if completely pointless, responses to frivolous questions. There are, however, some aspects of Siri's sardonic wit that could get you in trouble with the law, your partner, your boss, or just make you feel really awful thanks to a particularly brutal put-down. You may have become tired asking Siri the same old questions about the meaning of life and woodchucks chucking wood, but these are some alternatives you really shouldn't try: Ask Siri to call your boyfriend or girlfriend in front of your current partner Apple's virtual boffin can allocate family tags to your contact list with a few simple commands, but while asking Siri to call your dad is one thing, a call to your significant other could land you in the dog house. As retold in a humourous reddit thread, a girl fell foul of this when showing her boyfriend how "Siri can you call me boyfriend please" would place a call to him. Unfortunately, said girl had apparently forgotten to delete "boyfriend status" from her ex's contact profile, leading to Siri's painfully awkward response: "Which one?" Ask Siri to give you a dumb nickname Siri's habit of including names in its responses is part of what makes Apple's assistant feel a little less robotic and more like a real AI. If you are fed up for being on first name terms with Siri though, you can always mix it up and ask it to call you something else. While it may be funny at first to be called "Batman" when engaging in "bot banter", asking Siri reasonable questions while in an important business meeting/in school class/on a date only to have it reveal your inner nerd might make the novelty wear off pretty sharpish. Ask what zero divided by zero is ...unless you want to be hit with a "sick burn", Siri-style. Here's the response you'll get: "Imagine that you have zero cookies," Siri's response begins, "and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get? See? It doesn't make sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends." Savage. Ask for help with an addiction or illness There are plenty of queries Siri can help you with, but we suggest you leave more serious questions to a real life expert. This is especially true for anything related to addictions or immediate medical issues, where responses are mostly mixed, with certain symptoms directing you to a local pharmacy or hospital and others greeted with complete confusion. In short, if you need health advice or medical attention, Siri should not be your first port of call. Say 'Hey Cortana' The amount of challengers to Siri's personal assistant crown has grown dramatically in the last year, with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant both bringing personality and practicality to rival Apple's chatty champion. Microsoft's Cortana was its first real competitor on smartphones though, and we suggest you never mix those two up. Here's the wickedly passive aggressive response you get for saying "Hey Cortana" to Siri: "Very funny, [your name]. I mean, not funny "ha-ha," but funny." Anything with swear words That's just rude. Siri will let you know it, too. Anything which makes a call to emergency services... unless you actually need it This should be obvious, but you should never call an emergency services number unless you are in danger or in need of immediate help. For those that do need emergency assistance, Siri is programmed to call local emergency dial-codes by saying "999", "911", and similar international numbers. Unfortunately, pranksters have taken to abusing this system by tricking unsuspecting iPhone users. Whether it was the spate of idiots encouraging iPhone owners to ask Siri to "charge your phone up to 100 percent" in 2015 (which has now been patched) or the more blunt suggestion that you should say "108" (triggering a call to local emergency services via a re-direct service) in a more recent "Siri scam", there is no excuse for hoax 999 calls, or deceiving others to do so without their knowledge. Don't do it.

Apple rose nearly 1 percent, hitting a new record-high of $141.34, lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to yet another intraday high. The iPhone-maker's stock could rise another 10 percent in six months, Barron's wrote in an article posted Saturday. The U.S. stock market has been on record-setting spree since the election of Donald Trump as president, but the rally has faltered in recent weeks as investors fret over the lack of clarity on his proposals to reform taxes and cut regulation. Analysts have also said the Trump administration is spending too much of its political capital to pass a Republican-proposed healthcare bill, which may leave it wanting for support when it tries to reform the tax code. "With tax reform and infrastructure spending getting pushed to the end of this year or even next year, it will eventually weigh on sentiment and business confidence," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "Eventually, the market will lose patience," Frederick said. At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.91 points, or 0.18 percent, at 20,951.53. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.93 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,379.18. The Nasdaq Composite was up 12.01 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,913.01. Seven of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.68 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil fell as investors continued to unwind bets on higher prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve's conservative rate guidance is also keeping the market in check. All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans when he speaks later in the day. In an interview with Fox Business Network TV earlier on Monday, Evans said the Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year. A host of Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. Last week, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time this year but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market. Among stocks, Movado fell 5.70 percent to $22.25 after the watchmaker's quarterly results missed expectations. Walt Disney rose 1.1 percent to $112.96 after the media and entertainment company's "Beauty and the Beast" topped box-office sales. The stock was the second-biggest boost on the Dow. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,242. On the Nasdaq, 1,460 issues fell and 1,229 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 77 new highs and 20 new lows.

View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We’ve now heard more than one report that, while Apple has augmented reality plans for the iPhone, it is also planning to make some smart glasses further down the line. This is the product category made famous – or perhaps infamous – by Google Glass. There are two undeniable facts about Google Glass. First, it’s cool technology. Second, it’s decidedly uncool to be seen wearing them. It was that latter fact that led to Google abandoning plans to pitch them as a consumer device and to target them instead at enterprise applications, like giving engineers hands-free access to manuals while repairing equipment. Now, Apple is a master of taking once-geeky technology and making it cool. It did that with the iPod – turning a rather techy product category into the coolest product on the planet at the time – and of course with the iPhone. Previous smartphones were techy-looking things controlled by a keyboard and stylus, the iPhone was a friendly device that had mass-market appeal. But could even Apple make smart glasses cool … ? Anker braided Lightning cables Let’s start by getting one possibility out of the way. Google sees a market for smart glasses in the enterprise area, and I think it’s absolutely right. I can see a ton of applications in situations where getting the job done efficiently is more important than how you look while doing it. But Apple is a consumer company. It’s exceedingly unlikely it plans to make anything specifically for the enterprise sector. The closest it gets to that is the Mac Pro, and that isn’t really an enterprise product – it’s one made for the creative sector, which primarily comprises small businesses. And even there, Apple’s commitment to the product is distinctly underwhelming. So if Apple really does plan to make smart glasses, it will be doing so as a mass-market consumer product. Google tried to persuade us via marketing images that Glass was cool. Nobody fell for it. Real-life people wearing Glass looked like they belonged in a lab. But Apple could do better, right? It could take a clunky design and make it sleek and desirable, surely? Well, maybe, but I see two obstacles. First, when you actually look at Google Glass, it’s not that clunky a design. I mean, sure, that black plastic would look better clad in anodised aluminum, and it’s visually disturbing that the curve of the plastic doesn’t match the curve of the headband. It definitely needs some work. But even with Jony Ive’s touch, the basic form factor needs to be roughly the same. You need enough battery in there to power the display for a decent length of time, so you’re not going to lose much bulk. The display itself has to be mounted in roughly that position, so you’re not going to lose the cyborg look. You need the headband or some similar device to hold it in position. And so on. In short, it’s hard to see how any smart glasses could look massively different in appearance from this. Unless you disguise them as real glasses, but the massive variation in designs there shows the magnitude of the task of trying to make a handful of models that look good on anyone. Second, what job are smart glasses intended to do for consumers? It’s not going to be virtual reality – Tim Cook has already made that abundantly clear – so it’s not going to deliver an immersive gaming experience. The type of applications we’ve heard so far are all things that can be done perfectly well by a smartphone, holding it up in front of us for the short time needed to perform the specific task we need. So what is the application that justifies wearing something like this all day? I’m skeptical that Apple can give us a good reason to wear smart glasses, and I’m skeptical that even its highly talented designers can make them look stylish. But I do have one piece of counter-evidence to my thesis: AirPods. I don’t care what marketing images Apple has out there; real people do not look cool while wearing AirPods. (Sorry, Jason: I’m not picking on you – I’m using your photo precisely because you look exactly like everyone who isn’t a backlit model looks while wearing AirPods.) And yet AirPods have apparently been a massive commercial success. Supply is only now starting to catch up with demand. Which, in my view, can only be explained in one of three ways: People think they look cool wearing them They don’t care how they look, they love the portability & convenience The fact that it’s an Apple product makes it automatically cool to be seen wearing them Perhaps that third possibility is the answer here. If any other company had launched AirPods, everyone would be commenting on the weird design. But because it’s Apple, the brand lends a coolness to the product that the design really doesn’t deserve. Maybe Apple can pull off the same trick with smart glasses. What do you guys think? Will smart glasses always make you look like a cyborg no matter how slick the design? Can Apple actually make them look cool? Or is the Apple branding enough to turn an uncool look into a desirable one? As ever, please take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.

 The first signs of Apple's next big thing may look a lot like Snapchat Kif Leswing Mar. 20, 2017, 10:48 AM 4,474 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Future Apple products will include a technology called augmented reality, which overlays computer graphics and information from the internet into the real world. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the majority of people will soon have AR experiences daily.  Apple's goal for this technology is to make a pair of smartglasses, but in the short term, the first fruits of the effort will bring AR features to the iPhone, Bloomberg reported on Monday.   Some of Apple's AR team are working on Apple's iPhone camera team. According to the report, features that possibly could show up in an upcoming version of the iPhone include: One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works.  An example of Snapchat's AR filters.Maya Kosoff/Business Insider In the past few years, Apple has purchased several AR startups, including FlyBy Media and Metaio. Engineers from those companies are now working in a special projects camera group, Business Insider previously reported.  But Apple also has an AR-specific team led by Mike Rockwell, a former Dolby executive, which includes respected Apple veterans including Fletcher Rothkopf, who helped design the Apple Watch and who is named on several of Apple's most inventive patents.  In the long term, Apple is planning to create a pair of smartglasses. The challenges Apple faces include battery life, making them stylish and wearable for long periods of time, and possibly developing a new operating system and chip for the glasses. Apple will also need to invest in 3D animation to provide solid content for the wearable platform.  The glasses are likely to be wirelessly "tethered" to an iPhone, which will handle processing, like the Apple Watch. Previous rumors have suggested that the glasses could launch as early as 2018. Apple CEO Tim Cook's public comments from last fall suggest that Apple Glass may be a while. "AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there," Cook said.  SEE ALSO: Tim Cook laid out the playbook for Apple's next big thing More: Apple Apple AR facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The first signs of Apple's next big thing may look a lot like Snapchat The first signs of Apple's next big thing may look a lot like Snapchat Future Apple products will include a technology...

Apple has committed itself to using only clean renewable energy to operate all of its stores, data centers, and manufacturing facilities worldwide. That pledge applies to its suppliers as well. On March 8, Apple announced that Ibiden — a Japanese company that “helps bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices” — has become the first company in Japan to pledge that it will soon “power all of its Apple manufacturing with 100 percent renewable energy.” To realize that goal, Ibiden has created one of the largest floating solar farms in Japan. The floating solar island is built on land that was previously a lumberyard. Open land is scarce in Japan, so finding space for a solar farm that doesn’t detract from the country’s limited supply of open land is important. Similar considerations have prompted solar developers in other countries to use floating solar farms, especially in India. Apple considers Ibiden’s proposal to build 20 solar power installations in Japan a “significant step forward in Apple’s efforts to help its manufacturing partners transition to clean power.” In total, Apple expects to be generating more than 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually to power its global operations by the end of 2018. “We’re proud to partner with suppliers like Ibiden who recognize that renewable energy investments are good for the environment and good for business,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “As we continue our push to power our global operations with 100 percent renewable energy, it is more important than ever that we help our manufacturing partners make the same transition to cleaner sources, and set an example for other companies to follow.” Ibiden’s managing director of its environment group, Kyoichi Yamanaka, agrees. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically. Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Source: Digital Trends Reprinted with permission.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « U.K. Man Dies in Bath due to his iPhone falling in still Charging | Main | Samsung's Galaxy S8 will introduce a new Side Button for Quick Web Searches and Eventually Instant Access to Bixby » March 20, 2017 Apple Supplier Considers U.S. for 3nm Chip Plant because Taiwan Power Supply is Unstable   Patently Apple posted a report in mid-January titled "It's a Long Shot, but TSMC wouldn't rule out Opening a U.S. Plant to Support U.S. Customers like Apple and Qualcomm." Building on that commentary by TSMC, we learn today from a report from the China Post that TSMC has now stated that they're specifically considering plans for a 3nm chip production plant in the U.S. while also considering another location in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.   TSMC said its plans for the production of chips on the 3nm process will be finalized in the first half of next year and noted that its Chairman Morris Chang (張忠謀) had not ruled out the possibility of investing in the U.S.   The original story broke by the Economic Daily News that claimed that TSMC was planning to invest NT$500 billion (US$16.39 billion) to build a 3nm plant in the U.S. since the electricity supply by Taiwan Power Co., the sole power supplier in the Taiwan, was unstable.   The report further noted that "the Taiwan government was willing to help TSMC secure land in Lujhu in Kaohsiung for a 3nm plant but the company was worried that it would not be able to obtain the environmental impact assessment in time to meet its 2022 start date for the mass production of the advanced chip process.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Fretting about running out of juice will seem quaint, like hand-cranking a car to start it. Speaking of which, I want battery-powered flying cars too. For today, though, many who are weary of dead devices resort to third-party power accessories that make charging more convenient and devices less likely to run dry. A dizzying variety of such charging accessories exists, many designed for users of Apple laptops, tablets, phones and watches. I’ve been trying out a number of these, some of which have proven helpful. I give charging accessories bonus points if they can solve two or more power problems – charging my Apple Watch along with my iPhone, say, or being compatible with multiple charging standards like Lightning, USB-C, and Micro-USB. One of the products even brings a dearly departed Apple charging technology back from the dead! Satechi 60W 6-Port Multi-Port USB Desktop Charging Station -- Like many tech geeks, I’m awash in gadgets needing to be charged. A multi-port charging station makes this chore simpler to handle since I don’t have to wrestle with an assortment of individual chargers, each needing its own AC outlet. I’ve used a number of such charging stations over the years, but with the advent of USB-C, I’ve been on the lookout for an updated power station. Satechi’s $29.99 six-port variant has worked out nicely so far. Available in black or white, the charging station sports four USB-A ports and two USB-C ports, permitting me to charge everything from iOS devices and Bluetooth audio accessories to newer Apple notebooks. I have just a few quibbles. Because it lacks rubber feet, the Satechi charging station slides around awkwardly no matter where I place it. In desperation, I resorted to clamping the Satechi in a vertical notebook stand. It’s also a bit big to take on the road. In addition, Satechi’s charging station emits a low-pitched but persistent hum when plugged into a power outlet and switched on; the hum drove me nuts until I pinpointed the source. I’ve since grown used to it, but if you’re sensitive to noise, it might be a deal-breaker. Nomad Ultra Rugged Cable Series -- When grabbing a charging cord for the road, most iOS users take the one that came with their devices. There is no added cost, and Apple’s Lightning cables are thin and coil well. However, they’re also notoriously prone to fraying or otherwise failing prematurely. I’ve been testing a trio of alternatives from Nomad called Ultra Rugged Cables. Other companies sell such cables, but Nomad has added a few nice twists. All of Nomad’s cables are made of extra-thick wire sheathed in Kevlar and braided ballistic nylon. This makes them durable and tangle-resistant (and looks cool) but adds weight and bulk. In addition to a $29.95 Lightning cable, Nomad sells a $39.95 Battery Cable that incorporates a cylindrical battery and a $39.95 Universal Cable that is three charging cables in one: Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-C. I focused my testing on the latter two cables. The Battery Cable provides roughly one entire iPhone charge when topped off, and itself charges when it’s plugged into a wall charger or computer via its USB-A prong. The battery is not, however, rated for iPad charging. This is why I sometimes saw a Not Charging message when plugging the cable into an iPad Pro, although trickle charging did occur. An iPad will charge just fine with the cable plugged into a power source, though. You may appreciate the fact that the Battery Cable is 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) long, as are its siblings. I find it useful for snaking the cable out of my backpack and into my iPhone with length to spare. Or it may seem like an excessive length. To determine how much charging capacity is left in the battery, you press a little button to make an adjacent light turn on. If the light is white, you have between 30 and 100 percent capacity. If it’s orange, you’ve gone below 30 percent and need to recharge soon. Nomad’s Universal Cable pulls off its three-in-one trick by providing a USB-A to Micro-USB cable, and then adding two adapters or “tips,” attached to the cord via rubber strips, that each fit atop the Micro-USB prong to turn it into a Lightning or USB-C prong. This approach works nicely, though wrestling one adapter into place while keeping the other out of the way can be a bit awkward at times. Charging the 2016 MacBook Pro in my home office was a cinch, with the Universal Cable’s USB-C tip jacked into the notebook and its USB-A end plugged into the Satechi charging station. I’ve also used the Universal Cable to charge my iPhone, my iPad, non-Apple smartphones with USB-C ports, and an array of Micro-USB accessories, such as audio headsets. All three Ultra Rugged Cables include sturdy, stretchy, attached silicone ties for keeping the accessories in tight bundles for transport. They partly make up for how bulky the cords are compared to regular cables. BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable -- Many people who have upgraded to recent Apple notebooks with USB-C ports have mourned the loss of MagSafe charging. With that beloved technology, charging prongs engaged with corresponding laptop ports magnetically, and readily disengaged if the laptop was unexpectedly yanked. MagSafe prevented an untold number of damaged Macs due to people tripping over cords. USB-C doesn’t work like that, unfortunately. Its charging prongs fit in more deeply and do not pull out as easily, which can be a problem in the aforementioned yanking scenarios. Griffin thinks it has the answer with its $39.99 BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Cable. This ingenious product consists of a USB-C to USB-C cable with a detachable tip at one end. That’s the end that goes into a laptop’s USB-C port. Then, if the cable is accidentally pulled, it readily detaches from the tip, leaving only that dongle connected. This is, basically, MagSafe with a new name, BreakSafe. I used the BreakSafe cable with the 2016 MacBook Pro, and it performed splendidly. Though clever, the cable’s two piece design isn’t perfect. To replicate MagSafe functionality fully, you have to leave the tip plugged into the laptop at all times, which is clunkier than an integrated MagSafe port and potentially perilous if the tip catches on something and twists enough to damage the port. You could detach the BreakSafe cable and its tip entirely when you are done working and stash the accessory in your bag for transport. But you have to take care that the tip doesn’t accidentally detach from the cable and disappear. That happened to me twice, but I managed to find the tip each time. One other quibble: the BreakSafe cable, like Nomad’s Ultra Rugged Cables, is bulkier and heavier than Apple’s standard USB-C to USB-C cables, which makes for a bit more of a burden while on the go. Logitech Base -- When Apple unveiled its iPad Pro tablet line, it also introduced the Smart Connector. This port, built into one of the iPad’s long edges, is designed to engage with accessories, such as keyboard cases, for power as well as data transfer. After Apple announced the Smart Connector, many expected a flurry of third-party accessories that would tap into this technology. The expected flood has been more of a trickle. Logitech, though, has been on board with a handful of Smart Connector-compatible gadgets. These include a couple of Create keyboard cases along with an iPad Pro charging stand called the Base. The $99.99 Base, which mimics the look and feel of the iMac’s metal base, holds an iPad Pro erect in landscape orientation, at a slight angle, while linking it to power via a Smart Connector at the bottom. The Base accommodates either a 9.7-inch or a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and, we can hope, future iPad Pro variants. It works as a stand for other iPad models too, but obviously without the charging capability. I found the Base handy for charging an iPad Pro while also working on it via a Bluetooth keyboard. The iPad became a cute little desk workstation, though I found the fixed viewing angle less than ideal. The rest of the time, I’ve kept the iPad on the Base alongside my iMac as a secondary display for monitoring email, news, and social-media feeds. The Base itself gets power via a Lightning port in the back. If you have the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, though, you might want to buy a Lightning to USB-C cable along with Apple’s 29-watt USB-C Power Adapter (see “iPad Pro Charges Faster with MacBook Adapter and New Cable,” 27 April 2016). Belkin Valet Charger Power Pack for Apple Watch + iPhone -- I love to travel but hate the clutter that all of the cords and chargers for my tech gear tends to create. Belkin’s $99.99 Valet Charger Power Pack for Apple Watch + iPhone reduces this clutter by building an Apple Watch charging disk onto a portable battery pack. It lets me leave the crazy long Apple Watch charging cord at home and pack just a Lightning cable for my iPhone. Alas, Belkin’s Valet is far from the standard set by P. G. Wodehouse’s Jeeves. It sports only one USB port, so forget about charging more than one device at once. As battery packs go, it’s kind of puny for the money — you can buy a battery pack with two or more ports, fast-charging capability (which the Valet lacks) and greater charging capacity for half the price. Despite these issues, the Valet suits my needs. It’s compact, unlike other massive battery packs in my collection. Even so, it provides three full iPhone charges or eight Apple Watch charges, not that I can imagine the situation where you’d need a week of Apple Watch charges without being able to get to any other form of power. Three More Accessories -- I want to touch briefly on three other gadgets that have proven useful to me in various scenarios. Nomad’s Car Charger With Battery is just that, a device charger that plugs into a car’s accessory port but also incorporates a battery so it can charge your iPhone once, fully, away from the car. Yet the charger is compact, even more so than Belkin’s Valet. The Nomad charger has two ports, USB-A and USB-C – the latter a nod to the rising number of non-Apple phones and accessories with USB-C ports. But you can charge two iPhones if you have a Lightning to USB-C cable for one of them. This works fine in the car, but the battery does not have enough capacity to top off two such devices. If this product strikes your fancy, grab it now since it has disappeared from Nomad’s site but can still be found at resellers such as Amazon for about $50. Nomad also sells a $19.95 NomadPlus for iPhone accessory that adds a small battery to Apple’s regular iPhone charging plug. The Apple charger and Nomad battery fuse together well, with Apple’s white accessory fitting into a square hole in the black Nomad mini-brick. The battery tops up while the Apple charger is plugged into the wall so that users have auxiliary power for their iPhones when they are away from wall outlets. The third and simplest accessory is a $39.99 Belkin dongle called Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar that transforms an iPhone’s single Lightning port into two Lightning ports. It thus allows for uninterrupted charging while using a set of Lightning EarPods for listening to music — or, in my case, as a journalist, for conducting tons of telephone interviews with my hands free for taking notes on a keyboard while not fretting about running low on juice. Go, Go, Power Gadgets -- So many clever charging accessories exist for Apple devices that this article has scarcely scratched the surface. Such an accessory ecosystem is a good example of how Apple’s intentionally sparse product selection can be augmented by third-party purveyors to spectacular effect. You certainly could make do with the charging equipment that Apple provides for its computers and mobile gear – but why would you want to, with so many other accessories that can make your life easier?   READERS LIKE YOU!

Reply Tripp Frohlichstein  2017-03-19 14:24 About the first device, you write, "Because it lacks rubber feet, the Satechi charging station slides around awkwardly no matter where I place it. In desperation, I resorted to clamping the Satechi in a vertical notebook stand. It’s also a bit big to take on the road." Try velcro. Works great and is what I use on my bed stand. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-19 15:59 Good idea! Reply Bruce Blakely  2017-03-20 15:35 From back in the 30-pin day, my wife has an iPhone charging stand that is also a USB-2 hub (multiple USB ports in base). Still usable with the 30-pin to lightning adapter, but as far as I've been able to tell, no similar device was ever built with lightning built-in (much less USB-3). Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-20 20:57 I just picked up a 4-port (2 each 1A; 2 each 2A) charger by SyncWire. It puts out a total of 34watts so you can charge 2 devices that require 10w and 2 that only require 5w at the same time. Of course you can instead charge 5w devices using the 10w ports and since you will only be drawing 1amp from all 4 ports this way, you'll only be consuming just over 20watts. I plan on using it during a 30 day trip this summer to charge my iPhone, my iPad, and my Watch each night. I bought it from Amazon https://tinyurl.com/k7nf8rb Reply Jerry  2017-03-21 06:51 The only alternative charging solution of much interest to Apple's own would be a solution to make use of old MagSafe chargers - still waiting for that. (Bought the MagSafe, but has not used it as it is bulky and too easy breaks away since the cable is so stiff, so not much use there either.)

The company is also said to be working on other AR products such as digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and transmit movies, maps and other information to the wearer. Mike Rockwell, former EVP of Products and Technology at Dolby, is running the AR team with key engineers including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the Apple Watch team; Tomlinson Holman who created THX, Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, former director of software development at Meta; Yury Petrov, former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple wants to bring AR enhancements to the iPhone's camera which could include the ability to change the depth of a photo or even isolate objects. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. To make these features possible, the iPhone 8 will reportedly gain a 'revolutionary' front camera with 3D sensing capabilities. The system is said to consist of three modules that run algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company Apple acquired in 2013. Apple isn't expected to unveil the iPhone 8 until later this year.

Apple could be putting together an augmented reality team Posted Mar 20, 2017 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Bixby is Samsung’s new ‘intelligent interface’ for smartphones and beyond Apple could be betting big on augmented reality. According to a new Bloomberg report, the company could be working on augmented reality features for the iPhone and then later for glasses, a new device that you would pair with your smartphone. While the hypothetical pair of glasses is nowhere near ready, it’s still interesting to see what Apple is working on behind the scenes. And it first starts with a team. Mike Rockwell is apparently leading the new augmented reality team. He previously worked for Dolby on new technologies and hardware. Last Spring, Rockwell put together a team of experienced engineers when it comes to augmented reality. According to Bloomberg, members of the team include: Cody White, a former lead Amazon engineer who worked on Amazon’s CryEngine game engine fork Duncan McRoberts, the former director of software development at Meta Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher Avi Bar-Zeev, a former Amazon and Microsoft engineer who worked on HoloLens, among other things Various engineers working on special effects for Hollywood blockbusters Hardware and software engineers who were working on other projects at Apple also joined the team. Apple also acquired Metaio and Flyby Media for those projects. Overall, hundreds of engineers could be working on augmented reality right now. All of this sounds cool, but it doesn’t really tell us what Apple has in store for its users. Details are thin on this front in Bloomberg’s report. Apple could start with basic augmented reality features in the Camera app, such as selfie filters and real-time object detection, starting with faces. In other words, you can expect Snapchat-style filters built into iOS soon. While this is not augmented reality per se, the company could also go beyond Portrait Mode by letting you adjust the focus on an image after taking a photo. And that’s about all we know so far. If Apple is serious about augmented reality, there should be something more than this. Bloomberg talks about new augmented reality glasses so you can add virtual data to the world around you, but it sounds like the company itself doesn’t know what it wants to do with the new device yet. As always, take this information with a grain of salt. And let’s see if iOS 11 gives us hints about Apple’s augmented reality bet. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Citing people with knowledge of Apple’s plans, the report states that the company’s built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders. The group is allegedly being run by former Dolby Laboratories executive Mike Rockwell and includes engineers who worked on Facebook’s Oculus and Microsoft’s HoloLens virtual reality headsets “as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood.” Hundreds of engineers are now focused on the project. The report states that the glasses “are a ways off” though some of the aforementioned AR features could show up in the next iPhone sooner. One of the features of Apple’s digital spectacles could allow the user to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later. Another feature would isolate an object in the image, like a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. Yet another feature in development could add special effects and put virtual objects on a person akin to Snapchat. Apple’s CEO is reportedly “very serious” about AR and has embarked the firm on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses to ensure it “dominates the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem.” Rather than completely enclose the user in virtual worlds, Apple’s digital glasses would overlay images, video and games on the real world like Microsoft’s HoloLens. The accessory would connect to an iPhone like Apple Watch and use its processor to render and show content in augmented reality, including movies, maps and more. Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition. This would consume a lot of power so battery life and availability of AR-enabled apps and games will be crucial. The glasses will require a new operating system from Apple, joining iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, and maybe even a dedicated chip. Apple’s AR team includes the following experts: Mike Rockwell—Charged with leading Apple’s AR group. Rockwell previously ran Dolby’s hardware and new technologies groups and advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. He reports to Dan Riccio, who’s in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups. Fletcher Rothkopf—Helped lead the team that designed Apple Watch. Tomlinson Holman—Created THX audio popularized by LucasFilm. Cody White—He led Amazon’s Lumberyard virtual reality platform. Duncan McRoberts—Meta’s former director of software development. Yury Petrov—Former Oculus researcher. Avi Bar-Zeev—Worked on Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Google Earth app. Other experts in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. People with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The AR team’s lead, Rothkopf, is “a really sharp guy” who could certainly “put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going,” said Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. Apple also opened an office in Wellington, New Zealand and hired away several employees from the special-effects firm Weta Digital that worked on King Kong, Avatar, The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies and other films. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Gurman has learned that former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt (Apple bought his firm in 2015) now works on Apple’s strategic deals team which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, an AR startup that lets mobile devices “see” the world around them. “Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company’s AR technology,” as per Gurman. Apple is working on several AR products, stated Bloomberg. Apple’s boss Tim Cook opined that at some point, we will all “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day.

By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 20 March 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oculus, Tim Cook Tweet Tim Cook   Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple’s chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR’s game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.” Investors impatient for Apple’s next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company’s plans say Apple has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses — an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content — movies, maps and more — to the wearer. While the glasses are some way off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It’s an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80% to US$165bn by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. “It’s something they need to do to continue to grow,” he says, “and defend against the shift in how people use hardware.” Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it’s less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be “enclosed in something”. Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn’t a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they’ll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key, too. If Apple’s AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multidisciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who’s in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. “He’s a really sharp guy,” says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. “He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going.” Apple’s iPhone Last spring, in a sign that it’s serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell’s team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say, are Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon’s Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta’s former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry’s 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple’s strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company’s AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple’s first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. “To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff, too: from maps to social to payments,” Munster says. “Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.”  — (c) 2017 NewsCentral Media Reported with assistance from Alex Webb and Mark Bergen Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 77Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 37ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 4Cell C swings to net profit of R540m 2IFC coy on Net1 allegations 2Zuma to lead grants reform Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple is working on "digital spectacles" that could connect to an iPhone and beam content like movies and maps, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported on Monday. The Cupertino, Calif.- based company is also working on augmented reality features for the iPhone that are similar to Snapchat, Bloomberg said. To make its augmented reality push, Apple has acquired augmented reality start-ups FlyBy Media and Metaio, and hired major players from Amazon, Facebook's Oculus, Microsoft's HoloLens, and Dolby, Bloomberg said. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple's AR ambitions don't come as a total surprise. Apple patents for augmented reality maps, facial recognition, a headset, and new camera software have surfaced this month alone. Augmented reality, which lets viewers superimpose graphics onto footage of the physical world, has become a mainstream hit with the IPO of Snap. For a deeper look inside Apple's augmented reality plans, see the article at Bloomberg.com.

Firstly, it corroborates with past reports in saying that Apple has a large number of engineers working on AR features and that it will first debut on the iPhone. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. Bloomberg also describes some specific features Apple is exploring, but lacks detail. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. However, the report does believe that Apple will be producing AR glasses in the future, despite Google’s failed attempt at them. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard […] The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. The piece also notes that Apple has recruited some high-profile engineers to work on the project. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood.

By Alistair Charlton March 20, 2017 14:13 GMT Fan-made render shows how augmented reality could work on the next iPhoneGabor Balogh Apple has a team of hundreds of engineers working on a way to bring augmented reality technologies to future iPhones, potentially starting with the 2017 handset, due in September, and including features similar to those of Snapchat. The news, passed to the press by Apple insiders speaking on grounds of anonymity, comes after company boss Tim Cook has repeatedly sung the praises of augmented reality (AR), believing the technology has a more promising future than that of virtual reality (VR). Speaking to the well-connected Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the unnamed sources said Apple has a team of hundreds of engineers devoted to developing AR technologies, including some who are members of the iPhone camera team and working on AR in conjunction with future versions of the smartphone. The report states: "One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees." While flipping someone's head over doesn't sound like the most groundbreaking of image manipulation technology, another use of AI by Apple makes more sense. "A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person," the report adds. "Much in the way Snapchat works." It isn't clear if these features will be coming to the next iPhone, which is due to be revealed sometime in September, but they do tally with claims by the reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said the 2017 iPhone will have a "revolutionary" camera. Bringing Snapchat-style features to the iPhone is a surefire way to win over picture-sharing millennials, and for Apple to get its foot in the AR door. It is being speculated that Apple would use technology inherited during its acquisition of the Israeli company PrimeSense in 2013. To help make its AR dreams a reality Apple has hired numerous engineers from Microsoft's HoloLens team and Oculus, the Facebook-owned manufacturer of the Rift VR headset. Cook said about AR in February 2017: "Most people won't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it," he said. "With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance." Looking further ahead, the same Apple insiders say it is working on a pair of AR-enhanced glasses, perhaps similar to Google Glass and the HoloLens, although little is known about this product for now.

We've also posted a series of special reports on the matter. The first was posted in January 2016 covering VR and AR and talked about the team that Apple was building. A team made up of engineers from HoloLens, a top VR researcher from Virginia tech with experience in gaming, sports and 3D user interfaces. A second report was posted in September 2016 titled "Apple's Enthusiasm for Integrating Augmented Reality into Future Devices and Apps is Growing Louder," and third was posted in February 2017 wherein Apple's CEO noted that he regarded augmented reality as big an idea than the smartphone.   Today we're learning that Apple's AR team has since hired Mike Rockwell a key engineer form Dolby who advised Meta who created an AR headset as noted in the video below. He's now the leader on the AR team at Apple under Dan Riccio who's in charge of the iPhone/iPad engineering groups.     Apple's new AR team is now growing rapidly and bringing in yet more top talent such as Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm; Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers.   Sources tell Bloomberg that Apple has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks and has opened a Wellington office to lure several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films.   Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment.   One of the apps that Apple is apparently working on involves PrimeSense technology which would allow users to take a photo and then at a later time add different levels of 3D depth to it so as to change the focal points of the photo to emphasize different items or people within the photo. A great number of PrimeSense patents could be found in our archives here.   To better understand the future of VR using advanced 3D technologies for film and photography, check out the work being done over at Lytro here. You could also check out photos using Lytro technology. Here's one example. Look at the photo and then click on the second penguin and you'll see the focus of the photo change instantly. In another example, you can see the focus is on a pole with posters on it and with one click of your mouse on the bridge, the focus instantly changes. There are a great number of example you can test out for yourself on that site. It's a very cool capability for photography and its one that Apple is working on. Lastly, you could learn a little more about this story in the latest Bloomberg report here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple to bring augmented reality features to the next iPhone Apple to bring augmented reality features to the next iPhone Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Apple, Featured Tech News, Tech News It looks like Apple may be ready to get serious about augmented reality later this year as reports are indicating that the company is preparing a few AR-related features for its next iPhone. According to sources, Apple currently has several hundred engineers dedicated to augmented reality features, some of which are from the iPhone camera team. Tim Cook has been gushing about Augmented Reality technology for quite a while now and this current rumour ties into information we received a few weeks ago, claiming that Apple has 1000 engineers working on Augmented Reality projects over in Israel. This weeks particular report comes from Mark Gurney at Bloomberg, who has a proven track record with Apple leaks. According to his sources, “hundreds of engineers are now devoted” to bringing augmented reality to the next iPhone. One of the features said to be in development is the ability to change the depth of a photograph or depth of specific objects within an image. Another AR-related feature being worked on by the iPhone camera team is the ability to single out specific objects in an image, like a person’s head, and manipulate it by tilting it for example. These are simple applications of augmented reality and likely far from what Tim Cook hopes to get to in the future. This just seems to be Apple dipping its toes in before getting involved with immersive head mounted displays. KitGuru Says: While we knew that Apple was experimenting with augmented reality behind the scenes, I don’t think many people expected the company to dive in on a consumer product so quickly. Still, it makes sense to start testing things out with the iPhone camera, which is always a big focus for the company each year.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple Augmented Reality news Previous Star Citizen will drop DX12 for Vulkan to avoid forcing users to upgrade to Windows 10 Next Mass Effect Andromeda drivers now available from Nvidia and AMD Check Also CeBIT 2017: Deepcool shows new liquid cooling cases and RGB fans CeBIT 2017 has kicked off this week and we have Leo Waldock there reporting straight … Polls Which CPU air cooler next?

Those include special glasses that would connect over Bluetooth to an iPhone and send content like films, maps and more to the person wearing them – though that technology is some way off, those same features will come to the iPhone soon. Apple has already released a range of different wearable products in recent years, like the Watch and its AirPods, which put Siri into people's ears as well as working as wireless earphones. Read more New iPad and iPhone models to be released in coming weeks Augmented reality is less famous than the similar virtual reality, and in AR people are less completely immersed and just have technology adding to their vision rather than taking it up entirely. Tim Cook has said that people won't care for virtual reality much, and that instead the company is focused on working on augmented reality. The dream way of doing that is building glasses, according to the Bloomberg report. Those glasses will be tethered to the iPhone, like the Watch, allowing the handset to do the heavy lifting, downloading and provide much of the battery while information is displayed on the glasses. But it will require new software, too, including special apps and an operating system to run on the glasses, as well as a new chip to put inside them. Similar technologies were developed for the Apple Watch, which runs its own apps and using its operating system. Building glasses is a risky strategy. Google famously released its Glass in 2013 – but that became known mostly through mockery, didn't take off and was discontinued by the company in 2015. Apple's response appears to be hiring a huge range of people with expertise across a variety of different industries to make its own glasses. It has hired people who worked on Google and Microsoft's own augmented reailty headsets, according to the report, as well as buying up companies that make similar products. It has also moved people from the team that developed the Apple Watch and other products into its AR team. Apple has also filled out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers, it said. Some of those have come from the biggest film companies in the world, like those from Weta Digital, the special effects firm that worked on King Kong and Avatar. But before the glasses arrive, similar features are set to the come to the iPhone. Those features might include the ability to take a picture and then focus on different elements of it at a later date, for instance, or allow virtual objects to be placed onto a real picture like on Snapchat.

The U.S. enterprise announced Sunday an additional 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) investment to build two R&D centers in China's Shanghai and Suzhou. The firm has previously promised to establish two R&D centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. All four R&D centers are scheduled to be completed this year. The move struck a stark contrast to Apple's tepid response to the Korean market. The company has yet to open an Apple Store for consumer service, not to mention an R&D facility here, which led to great inconveniences for Apple product users. "For Apple, it is natural to boost investment in one of the world's largest smartphone markets where iPhones have been increasingly losing steam in recent years," an industry source said. "But Korean consumers would not be happy with such news because there is no Apple Store in Korea." Apple has 40 Apple Stores in China. Despite the iPhone's high popularity here since its debut in 2009, Apple has not yet established one in Korea. The company finally decided to set up one here in Sinsa-dong, southern Seoul, but it remains to be seen when it will open. Without an Apple Store in Korea, the company has provided after-sale services only indirectly through third-party agencies here, inconveniencing consumers. Apple's decision to establish four R&D bases in China came as the company's performance in the country started to dwindle in recent years amid rapid growth of local brands. China's smartphone market grew 9 percent year-on-year last year. But Apple's share in the market has continued to decrease. According to data by global market researcher IDC, Apple has been overtaken by Oppo, Huawei and Vivo in the Chinese smartphone market, with its sales in the fourth quarter last year dropping 12 percent from the previous year. Its market share was 9.6 percent, down 4 percentage points from 13.6 percent in 2015. Oppo, on the other hand, jumped to the top from the fourth spot in 2015, by doubling its market share with 16.8 percent last year. Vivo has also boosted its market share to 14.8 percent, up from 8.2 percent in 2015. Apple is also seeking to boost its localization drive in China by building R&D centers and hiring Chinese workers to regain its share in the local market. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Beijing to speak at the China Development Forum on Saturday. He urged the Chinese government to open more to foreign companies. "I think it is important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will," Cook said. "The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, are not good for their people." yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter [LIVE] Sewol emerges from water after 1073 days Seoul ranks No. 3 among cities with worst air pollution [LIVE] Sewol seen above water after 1073 days Mobile carriers fined for wooing expats with illegal benefits Park could face up to 45 years in prison Park under interrogation over corruption scandal N.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple Inc.'s chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR's game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all "have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you." Investors impatient for Apple's next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company's plans say Apple (IW 500/2) has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses—an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. Popular Now 2016 IW Best Plants Winner: Johnson Controls’ Magic Ingredient is Leadership Overtime Threshold Ripe for Review, Says Trump Labor Pick Standard Work: A Standard, or More Like a Guideline? As previously reported by Bloomberg, Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content—movies, maps and more—to the wearer. While the glasses are a ways off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It's an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. "It's something they need to do to continue to grow," he says, "and defend against the shift in how people use hardware." AR: The Lesser Known Cousin Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it's less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be "enclosed in something." Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn't a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they'll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key too. If Apple's AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. Multidisciplinary Team When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multidisciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who's in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. "He's a really sharp guy," says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. "He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going." Last spring, in a sign that it's serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell's team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say: Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Tactical Acquisitions Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple's first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. "To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments," Munster says. "Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off." By Mark Gurman, with Alex Webb and Mark Bergen Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iPhone to be available in Indonesia again after March 31st following Apple’s investments in localized R&D Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 20th, 2017, 05:08 Category: iPhone, News, retail You’ll be able to buy an iPhone in Indonesia come the end of the month. Apple is reportedly on track to resume sales of the handset within the country, following a roughly two-year period during which sourcing requirements kept the device off the local market. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as the 6s series will go on sale through six retailers on March 31. In some cases, people should already be able to sign up for pre-orders. iPhone sales were last permitted in Indonesia with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets. Subsequent sourcing regulations —similar to ones in India —then forced the product out, since Apple couldn’t ensure that 30 percent of components were local. Such rules are intended to boost domestic industry. Sales are scheduled to resume due to Apple’s investment in three R&D facilities in the Indonesia capital of Jakarta. Previously, Apple’s R&D plans were uncertain. Apple has begun making a number of global investment as a means of satisfying political ends. Recently, Apple’s efforts to bring manufacturing to India, are believed to be part of a path to opening retail stores in that country. Earlier on Friday, the company announced plans to build two more Chinese research centers — just a day before CEO Tim Cook is set to speak with government officials at an economic forum. Indonesia is an essential market, with over 255 million people and enough middle- and upper-class shoppers to support Apple’s product base. So, good news if you’re over there and need to pick up an iPhone in a pinch. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple quietly extends AppleCare+ policies from 60 days to one year for iPhone purchases Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 20th, 2017, 05:12 Category: Apple TV, AppleCare, Hardware, iPhone, News, retail Modern mobile smartphone with broken screen isolated on white background. If you have an AppleCare+ policy, you’re going to like this. Apple has quietly updated its AppleCare+ policy, extending the purchase window for iPhones from 60 days to one year. The change has been confirmed with a support rep, but is not yet showing up on Apple’s official product page for AppleCare+. If you go to Apple’s eligibility tool and input your serial number from the iPhone’s settings panel, you should be able to see a new purchase option so long as you purchased the device within the last year. The change extends to Macs and Apple TV units, but Apple Watch and iPads are still restricted to 60 days following the purchase. Apple lowered the price of iPhone screen repairs from $99 to $29 last September, which helps as well. In the event that your iPhone screen has been cracked, Apple requires a physical inspection to buy the service in-store and a remote diagnostic test if you do so online. If you’ve purchased an AppleCare+ policy with your iPhone and have any feedback to offer about it, please let us know in the comments.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Surface FLASH SALE: Bitdefender 2017      50% OFF! Microsoft Goes After Apple Users with Mac to Surface Data Transfer Tool GO Redmond silently releases Mac to Surface Assistant Mar 20, 2017 12:42 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has silently released a new tool called Mac to Surface Assistant, which is supposed to do exactly what its name suggests: to assist users as they make the switch from Apple’s Mac to Redmond’s own Surface. Microsoft’s Surface lineup itself has often been positioned as a direct competitor to Apple’s MacBooks even though devices like the Surface Pro and the Surface Book are capable of doing a bit more thanks to detachable keyboards and touchscreens, and now the software giant itself is going after customers of rival products. The Mac to Surface Assistant is a solution that’s supposed to make the transition from Mac to Surface as smooth as possible, as it lets users configure exactly what data they wish to transfer when giving up on their Apple laptop for a Microsoft 2-in-1 device. The application was developed as a wizard, so it’s only just a matter of steps until you complete the process, though there’s something that you wouldn’t normally expect from a tool developed by the world’s number one software company. What the Mac to Surface Assistant does is create a ZIP archive with the selected user files, so instead of thousands of items, you only have to transfer a single pack from one device to another. Basic data migration tool This isn’t exactly the most convenient data transfer tool and, at first glance, relying on cloud would be a much better choice given the fact that the transition would be performed automatically. Of course, creating a ZIP archive with your favorite files can also be done manually, but Microsoft hopes that most users would prefer having an application do the whole thing without the need for browsing folders on the local drives. Once the ZIP file is created, users can move it to an external drive, which can then be connected to the Surface and transferred to the local drives with the Surface application. Microsoft hopes that this “easy” data transfer method would convince more users to move from Macs to Surface, though we doubt this is going to happen given the rather basic approach of the app.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Microsoft#Surface#Apple#Mac subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Mac to Surface Assistant (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support The 7-Inch Windows 10/Ubuntu Pocket PC Shows Up on Video Microsoft Named One of the Most Ethical Companies in the World Windows XP Installed on an iPhone 7 Because Why Not - Video Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows 6 photos    Mac to Surface Assistant New Apps Syncovery: Backup data and synchronize PCs, servers and notebooks by creating customize profiles using this straightforward software utility Starus Excel Recovery: Seamlessly recover spreadsheets that you accidentally deleted or that are lost due to a problematic hard drive using this software solution PEBL Launcher: Launch psychology and neuroscience experiments created with the PEBL programming language with the aid of this intuitive application Lighten PDF Converter: A reliable and easy to use tool that enables you to easily convert batches of PDFs to Word documents, Excel workbooks or PowerPoint presentations PDF Annotator: A lightweight and easy-to-use program meant to help you make annotations on your Portable Document Format files using the mouse or a Tablet PC pen Starus Photo Recovery: A handy and easy to use wizard application that helps you recover lost or deleted image files from your hard drive or flash devices OESIS Endpoint Assessment Tool: Manage and actively monitor installed applications and uninstall security software, such as antivirus and anti-spyware tools by eliminating all leftovers to make room for a new tool Reader comments Microsoft Launches HoloLens Partner Program in Europe more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Apple Is Working on a Number of AR Features for the Next iPhone GO The new iPhone’s selling point will be AR features Mar 20, 2017 12:21 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  A new report by Bloomberg states that Apple is working on multiple new AR features for its upcoming iPhone. Apparently, Tim Cook is “very serious about AR” and intends to bring the technology to the masses. Apple has built a team to work on new hardware and software that would later result in AR features for the upcoming iPhone, anonymous internal sources stated for Bloomberg. The team is run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive and includes experts who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual headsets released by Facebook and Microsoft. The Cupertino company also bought several small firms that worked on AR hardware, 3D gaming, as well as virtual reality software. Apple is working on a number of AR products The team made up of several experts on augmented-reality won’t be working solely on features for the next iPhone, but also on a number of AR products. Apparently, Apple intends to develop a pair of digital spectacles that would wirelessly connect to an iPhone and stream videos or app content to the wearer. Hundreds of engineers are working on the technology; some of them are solely focusing on AR features for the new iPhone. Apple intends to bring iPhone users the option to take a picture and then change the depth of the entire image or the depth of specific objects. A separate feature would let users isolate a certain object inside images and tilt it 180 degrees. Another AR tool would allow for objects and virtual effects to be placed inside images. This report is in line with the analysis recently made by Ming-Chi Kuo, who predicted that the next iPhone would have an innovative camera augmented with an infrared projector and receiver. However, AR glasses would arrive further down the line, since it would mean that Apple must develop an entirely new product and integrate features that would require extensive testing. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#AR features#AR glasses subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Siri with Augmented Reality Features Future iPhones to Support 4K Graphics and Advanced AR/VR with PowerVR Graphics Apple Files Patent for Scroll-like iPhone with Retractable Display Apple’s Next iPhone Could Come with AR Features - Report Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    Next iPhone concept with integrated AR features new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Launches Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Apple filed documents to Federal Communications Commission for a new device By Margi Murphy 20th March 2017, 11:57 am Updated: 20th March 2017, 12:02 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments A NEW Apple device has been revealed, thanks to official documents published by a government body. The technology company got tongues wagging when it submitted an application for a mysterious gadget to the US Federal Communications Commission last year. Federal communications commision 5 Apple filed documents for this mystery device late last year, and they have finally been revealed We’re sorry to disappoint, but turns out it’s not a blueprint for the iPhone 8. The files – including detailed pictures and a user manual – are pretty brief on details, leaving those out of the loop scratching their heads. It appears that the hotly anticipated tech is a smart access system. The documents reveal a smart lock which can be opened using a reader, highlighted below. Federal communications commision 5 Federal communications commision 5 The smart key system is likely to be used in the Park campus opening in April and in Apple’s stores worldwide Federal communications commision 5 According to the files, the device can grant access using a reader which flashes green for entry 5 The brand new Apple HQ is almost finished, and could feature the new devices According to the user manual, the device will flash green and play a sound when access is granted, presumably using an Apple Watch or iPhone as the key. The files detail near-field communication technology, the same kind that allows iPhone and Android owners to pay at the till using a smartphone. Apple have yet to release their own brand of smart home devices, but this new technology could be used in Apple’s brand new campus, an impressive architectural feat in California, US. It’s not clear why the tech company would want to create its own smart locks – when there are plenty on the market. But the super-secretive company may want to make it impossible for hackers to tamper with their systems.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Apple reportedly working on bringing AR features to the iPhone using ex-Microsoft HoloLens talent 1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Mar 20, 2017 at 12:48 GMT3 days ago We have known for a while that Apple is working on AR (Augmented Reality) headsets, with the company’s CEO claiming that AR is going to be “huge.” And now, it seems like we might see an augmented reality product from the hardware giant sometime soon. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on integrating some AR features into the iPhone’s camera. Apple actually built a team for its AR ambitions, and “hundreds of engineers” are reportedly working on bringing the tech to life. What’s more interesting is that the team reportedly includes multiple engineers who worked on the Microsoft HoloLens. Engineers who worked on Facebook’s Oculus Rift are also part of the team, according to Bloomberg: “Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.” Apple has also acquired multiple firms who specialize in AR technologies in the past to work on Apple’s upcoming AR products. It’s clear Apple’s AR team is full of bright minds from the industry, and Microsoft’s HoloLens engineers might also help the company’s AR ambitions quite a lot since Microsoft already has an AR headset available for purchase to the public. How Apple will execute its AR plans remains to be seen as it isn’t clear how the company is working on integrating AR features into the iPhone yet. Bloomberg claims that the iPhone’s camera team are working on incorporating the “AR-related” features to the iPhone. The company is apparently working on a feature that would let users place virtual effects and objects in the real world — similar to how Pokemon Go and other apps like Snapchat work. Another feature the iPhone camera team is working on is the ability to change the depth of photographs taken with the iPhone, as well as the depth of specific objects in a picture. The report explains: “One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees.” At the moment, it isn’t clear whether we will get to see some of these AR features on the next iPhone, which is set to arrive sometime in September. Apple’s AR headsets should be a lot more interesting, but we likely won’t get to see them anytime soon. Microsoft, on the other hand, reportedly skipped HoloLens v2 and the software giant is now working on a v3 of its popular AR headset — but that won’t arrive until 2019.

Is this Apple's mystery new 'wireless device'? by Catherine Hood 20 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Image credit: FCC Months of speculation have finally been put to an end, following Apple’s 2016 filing to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for certification of a mysterious ‘wireless device’. The only clues the original FCC application revealed about the device, identified as model number 'A1844', were that it has Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC connectivity. Apple requested permanent confidentiality on all other details. This led to speculation among Apple fans that it could be fifth-generation Apple TV, or possibly a new AirPort router. Given Apple’s efforts to popularise its smart-home gateway app Apple HomeKit, it could well have been a smart door lock too. Finally, it seems, we have an answer – and it turns out to be none of the above. A manual published by the FCC on Sunday for the mystery device appears to be for a door access system, which BusinessInsider speculates is most likely destined for Apple’s new Apple Park campus opening in April, rather than for consumer use. Image credit: FCC Photos in the manual show a card reader attached to a door assembly, with accompanying instructions that say users have to “present the company provided credential to the reader.” The manual gives a brief outline of how the door system operates, which involves a standard green light and digital sound to indicate approved access, or a red light and a further sound for denied access. Image credit: FCC Disappointingly for all the hopefuls with grand ideas of a shiny new Apple product set to hit the shelves, the evidence does point towards a door access system for badge-carrying Apple Park employees being the most likely destiny for the device. The FFC manual also tempers the excited buzz surrounding two separate filings for certification that Apple has submitted this year. It’s likely that the two devices, with the suspiciously similar model numbers of ‘A1846’ and ‘A1845’, are simply components or iterations of the door access system.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents iPhones iPads iPad mini Apple Watch 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September Apple predictions for 2017: iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that. For a more in-depth look at the latest rumours on the Apple Watch be sure to check out our Apple Watch 3 Rumours article.

We think September Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly. Read more about the Apple TV: Apple TV (2015) review | Best Apple TV apps | Tips for using the new Apple TV Siri Remote | New Apple TV release date rumours When? We think WWDC Apple predictions for 2017: Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn't have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world's largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and  shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016 -- when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn't adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws," the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. "They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas." That's not to say Duan doesn't appreciate the iPhone maker's global clout. In fact, the billionaire's obsession with his U.S. rival is legion: he's long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. "I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we've chatted a little," Duan said. "I like him a lot." Apple couldn't confirm Duan's meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple's products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs "a really big pocket" because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from," Duan said. "We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves." Oppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the "Subor" gaming console with dual-cartridge slots -- a direct shot at Nintendo Co.'s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished -- a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally "rising higher step-by-step." BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. "The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan," said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. "Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation." Duan's latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. "We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully -- in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money," he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei. "Making mobile phones was not my call," said Duan. "But I reckoned we could do well in this market." At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.'s 76.6 million units, Apple's 44.9 million and Xiaomi's 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively -- Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan's smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo's shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. "Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there's no replacement. But we don't know," Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn't have a specific goal for market share. "The competition is more fierce in China -- not only in this industry, but in many industries," Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. "I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products." Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won't say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid "disturbing them." His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using "imbalanced information" to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. "Those who said this were insane," Duan said without naming names. "When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots." His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan's blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding's internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first U.S.-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend's aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn't shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm's length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK's Vivo and Duan's own Oppo have done well, there's no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona's Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing's for sure, Duan doesn't see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. "I've made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback," he said. "If there's a problem they can't fix, then neither can I."

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji If latest reports are to be believed, Samsung is developing display panels that are pressure sensitive for both Galaxy Note 8 and S8. It will be reportedly similar to Apple’s Force Touch that featured in iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are said to pack some of the best specs and features in the smartphone market today. The smartphones will have desktop connectivity, virtual assistant and a button-free front among a plethora of features. Earlier reports had mentioned that the handsets will have a virtual Home button. However, due to manufacturing issues on Synaptics’ part, the fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back. Samsung Display is currently working on OLED Force Touch Panels. This technology will first be adopted by the S8 handsets and then by Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which will take matters to a completely new level. Thus, the Home button in the two devices will be pressure-sensitive. The in-house panels will be used for the devices. The company is separating home button navigation and fingerprint recognition, which many experts believe as a step back, writes Wccftech. Insider sources have claimed that Samsung has showcased its latest technology during MWC 2017 to a select few. According to the Investor, the OLED Force Touch Panels will be highly sensitive and boast a wider range of pressure-sensing levels than previous technologies used in Huawei P9. Once the technology is incorporated in Galaxy S8, Samsung will better the technology further so that it can be incorporated in the Note 8. It will be Samsung’s first mobile device that will feature a complete pressure-sensitive touch screen. Moreover, it will be the first big major Galaxy Note 8 upgrade in two years. The upcoming Note device is expected to be immensely successful as the Galaxy devices will fill the void created by the Note 7 disaster, as they are releasing first. The S8 and S8 Plus devices are rumoured to be revealed in seven different colour options. Moreover, the Note device is expected to be the most powerful device in the market when it hits stores in the latter half of this year. There are numerous rumours about the release date of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Some feel it will be released along with the Galaxy S8 devices this month. Traditionally the Note flagships are unveiled during the IFA trade show every year in early September. But for the past two years, the company has been unveiling its Note devices in August to get ahead of Apple.

The Apple boss probably does now.

Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016 -- when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his U.S. rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Full screen 1/3 SLIDES © Bloomberg News BC-DUAN-YONGPING-APPLE-1 2/3 SLIDES © Bloomberg News BC-DUAN-YONGPING-APPLE-1 3/3 SLIDES © Bloomberg News BC-DUAN-YONGPING-APPLE-1 3/3 SLIDES Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots -- a direct shot at Nintendo Co.’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple found guilty of price-fixing in Russia, strong-arming its retail partners Apple found guilty of price-fixing in Russia, strong-arming its retail partners By Joel Hruska on March 17, 2017 at 9:15 am Comment Apple has run into trouble with US regulators on several occasions to date, including its attempt to illegally collude with book publishers to manipulate eBook prices. Up until now, the company has never been accused of breaking the law on iPhone prices. Earlier this week, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled Apple’s Russian subsidiary had illegally ordered its retail partners to sell the iPhone 5s, 5c, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, and 6s Plus only at its own specified prices. Furthermore, Apple monitored all 16 of its partners and would get in touch with them immediately if it discovered they were setting prices below the accepted level. The terms of the agreements Apple struck with these companies allowed them to terminate their relationship with its 16 Russian partners at any time, for any reason. Apple, which previously protested the charges and claimed Russian companies were free to set their own prices has since changed its tune. “We worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind us,” an Apple spokesperson told FT. “We work hard to make the best products and services in the world for our customers and are deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business.” Apple’s specific scheme, according to the Russian report, was to require its resellers to hold to its own specified prices for a period of three months. As schemes go, it’s a smart one. The chart below illustrates why, but remember, this is a fiscal year chart, not a calendar year chart. Apple’s Q1 2017 began on September 25, 2016, for example. This chart shows how Apple’s quarters break down compared with the calendar year. Each Q1 spike equals a new iPhone launch. The 5S in Q1 2014, the iPhone 6 in Q1 2015, the 6s in 2016, and so on. In both FY 2014 and 2015, the first quarter accounted for 30% and 32% of all iPhone sales that year. In other words, if Apple wanted to strong-arm companies into obeying its own pricing model, it would do so at launch. The company could face a fine of up to 15% of its sales in Russia. The last interesting bit of the puzzle is Apple’s statement contains no specific denial of the charges brought against it. It has become common practice in the US to allow corporations to escape taking responsibility for their actions by not requiring them to admit wrongdoing as a condition of settlement, and can instead chalk things up to “mistakes,” “accidents,” or “robust competition” depending on the circumstances. It’s nice to see that particular custom hasn’t embedded itself everywhere just yet.

Anker braided Lightning cables Bloomberg spotted a mystery Apple wireless device code-named A1844 going through testing back in September of last year. We noted one clue that it likely wasn’t a consumer-facing device – the color-coded wiring – and photos now posted by the FCC confirm this. Spotted by Business Insider, device A1844 is revealed to be nothing more interesting than an electronic badge reader for a door. 1. Present the company provided credential to the reader. 2. The reader will indicate granted access by briefly changing color to green and playing a sound. Declined access is indicated by red color and a second sound.  Since Apple seems content to leave it to third-party companies to make HomeKit-compatible devices like smart locks, this is almost certainly designed purely for Apple’s own use. One of the details revealed during a rare look inside the Apple Park campus was iPhone-like elevator buttons. Given the famed attention to detail of both Steve Jobs, the man behind the spaceship campus project, and Jony Ive, whose design remit was extended beyond products to Apple Stores and more, it seems likely this is a custom fitting designed for the new building. Apple last month officially named the campus and theater, and revealed that the first staff would move in next month, with construction work continuing through to September.

It has been around since 2010 and Apple encourages you to "talk to Siri as you would to a friend" so you can get things done — like sending messages, making calls and finding restaurants. Siri's got a sense of humour too. If you ask her to borrow some money, she'll sagely reply with, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." Read More Siri will pretend to be the computer from Lego Batman But sometimes it can lead to something more serious. The Mirror reports that iPhone users have been taking to Twitter recently telling others to say the number 108 to Siri, adding things like, "You'll thank me later." But saying 108 will put you through to the emergency services in the UK because this number is the equivalent of 999 in India, writes The Sun . So what Siri does is recognise it as an emergency call, and puts you through to the services in your area. (Photo: Western Mail) Another would-be prankster went one further and urged people to not only say "108", but to then close their eyes for five seconds. This would of course mean you don't cotton on to the fact you've called the UK's emergency services until it's too late. Other numbers includes in similar pranks are: 112,110, 000 and the US number 911. Read More Sending iPhone messages after the iOS 10 update is way more fun than before What makes this prank particularly inadvisable are the thinly stretched resources of our emergency services. There could also be serious repercussions for anyone caught wasting the emergency services' time.

To be among the first to get it, sign up here.  Reclusive Chinese billionaire Duan Yongping has opened up about how he managed to topple Apple in China with a pair of cheap smartphones and some very savvy marketing. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, his Oppo and Vivo phones have leapfrogged Apple in the rankings, pushing the U.S. smartphone giant out of China's top three. Duan says Apple's Tim Cook had no idea who he was when they met a few years ago. He likely knows now.—Brent O'Brien and Alex Millson Singapore and Australia are two of the world's healthiest nations, but when it comes to living a long life Italy is the place to be, according to the Bloomberg Global Health Index. A baby born in Italy can expect to become an octogenarian, while 2,800 miles south in Sierra Leone the average newborn will die by age 52. Uber's President has had enough. Jeff Jones is quitting after less than a year with the ride-hailing app due to a long string of controversies surrounding the company. Scandals range from allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic work culture to the combative behavior of CEO Travis Kalanick, who was recently caught on camera berating an Uber driver. Default fears are resurfacing in Singapore ahead of a wall of maturing corporate debt. Pressure to pay down obligations has been unrelenting. Companies excluding banks in Singapore must repay S$38 billion ($27 billion) of local bonds through the end of 2020. Six firms have defaulted on S$1.2 billion worth of notes since November 2015. A Chinese lampshade-maker is hanging by a thread. Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on Chinese goods could kill off thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in China that rely on exports to the U.S. At Eric Li's glass factory, three of his four furnaces sit dormant and his staff of 1,000 lampshade and vase makers has been slashed to 150 from more than 1,000 a decade ago.

Sign Up Why resource-rich Australia can't keep its lights on. The country has some of the world's largest reserves of fossil fuels but it's running short on gas, which has raised the prospect of widespread power outages in the near future. The crisis recently prompted Tesla CEO Elon Musk to claim he could fix the problem within 100 days. Now summer peak demand has eased and it looks like the lights will stay on - for another two years at least. How do you spot the truly rich in Switzerland? Forget shiny timepieces and instead take a look at their license plates. Switzerland doesn’t allow vanity plates, so special or lucky numbers sell for big money. While Swiss auctions of license plate numbers can’t quite compete with those in the United Arab Emirates — where the wealthy pay millions of dollars — they are not far behind.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple Pledges Two More R&D Centers Investing Over Half a Billion Dollars in China By Rafia Shaikh Mar 17, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit While you may be getting excited about Apple potentially working an all-American iPhone, the Cupertino tech giant is furthering its investment in China. The company has set up two new research and development centers in Shanghai and Suzhou. Apple announced its plans on Friday in a post on its Chinese website. The new locations are added to those previously announced for Beijing and Shenzhen with Apple pledging to invest more than half a billion dollars (over 3.5 billion yuan). All four centers are expected to open later in 2017, Apple said. Related Apple Acquires ‘Workflow’ – A Powerful Automation App For iOS And Makes It Free While the iPhone maker focuses on its new product development programs in Cupertino, the company hopes to attract graduates from local universities in China. The company noted that it’s important to develop technical expertise in the Apple supply chain, with a focus on university graduates. Apple’s research and development center in China aims to develop technical experts in the Apple supply chain and [among] graduates from universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University and Shanghai Jiaotong University. As part of Apple’s continued growth and investment in China, the company has partnered with schools to include internship programs to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs. Some suggest that the company is investing more in China to be in the good books of the local government. The news comes as CEO Tim Cook plans to attend the China Development Forum – an annual conference that gathers Chinese officials and global executives – over the weekend. Advertisement Apple mentioned that while it directly employs only 12,000 people in China, it has “created” over 4.8 million jobs in the country, including 1.8 million iOS app developers. Last year, Chinese authorities forced the Cupertino tech giant to shut down its online music and book services in the country. With the sales falling 17% in its latest fiscal year in the country, and iPhone facing some strong competition from companies like Oppo and Huawei, Apple could be looking to curry favor with not only the government for easier access and fewer restrictions but also to attract local talent to compete against these companies.

With Apple and its A10 processor employing TSMC's InFO-PoP technology, the fan-out market has exploded. Apple's involvement will undoubtedly generate increased interest in the fanout platform, and market revenue is forecast to reach around US$2.5B in 2021, with 80% growth between 2015 - 2017. Moreover, following the high-volume adoption of InFO and the further development of fan-out wafer level packaging technologies, a wave of new players may enter the market. The supply chain is also expected to evolve, with a considerable amount of investment in Fan-Out packaging capabilities. In such a fast-growing Fan-Out market, it is essential to deeply understand the global patent landscape in order to anticipate changes, harvest business opportunities, mitigate risks, and make strategic decisions in order to strengthen one's market position and maximize return on one's IP portfolio. The report thoroughly investigates the Fan-Out packaging patent landscape (chip-first, chip-last, face-down, face-up, single-die, multi-chip module, package-on-package, system-inpackage, etc.), and this report contains detailed patent analyses including countries of filing, patents' legal status, and patented technologies, as well as patent owners, their IP position, and IP strategies. More than 3,100 patents relating to over 1,200 inventions on Fan-Out packaging have been published worldwide through September 2016, coming from 100+ patent applicants. A first wave of patent applications occurred from 1999-2006, induced by Infineon. Patent applications have increased since then, with Freescale (NXP), STATS ChipPAC (JCET), SPIL, Amkor, and TSMC entering the Fan-Out IP arena. Today the number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. All of major players involved has filed patents on Fan-Out packaging, except for Nanium, which does not file any patents at all but instead has adopted a different IP strategy that we discuss in this report. Another special case is the presence of patent licensing companies like Polaris Innovations (WiLAN), which in 2015 acquired key patents from Infineon/Qimonda. The visibility of such companies in the patent landscape is a tangible sign of the market explodes. In the next few years Polaris Innovations could assert its patents to make money, and in this report we present its most critical patents. We have also noted Samsung's conspicuous IP presence in the FOWLP patent landscape, despite the company's unclear market position. R&D labs are also present (i.e. Fraunhofer, A - STAR, CEA), but to a lesser extent. Most new entrants in the FOWLP patent landscape are Chinese players (HuaTian Technology, NCAP, SMIC), and more recently we have observed Apple's appearance. Apple, which this year chose TSMC's InFO-PoP technology for its A10 APE, has recently filed some patents on Fan-Out wafer level packaging (chip-last, chip-first, PoP, and SiP), reflecting a genuine interest in the FOWLP platform. Key Features Of The Report: - IP trends, including time evolutions and countries of patent filings - Patents' current legal status - Ranking of main patent applicants - IP collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements - Key players' IP position, and relative strength of their patent portfolios - Patent segmentation by technology solution (chip-first, chip-last, facedown, face-up), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package), and technical challenge (warpage, die shift) - Matrix showing patent applicants and their patented technologies - Technical solutions found in patents for warpage and die-shift issues. - FOWLP IP profiles for 18 key companies, including countries of filing, patents' legal status, patented technologies, prior art strength index, IP blocking potential, partnerships, and IP strategy - Excel database with all patents (3,100+) analyzed in this report, including technology segmentation.

With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. In March, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. It went through an extensive beta but the update immediately caused problems for iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3. iOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches. After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update. Shortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. It will be the last update the iPhone 4s receives from Apple. The iPhone 4s will never get iOS 10. If you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, the iOS downgrade process, and more. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews   1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others. As we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.  Some users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying that the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9. As of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade. Dig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.    1 / 7 23 Responses 04/20/2016 Enajrowe Reply Hurrah..!!!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

Still an amazing phone and still updating and supported. Get a new phone or accept things on a 5 year old phone takes time. 09/05/2016 Robert Jackson Reply I had my iPhone 4s since the beginning. And yes with 9.3.5 she is still kicking strong and doing well. I cannot say much for others, but if they have any problems with any updates. Just re-set the whole thing (make sure you on iCloud ) like a brand new phone, or to the last day like two days ago. And when all is boosted. You’ll have more storage for some reason , and everything you had since. And I have a 16 gigger (n####r) joke…. Smile….it won’t broke yo face! Jamaican Man. Make sure you have an iPad or MacBook. They all feed off one another like clockwork. Adios Gringgos 09/19/2016 premn Reply Anyone know if there is a further update coming. My 4S has become almost useless. And I’m pretty sure it was after the 9.3.5 update. I’m hoping they might fix it? Thanks. 09/30/2016 prem Reply Update: After one month of sound and other issues, my 4s suddenly started working fine with 9.3.5. Amost as if it needed a month to get used to the update. Thought I should share this here. 09/30/2016 Chris Reply 4s stopped working when I tried to update to 9.3.5. Never was able to upgrade, only shows the “plug into iTunes” and is basically bricked until I figure out how to fix it. 10/13/2016 Abramski Reply Can u put the device in DFU mode? You do it this way, make sure the phone is off AND connected to your mac or pc and leave iTunes open, press and hold down the power button and count 3 seconds, after you count those 3 seconds, you push down the home button but don’t release the power button, hold the power button and home button pressed simultaneously for about 10 seconds, in mean time the screen should turn black as you reach 6 or 7, after 10 second, release the power button but keep holding down the home button until you see a prompt in iTunes that will tell you to restore you’re iPhone. Good luck! 11/01/2016 Mike Morley Reply Since updating to ios 9.3.5 my iPhone 4s shuts down at 35% battery level. I have heard that Apple do not plan to release any further updates to iphone 4s so I either put up with this or upgrade the phone. Of course apple would love me to upgrade the phone. I also upgraded my ipad2 to ios 9.3.5 and found it would then not let me past password sign in, it to a great deal of time to sort this out including complete reset and restore of the machine. I don’t have time to fix apples mistakes so I’m switching to android, at least you are not badgered continuously to upgrade it’s operating system APPLE NEVER AGAIN ! 12/17/2016 Satheesh Reply When i update to 9.3.5 My 4s asking to connect itunes. I dont know why? Anyone can explain? 02/08/2017 NIROSH Reply what’s the Next date of 4s update 03/17/2017 Sue Reply 9.3.5 was the last update for 4S! 03/19/2017 user Reply battery problem and overheating..

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone. Just stick to the one you like best and live life. 05/25/2016 Blake Kersey Reply And what makes you think he gives a f$&# what you think?? 05/30/2016 hello Reply Unless you’re a billionaire you cannot stick to the pone that you wanto 07/30/2016 Avalanche Tsunami Reply Dude, he also has a “Android vs iPhone: 15 Reasons Android is Better” article too. So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience. P.s: «Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls» …. LOL… I’m trying to contain myself here… :D 04/21/2016 Vickie Reply I love you 🙌🏼 (apparently I am a white girl who loves Apple and Starbucks… I’m more of a Costa girl myself) 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Its based on opinion, Apple and Android are like XBox and PS4, they have advantages over each other and problems of their own, nothing is gained over arguing about it because recently Android has caught up to Apple so now its just up to personal preference because they are pretty much at the same level right now. 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply why does everyone write a full on report about their opinion this is ridiculous 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply hhhh your gr8 especially last sentence 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply Last sentence especially Starbucks hhhhhhhh made me die of laugh 09/13/2016 bestdeals242 Reply Nice 03/21/2016 Matt Reply what search engine do you use Bing lol or internet explorer 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Who the F-Word uses Internet Explorer anymore 05/03/2016 Thomas Oglesby Reply Are you ok? Do you need help? The only reason you like them is because you a billable fanboy that refuses to try anything else, and just because it’s ridiculously expensive, you think it’s better.

Very sad….. 10/06/2016 Alon Reply Amazing, almost all whats written in the article is wrong. More apps with faster updates??? How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works. No one really has a hard time plugging them in, that was an invented problem. 06/25/2015 RuskieBear Reply 90% of these are false 09/30/2015 poopy Reply You’re just a piece of poop 09/14/2016 Trashpple Reply Chill out iRetard. 10/28/2015 jihou Reply your moms false 06/30/2015 phinfankid Reply I’m a long time android user, but I thought about switching to iPhone on my last upgrade. Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

This site shows the majority: https://ninki.co/android-vs-iphone 09/03/2015 Bent Reply Sorry, but that’s it? Honestly, these are more like 15 reasons why an iPhone user should switch to android as soon as possible. Most testify to the fact that Apple product users are chained together under the apple tree, sustaining themselves on apples only. On top of that they are forced to watch android user eat happily from all the trees in the garden, even apples trees, even inventing fruits of their own. 01/25/2016 Real mofo Reply Your clearly insane 09/03/2015 Lodosa Reply Ja wybrałbym androida: http://logoff.pl/ios/wybralbym-androida-a-nie-ponownie-iphone/ 09/03/2015 GoToHell Reply One of the worst article I ever read. And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me?????????

Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far.

I don’t want be associated with anyone that uses an Android. It would make me look bad. Thanks. 03/03/2016 Jack Reply The fact that u say “Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants”, just ticks me off. You are what I like to call a dumb ass like every kid I know. You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one.

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device.

So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones.

I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information. Thank you for sharing it. 05/23/2016 00 Reply i love apple never go to samsung they suck 05/23/2016 Andrapple Reply You’re All Phaat And Stoopid! 05/24/2016 nic Reply apple is just better in very way …. battery , faster processor , better sound quality , the most clear screen and best off is security . just being honest . Samsung along with android are pure rubbish ….!!!!!!

But when it comes to the games the android will never be smooth as Apple or faster the performance in apple will always be better. But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck. I laugh at people who buy these things for the show off appeal as I know they are getting ripped in a rather large way……… 06/08/2016 Mohamed Faizul Reply I used android for 7 years this is my first iphone 5s bought two years back From the day i bought this iphone till now regularly i m browsing in website that why iphone is better than android, why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android but while using android i m much okay with everything…. iPhone is simple best for call ,messaging ,camera with instant speed though its two year old device … But not more than that In android its like sea u can do lot lot more than iphone but not as quality standard reliability fast easy as iphone . 06/09/2016 Ryan Reply Has anyone thought that maybe iPhone is more simple than Android simply because the staff aren’t smart enough to produce anything more complicated than simple? It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones? The whole usb bit is quite a stretch too. You’re just another iSheep. 06/12/2016 11112222 Reply android is way better than android its an open source os which means you can customize everything literally and you can’t say that ios is better than android because snapchat looks “prettier ” what are you? 5years old girl. and apple users are like a bunch of sheeps. apple never lets you do anything without their” ok” and many other that makes an apple device less than an android one in conclusion android is better than apple 06/13/2016 useyourIQ Reply its very funny coz all of them are WRONG :D XD Please use a droid phone before you write an article about it….

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android? There are many many more possibilities and helpful apps that came with my galaxy s7 edge and i love it alot! So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point. Twitter, Facebook, all the google apps, as well as plenty of others have better looking designs on Android now than on iPhone thanks in large part to material design! 09/27/2016 Simon Reply What a crock of misinformed shite 09/28/2016 Eugene Reply ANDROID IS BETTER Really. Devices cheaper, but they have similar power with iPhones. And it’s open-source, you can customize it all over you want. I installed CyanogenMod ROM for my Xiaomi device, and it runs faster, and i can set any proceesor mode for any time. And I can watch anime on it and play Hearthstone all the same time!

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me. This “roll-back” possibility is just pure gold. 10/01/2016 don Reply Blackberry rules 10/03/2016 B BALL Reply F**k all of you stop writing huge ass stories and go back to 1st grade to learn your grammar and if you like android the os systems are freakin names of candy!! 10/07/2016 Scuba Turtle Reply I can do all of this with my Andriod plus a lot more that an Iphone just cannot do. 10/16/2016 Sally Fallis Reply This is for Charles Alden. If I could have 1/50th of your technical expertise I would be overjoyed. Meanwhile, I’ll just be glad I chose a Samsung. At least I got that right. 10/07/2016 Majid Reply None of these arguments accounts for any good reason to buy an iPhone except argument number 1. Android can do these equally or better. I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates.

Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance. To human eye it looks the same screen. It’s same as you put truck engine in a car for same volume of fuel. Do you really need that for your serious business tasks? Kids need that for games only… 12/27/2016 Bas Reply This brought my iq down by 10 points, iphone users aren’t bothered by that because they dont have any iq points to lose. This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits…. You don’t know what Apple is…. 12/30/2016 Joe Reply iPhones are more compatible with other devices if you have an iPad and Mac. But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again. It was slower and crashed more often untill I uninstalled it. With Android you don’t have to install anything to put music on your phone. 01/02/2017 Dusty72 Reply This post is really interesting, but why it is on 15th place in google’s search results.

Simply search for: pandatsor’s tools 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply I’d have to say if you think the last iPhone was 2 years ago then you know nothing about it. I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying. They think because its popular its the best choice..all robots who don’t think for themselves 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Since it’s more popular it’s better … 01/04/2017 farafit Reply i read almost every comments and keep deciding what should i buy: an android or iphone. i own android for 8 years now (from the era when sony ericsson still existed) and got so accustomed to it. i changed devices for 4 times during the 8 years because i want to get spec updates regularly. i love the fact that it is very simple in android: you can buy any android device you want and you will feel like you never changed your phone. contact, picture, apps, music will all still be the same as in the old phone. i heard that iphone is more stable compared to android so i am thinking of switching but i am genuinely scared the switch will cost me more: i will have to buy new headphones, mac (because many say that iphones does not connect well with pc), and i am very clumsy so i’m scared of scattering my iphone screen and will need to pay more to repair it. my husband owns a 4s and it still works until now, and it is true that android has shorter lifespan for a clumsy user like me because after some point android will keep hanging.. but still i think android is perfect for people like me who doesn’t really have the money to be a vivid apple follower.. i don’t want to be all attached to itunes.. i dont want to be obliged to buy a macbook to operate my iphone well.. i just don’t really like to spend almost all of my earnings to buy a single phone, when at the same time the same amount of money can be used to buy an android and a pc, and a vacuum cleaner.. maybe someday i will switch to apple products altogether when i have a mountain pile of money to spend.. but for now i am quite happy with a middle-end android phone and will stick to it.. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply As they say: expensive shoes last longer… 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Reply iPhones are better than androids, PERIOD. At least we don’t get viruses, androids are very slow and lag A LOT! iPhones are really fast, while androids have “better specs” than every iPhone in the world.

Sure there may be more that an android can do ( provided you download appropriate apps) but as a comment above made, after a month or 2 the android starts slowing down dramatically. With the iPhone this does not happen. BUT the major improvement that will keep me with the iPhone is security !!!!!! 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh Smith… But My view about your article is…No one can said this iPhone is better or Android is not Or Vice-Versa until you are not aware of their pros as well. There are alot to know about these two before making your mind to go for iPhone or Android, one of them. Both phones have their own features and plus points.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android.

Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies.

Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes.

Will the Apple model work for Maruti? March 20, 2017 14:36 IST With Nexa, the value-for-money mass-market car maker hopes to attract premium buyers. Sangeeta Tanwar reports. IMAGE: Since the launch of Nexa, Maruti has launched Ciaz, Baleno, S-Cross and Ignis, covering the spectrum from a sedan priced more than ₹8 lakh to a compact car priced at ₹4.59 lakh. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/Reuters. Who are Maruti Suzuki's biggest customers? Maruti Suzuki (Maruti), the automaker synonymous with value-for-money mass-market cars, has been making attempts to upscale its imagery by offering buyers "premium car buying experience" through its new-age Nexa showrooms. Since the launch of Nexa in July 2015, Maruti has launched Ciaz, Baleno, S-Cross and Ignis. The launches show that at one end of the spectrum the automaker has Ciaz, a sedan (priced upwards of ₹8 lakh), and on the other it has the compact car Ignis (priced at ₹4.59 lakh). Launched exclusively through Nexa, the two cars are poles apart in terms of positioning and pricing. What does this huge gap in buyer profile and pricing say about brand Maruti's attempt to go premium with launches emerging out of Nexa? Does it amount to diluting Nexa's core brand proposition of delivering a premium customer experience to buyers? The company brushes aside any hint of contradiction or toning down the brand proposition of Nexa. Vinay Pant, assistant vice-president, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, says, "With Nexa, we aspire to replicate technology brand Apple's business model which commands a premium on a wide range of products at different price points." For example, Apple has an iPad and an iPad Mini, and it also offers a MacBook Air alongside a MacBook. The idea is to cater to mass as well as niche buyers while ensuring that products with Apple's logo are seen as a premium offering by buyers. Similarly, Maruti wants to command a premium on vehicles which have a Nexa imprint. With an aim to maintain its "premium" imagery, Maruti is positioning and pricing each Nexa vehicle launch smartly. For example, Ignis is a compact car but the vehicle is priced at a premium vis-à-vis its competitors. Offering premium features, Ignis is not in competition with Renault's small car Kwid. Maruti vs workers: Lessons from Manesar For Maruti "premiumness" does not necessarily come from the price tag alone. For instance, Ignis is a differentiated product targeted at young first-time car buyers. In the compact segment with a 1.2-litre engine, Ignis offers a five-speed automated manual transmission and the "Smart Play" touch screen infotainment system that boasts Android Auto, Apple CarPlay features that appeal to millennials. The car targets a segment that understands technology and is willing to pay for it. At traditional showrooms, the key consideration for a buyer is a good car package (competitive pricing plus service guarantee) and not the technology. Ignis, as a first-time buy for millennials (who already have a car at home), would not have been appreciated as much had it been launched through traditional Maruti showrooms. Pant explains that the automaker's traditional showrooms, by virtue of their positioning, cater to first-time buyers. About 50 to 60 per cent of customers visiting these showrooms are first-time buyers. In case of Nexa, about 70 per cent of visitors are replacement buyers who have already experienced a car. Nexa visitors would already have an Accord or a Honda car, but now they are on a lookout for a smaller vehicle like Baleno. These are the buyers who have been changing their cars and while upgrading did not consider Maruti as a replacement brand. Nexa, therefore, is looking to change this. With Nexa, the automaker is looking to bring back 55 per cent of buyers who are not returning for their second or third car purchase. Sridhar V, partner, Grant Thornton India LLP, says for companies which have achieved market share the next logical step is a move to increase margins. And for passenger vehicle companies, to focus on distinguishing and attracting a set of customers through premium positioning and branding is not out of place. "When you price it appropriately, the strategy could lead to success. Young customers are aspirational and they look for passenger vehicles with advanced features, something a mature player in the market would not want to miss out on," adds Sridhar V. Why small-car leader Maruti started thinking big Pant believes Maruti faces a unique challenge. Of the top 10 brands in India, eight are from Maruti's stable. And yet, when one talks about premium products, the industry gets back to talking about volumes. According to the automaker, with differences in sales channels, models, reach and size it is unjust to compare Nexa sales with its traditional showroom sales. For example, sales of Swift and DZire combined are to the tune of 30,000 per month. These models are sold through 2,000 outlets across India. By comparison, Nexa is a young network with 200 stores in 121 cities. As of January, the network has sold over 185,000 vehicles. Nexa launches Ciaz and Baleno have done well for Maruti. Baleno is selling an average 10,000 units per month. Nexa, says Pant, "is not about volumes". At present, he adds, Nexa as an initiative is more of an image building exercise, and in due course numbers too would follow. "But Nexa sales cannot compete with a Swift or an Alto -- these cars are first-time buys, and sales numbers will be high. We will need those models because they are what Maruti has built its success on. We will not lose focus there and keep fortifying our position in the mass car market."

Apple announced on Friday to invest 3.5 billion yuan (US$507 million) to establish four research centers in China including one in Shanghai, which will be open "later this year". It was the first time for Apple to establish research facilities in China, its second biggest regional market. "Apple has to adapt strategies to make itself more localized in China when it faces aggressive Android phone rivals here," said Jia Mo, a Shanghai-based analyst of research firm Canalys. Through the new centers, Apple can better handle the competition with local competitors like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc, who called the competition "irritant". In the recent quarters, Apple's revenue in China declined 12 to 16 percent year-on-year, because of tough competition from cheaper local smartphones and macroeconomics weakness. The iPhones can meet the localized specific demand in China, such as enhanced selfie feature and super-powerful battery. It means that Apple is losing innovation advantages compared with other brands, said Canalys' Jia. By the end of 2016, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo took the top three positions in the domestic smartphone market. They have developped high-end models to challenge Samsung and Apple's market positions in the segment. Samsung has developed models specifically for Chinese consumers like enhanced camera for selfie, beauty optimization software and assistant tools for payment and online "Hongbao" (red packet money among family members and friends). Samsung named the models as C series representing designed for China.

"The manual for model 'A1844, which supports both NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy, includes wiring instructions, and in fact says that users have to present the company provided credential to the reader," appleinsider.com reported on Monday. The new 175-acre Apple Park near Cupertino will be open to employees from April, while the construction of buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the year, the US tech giant announced earlier this year. In honour of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' memory and his contribution to Apple, and his vision to make Apple Park a centre for creativity and collaboration, the theatre at the campus will be named the Steve Jobs Theatre. Apple Park will include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees and development facilities and the Steve Jobs Theatre. The Park has been designed in collaboration with "Foster + Partners" and it replaces five million-square-foot of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, and is powered 100 per cent by renewable energy. In the past few months, Apple has submitted two other wireless devices for FCC approval, identified as A1845 and A1846.
