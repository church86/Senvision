Many iPhone owners don’t buy AppleCare+ that covers damage or spend $8 to $10 a month on iPhone insurance plans that cover damage and loss or theft. Apple only sells an extended warranty to users who are within 30 days of the initial iPhone purchase and the iPhone must be working at the time of purchase. Here is how replace a broken iPhone cheap, spending less than half of what carriers will charge. If you are holding a broken iPhone in your hand and it is out of warranty or without any insurance or accidental protection plan you can still get a replacement for under $300, which is 50% less than what you would pay to buy an off contract iPhone at a carrier like AT&T, Verizon or Sprint. Apple offers an Out of Warranty Service that allows almost any iPhone owner to get a replacement for $269 or less. That’s a huge savings over the off contract iPhone price. You will need to bring in the broken iPhone, so this will not help users with a lost or stolen iPhone. Thankfully the iPhone out of warranty replacement does cover water damage, so if you drop the iPhone into water and don’t have AppleCare+ you can still get a replacement. The same goes for an iPhone with a broken screen or that won’t even turn on. If you can hold your broken iPhone in your hand you likely qualify for an out of warranty iPhone replacement. Out of Warranty iPhone Replacement Cost If you can go to an Apple Store it is going to be the fastest way to get an out of warranty iPhone replacement. Apple calls this an out of warranty service, but in most cases they will take your old iPhone and give you a new one in the same visit. The prices listed below are for an out of warranty iPhone service at an Apple Store. You cannot get these prices at a carrier or at a retailer like Best Buy.   iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c – $269 iPhone 4S – $199 iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G, Original iPhone – $149   If you call in and need to ship the phones back you will be charged $6.95 or shipping. If you need an out of warranty replacement iPhone faster you can use the Express Replacement Service and pay an additional $29 fee. The Out of Warranty iPhone replacement cost is affordable and even covers water damage and broken screens.   With this additional fee and upgraded service Apple sends a replacement iPhone to you first, and then you send the broken iPhone back. This is ideal if you need the iPhone faster, but if Apple refuses the service due to the iPhone being in multiple pieces or unauthorized modifications you will need to pay an additional fee. There is also a fee if you don’t send the iPhone in or if you send it in late. These are the best options for iPhone owners without a warranty like AppleCare+, SquareTrade or insurance like Protect Your Bubble or carrier programs. If you are in the hardware warranty for defects, but break the iPhone or drop it in water you qualify for this replacement service as well.

Apple Enters Self-driving Car Race Share This Tags Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. Apple Goes Mobile … In a New Way Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A Next Big Thing Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. Deep Pockets With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

Saturday, April 15, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Latest News Technology  Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars April 15, 2017, Saturday Apple has obtained a permit to test self-driving vehicles, putting the iPhone maker in competition with Google and others. Pictured here is an autonomous vehicle on a test run north of London. AFP File Photo SAN FRANCISCO: Apple has joined the list of companies with permits to test self-driving cars in California, according to an updated roster released on Friday by state officials. The iPhone maker has disclosed little about its ambitions when it comes to self-driving vehicles, with chief Tim Cook hinting at plans but the company declining to comment for news reports on long-idling rumors. Late last year, Apple revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. Apple issued the letter because it is “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP at the time. The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars. Most major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020. General Motors this week announced that its autonomous driving efforts, investing $14 million and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research center in San Francisco. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and Michigan, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. Similar research is being carried out by other automakers including Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, and by other groups including Uber and Google parent Alphabet. Continental this week opened a new research center in the heart of Silicon Valley, saying it was dedicated to “mobility innovations and technologies.” Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is working on autonomous driving at its California research center, this week announced the acquisition of xPerception, a US startup that provides visual perception software, along with services and devices for people who are visually impaired. – AFP What do you think of this story?

The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans. The project quickly became something of an open secret among technology-watchers, even if it was never truly clear what Apple was working on. The ambiguity surrounding the effort was reflected in the numerous names that circulated about the project, such as the "Apple Car," "the iCar" and "Project Titan." Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car, or to upgrade a car by injecting it with autonomous capabilities. Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumours. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1,100 additional jobs and a $14 million investment, and in February Ford said that it's investing $1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 percent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. "It's encouraging to hear Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game," said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars will push the industry to "provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we're already experiencing." Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California's autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle's autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones - a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles. © 2017 The Washington Post For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Apple enters self-driving car race Latest News World News The iPhone of cars? Apple enters self-driving car race By Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer April 15, 2017 0 98 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. The Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. ” Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan's Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba's memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai's bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March. On Tuesday, Toshiba reported an unaudited loss of $4.9 billion in long-overdue financial results for the nine months to December 2016. In announcing the earnings, Toshiba also warned of the likelihood of a worsening financial situation and said its survival was at risk.

The iTunes brand stopped making sense a long time ago. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 14, 2017 at 8:00PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) began transitioning away from its iconic "i" branding several years ago, instead moving toward "Apple <product or service>" branding. The reasons were pretty clear. Since Apple can't trademark a single letter, countless others have attempted to piggyback on the "i" nomenclature with their own "i" devices, products, services, and even entire companies (like iHome). Over the years, what we saw was a relentless dilution of the "i" naming convention that increasingly had less and less to do with Apple. The long-term branding solution was to start branding things with "Apple." Think of Apple Music (instead of iMusic), Apple Pay (instead of iPay), or perhaps most notable, Apple Watch (instead of iWatch). At this point, Apple hasn't introduced an "i" product or service in years. Existing products like iPhone or iPad will certainly remain, but there's very little chance that Apple will introduce another new iAnything ever again. iTunes does just about everything now, for better or for worse. Image source: Apple. Is iTunes next? The iTunes brand stopped making sense long ago, at least if the brand is expected to describe the service. iTunes expanded beyond just music over a decade ago, and now includes a wide range of content categories such as movies, TV shows, apps, and even ringtones (does anyone still even pay for ringtones?). It's not just "tunes" anymore, and it hasn't been that way for a long time. As such, the iTunes brand has been declining in appropriateness for an eternity. It became a strong brand as the first mainstream digital storefront for music, which is probably why Apple has stuck with it for so long. As a function of iTunes' expansion, it's no longer just a music-playing app either. It has an integrated storefront for all types of media, and will play any of that media (other than apps). There are now signs that Apple wants to move away from the iTunes brand, starting with a subset of the content: podcasts. The company has now rebranded its first-party podcasts app as "Apple Podcasts," according to 9to5Mac. While there are some other ideas as to what this could potentially signal, like a possible podcasting subscription service, it could also mark the first indication that Apple will rebrand its digital content repository. The challenge then is: What would Apple rename it? If Apple were to rebrand iTunes altogether -- which is still a pretty big "if" currently -- there aren't a whole lot of obvious or compelling alternatives. Apple Music already refers to the streaming service and doesn't encompass the other content categories. "Apple Content" is horrendously boring and doesn't appeal to anyone, and "Apple Media" is barely any better. "Apple Play" wouldn't work because Apple's dominant mobile platform rival has already used "Play" for its own storefront. Apple Store usually refers to the retail locations. If you have any better suggestions, I imagine Cook & Co. are open to ideas right about now. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The DMV updated its list of manufacturers testing self-driving cars on Friday, with Apple becoming the 30th company to be granted permission. Few details have been revealed about Apple’s plans for self-driving cars, according to Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs. But she said Apple could be a “major player” in the autonomous vehicle industry. The permit will cover three types of vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX540h models –and six individual drivers, the California DMV said in a statement to ABC News. Apple has never publicly acknowledged its self-driving car program. A company spokesman would not provide additional details about the efforts to ABC News. Household names like Google, Tesla and Ford are also on the California DMV’s list. Volkswagen Group of America was the first company to be granted a permit. In December, Apple said that it is investing heavily in “machine learning and autonomous systems” in a statement to federal regulators after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public an Apple letter giving input on autonomous car regulations. Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test self-driving cars to submit an annual report “summarizing the disengagements of the technology during testing,” according to the DMV. The state of California also requires that a human be behind the wheel of autonomous vehicles during testing. “We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said at the time. California regulations for the technology became effective in September 2014.

Apple enters self-driving car race By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and The Associated Press April 14, 2017 11:03 pm 3 min read Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “ Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. March TSP returns: In like a lamb, out like a lion A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Apple Gets Permit To Test A Self-Driving Car by Jay Barmann in News on Apr 14, 2017 2:20 pm via busytownmysteries.com We've been hearing that Apple was quietly getting into the self-driving car game since early 2015, and in August of that year, we learned they had already sought out a testing site in Contra Costa County. Last fall, Apple shut down parts of their self-driving car program and had some layoffs, but this week, as Gizmodo reports, there's evidence that they're still in the game. As of today, Apple Inc. joins the list of 30 companies that the California DMV has issued testing permits to for autonomous vehicles to be driven on public roads. All the companies, which include Uber, Tesla, Google and auto makers Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Subaru, BMW, Ford, and Honda, have to submit accident reports and annual reports to the DMV  but as of January 1 of this year, only seven of the companies had been permitted long enough to have to submit annual reports. As Gizmodo notes, the permit does not necessarily mean that Apple is going to give us an Apple Car, it just means that they're still trying to develop the autonomous-driving technology that all these other companies are also racing to develop. We heard back in September that Apple was in talks, possibly, to acquire high-end carmaker McLaren, but not long after that rumor went out, The Hustle pointed out that Apple was likely more interested in McLaren’s consulting firm, McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT), probably for the brain trust that is there when it comes to developing new vehicle technologies. Nothing further was reported on that deal, and Apple had just two months before hired Dan Dodge, the founder and former CEO of QNX, a software company that specializes in "microkernel" operating systems and integrated driving and info-tainment systems which are used in multiple high-end vehicle brands including Audi, Jaguar, and Mercedez Benz. So, despite laying off or reassigning "hundreds" of people who had been working on the secretive Project Titan car project, Apple seems to have perhaps just pivoted and may be interested in developing its own version of a self-driving apparatus that they can then sell to other companies. But it's weird, isn't it, that a computer company that has made forays into entertainment in the last decade and has also become a telecom giant with the iPhone now wants to be a self-driving car company too? I guess if they count Google as a primary competitor in other realms, they may as well compete in this one too. Apple’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote a letter in November to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) asking that "new warrants" in the self-driving car field be granted the same testing privileges as "established manufacturers." And Kenner wrote, "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation." This suggests, as Gizmodo says, that Apple is likely more interested in keeping up with the technology itself than in actually producing a car. But we shall see.

California’s Department of Motor Vehicles quietly updated its Web site Friday to include Apple in its list of 30 companies that have permits to test self-driving cars on California’s public roads. Apple — which reportedly put its plans to develop a self-driving car of its own on the back burner last year — has obtained a permit to test its car software on three 2015 Lexus RX540h vehicles with six different drivers, the DMV said Friday in an e-mailed statement. A Lexus spokesman told The Post he had no “specific information” on why Apple chose its model, but added that its hybrid crossover SUVs “are a popular choice among companies looking to test future technologies.” The Cupertino, Calif.-based MacBook-maker isn’t in pole position when it comes to permits in California. Google and Uber have them, and the latter also started testing self-driving cars with its Pittsburgh customers late last year. Traditional automakers such as GM, Ford, Honda and Mercedes-Benz also have permits to test their models on California’s roads. Electric-car manufacturer Tesla started test-driving automated cars in California late last year. Apple’s move into self-driving cars has been hotly anticipated for years, and Friday’s news is the latest indication that it is serious about the space. Apple said in a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Apple reps didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In a report from Bloomberg, it has been discovered that the California DMV has granted Apple approval to test self-driving cars on California roads. This is actually not the first time that Apple’s plans have been revealed by government agencies. Back in December last year it was revealed that Apple’s director of product integrity had written in to the NHTSA with regards to automation of transportation and machine learning, hinting at self-driving car plans. However if you might recall, it was also reported last year that Apple had given up on building its own electric car. This doesn’t mean that Apple still isn’t interested in the technology, but instead it suggested that Apple could simply be looking more towards the software side rather than the hardware side of things. Given that making your own cars is a huge undertaking, it is understandable. So this permit granted by the DMV could simply be Apple looking to test their software with existing vehicles, and nothing more, but it is an interesting development anyway. No word on if and when Apple will ever release this software to carmakers, but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled all the same. Filed in Apple >Transportation.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said yesterday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. “This does confirm what's long been rumoured: That Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumoured, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. Shares of Apple closed down 0.5 per cent at US$141.05 (RM622.63) on Thursday. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Apple gets permit in California to test self-driving cars Facebook disrupts suspected spam operation Google launches Style Ideas, a new shopping tool Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts NUS researchers invent way to ‘teleport’ drinks over the internet (VIDEO) Project Scorpio: Five consoles that won with less power, and one that didn't Artificial intelligence to put an end to failed selfies (VIDEO) That fingerprint sensor on your phone is not as safe as you think Student-designed rocket soars to record heights (VIDEO) Facebook looking at behaviour to weed out fake accounts Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner file for divorce Reuters Video: The fight for luxury comes to the New York auto show Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Apple considers bidding for Toshiba’s chip business Survey reveals US teens in love with Amazon and Apple Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Late-night snacks that are actually good for you Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Apple enters self-driving car race The company, in need of a breakthrough product, is awarded a permit to test vehicles on public roads in California. By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already reshaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles Friday and disclosed that information on its website. Associated Press/Tony Gutierrez Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The permit covers three vehicles – all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs – and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December: “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to go to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. APPLE’S DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the project name “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

If you downloaded the soft launch version and are playing it right now, you should join our Discord server, where we've opened up #modern_combat_versus, a channel where you can discuss the game with other players. Need to get a game going, discuss tactics, or just want to bond over some cool stuff? This is the place for you! It's worth noting that with the debut of the soft launch, you not only need to have access to the game, but you also need a VPN to play the game since it is region-locked. We're going to explain how to use a VPN to play the game right away, and how to download it if you don't know how to download soft launch games. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel   How to play with a VPN Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) sounds scary, but iOS makes it extremely pain-free to use one. What you're going to need is a VPN that has a server located in the Philippines so that you can appear as if you're in the region so the servers will let you play the game. This does work, but do note that performance is going to be impacted on the fact that you're connecting to the game from overseas if you're connecting via VPN. As well, you often get what you pay for with VPNs, as free VPNs can be slow because, well, people like free things. Paid VPN services do exist, and you might want to consider one if playing region-locked soft launches is of interest to you. Be sure to check out our #modern_combat_versus room where people are sharing VPN recommendations. As well, sound off in the comments if you have any VPN recommendations. But for the purposes of this guide, we're going to use a VPN app that's good enough for Modern Combat Versus, in Free VPN by Cloudwall [Free]. All you need to do is to download the app, choose the Philippines server, and hit Connect. The first time you do this, it will prompt you to "Allow" the VPN connection, and take you to Settings where you will have to put in your passcode or Touch ID to approve the VPN profile installation. Once you do this, Cloudwall will connect. All you need to do now is to launch Modern Combat Versus and you can go through the tutorial and play the game for yourself.   How to download the soft launch version So, you want to download Modern Combat Versus, but don't know how? We often talk about soft launched games here on TouchArcade (and if you enjoy our coverage, your support is most welcome). While getting soft launched games in a country you don't reside in isn't necessarily easy, it's not that difficult to do, you just have to know where you're looking and what to do. Here's how to register an iTunes account in the Philippines for the Modern Combat Versus soft launch. The first step is that you'll have an easier time doing this from desktop iTunes. This process isn't impossible from iOS, and it has been possible to just change the country on your account, but doing so from a computer with mouse and keyboard, along with creating a new account, is the easiest and most non-destructive way to get access to other iTunes stores. Start by signing out of your account. Go into the App Store on iTunes, and scroll all the way to the bottom to where you see the country flag, or the "Change Country" link. Click that, and now select the country that you want to sign up in, which in this case is the Philippines. I recommend repeating this process for countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, as these countries regularly get soft-launched games as well. Now, go and download a free app. Ideally, it'd be Modern Combat Versus, but any free app will work. Once you do this, it'll prompt you to sign in to the iTunes Store. Choose "Create Apple ID." You'll want to make sure that you download a free app. You can't just register a new account outright as you'll have to put in a credit card number, and well, if you had that, you wouldn't be reading this article, now would you? For the email address, what I recommend doing is if you have a Gmail address, to use + and something to signify the country that the email is for. So, for example, use elihodappsucks+ph@gmail.com for a Philippines account. This way, the emails still get sent to your inbox, but it will function differently than your current Apple ID. If your email provider doesn't support the + function, or if that's too complicated, create a burner email somewhere to use as your alt Apple ID. Obviously for payment method, choose none. For the personal information including billing address, you'll need some sort of quasi-usable address in the country you're signing up in. Personally, I like to use a fake name generator website for coming up with usable addresses and info. Fill that out, and hit Create Apple ID. You'll need to verify your Apple ID, but once you do, it should be usable. Now you can sign in with it on your device. To switch Apple IDs, scroll to the bottom of the App Store, tap the Apple ID section, and choose Sign Out. Then, sign back in with your new Apple ID. The App Store will automatically switch you to your Apple ID's App Store. From there, you can download whatever free apps you want to that account. Do note that you can't necessarily buy anything from this account without some form of payment method attached. You could get someone to give you a gift card from the Philippines of course, or possibly buy the country's iTunes gift card off of eBay. What you can't do is buy IAP in the app from your home account; Apple requires that you be signed in to the account that you bought the app on to buy IAP in it. There's not really an easy way around this, so you'll just have to play free games for free unless you find a hookup. Otherwise, you'll see a screen like this: Note that if Gameloft releases an update, the App Store won't automatically update the game, it'll usually just make you sign in with the password of your alternate country's account for the update to download. And when you sign in with your other account, the store will switch automatically to the account's country. Also, be sure to sign into an account in-game so that you don't lose progress when the game comes out in your country. You'll need to delete and re-install on your primary account so that you can make purchases. In general, the soft launch account process should be pretty painless. This is as compared to the Android process, where...well, it's not as easy to do it yourself since Google restricts it based on the device's region, which is harder to fake. This trick has worked and been known for a few years now, and while Apple could possibly change it someday, you should be good for the foreseeable future to download soft launch games.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure California DMV Gives Apple Permission to Test Driverless Cars The technology giant is now the 30th company to receive approval for testing on state roadways. by News Staff / April 14, 2017 Matt Buchanan According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website, Apple is now permitted to test self-driving cars in the state. Apple is now the 30th tech company with such rights. They join other big-name tech firms like Google and Tesla, as well as more traditional automakers like Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, Nissan, GM, BMW, Honda, Ford and Subaru. Though Apple never formally announced plans to build an autonomous vehicle (AV), there has been much speculation about the tech giant getting into the driverless game. RELATEDCalifornia DMV Adopts Autonomous Vehicle Testing RulesData Shows Promise for Autonomous Vehicles' Progress For starters, former Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak said two years ago that a self-driving “automobile makes a lot of sense for a company like Apple,” adding that “Tesla has set an example that a new car company can come, not out of Detroit, but out of Silicon Valley. Just the price of cars make me think Apple should work on it.” Then later that year, in September 2015, the California DMV admitted to having met with Apple officials about the state's rules for testing autonomous vehicles on public streets. And this past December, the company penned a letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation acknowledging its interest in AV technology. Like all permit-holders, Apple must report accidents within 10 business days, and submit annual reports that document self-driving tech failures, including disengagements, which is when when a human driver takes over.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Photo / AP After months of speculation that the company is developing automotive technology, Apple has officially leapt into the war for self-driving cars by obtaining a test permit from California regulators. The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans. The project quickly became something of an open secret among technology-watchers, even if it was never truly clear what Apple was working on. The ambiguity surrounding the effort was reflected in the numerous names that circulated about the project, such as the "Apple Car," "the iCar" and "Project Titan." Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car, or to upgrade a car by injecting it with autonomous capabilities. Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumors. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Continued below. Related Content John Drinnan: When does plain talk become hate speech? Your Views: Readers Letters Heather du Plessis-Allan: Green-Labour photo op a Winston win Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1,100 additional jobs and a US$14 million (NZ$20m) investment, and in February Ford said that it's investing US$1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 per cent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. "It's encouraging to hear Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game," said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars will push the industry to "provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we're already experiencing." Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California's autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle's autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones - a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles. - Washington Post By Brian Fung, Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE ...

" Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump.

(Tribune news services) Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan." Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Automotive Industry Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Apple Inc.

In January, Toshiba officially announced it would seek to sell a portion of its flash memory business, including the SSD business of the Storage & Electronic Device Solutions Division, to a not-yet-named buyer. [ Further reading: Face-to-face without frustration: The HP Elite Slice for Meeting Rooms ] The Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba may sell a 20 per cent stake in the memory business for between $1.77 billion and $2.65 billion, "while retaining a majority stake and keeping the new company in group earnings." Toshiba Based on a vertical stacking or 3D technology that Toshiba calls BiCS (Bit Cost Scaling), the company's NAND flash memory stores three bits of data per transistor, meaning it's a multi-level cell (MLC) flash chip. It can store 512Gbits (64GB) per chip. Toshiba's solvency and fundraising ability are presently in doubt because of a $1.9 billion accounting scandal and a huge loss related to the purchase of a U.S. nuclear plant business. The company, which invented NAND flash in the early 1980s, had been considering spinning off its semiconductor operations and selling a partial stake to Western Digital (WD) and others, as it tries to cope with a massive impairment loss in its U.S. nuclear power unit. Neither Toshiba nor WD have confirmed a potential sale, however. Earlier this year, Toshiba took a writedown of $6.56 billion against its struggling U.S. nuclear equipment operations and it's hoping to rebound from that loss with a sale. "Its financial problems were a major drag on the growth of its memory business," Sean Yang, research director of DRAMeXchange, said in an earlier interview. Several potential buyers have been identified in reports, including Apple, according to Bloomberg's news service. Apple is considering investing several billion in Toshiba's memory business, according to the report. "It seems like they are selling the Golden Goose and keeping the money pit," said Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective-Analysis, referring to Toshiba. If Apple were to purchase a stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business, it would be a departure for a company that has historically outsourced most of its parts and labor, Handy said. "Seagate and Western Digital used to believe that vertical integration was necessary in order to compete in the SSD market, although Seagate appears to have changed its tune," Handy said. "A captive source of supply is a good thing to have during a shortage, but can be a millstone during an oversupply." Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to Apple, reportedly said it was not participating in talks after reviewing a possible deal "with interest." According to one report, Western Digital (WD) is none too happy about Toshiba's plans to sell its memory business. WD reportedly sent a letter to Toshiba telling it the proposed sale breaches a joint-venture agreement as part of the FlashAlliance to build flash fabrication plants in Japan, which are operated by Toshiba. WD's SanDisk holds a 49.9 per cent share in the FlashAlliance and a Toshiba has a 50.1 per cent share. Any potential sale by Toshiba might be on hold for now as it deals with WD's concerns. If Toshiba does sell a major stake in its memory business -- or the entire unit -- it would do little to effect the memory market as a whole from the perspective of supply and demand, according to Handy. "From the perspective of national security there are significant concerns that Japan will lose control of an important technology, and that it will be owned by a company from a country that has a difficult history with Japan," Handy said, referring to China and Foxxcon. "From WD's perspective it's really strange, since they have a very good working relationship and understanding with Toshiba, but not necessarily with the buyer. "I like to think of it as your spouse coming in and saying: 'Here's somebody new for you to be married to!' then walking off."

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple CEO Tim Cook. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans.  Photo: AP Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumours. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Some say Apple is more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car. Photo: AP Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday, General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1100 additional jobs and a $US14 million ($18.5 million) investment, and in February Ford said that it was investing $US1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 per cent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. "It's encouraging to hear Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game," said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars would push the industry to "provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we're already experiencing". Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California's autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle's autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones - a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles.

As we mentioned, the Cupertino-based company has also revised its marketing guidelines. It reads "Now use the Listen on Apple Podcasts badge or the Apple Podcasts icon whenever you promote your show or episodes" on Apple Podcasts Identity Guidelines website. The badge can be used in promotions on Web pages, social media, apps, and in printed materials. Also, following the official rebranding, Apple has renamed its official Twitter handle @iTunesPodcasts to @ApplePodcasts. At Code Media conference in February this year, Apple also announced that it is foraying into the TV space with the launch of its upcoming reality TV show Planet of the Apps. The show is set where contestants will pitch their ideas on new apps before investors to fund them. The panel of judges (or investors) includes singer-songwriter Will.i.am (also a founder and CEO at I.am+), actress Jessica Alba (also a co-founder at The Honest Company), actress Gwyneth Paltrow (now a founder at lifestyle publication Goop), and CEO of Vayner Media, Gary Vaynerchuk.

(U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) A dropped iPhone scenario with a bumper-equipped device. (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) Sooner or later it happens to every mobile phone user: the device escapes the hand, or gets knocked off a counter, and down it falls. The Apple warranty does not apply to damage caused by user fumbling and bumbling. And even if it’s only the screen that breaks, Apple will charge $129 to $149 for the fix. But imagine if, when you dropped your phone, bumpers popped out from each corner to cushion the impact – or even allow the phone to float when it falls into water. Apple has been looking at just such a system, and received a patent for it on April 4. The technology is built around sensors such as the accelerometer present in most modern smartphones, which can detect when a device is in “free fall,” according to the patent. “The length of time in free fall may be used to calculate the height and velocity of movement and thus to make a determination whether the device has been dropped or merely set down,” the patent document said. When the software determines that the phone has been dropped, out spring the corner bumpers. And these cushions could not only help prevent breakage, but enable flotation. “Devices may sometimes be exposed to elements such as water and may even be dropped into water environments such as a lake, ocean, or even a bathtub or sink within the home,” the document said. Although Apple delicately avoided mentioning the toilet, 39 percent of smartphone owners use their devices in the bathroom, according to Google, and 19 percent of users drop their phones in the toilet, according to online services firm Plaxo. Whatever the body of water, Apple’s technology could reduce the damage, or prevent loss, according to the patent document. “In a situation where the portable electronic device is dropped into water, the user may face a risk not only of irreparably damaging the device due to water ingress, but also of losing the device altogether as these devices will sink,” the document noted. “The shock absorbers may include buoyant material which permits the portable electronic device to float in the event that it is dropped or otherwise exposed to a water environment,” the document said. “By enabling the device to float, this may permit the user time to retrieve the device from the water environment and prevent damage. “In addition, by enabling the device to float, it is prevented from sinking to the bottom of a lake, ocean or other turbid waters where retrieval may be problematic.” The bumpers, once out, could be retracted by the user after recovery of the phone from the ground, floor or toilet. And the corner-cushions could be made fashion forward, or, alternatively, unobtrusive. “Bumper cushions may be colored or otherwise configured in a decorative mode such that they add to the appearance of the smartphone or blend into the edge or body of the device.” Of course, patented technologies don’t always end up in consumer products – but when Apple releases the iPhone 8, we’ll certainly be eyeballing the corners.

Apple enters self-driving car race Associated Press Posted April 14, 2017 April 14, 2017 Updated April 14, 2017 12:35pm ASSOCIATED PRESS Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles and disclosed that information on its website. SAN FRANCISCO >> Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “ Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. "This does confirm what's long been rumoured: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumoured, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N). Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. Shares of Apple closed down 0.5 percent at $141.05 on Thursday.  (Reporting by Shalini Nagarajan in Bengaluru and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr) The Apple logo is seen on the facade of the new Apple Store in Paris, France, January 5, 2017.

They put together their own custom PC builds, and work together to come up with the necessary hacks to get macOS and the software they need running on the machines. Who better to ask what Apple should include in its upcoming modular Mac Pro than the pros that it has pushed away? To find out what Hackintoshers want in the new machine, and maybe what would help bring back some pros that Apple has lost in recent years, we’ve talked to the moderators at one of our favourite Hacktinosh communities, tonymacx86.com. We also got some input from our own resident Hackintosh enthusiast (and YouTuber) Jeff Benjamin, and some other pros and gamers that have made the jump from Apple’s pro machines to a Hackintosh. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac pastrychef (tonymacx86 mod): The biggest backlash regarding the Mac Pro 6,1 was, by far, the proprietary graphics card slots. A return of PCI-e slots for user upgradeable GPUs will instantly win back many customers. I’d like to see Apple go one step further to show that they are committed to pros by eliminating the need for customized firmware to get boot screens when using aftermarket graphics cards. This will win them back a lot of faith. I think it’s also important that Apple continues to keep the CPUs in Mac Pros socketed.#5 I know it’s a long shot, but I’m sure many users would benefit from an “entry level” Mac Pro that uses E series Intel CPUs (as in Haswell-E, Broadwell-E). Many people need more cores but don’t necessarily need ECC RAM. Apple can even limit it to a single PCI-e slot (née ITX) so as to have more differentiation from “high end” Mac Pros. I believe such a machine would sell like hotcakes. I was thinking about usage of standard M.2 slots, but we would still be faced with the issue of Apple using 4K sector size… tonymacx86: The Hackintosh community in particular would like the modular Mac Pro to have removable, upgradeable parts. This is what draws people to make a custom build- like PCIe based graphics cards, removable SATA and/or m.2 SSDs, RAM slots, PCIe slots for expansion, multiple graphics ports, USB ports. Thunderbolt 3 would be a nice feature, and seems to be picking up some steam although I think more users would like traditional expansion methods. To be able to access the inside of the case would be great- kind of like the old style non-cylinder Mac Pro. We’d also like to see adoption of NVIDIA graphics cards, possibly even simple off the shelf retail access for macOS capable GPUs. Oh and non-proprietary interfaces and the ability to replace stuff without voiding the warranty or visiting the Apple Store would be key. Jeff Benjamin (9to5Mac): The main thing that I desire from a professional Mac setup is something that Apple seems to be promising — regular hardware updates. Of course, true modularity is highly desired, but regular updates are even more important for a product that should stand head and shoulders above every other hardware offering in Apple’s lineup. Of course, we need to see regular CPU and GPU updates, but we should also need to see timely hardware advances when such progress is made within the industry (PCIe 4.0, for example). As long as Apple is able to pull off some form of modularity — either full off-the-shelf component support, or limited partner support — and its able to provide consistent timely hardware updates system-wide, then I think the Mac Pro is destined to be viewed as a success amongst the Pro constituency. Read Jeff’s guide: Building a (sub-$1000) Hackintosh that meets the Oculus Rift hardware requirements trs96(tonymacx86 mod): How about non-proprietary M.2 connection slots. If I really have to pay triple the going market price for a larger NVME drive it puts the Mac Pro out of reach of myself and many people. Also, I would be completely surprised if Apple would allow the end user to install their own PC graphics card. My feeling is that they will continue to use the much more costly workstation class cards be they from AMD or Nvidia. If so, a choice of either brand would be awesome. 9to5Mac’s own Jeff Benjamin Hackintoshing Going Bald (tonymacx86 mod): +1 on the non-propriety m.2 slots. Would also like to see the BT/WiFi slots be industry standard so we are not locked into the Apple branded cards only. Really would like to see the return of the superdrive for both DVD and Blu-ray as a standard and have it also be an off-the-shelf model without proprietary connections or firmware. WonkeyDonkey (tonymacx86 mod): Fair play. There is that risk with modular for sure. Modular to them does not necessarily mean the same modular as we understand it. With the exception of AMD graphics, Apple seem to have been quite relaxed regarding the software I think. They could make a proper modular system (As we understand it) but then make life quite difficult for us with the software. We know the community could make some or most of it available, but Apple could still screw us over if they wanted to. Greg Gladwell (Switching to Hackintosh for gaming, GPU options): If I don’t do this, it’s probably a complete defection back to Windows and look for alternative solutions to various use cases I have. I simply would feel like I’m being taken for a ride shelling out money for an Apple computer now given the disparity between cost and experience; there used to be a closer correlation between the two. Now the price premium has gone up and the experience premium has gone down, the difference is untenable for me… A genuinely useful/up to date GPU for gaming and VR (Elite Dangerous, Doom in Windows, Oculus rift in Windows, etc) and better bang for the buck overall. The announcement and subsequent release of the Pascal architecture drivers by Nvidia is perfect timing, and makes things even more appealing, although I have to wait a bit to see what the community makes of them before I leap in – so a couple of weeks. MacMan (tonymacx86 mod): Dual industry standard M.2 slots, PCIe 3.0 slot for NVIDIA or AMD GPU. USB 3.0, USB-C and dual Thunderbolt 3 ports. 10Gbps Copper would be nice since it’s common on servers and cheaper than fiber. Adrian B (tonymacx86 mod): PCIe 4.0 needs to be available. My understanding is that PCIe 4.0 is coming to Intel Kaby Lake second generation and AMD Ryzen second generation hardware which will be available in the Windows market place around the time (or before) Apple release the new Mac Pro machine(s). The main PCIe 4.0 benefit is going to revolve around increased network and data transfer speeds. I fully accept that straight out the box the benefits will be limited for most users just as they were with ThunderBolt. Apple haven’t updated the Mac Pro for close to 4 years and even when first released it used end of life hardware for the motherboard and CPU with old AMD graphics. It would be nice if Apple released hardware that was bang up to date and looked to the future. Features like PCIe 4.0 could be used within the lifetime of the original user. Adding value and giving a modern spec to hardware is really needed to give many in the bigger Apple community faith that Apple take their higher end users seriously. My worry about Apple creating a ‘modular’ design is that it will have interchangeable items such as GPU cards that Apple will produce and that will rely on Apple propriety connection rather than standardised PC fitment such as PCIe slots. I hope that I am wrong but the marketing use of ‘modular’ in the terms of design and manufacture makes me nervous. Are you a Hackintosher?

Apple enters self-driving car race MICHAEL LIEDTKE , AP Technology Writer Published: April 14, 2017, 5:55 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - This Thursday, Sept. 19, 2013, file photo shows the Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles Friday, April 14, 2017, and disclosed that information on its website. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

Media practitioners were given the opportunity to taste the food of the finalists and judge the best three recipes. Among the categories were apple pizza with dates, apple tart with custard, gegeurde normandiese randtert, curry apple soup, apple and onion filling for pancakes, apple ring cake, apple pork fillet surprise, chicken fillets, food apples and honeyed apple and almond surprise. The recipes were judged according to the following criteria: the main ingredient of the recipe had to be fresh apples, preference was given to recipes based on a healthy lifestyle and there had to be a starter, main course, dessert or tart. The judging was based on originality, simplicity, nutritional value, presentation and taste or flavours that serve a minimum of six. The competition was launched under the theme, “Eat Healthy. Live Healthy. Prevent Cancer”. According to Communication Practitioner of Bank Windhoek, Marie du Plessis, it was with this in mind that Bank Windhoek, in partnership with the Chefs Association of Namibia, launched the first ever Bank Windhoek Cancer Apple Project Recipe Competition last month. “The recipe competition is aimed at developing the right eating habits in all Namibians, thus helping us ensure that we become a much healthier nation overall,” she said. She also said that, through the recipe competition, Bank Windhoek invited the public to enter with their fresh original recipes. She added: “So far only 25 people entered the competition and it was difficult for us to choose the best top ten among the entries.” Vice-President of the Chefs Association of Namibia Terry Jenkinson said, “Chefs Association of Namibia prepared the recipes the way ingredients were sent us by the contestant in order for us to be fair to every one who entered the competition.” Interested people were asked to forward their typed or neatly hand-written recipes and a full-colour photograph of the prepared dish to the Marketing and Corporate Communications Services Department at Bank Windhoek’s Main Building before May 3, 2007. The winner of this creative competition will be announced on May 28 and will receive a prize, said Du Plessis. The public will have an opportunity to taste the winning recipes at the Chefs Association show stand at the Namibia Tourism Expo scheduled for May 30 to June 2, she said. She also said the overall winner of the Bank Windhoek Cancer Apple Project Recipe Competition will enjoy a fabulous weekend for two at Divava Okavango Lodge and Spa.

The list, which can be viewed on the website for California's Department of Motor Vehicles, was updated on April 14, with "Apple Inc." having been newly added. The permit covers the registration of three Lexus RX450h SUVs, and allows six drivers to operate them. Apple's possession of the permit indicates that the company could begin testing autonomous vehicles on California roads, and an Apple source reportedly told Bloomberg that testing would begin "soon", but no specific time frame was given. This permit could indicate the resurgence of Apple's self-driving car program, codenamed Project Titan. Although the firm never officially acknowledged the project, anonymous sources claimed that dozens of employees were laid off back in September last year, in order to "reboot" the initiative. The possession of a permit does not necessarily mean that the Cupertino giant is actively testing autonomous vehicles, as several companies may have permits without actually carrying out testing. Those that do own testing permits are required to submit regular reports to the California DMV, so more will be known about Apple's specific autonomous exploits when the company submits its first report. If Apple were to start testing autonomous vehicles in California, it would be joining several other companies who have conducted similar testing in the state. Examples of companies holding autonomous testing permits in California include Google, Tesla, and Bosch. Among the list of permitted companies is also ride-sharing company Uber, who carried out autonomous testing without a permit in California last year. Amid tensions with the state, the company was forced to migrate their project to Arizona where operations were recently resumed after an accident. Apple has not made a statement about its receipt of the permit, instead referencing a letter it wrote to the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration last November, which stated that the company was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation," and was "excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Source: The Verge Tags Apple Self-driving cars Permit Autonomous vehicles California Dmv Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Follow @TwitterDev Previous Story Kantar: Android sales up in most markets, iOS down in China, Windows phone sales fall again Next Story Microsoft's Brad Smith: Growing consensus on need for international treaty on state attacks Community Activity Refresh Two 960 Evo Drives, Something Kills 4K Reads/Writes in Hardware Hangout A year later than planned, Dell's stunning 30-inch 4K OLED monitor is available for $3,499 in Front Page News Light's 52MP 'L16' 16 lens camera now has a final design, and is almost ready to ship in Front Page News Microsoft Rewards to replace Xbox Live Rewards in Australia in late April in Front Page News Samsung's Galaxy S8 active makes its first appearance as the SM-G892A in Front Page News Microsoft is finally blocking updates to older versions of Windows on new processors in Front Page News My first drone in General Discussion Sandboxie 5.18 in Front Page News Advertisement Trending Stories Version 1704 update is rolling out to all Xbox One users today - here's what's new Apr 13, 2017 with 4 comments Virgin Media is now turning customers' home broadband routers into public Wi-Fi hotspots 12 hours ago with 14 comments Custom Gamerpics are now available for Xbox Insiders in the Preview Alpha ring Apr 14, 2017 with 1 comment HP Spectre x360 review: A near-perfect convertible that falls short on battery life 16 hours ago with 0 comments Related Stories 7 Days: A week of Microsoft updates, more Yahoo hoohah, and Apple Watch wah-wah-waaahhh Dec 17, 2016 · Hot!

All three spots were released for the Turkish market on the Apple Turkey YouTube channel. They were shot by 11 year old children on iPhones, and were released to celebrate National Sovereignty and Children’s Day in Turkey. Balon All three are terrific, but my favorite is this one, titled Balon (Balloon in Turkish): That’s good stuff, and it was shot by Beliz E. Köpek Next up is Köpek (Turkish for Dog), it’s also very clever, and hat’s off to 11-year old Eren P. for making it. Tavşan The third spot is called Tavşan (Rabbit). It’s a slow motion closeup of a long-haired rabbit’s fur also shot by Beliz E. These spots do a great job of making great videos feel attainable, especially the first two. They’re fun, captivating, and entertaining.

And we're not talking a run-of-the-mill sedan here: Apple is testing self-driving cars. According to an updated page on the typically dry California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website, the agency has issued an Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit to Apple, allowing it to conduct self-driving car tests in the state.  The iPhone 7 maker is the newest entrant as of April 14, joining the likes of Nvidia, Faraday Future, Ford, Honda, BMW, Nissan, Tesla, Google and Mercedes Benz with self-driving permit in hand. As with every other company that's testing autonomous vehicles in California, Apple must submit a report on traffic accidents involving its cars within 10 business days. Apple also needs to turn in an annual report on disengagements, or every time a human driver takes over for the self-driving system. Apple on the road Best known for the iconic iPhone, which turns 10 this year, Mac computers and the Apple Watch, vehicles are a whole new product category for Apple, and one it's taken its sweet time to develop.  That's Apple's modus operandi with nearly every device, including rumored work in virtual reality, but it seems now Apple is ready to take its show on the road, and make its cars a reality. It's no surprise Apple would include self-driving features in its vehicles considering the market's trend towards autonomy, with a growing number of car makers adding driverless tech following Tesla and Google's lead.  Apple's mystery mini van, equipped with self-driving tech apparatus Though signs here and there over the years have indicated Apple has four-wheelers on the brain, we started seeing mystery vans equipped with LIDAR and other tech indicative of self-driving systems last year. One van was spotted cruising near Apple offices in Sunnyvale, California.  Those vans, it turned out, were working on Apple Maps, but it's possible they were also testing systems that would one day make it into a self-driving car. With its freshly minted permit, we could soon see patented Apple self-driving cars on California roads. We'll keep our eyes out (and let us know if you see one!), though don't expect to be able to buy your own iCar for a few more years.  Up next for Apple is the iPhone 8 Related news Your Xbox One home screen is in for a small spring cleaning Download of the day: Pivot Animator Top 45 best free games you should play in 2017 The first Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer finally sees Luke speak See more Car tech news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Be Aware of These Risks Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Imagine this scenario. You purchase a new home with several pre-installed smart devices. In the middle of your first night under a new roof, the alarm on your home security system awakens you. On day two, the lights in your bedroom mysteriously turn on at 4 AM. Finally, on the third day, you wake up uncomfortably warm with your heating system Why the Ecobee3 Smart Thermostat Should Be Your First HomeKit Device Why the Ecobee3 Smart Thermostat Should Be Your First HomeKit Device If you’re an Apple device user and are looking to start building a HomeKit-compatible system, the Ecobee3 Smart Thermostat is a great place to start.

Instead, it could be that the previous homeowners are controlling your smart devices from afar, either accidentally or deliberately. Sound too far out there to be true? Think again. When it comes to smart home appliances What Is A Smart Home? What Is A Smart Home? We recently launched a Smart Home category at MakeUseOf, but what is a smart home? Read More , there still aren’t established standards for resold devices.  Unfortunately, in many cases, doing a “factory reset” might not be enough. In this article, you’ll learn about the risks of buying second-hand smart home devices, such as lights, temperature controls, and locks, and what you can do to best protect your privacy. Smart Home Industry: The Digital Wild West It seems that every company, no matter the industry, is trying to come up with the next great smart home device. Unfortunately, while companies are pushing hard to get new products into stores Apple HomeKit's Hottest New Products for 2017 Apple HomeKit's Hottest New Products for 2017 Since Apple first announced HomeKit, the number of compatible products keeps growing! From security cameras to lighting products, here are the coolest new gadgets set to arrive in 2017. Read More , there has been less foresight regarding what should happen when those devices are eventually resold to a new owner. It’s fair to say that tech products usually have an incredibly short life cycle, as cell phone turnover rates show. However, there are plenty of exceptions, especially when it comes to smart devices. Many of the most popular smart light bulbs on the market, for example, can feasibly last for decades, depending on how often you use them. To a lesser extent, the same can be said about other products like smart thermostats, which have been designed to work with a broad range of electrical systems, both new and old. Due to the extended lifespan of smart home products, it’s not uncommon for used smart devices to find new homes as part of a house sale or due to the previous owner upgrading their smart home system. Consider how much information is routed through your smart devices and the permissions that you have given them. Unless you can guarantee that past or future owners will have zero access to said information, choosing to buy or sell a used smart device is risky at best. Steps You Can Take Many smart home products won’t be around long enough to get a second owner. But for products that do, there are steps you can take to better protect yourself from annoying interference or serious security risks. These steps are helpful for both sellers and buyers. Assess the Situation When dealing with multiple smart devices, it’s always best to inventory the used items. When possible, group products by manufacturer and product type. If you can’t find this information, either because they aren’t properly marked or because there isn’t a box, avoid the items and don’t use them. The Online Trust Alliance’s Smart Home Checklist is a great place to start when you need to inventory items. It provides a general list of smart items that might be in a home. It also walks realtors, sellers, and buyers through the process of transferring of smart devices. Better still, there could soon be an app that takes the guesswork out of identifying smart products. The unnamed app, currently under development by the National Association of Realtors’ Center for Realtor Technology (NARC), will help users better identify items that must be reset prior to a repurchase. Yes, Do a Factory Reset… Every smart home device comes with a factory reset option Stop Thieves From Recovering Your Data After A Factory Reset Stop Thieves From Recovering Your Data After A Factory Reset Android's default factory reset may not completely wipe all your data, so before you sell or give away your device, make sure to completely wipe all your data with this method. Read More . Depending on the item, you can perform this step on the device itself or through a dedicated app or website. To get the latest directions for doing a complete reset, visit the company website. This will guarantee you get up-to-date information, rather than relying on the potentially outdated instruction manuals that came with the item. In most cases, finding these instructions online is as simple as typing “factory reset” into the search box on the company’s support page. For example, a quick search on the Google Nest website will bring up the aptly named How to restart or reset the Nest Learning Thermostat page. …But Keep in Mind When doing research for this article, I was surprised to learn that factory resets of smart home products aren’t always foolproof. Some products, such as the Wink Hub 2, do provide privacy protection when a smart product is being used by someone new. As Patrick Mahoney, Wink’s communication director told Digital Trends: “If a Wink Hub was not removed by a previous owner from their account, the new owner wouldn’t be able to connect it to theirs, hence they’d never be able to see the previous owner’s devices or user profile.” Still, other products do not. The same Digital Trends article explained that in some instances, a factory reset doesn’t actually un-link a product from its original owner. In those cases, you typically must call the company for further instruction. As Charles Henderson, global head of IBM’s X-Force Red explained about smart devices at the 2017 RSA computer security conference: “They (the manufacturers) have all these great on-boarding tools to get that first owner in, but there’s nothing to get the first owner out and the second owner in. They’re not really concerned with the second owner who needs the first owner evicted.” Ask the Right Questions If you’re still concerned about security and privacy Home Security Systems May Not Be As Secure As You Think Home Security Systems May Not Be As Secure As You Think Here we take a look at some of the most notable smart home security hacks – exploring what happened and why it happened. Read More as it relates to second-hand smart objects, you should contact the manufacturer and see how they can assist. Most will probably recommend doing a factory reset and hope to end the conversation there. Before doing so, however, ask them about the company’s policy on unlinking devices from past owners. For example, you could ask: Will resetting the device remove it from the previous owner’s account? What guarantees are in place to protect my privacy? Besides a factory reset, what other steps would you recommend? Other Things to Consider There are other things to consider when dealing with used smart devices. For example, you should find out whether warranties remain in place with new owners. When they don’t, do some research so that you know the potential cost to repair or replace the item should something happen. You’ll also need to find out more about device compatibility Future Proofing Your Smart Home for Apple HomeKit Compatibility Future Proofing Your Smart Home for Apple HomeKit Compatibility Read More . For example, does the item only work on Wi-Fi or can you use it with Bluetooth? Does it require a separate hub or will the device function independently? A Fluid Situation The smart home industry remains in its infancy. As with most new technologies, smart device manufacturers are more concerned with getting new items out the door than with what happens when these products are eventually resold. Henderson hopes that smart home device manufacturers eventually look to the mobile phone industry to determine an industry standard regarding what a device reset means. “Right now we just sort of hope for the best and wish consumers luck when it comes to removing data or removing access,” he explains. Until that standard is developed, you should practice due diligence.

Thanks to an update from the California Department of Motor Vehicles Friday, we now know one thing for sure: Apple has a permit to test autonomous cars in the state. Related Apple Is Launching a New Video App That’ll Up Your Social Media Game Apple's Insane Spaceship Campus to Open in April With Theater Named After Steve Jobs Nearly 100 Tech Companies Oppose Trump's Muslim Ban Apple's name was added to a list of 29 other companies testing self-driving cars in California, Business Insider first reported. Apple joins previously permitted companies Tesla, Google, and a bunch of automakers you have probably already guessed are on the list. In a statement Friday, a California DMV spokesperson said that Apple Inc. had been issued an autonomous vehicle test permit covering "three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers." The permit makes it clear that Apple is at least serious about developing self-driving vehicle technology and software, but not necessarily fully committed to making their own car just yet. Multiple publications' attempts at getting a statement from Apple on this latest update resulted in a spokesperson redirecting them to a letter the company sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2016. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's November letter to the NHTSA said, according to Mashable. Way back in September 2015, the Wall Street Journal cited people "familiar with the matter" and reported that a 2019 unveiling was being targeted for an Apple-branded vehicle. According to a subsequent report from the New York Times one year later, Apple eventually "shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees."

The Cupertino-based company was awarded the permit on Friday by California’s Department of Motor vehicles according to a report from Jalopnik. State rules dictate that any company looking to engage in the testing of self-driving vehicles must apply for an autonomous vehicle test permit. Companies that are granted a permit are required to submit an annual report on its “disengagement rate,” or how often a human driver had to take over control of an autonomous vehicle during testing. The DMV told the publication that the permit covers three vehicles – all 2015 Lexus RX540H SUVs – and six drivers. Apple has reportedly been working on a secretive self-driving car project for several years. Dubbed Project Titan, the initiative was nearly sidelined last year as rumors surfaced that Apple was shifting gears and would instead focus on building autonomous software rather than an actual vehicle of its own. It wasn’t until late last year, however, that Apple publicly acknowledged that it was investing in the area of transportation-related automation. In related news, it was reported earlier this week that California was gearing up to impose a one-time registration fee for plug-in vehicles beginning with the 2020 model year. There’s also talk of an annual fee that’ll range from $225 to $175 depending on the value of the vehicle in question.

We did learn last fall that the company was killing off plans to build its own car, and clues about its program to develop a self-driving system popped up since. Today, though, we have more concrete information, as the California DMV has issued Apple a permit to test self-driving cars in the state, as TechCrunch reports. In a document released by the DMV, the tech company joins a number of others in California with approval to test autonomous vehicles. Apple will test its systems on three cars, each a 2015 Lexus RX540h, with six approved drivers. Presumably, those cars will be on the road quite a bit, as gathering lots of data is crucial to developing a working system. Per California rules, the company will have to provide accident reports, as well as a log of every instance that a human driver has to take over driving duties from the autonomous system in what the DMV calls a "disengagement report." Those reports will be made public, so we'll be able to glean a little more information about Apple's progress once they're available.

Toshiba is battling to survive in the face of £4.2bn losses, the bankruptcy of its nuclear business Westinghouse and a crisis of investor confidence. Rivals are now circling the company’s semiconductor business, which makes millions of memory chips a year and has a price tag of up to £22bn. Apple looking to buy part of Toshiba's chip business Sources say Apple is considering a joint approach with its Taiwanese supplier Foxconn, in a move which would see the US iPhone maker invest several billions of pounds. It is thought Toshiba would retain a stake. Others interested include American chip-maker Broadcom, South Korean chip-maker SK Hynix and America’s Western Digital. Japanese tech firm Softbank is also watching. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next When will interest rates move? Inflation respite forecast to...

Zeman   @phonescooper Belkin's ridiculously-named dongle does one thing: it lets you simultaneously charge your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and listen to music. If you want to rock out and power up at the same time, Belkin's Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar makes it possible. AD       article continues below... Background Apple introduced a lot of headaches for people when it dropped the industry standard 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Lightning-based digital audio with the iPhone 7. Without the headphone jack, people can't use standard wired headphones without an adapter. Apple gave everyone just such an adapter in the box for free, but it's a hassle to use and easy to lose. Even if you manage to keep track of the dongle, using it conjures up a new problem for iPhone owners: you can't listen to music using wired headphones via the Lightning port and charge your phone at the same time. Every iPhone since 2007 has allowed people to plug in headphones and the charging cable. Not so the iPhone 7. The Lightning port now handles charging, data sync, and audio output. People who rely on wired headphones, or other 3.5mm wired accessories, are left in a bit of a bind. They must choose to either listen to music, or charge their device — the iPhone 7 doesn't facilitate both at the same time. This situation is particularly frustrating when driving. If you want both power and music, the Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar is here to help. Hardware Belkin's dongle is basically a Lightning splitter, giving your phone two Lightning ports. Plug the male connector into your iPhone 7 and you can then attach two Lightning cables into the dongle below. Use one for power, and the other for Apple's Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter (or Apple Lightning headphones). The male portion of the dongle is sturdy and reinforced where it meets the cable. I like this. Too many Lightning cables are flimsy. It may be too chunky for some cases, but it worked with several cases I have on hand. The cable itself is a bit stiff and only about three inches long. Belkin reinforced the cable where it joins the lower module to protect it. The dual-Lightning module is a solid piece of white plastic. It's 1 inch tall, 1.4 inches wide, and 0.35 inches (9mm) thick. It's a sturdy dongle that does exactly what it should. Dongle   Performance The Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar has some interesting limitations. First, it works with the Apple-made 3.5mm adapter and the Apple-made Lightning headphones. It supports the remote control functions and microphone of the Lightning Audio headphones for music and calls. It's compatible with the iPhone and iPad, and even supports the Apple iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case. The RockStar only supports Lightning Audio and Lightning power transfer: it does not support syncing or any other USB data transfer. You can't daisy chain it with your Mac to sync files. w/Headphones   On the music side of the equation, the RockStar supports up to 48 kHz, 24-bit audio output. That's good. There are lots of variables at play here, so your actual mileage in terms of playback quality will vary. In the simplest terms, the RockStar let me connect my iPhone 7 to the wired headphones of my choice and the 3.5mm auxiliary input of my car to play music. Music passed through the RockStar sounded great through my best wired headphones and the high-end music system in my car. I couldn't discern any appreciable difference in music quality when using the RockStar dongle with the iPhone or using just the Apple 3.5mm Lightning adapter. As for power, the RockStar supports 12W pass-through from whatever source is on hand. It can handle the maximum charging speed available to the iPhone, but your actual results will be dependent on what you plug it into. In the Car   I found a few niggles. I tested the RockStar over the course of about a month. The dongle worked perfectly for the first few weeks. Then, Apple released iOS 10.3 and music functionality dropped completely. Thankfully, iOS 10.3.1 brought music functionality back. In the interim, the RockStar was effectively dead. It's worrisome to me that a routine system update from Apple may kill the functionality of such an accessory. Near the end of my review period, I noticed that jostling the cable a bit could sometimes freeze music playback. Unplugging and re-plugging wasn't enough to fix it. I had to unplug the dongle, close the music app, plug the dongle back in, and restart the music app. This is super annoying. More to the point, this is a distracting and dangerous dance to perform in a moving car. When you consider how frequently things bounce around inside a car, the potential for this disconnect to occur is high and I ran into it often enough to bum me out. I didn't really run into this issue if the iPhone-dongle-headphone array was resting on a desk or table. Discussion The Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar dongle is a middling solution to an annoying problem. This is all Apple's fault, as far as I am concerned, for taking away the 3.5mm headset jack from its iPhones. (To be fair, some Android phones, such as the Moto Z Droid, have also dropped 3.5mm headset jacks in favor of USB-C audio.) Belkin conjured up the RockStar to solve a headache faced by people who prefer wired headphones or make use of wired accessories, such as speakers or the 3.5mm auxiliary input found in older cars. The RockStar dongle costs $40. It works, but inconsistently. The dongle lets you charge your iPhone while also listening to music via the Lightning port and nothing more. I wish it weren't prone to software breakage and annoying drop-outs. These are near deal breakers.

Apple Prepping To Test Its Self-Driving Cars On Public Roads Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Prepping To Test Its Self-Driving Cars On Public Roads Image courtesy of dlayphoto.com April 14, 2017 3:26 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk apple autonomous driving technology autonomous vehicles california driverless cars look ma no hands Despite major staffing shakeups in its autonomous driving project last year, Apple is reportedly gearing up to unleash cars equipped with its driverless technology on California’s public streets. The California Department of Motor Vehicles’ newly-updated list of carmakers and tech companies that are approved to test autonomous vehicles in the state now includes Apple. Sources close to the matter tell Bloomberg that Apple’s Project Titan team will soon start testing self-driving software on public roads in California. Because the company hasn’t built the electric car it originally wanted to, the tech will be tested in existing cars. Specifically, the permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX540h SUVs, and six drivers. As required by the state, the vehicles will each have a person behind the wheel to monitor the trips, just like the humans employed by Google’s Waymo and Uber in testing. And once Apple does start testing, it will have to file Disengagement Reports that detail how many miles driverless vehicles have traveled as part of the state’s Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program. Reports for 2017 won’t be due until January 1, 2018, however. (You can access all companies’ 2016 reports here) Apple declined to comment on the report but referred to a statement the company made last year after it wrote a letter [PDF] to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the agency’s proposed policy for driverless vehicles. In that letter, Apple said it felt “new entrants” into testing on public roads “should be treated equally.” “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said in December.

In January, Toshiba officially announced it would seek to sell a portion of its flash memory business, including the SSD business of the Storage & Electronic Device Solutions Division, to a not-yet-named buyer. [ Further reading: Face-to-face without frustration: The HP Elite Slice for Meeting Rooms ] The Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba may sell a 20 per cent stake in the memory business for between $1.77 billion and $2.65 billion, "while retaining a majority stake and keeping the new company in group earnings." Toshiba Based on a vertical stacking or 3D technology that Toshiba calls BiCS (Bit Cost Scaling), the company's NAND flash memory stores three bits of data per transistor, meaning it's a multi-level cell (MLC) flash chip. It can store 512Gbits (64GB) per chip. Toshiba's solvency and fundraising ability are presently in doubt because of a $1.9 billion accounting scandal and a huge loss related to the purchase of a U.S. nuclear plant business. The company, which invented NAND flash in the early 1980s, had been considering spinning off its semiconductor operations and selling a partial stake to Western Digital (WD) and others, as it tries to cope with a massive impairment loss in its U.S. nuclear power unit. Neither Toshiba nor WD have confirmed a potential sale, however. Earlier this year, Toshiba took a writedown of $6.56 billion against its struggling U.S. nuclear equipment operations and it's hoping to rebound from that loss with a sale. "Its financial problems were a major drag on the growth of its memory business," Sean Yang, research director of DRAMeXchange, said in an earlier interview. Several potential buyers have been identified in reports, including Apple, according to Bloomberg's news service. Apple is considering investing several billion in Toshiba's memory business, according to the report. "It seems like they are selling the Golden Goose and keeping the money pit," said Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective-Analysis, referring to Toshiba. If Apple were to purchase a stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business, it would be a departure for a company that has historically outsourced most of its parts and labor, Handy said. "Seagate and Western Digital used to believe that vertical integration was necessary in order to compete in the SSD market, although Seagate appears to have changed its tune," Handy said. "A captive source of supply is a good thing to have during a shortage, but can be a millstone during an oversupply." Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to Apple, reportedly said it was not participating in talks after reviewing a possible deal "with interest." According to one report, Western Digital (WD) is none too happy about Toshiba's plans to sell its memory business. WD reportedly sent a letter to Toshiba telling it the proposed sale breaches a joint-venture agreement as part of the FlashAlliance to build flash fabrication plants in Japan, which are operated by Toshiba. WD's SanDisk holds a 49.9 per cent share in the FlashAlliance and a Toshiba has a 50.1 per cent share. Any potential sale by Toshiba might be on hold for now as it deals with WD's concerns. If Toshiba does sell a major stake in its memory business -- or the entire unit -- it would do little to effect the memory market as a whole from the perspective of supply and demand, according to Handy. "From the perspective of national security there are significant concerns that Japan will lose control of an important technology, and that it will be owned by a company from a country that has a difficult history with Japan," Handy said, referring to China and Foxxcon. "From WD's perspective it's really strange, since they have a very good working relationship and understanding with Toshiba, but not necessarily with the buyer. "I like to think of it as your spouse coming in and saying: 'Here's somebody new for you to be married to!' then walking off."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Foxconn's Chairman Reportedly Seeks Out SoftBank's Assistance in Bid to Acquire Toshiba | Main April 14, 2017 California DMV Lists Apple as one of 30 Permitted to Conduct Autonomous Car Road Tests   In September 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "A Mysterious Meeting between Apple and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) took Place Last Month." At the time the report noted that California's DMV was developing regulations for the eventual deployment and public operation of autonomous vehicles. Those rules would establish requirements that manufacturers would have to meet to certify that their driverless vehicles had been successfully tested, meet safety criteria, and be ready for consumers to operate on public roads. Business Insider notes in a report today that the DMV has confirmed that Apple had been granted a permit to test self-driving cars in California. The official list of those on the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program are noted below.   The DMV notes that the list shows the order the permits were issued, with Apple being last. However, the DMV doesn't list the actual date Apple received their permits.   Without knowing the date of Apple's issued permit, we're unable to tell if this is old news. Patently Apple posted a report last September titled "Apple Refocuses Project Titan towards Advanced System Software and away from a Dreamy iCar." Reportedly Apple's Bob Mansfield was taking Project Titan in a new direction, focusing on the softare and/or OS to power autonomous vehicles.   So while today's revelation is interesting, it still doesn't answer any relevant questions about Project Titan's current status or exact nature. Naturally Apple will keep the Project Titan as secretive as possible until it's ready for public consumption.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple is considering a range of options from partnering with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to joining with Japanese investors on a bid, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private.  SoftBank Group Corp. is considering getting involved in the Toshiba chip unit bidding and may cooperate with Hon Hai or Apple, the people said. Apple’s entry into the auction may improve Toshiba’s prospects for emerging from a fiasco in its Westinghouse nuclear business that has led to billions of dollars in losses. Toshiba needs to raise money from the semiconductor sale to plug the hole in its balance sheet, but the bidding process so far has been rocky. The Tokyo-based company is wary of Hon Hai’s bid to take full control of the chips unit on its own because it anticipates Japanese and U.S. governments would object. Mitsuhiro Kurano, a spokesman for SoftBank, declined to comment. Representatives for Apple in Japan didn’t respond to calls for comment. Toshiba’s Slide Into Obscurity Should Worry Shareholders: Gadfly The iPhone maker’s move caps a hectic week for Toshiba. First, the 142-year-old electronics conglomerate  warned it may not be able to continue as a going concern because of the Westinghouse losses. Then, amid signs of progress in the company’s efforts to sell its semiconductor unit, joint-venture partner Western Digital Corp. notified Toshiba such a sale may violate their contract. “How do you even judge what happened this week for Toshiba?” said Kazunori Ito, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Services. “One positive is that the company showed third-quarter profits in the memory business, giving some assurance it may sell it for a good price. But there are so many negatives, I don’t even know where to begin.” Toshiba’s memory chips are used in smartphones, personal computers and data centers, putting them at the heart of a shift away from hard drives. The semiconductor unit, which reported this week healthy profit growth in the memory unit, has fetched proposed prices of 2 trillion to 3 trillion yen, with Hon Hai, Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. and chipmaker Broadcom Ltd. emerging as the most aggressive bidders. The twists and turns won’t go away anytime soon. Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit, which is behind a 716.6 billion yen impairment at the center of the imbroglio, is mired in lawsuits and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Toshiba’s Fight for Survival After Nuclear Collapse: Timeline On Tuesday, Toshiba took the unusual step of reporting third-quarter earnings without approval from its auditors. Toshiba said losses last year had left it with negative shareholders equity of 225.6 billion yen at the end of December. Toshiba has been at odds with PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata over accounting at Westinghouse, where the billions of dollars in losses stem from cost overruns on nuclear construction projects. This further jeopardized Toshiba’s listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The TSE kept Toshiba on its list of securities on alert in a December announcement, after originally being included for overstating profits from 2008 through 2014. Toshiba last month submitted a report detailing plans to improve internal controls. If deemed insufficient, the company will face delisting. Then in the middle of the week, news emerged that Steve Milligan, Western Digital’s chief executive officer, warned a sale may violate a joint venture it has with Toshiba. He wrote a letter to Toshiba’s board on April 9 advising them that they should negotiate exclusively with his company before any sale and that the proposed offers were more than the fair and supportable value of the chip business, according to a person familiar with the process. Toshiba shares fell as much as 8.1 percent in Tokyo on Friday, but pared losses after NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster, reported on Apple’s plans. The stock fell 5.4 percent to 198.7 yen in Tokyo, leaving it down 30 percent this year. Apple has not made a definitive decision about what role it will play in the chips sale, if any, the people said. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has an interest in the unit’s future because iPhones and iPads use flash-memory. Apple could take a minority stake in the chip business with Japanese finance firms, as well as working with Hon Hai or SoftBank, the people said. It’s not clear whether SoftBank is weighing an investment in the Toshiba chips unit or another role, the people said. The Tokyo-based company is in the process of raising a $100 billion fund and has yet to close the initial investment round. “The share price right now is a pretty reasonable assessment of what Toshiba is worth without the flash memory business, assuming there is no delisting or bankruptcy,” Morningstar’s Ito said.

"Today, April 14, 2017, California Department of Motor Vehicles issued Apple Inc. an autonomous vehicle test permit. The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers," a DMV spokeswoman told Business Insider. Apple joins 29 other companies who are allowed to test self driving vehicles in the state including Google and Tesla. The self-driving car platform is designed so that Apple could choose to open it up to existing carmakers or eventually port it to an Apple-designed vehicle, says Bloomberg. The company is said to have shifted to a stronger focus on self-driving technology after Bob Mansfield was put in charge of its car efforts. Apple is said to have dozens of engineers working on a car OS in Canada, and will reportedly decide on a final direction for its vehicle endeavors by fall of this year.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (13) Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency by Adam C. Engst In an unprecedented move, Apple invited five prominent industry journalists to an on-the-record meeting with top executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus (VP of Hardware Engineering). The writers included John Gruber of Daring Fireball, Matthew Panzarino of TechCrunch, Lance Ulanoff of Mashable, Ina Fried of Axios, and John Paczkowski of BuzzFeed. The topic of discussion? The Mac Pro, why it has taken Apple so long to update it, and Apple’s commitment to the professional market. I’ll say more about that in a moment, but first, let me recommend that you read at least the first two of the articles linked above — Panzarino and Gruber, in particular, did an excellent job of capturing both what was said and the implications of those statements. In short, Apple did something it has never done before — assemble a panel of reporters for an on-the-record talk in which it acknowledged design errors and missteps with the current Mac Pro, pre-announced a new Mac Pro accompanied by a new pro display that won’t ship this year, and admitted that it needs to communicate better with its pro users. No, this wasn’t an April Fools prank. In essence, this is Apple arguing with my claims in “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac” (21 November 2016) that the iOS platform reigns supreme within the company and conceding the point Josh Centers made about the slippery slope of losing pro customers in “What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk” (6 February 2017). To show how important the Mac remains to Apple, Phil Schiller said that the Mac user base is nearing 100 million users and is a $25 billion business — on its own, it’s nearly a Fortune 100 company. (Also interesting was the statistic that notebooks make up 80 percent of Mac sales, with desktops at 20 percent. It’s not surprising, given the stagnation of the Mac Pro and the Mac mini.) The Apple execs also came right out and said that the Mac and the pro audience were key. Schiller said, “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple, that Apple cares deeply about the Mac, we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac. And if we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that, we’re sorry for that — what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” Craig Federighi chimed in, saying “The Mac is — we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it.” But the entire point of this meeting was to address the pro reaction to Apple’s lack of either concrete actions or announcements in the past. Gruber asked whether Apple is aware of just how many serious Mac users have begun to doubt the company’s commitment to the Mac in general, and the needs of professional Mac users in particular, eliciting this response from Schiller: It’s a reasonable question, and this is why we’re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We’re committed to the Mac, we’ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we’ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers. At the moment, Apple has only words to reassure pro users, since the executives said that a completely redesigned Mac Pro and pro display are coming, but they won’t arrive this year. So communication is essential if pros are to stick with the Mac platform for another eight months minimum. But openness isn’t Apple’s style, so we’ll see if the company continues to share details about the future. Apple should be heartened to see that the community seems to be taking this increased commitment to transparency as a positive sign. In our informal Twitter poll, 75 percent of respondents said that it’s good news and isn’t too little, too late. (Next time we’ll run the poll longer, so more people have a chance to vote.) Other useful statements that came out of the meeting include: Existing configurations of the current Mac Pro are now available at lower prices (see “Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000,” 4 April 2017). The redesigned Mac Pro will not include a touchscreen like Microsoft’s Surface Studio. Federighi suggested that Apple’s approach will involve making the iPad Pro work better with the Mac. The iMac is slated to receive some upgrades this year, including configurations targeted specifically at the pro market. Apple had nothing specific to say about the future of the Mac mini, though Schiller did say that was because “it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use.” When Gruber asked about scripting and automation, Federighi replied, “We think scriptability and automation of the system remain super important.”   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

In an effort to repair its relationship with professional users, Apple took the unprecedented step of inviting a handful of prominent journalists for an on-the-record talk. In it, the company acknowledged design errors with the Mac Pro, promised a redesigned Mac Pro and accompanying pro display, and said it was trying to communicate better with pro users.

I can add boatloads of RAM and I have a larger RAID array attached to the thunderbolt 2 bus. I write software for a living and live inside virtual machines all day. This computer is perfect for that use case. So while the design is clearly flawed for future updates, it isn't flawed in conception in my view. I am happy to learn that just about when my 2013 Mac Pro starts feeling a little old and slow, I will be able to upgrade to whatever is next but right now it does everything I need and more. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 15:37 The Apple guys said basically what you just did — that the current Mac Pro was great for some professionals, but that the design wasn't ideal for all pros. Reply Geoff Duncan   2017-04-04 21:16 I'm glad the cylindrical Mac Pro has been useful to some people, James! I do a lot of work in pro audio and a bit of multi-platform software development. I can count the number of cylindical Mac Pros I've seen in the wild on the thumbs of one hand. I see old Mac Pro towers in use all the time. I'm glad Apple said *something* about the state of desktop Macs and is trying to reach out to pro users. As someone for whom iMacs and MacBook Pros don't really work, I can't say I'm excited, though. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-04-06 13:54 The 2013 MacPro would have been my ideal machine had it had better GPUs. I know those GPUs are pretty good for things like Final Cut, but they are not that great for GPU intensive tasks like folding and gaming (which is what I mostly use GPUs for, and a little video encoding). As it stands now, I am waiting for the new iMac (iMac Pro?) and will buy that. My days of needing a Mac Pro are behind me (though not my days of *WANTING* a Mac Pro 😜😝) Reply Anonymous   2017-04-06 16:16 Isn't that driven by folks investment in specialized PCI based hardware? If one has $5k-10K invested in one of those setups then it's understandable to milk 10 years out of it. I think it's also reasonable for Apple for to move on and not maintain backward compatibility with specialized hardware after that many years. The ThunderBolt bus is just as fast and far more modular. It would allow one to switch out the underlying computer more frequently. Reply Geoff Duncan   2017-04-06 21:08 Yes, it's true that for a lot of audio and video pros, their Macs are essentially peripherals connected to their studio gear. Most of those setups use PCI cards. A thunderbolt chassis for PCI cards *can* work with some of those setups, as can Thunderbolt breakout boxes. The question for many pros is whether they want to go to the expense of getting those systems set up with a cylindrical Mac Pro (since that often means upgrading or replacing their external hardware as well), or just to migrate to an already-compatible and far less expensive PC. I think that's why the only cylindrical Mac Pro I've seen in the wild was in a studio facility built from scratch: everything ther was new, no legacy digital hardware at all. Reply Greg  2017-04-04 20:50 What about Pro apps? Aperture? FCP? Although from what I hear they've already lost the video/film editing business. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-05 10:45 Nothing was said about Aperture ("It's dead, Jim.") but Apple did talk about Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X. My understanding is that FCPX has gotten better over the years and may be more or less back to where FCP was before, but many people already switched. Reply Jon Hall  2017-04-06 17:19 A very welcome admission of a misstep with the MacPro. Will Apple please go the whole hog and resurrect Aperture? I know there are other options, but they're not palatable to me. Reply robtbass   2017-04-10 20:44 "We’re sorry for . . . what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” I have to say that that statement sounds uncomfortably like Donald Trump on the Affordable Care Act. Reply peter lees  2017-04-10 22:35 I wonder if they'll have similar regrets about the 2016 macbook pro? such a disappointment & has stopped me from upgrading... Reply Benjamin Lowengard  2017-04-11 07:31 Not so sure to tag this as GREAT news- but it is news. Thing is I still have Pro Users buying old Cheese Graters because Trash Cans make them invest so much more in new peripherals. Mac Mini, Mac Mini Mac Mini. I was ready to buy a new Mac Mini when the last version came out but it was so lacking that I bought a 2011 iMac instead. I think the Pro laptops are nice but so un-upgradeable -that that's because a cause of concern. I still think Apple could drop the Pro down another 500$, and if they go to 5 USB3 on the next iMac I might scream. BTW, I love my 2011 iMac and I have not maxed out upgrades to it yet! Reply Bruce  2017-04-14 06:50 I sold my 2009 Mac Pro that was totally kitted out with 48 gigs of RAM, SSD boot, excellent graphics cards - so I could buy a 27" iMac that was supposed to be a screamer. It was not. I've regretted it from day one. I now have a desk full of goodies that used to be inside the Mac Pro. I came close to buying a refitted 2010 MacPro this past weekend. Updated with super fast cards and SSD's. Apple seems to forgot that form without function is worthless to working creative professionals. I burn Blu-Ray back-ups of video and still files - along with backing up to hard drives. I could never back-up my files via the cloud. The original cheese-grater Mac was perfect - loads of space, load of OPTIONS and the it worked. My desk, with my 27" iMac looks like an OWC ad with all the extras drives and connectors. If Apple made a new "cheese grater" that actually worked, I would buy it in a heartbeat. If not, I'll switch to a BOXX computer and run Windows.

In an effort to repair its relationship with professional users, Apple took the unprecedented step of inviting a handful of prominent journalists for an on-the-record talk. In it, the company acknowledged design errors with the Mac Pro, promised a redesigned Mac Pro and accompanying pro display, and said it was trying to communicate better with pro users.

The escaped pony, named Apple, fell into the muddy bog in Beckton on Thursday. Her owners tried to pull her from the ditch, off Jenkins Lane, but were forced to call 999 when the five-months pregnant horse began to struggle. London Fire Brigade crew members used harnesses and brute strength to pull the horse from the mud in the early hours of the morning. Dramatic rescue: Fire crews pulled a horse from a ditch in Beckton (LFB) Watch manager Emma Carr, from Bethnal Green fire station, said: “It was a difficult job for crews. Apple was stuck in the water and mud with, at times, just her head above it. Cleaned up: Apple was rescued by fire crews (LFB) “Due to the location she was in, it was difficult for crews to reach her so we had to use strops, mud paths and our physical strength to pull her out as you couldn’t have got any machinery down to where Apple was.” She added: “If you notice an animal in distress, the first thing to do should be to call the RSPCA if you see an animal in difficulty.

X Apple gets go-ahead to test self-driving cars in California Tech giant to trial autonomous vehicles as driverless transportation race heats up about 12 hours ago Tim Bradshaw Apple’s automotive research project has been under way for more than two years, but it is unclear how soon any product will emerge         Apple has been granted a licence to test autonomous vehicles in California, marking the public launch of its race with Uber, Alphabet and Tesla to define the future of driverless transportation. The permit was revealed with Apple’s appearance on a list of approved companies on the state automotive regulator’s website yesterday. Apple’s automotive research project has been under way for more than two years, but it is unclear how soon any product will emerge. Last year the group abandoned efforts to build an electric vehicle and refocused on the systems that underpin self-driving cars, according to people familiar with the situation. Apple faces a challenge in maintaining its usual levels of secrecy as it enters more highly regulated markets such as transportation and healthcare. For several months after discussions with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) were reported in September 2015, vehicles equipped with cameras and sensors were spotted close to Apple’s Cupertino headquarters. Crowded Silicon Valley’s self-driving sector is starting to look crowded, although no full commercial service has been deployed on US roads. Apple is the 30th group to receive a permit in California, alongside carmakers Ford, Volkswagen and General Motors, suppliers including Delphi and Bosch and start-ups such as Zoox, Drive.ai and Plus.ai. The state DMV said Apple had been licensed to test three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h models, with six drivers. Tesla and GM have more than 20 autonomous testing vehicles on California’s roads. Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving division, has several dozen. Apple provided no new comment on its autonomous driving programme, but referred to a statement in December when it acknowledged plans to develop self-driving cars with a letter to the highways regulator. Last month the California DMV said it would ease some restrictions on testing self-driving vehicles, potentially paving the way for the public use of robot cars as early as next year. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Department Of Motor Alphabet Apple Bosch Delphi General Motors Volkswagen AG Waymo California Cupertino San Francisco(US) United States  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Motors Apple gets go-ahead to test self-driving cars in California Motors Toyota’s FT-4X concept harks back to the classic Land Cruiser Motors Seat starts its latest offensive with a sporty new Ibiza Motors Kia’s new Picanto wins big in the little league Sponsored Ten thrifty tips to brighten up your home Let a Hume PhD scholarship unlock your potential at Maynooth University Broadband and digital technology essential for Irish business growth Lifting the diamond to a higher level Videos 5:54 Our Test Drive: the Peugeot 3008 4:59 Our Test Drive: the Mercedes-Benz E220d Estate 5:31 Our Test Drive: the Audi Q5 7:00 Our Test Drive: the Peugeot 5008 4:32 Our Test Drive: the Hyundai i30 Top 100 The best cars to buy in 2017: We count down from 100 to 1   Paris motor show 2016   Gallery Geneva motor show 2016 Geneva car show - Part II Geneva car show 2016 - Part III Most Read in Life & Style 1 Chicago Joe, the illiterate Irishwoman who became Montana’s great madam 2 ‘Ford is a Cork company; it just has a very large American branch to it’ 3 Eimear McBride in the West Bank: ‘All that is human in me recoils from this’ 4 ‘My husband is sexting other women and I am devastated’ 5 ‘Ronan, I’m still terrified of you being sucked into that world of guns, drugs . . . non-rugby nicknames’ 6 Good Friday: Why are so many of us still Catholic? 7 Big little home in the city for €525,000 8 The Limerick nurse who was nanny to children of the last tsar 9 We need more, and nicer, apartments to rent 10 Review: A secret vegan restaurant for real food lovers Never miss a story.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) AP The iPhone of cars? Apple enters self-driving car race By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer Apr 14, 2017 Updated 48 min ago Tony Gutierrez FILE - This Thursday, Sept. 19, 2013, file photo shows the Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles Friday, April 14, 2017, and disclosed that information on its website. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE ... IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. " Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan." Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | Apr 14, 2017 12:50 PM PT Credit: Apple More like this Uber ships self-driving cars to Arizona after San Francisco spat After legal scuffle, Uber gets permit to test self-driving cars in California Uber relents, suspends self-driving car tests in San Francisco Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips It seems like Apple has not yet hit the brakes on its self-driving car. As of Friday, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles now lists Apple as one of the companies with a permit to legally test self-driving cars in the state. This means that Apple’s self-driving initiative, codenamed Project Titan, is back on track. California requires all companies with autonomous vehicles to register before hitting the road. Other tech companies like Google and Uber, alongside car manufacturers like Tesla and BMW, have also received permits to test their self-driving technology on public roads. Uber’s permit was recently secured in March, but the company had been conducting rogue trials for a while. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple’s permit covers three 2015 Lexus SUVs and six different drivers who must sit behind the wheel to monitor the driving and takeover when needed. In addition to the permit, the state of California also requires companies to file public reports about their self-driving tests, including crash reports and how many times the human driver has had to take over. This could send Apple for a loop, as the company is notorious for keeping all of their testing info a secret prior to launching new products. Why this matters: This is the first indication we’ve seen in a while that Apple’s super-secret Project Titan is still in the pipeline. Previously, there was an insane amount of speculation about Apple’s self-driving car project. In 2015 alone, Apple filed permits to build a “auto work area” near Cupertino, leased a super-secret testing facility, and met with the California DMV.  In 2016, however, Apple seemed to have pivoted the initiative, opting for creating just the self-driving software to license to established car-makers instead of assembling an entirely new Apple vehicle. This is a departure for Apple, which has created a legacy by developing both hardware and the software aspects of all its products. Now that Apple will have to file public reports regarding its self-driving trials, expect more information to become available about Project Titan.

It has long been known that Apple is working on automotive-related projects, but the company has never publicly confirmed any details. The news was made public by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles on Friday. The agency said Apple has been given permission to test three cars manufactured by Lexus. Apple has not commented - other than to point to its letter late last year expressing an interest in the technology. The company was "excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”, it said at the time. Rumours about Apple’s car ambitions have ranged from speculation it was building its own car to the suggestion it was instead focusing more on in-car software. Internally known as Project Titan, the project at one point was understood to have more than 1,000 employees working on it, though the current scale of Apple’s efforts is unknown. Encountering self-driving cars in California is a daily occurrence for those living around Silicon Valley. Apple has become the 30th company to be granted a testing permit. Among the stipulations for approval is the requirement to regularly report back statistics on the performance of the technology - including how often humans have to intervene when the computer gets it wrong. Apple's competitors have already been testing autonomous vehicles. Last year Waymo - a company spun out of Google's self-driving programme - clocked up 635,868 miles in California. Statistics showed a human had to step in on average once every 5,000 miles of driving. ________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 View comments Related Topics Apple Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn More on this story Uber: We did not steal Google's self-driving tech 7 April 2017 More from Dave More Technology stories Top Stories North Korea 'ready for nuclear attack' The warning to the US came during an elaborate display of military force in the country's capital. 15 April 2017 IS death toll from Afghan bomb reaches 90 15 April 2017 Learner drivers to face sat nav test 15 April 2017 News navigation Sections Home UK UK Home England N.

Live Watch Apple receives permit to test self-driving cars in California By JULIA JACOBO Close Follow on Twitter More from Julia Apr 14, 2017, 3:54 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayStephan Lam/Reuters WATCH Apple reportedly developing non-invasive sugar monitoring for diabetics 0 Shares Email The California Department of Motor Vehicles has granted Apple a permit allowing it to begin testing self-driving cars on public roads. The DMV updated its list of manufacturers testing self-driving cars on Friday, with Apple becoming the 30th company to be granted permission. Few details have been revealed about Apple's plans for self-driving cars, according to Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs. But she said Apple could be a "major player" in the autonomous vehicle industry. The permit will cover three types of vehicles -- all 2015 Lexus RX540h models --and six individual drivers, the California DMV said in a statement to ABC News. Apple has never publicly acknowledged its self-driving car program. A company spokesman would not provide additional details about the efforts to ABC News. Household names like Google, Tesla and Ford are also on the California DMV's list. Volkswagen Group of America was the first company to be granted a permit. What you need to know about the types of 'self-driving' cars Uber rolls out autonomous car technology in Pittsburgh All eyes on Tesla as it faces its biggest hurdle yet In December, Apple said that it is investing heavily in "machine learning and autonomous systems" in a statement to federal regulators after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public an Apple letter giving input on autonomous car regulations. Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test self-driving cars to submit an annual report "summarizing the disengagements of the technology during testing," according to the DMV. The state of California also requires that a human be behind the wheel of autonomous vehicles during testing. "We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple said at the time. California regulations for the technology became effective in September 2014.

The tremors knocked out production at plants that produce image sensors, the chips that convert light particles into bits and make digital pictures and videos possible. To lead its recovery, the company turned to 33-year veteran engineer Hiromi Suzuki, who crisscrossed the country to secure parts needed to get its Kumamoto factory back online. A year on from the temblor and Sony is taking sensors into augmented reality, self-driving cars, factory robots and drones as more machines begin using the chips to see the world around them. With control of about half the market, and customers including Apple, Google and Nikon Corp., it’s building on technology pioneered in the 1980s with the Handycam. “Rather than creating something for humans to look at, image sensors will be used more by machines to take in information,” said Suzuki, 58, the holder of several patents on the technology. “Whether it is Internet of Things, cars or automation in factories, the ability to interpret images is going to be a crucial feature. This will drive growth.” Suzuki’s team managed to get Kumamoto back up a month ahead of schedule, helping Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai shave $540 million from expected operating losses and, more importantly, allowing Sony to maintain market share. Macquarie Group Ltd. expects sensors to generate 17 percent of operating profit by 2019. “The idea that all of us will be surrounded by image sensors and using them in novel and interesting ways is part of what Sony is trying to build toward,” said Damian Thong, a Macquarie analyst. “They handled the earthquake recovery well, even to the extent of sacrificing their own camera businesses to protect customers.” The Kumamoto plant was hit by hundreds of quakes over three days starting on April 14 last year. The biggest measured 7.3 on the Richter scale, damaging the factory’s core structure, ruining specialized equipment like diffusion furnaces and smashing thousands of wafers sitting in clean rooms.   Suzuki’s team managed to cut the recovery period from four months down to three, but he’s confident it can be shortened to less than two for quakes of similar magnitude. That’s a critical improvement in a country that sits on the densest seismic network in the world, according to the US Geological Survey. After restoring Kumamoto, Sony is positioning the business to capture even more than the 49 percent market share it is estimated to hold by Techno Systems Research. Dual cameras, already used in the iPhone 7 Plus and Huawei P9, are becoming a key feature for mobile devices and use multiple sensors to simulate the "bokeh" effect which blurs the background to give pictures a glossy, professional look. “As dual cameras increase, so will demand for more image sensors,” said Tetsuo Omori, an analyst at Techno Systems, which expects the market to grow by a third to $12.7 billion by 2020. “The question is how Sony handles capital investment. The plants are already running at full-capacity. Building a new one is probably out of the question, so what’s the plan to squeeze more out of the existing ones.” Beyond just increasing the number of cameras per phone, Sony’s new innovation is embedding memory inside image sensors, a design it unveiled in February. That captures more light, which reduces motion blur and allows for ultra-slow motion videos that capture up to 1,000 frames per second. “We’ve barely scraped what you can do with cameras in your phone,” said Macquarie’s Thong. He says the recently-unveiled chips will make it possible to take hundreds of shots, then automatically feed them through software that churns out the single best photo possible. “This capability is going to be invisible to you, but the idea is that you’ll never have a shot that’s wasted. I think you’ll see that people will be willing to pay for that.” Sony’s technology is already used in high-end car dashboards, where sensors track hand gestures to control music or GPS navigation. Thong also expects image sensors to play a key role in augmented reality, which Apple is said to be considering as a central feature for this year’s iPhone 8, Bloomberg reported last month. In 2015, Sony bought a Belgian startup that creates 3D models by using light to measure distances. In smartphones, Lenovo Group Ltd.’s Phab 2 Pro uses similar technology to map a room in 3D and let virtual pets walk around it, or let interior designers plan room layouts with virtual furniture. Suzuki is equally excited about the role image sensors could play in self-driving cars, where Sony has partnered with Denso Corp., the largest supplier to Toyota Motor Corp. Capturing images even at night while moving at high-speed relies on technology rooted in Suzuki’s work from the 1980s. “We have a 40-year history in building this technology up, bit by bit,” said Suzuki. “That’s what keeps us ahead of everyone else.” Read More On Iphone8 | Sony | Sony Image Sensor | Apple | Apple Iphone | Iphones | Technology | Latest Tech News | Mobiles & Tablets PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Sony dominating sensors, most innovative chips in iPhone8 Sony's target for earthquake recovery narrowed to 2 months Sony's target for earthquake recovery narrowed to 2 months The earthquakes that jolted Japan’s southwest island of Kyushu a year ago killed dozens, left tens of thousands homeless and were a reminder of how much the global supply chain for smartphones and digital cameras depends on Sony Corp.

Photo Credit: Big Apple Circus Facebook Page Gertler: Big Apple Circus proves bankruptcy isn’t all bad By: Commentary April 14, 2017 0 Which is more quintessentially American: a circus or a success story? Historically, we’ve loved both. But things have been a little dark under the big top as of late. Citing declining attendance, the world-famous Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus recently announced its current tour will be its last hurrah. The news sent shockwaves across social media, but to New Yorkers, it might not have been such a surprise. Our own take on the age-old razzle-dazzle, the Big Apple Circus, skipped out on its holiday season show for the first time in decades last year. Having failed to reach even the halfway point in its emergency $2 million fundraising drive, the Brooklyn-based staple filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last fall. Headlines spelled doom for the enterprise, and saddened New Yorkers made ready to bid the big top adieu. But now the circus has a success story all its own. Big Apple is back and it has at least two stories to tell: old-style family entertainment isn’t quite dead yet, and “bankruptcy” isn’t the bad word it’s made out to be. Having secured protection from creditors after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Big Apple’s operators went to work on a plan that could save the circus. The show’s balance book had become a circus-worthy juggling act all its own in the wake of the economic downswing of 2008— only with no safety net and not enough fans in the seats. With $3.8 million in assets and $8.3 million in debt, the nonprofit operation went into a court-ordered auction with bleak prospects but high hopes. Fortunately, a corporate restructuring firm saw some value in the aging act and successfully acquired the Big Apple Circus (including both its physical and intellectual property) for $1.3 million. Thanks to a court stipulation, the auction winner is required to maintain the show’s longstanding performances for low-income and special needs children. Its new owners, Big Top Works (an affiliate of Florida-based Compass Partners), plan to keep the circus running for families throughout the Empire State, sticking with that age-old big-tent tenet: the show must go on. Too often, news media and members of the general public conflate bankruptcy with failure. Indeed, a Chapter 11 filing is often effectively treated like a “going out of business” notice. In reality, though, the opposite is often true. In some instances – it’s a new beginning. Although there are two primary kinds of bankruptcy in U.S. federal law available to a struggling business, only reorganization under Chapter 11 would provide a means of allowing a worthwhile business to work through a temporary financial crunch that might otherwise mean disaster. While Chapter 7 is generally reserved for instances of liquidation, Chapter 11 bankruptcy is simply a process for rehabilitation. When a business like Big Apple Circus files under Chapter 11, it is merely asking the court for assistance and protection while it overcomes and works through obstacles and hurdles. Many of today’s booming businesses, which were destined for demise, are only around because of past Chapter 11 proceedings. With the revitalization of a business comes a preservation of jobs. Hard times are a fact of life for individuals and businesses alike and without federal bankruptcy procedures in place, we’d have an undue impact on culturally important and beneficial business ventures. Big Apple Circus is a compelling case in point. Thanks to the protections in Chapter 11, its bright banners will continue on as part of the fabric that defines New York — returning to the stage for the fall of 2017.   Richard R.

The iPhone maker has disclosed little about its ambitions when it comes to self-driving vehicles, with chief Tim Cook hinting at plans but the company declining to comment for news reports on long-idling rumours. Late last year, Apple revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. Apple issued the letter because it is "investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP at the time. The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars. Most major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020. General Motors this week announced that its autonomous driving efforts, investing US$14 million (S$19 million) and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research centre in San Francisco. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and Michigan, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. Similar research is being carried out by other automakers including Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, and by other groups including Uber and Google parent Alphabet. Continental this week opened a new research center in the heart of Silicon Valley, saying it was dedicated to "mobility innovations and technologies." Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is working on autonomous driving at its California research centre, this week announced the acquisition of xPerception, a US startup that provides visual perception software, along with services and devices for people who are visually impaired.

Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California department of motor vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles – all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs – and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. The road ahead: self-driving cars on the brink of a revolution in California Read more Apple confirmed its arrival in the market, but would not discuss its intentions. The Cupertino, California, company instead pointed to a statement that it issued in December. That comment came after Apple informed federal regulators of its interest in self-driving cars in a letter from Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now the company’s director of product integrity. “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars also are likely to yield a gold mine, another reason that Apple is exploring an expansion beyond its main business of making phones, tablets and personal computers. Although the ongoing popularity of the iPhone has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, it hasn’t been able to invent another breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of its iPad, which is now in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised persistent questions as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of its co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Hell of a ride: even a PR powerhouse couldn't get Uber on track Read more Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2m miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology, but it’s also a company with a history of trailing in markets that it eventually revolutionizes. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, cellphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. With billions in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50bn. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any hint that they are interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the project name “Titan”. Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars: Department of Motor Vehicle Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars: Department of Motor Vehicle Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. By: Reuters | San Francisco | Updated: April 15, 2017 2:30 AM Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. (AP) Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, which allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, President of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former Vice President at Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The permit does not necessarily mean Apple is building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement when the company submitted its comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration late last year. After a five-page letter last November from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to NHTSA, the company was under increased speculation that they would enter into the competitive self-driving space. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. You may also like to watch: At that time Apple said it had provided comments to NHTSA “because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California – all vying to be the first to bring self-driving cars to the masses. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. No Comments.

DMV permit suggests so New permit drives speculation about company’s self-driving car aspirations. Megan Geuss - Apr 14, 2017 7:20 pm UTC Apple wants to get on those California roads. nrg_crisis (off and on) reader comments 35 Share this story On Friday, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) updated its website to reflect that Apple now has a permit to test self-driving cars on public roads. Apple has been hiring automotive experts—particularly those with experience in autonomous driving—for years. (In 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even taunted Apple by saying, “If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.”) But Apple has long kept quiet about its aspirations. That began to change in December, when the company wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration saying that it was “investing heavily” in machine learning to support autonomous systems, especially in transportation. The update on the California DMV website confirms that after years of speculation, Apple is serious about building self-driving car software. Getting an autonomous-car testing permit with the California DMV requires that a company fill out an application to test its technology and take out an insurance policy for any vehicles equipped with it. Companies testing self-driving cars must keep logs of disengagements, or times when the car had to be taken out of self-driving mode for safety or other reasons. California’s relatively strict testing rules haven’t deterred companies from seeking testing permits. Uber was a notable hold-out—it refused to apply for a self-driving permit in December after it launched its self-driving car pilot program. California then revoked the registrations of the company’s cars, so Uber took its test cars to Arizona, where no such registration is required. But a few months later, Uber filed all the appropriate paperwork anyway and is currently permitted to test its technology on California roads. According to Bloomberg, Apple’s California permit “covers three 2015 Lexus RX540h SUVs and six drivers.” Ars contacted Apple for more information, but we have not yet received a response.

Apple has released scant details about its autonomous car efforts, dubbed Project Titan, an effort it hasn't even formally acknowledged. In September, it was reported that Apple had laid off a significant amount of its Project Titan employees, sparking speculation the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant was pivoting from developing an autonomous vehicle to focusing on creating software for the technology. ADVERTISEMENT An Apple spokesperson declined to comment directly on the new permit but pointed to a statement about Apple’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration comments from December. “We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the statement read. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” The NHTSA had sought comment on developing industry standards on self driving cars.   View the discussion thread.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Japanese Public Broadcaster NHK Claims that Apple may be Joining Foxconn's Bid for Toshiba | Main | California DMV Lists Apple as one of 30 Permitted to Conduct Autonomous Car Road Tests » April 14, 2017 Foxconn's Chairman Reportedly Seeks Out SoftBank's Assistance in Bid to Acquire Toshiba   Earlier this morning Patently Apple posted a report titled "Japanese Public Broadcaster NHK Claims that Apple may be Joining Foxconn's Bid for Toshiba." At the end of the report I added: "Should Apple not be a part of the deal, Foxconn could always get needed funding from Japanese partner Softbank via it's technology fund that both Foxconn and Apple have invested in. The connection to Japan's Softbank could be the key to a deal for the Foxconn bid. Remember that Foxconn and Softbank have a joint venture for designing ARM chips and so having Toshiba would be a nice fit for both Foxconn and Softbank" Now the Nikkei is reporting that Foxconn is seeking SoftBank's assistance in their bid for Toshiba's chip unit.   The Nikkei has learned that Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, has asked for help from Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank Group in its bid to acquire Toshiba's memory business.    With SoftBank's backing, Foxconn is preparing to begin negotiations with Japanese banks and related companies over the deal. There is also talk that Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, may partner with Apple for the bid.   When Foxconn acquired Japanese electronics powerhouse Sharp in spring 2016, SoftBank's chairman Masayoshi Son introduced the Foxconn's Terry Gou to Japanese banks. Son's assistance in the Toshiba bid is expected to come in a similar form -- through his assurances rather than money. For more on this, read the Nikkei report here.   In December Patently Apple posted a report titled "Sharp's Terry Gou Deliberately Drops Samsung as a Customer & Sends Samsung into a Panic." At the time the Taiwan press reported that Foxconn had declared war against Samsung. Samsung did in fact panic at Foxconn's decisive move and actually ate crow by  making a deal with arch rival LG to supply them with LCD's that Foxconn denied them.   If Foxconn were to acquire Toshiba it could mean gaining Apple's memory business and delivering another blow to Samsung. Such a scenario would have many in the Apple community applauding Foxconn's Chairman Gou.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Uber had initially started its tests without a permit in December only to have the program shut down by the state’s DMV. Meanwhile, GM said Thursday it plans to invest $14 million and create more than 1,000 jobs in a California facility to advance its self-driving car technology and zero-emissions vehicles. Ford, which has beefed up its presence in Silicon Valley, said last year it could sell a driverless car in five years. Apple reportedly has been working on a driverless car for several years under the code name Project Titan, but has never publicly disclosed the effort despite issuing opinions about regulations for driverless cars. Such efforts have excited some observers who believe Apple needs to add another big-ticket item to continue to grow as its iPhone sales level out. Not everyone believes the company can succeed in the field, however. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available. MarketWatch took a spin in a semiautonomous car to learn more about this emerging technology. Shares of Apple have gained 22% so far this year, which compares with 4% gains for the S&P 500 index.

It could, but with a potential caveat. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 14, 2017 at 1:30PM A while back, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo put out a research note in which he offered some insight into the display technology that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will use in its upcoming premium iPhone 8. As expected, Kuo says that it'll pack an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. What's interesting about this OLED display is that the resolution of the 5.8-inch display is expected to be 2800-by-1242. Using an online pixels per inch calculator, this works out to about 528 pixels per inch. Image source: KGI Securities via MacRumors. By contrast, the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7, with its 1334-by-750 display offers a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, and even the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, with its 1920-by-1080 display, offers a pixel density of "just" 401 pixels per inch. If Kuo's info is good, then the OLED iPhone might offer a substantially sharper display than any iPhone that has come before. There may, however, be a catch. That PenTile thing... In Apple's current liquid crystal displays (LCDs), each pixel is made up of three subpixels -- green, blue, and red (this is known as "RGB stripe"). In Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) current OLED displays (remember: Samsung is expected to be the sole manufacturer of Apple's premium OLED displays this year), the subpixel structure is different. Instead of equally sized red, green, and blue subpixels (as this image from AnandTech shows), the subpixels are in what are referred to as "diamond pixels." These "diamond pixels" (see this image from DisplayMate) essentially make it so that the display has a green subpixel for each pixel but fewer red and blue subpixels than the total number of pixels (though the red and blue subpixels are larger than the green ones). What all this ultimately means is this: The densities of the red and blue subpixels are lower than the density of the green subpixels. Indeed, DisplayMate ran the numbers for the Galaxy S8's display and came up with 403 subpixels for red and blue and 570 subpixels per inch for the green (corresponding to the total number of pixels on the display). If Apple uses an OLED display and a PenTile subpixel arrangement, then the OLED iPhone would be the sharpest display ever from a total pixel perspective, but in terms of red and blue subpixel density, it'd actually be worse off than the display on the current iPhone 7 Plus. Will Apple use a PenTile arrangement? At this point, it's not clear how much the display technology used in the iPhone 8 will differ from that of the Galaxy S8. Based on the rumors/leaks, Apple seems to be very interested in making the OLED iPhone 8 unequivocally "better" than the LCD-based iPhone 7s/7s Plus, so we might see it go with an RGB Stripe subpixel configuration if it can achieve the desired yields, brightness, and image quality. On the other hand, Apple might be willing to make a sacrifice with respect to the red/blue subpixel density in exchange for the advantages that OLEDs bring to the table. Hopefully, we'll know more in about six months when the in-depth reviews of the device are published. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple is Developing Sensors to Monitor Diabetes According to a report by CNBC, the team is working at a non-descript office, miles from corporate headquarters. The initiative was envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. ‘Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose.’ If such sensors are successfully developed, that would be a breakthrough as it is highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. It can help millions of people turn devices like Apple Watch into a must-have. "The initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways," the report quoted anonymous people related to Apple as saying. Jobs had envisioned that wearable devices, like smartwatches, could be used to monitor oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose, the report noted.

Pictured here is an autonomous vehicle on a test run north of London Apple has joined the list of companies with permits to test self-driving cars in California, according to an updated roster released on Friday by state officials. The iPhone maker has disclosed little about its ambitions when it comes to self-driving vehicles, with chief Tim Cook hinting at plans but the company declining to comment for news reports on long-idling rumors. Late last year, Apple revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. Apple issued the letter because it is "investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP at the time. The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars. Most major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020. General Motors this week announced that its autonomous driving efforts, investing $14 million and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research center in San Francisco. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and Michigan, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. Similar research is being carried out by other automakers including Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, and by other groups including Uber and Google parent Alphabet. Continental this week opened a new research center in the heart of Silicon Valley, saying it was dedicated to "mobility innovations and technologies." Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is working on autonomous driving at its California research center, this week announced the acquisition of xPerception, a US startup that provides visual perception software, along with services and devices for people who are visually impaired.

MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto Apple Inc. has received permission from California to test autonomous vehicles on the state’s public roads, joining a growing list of tech companies, startups and car makers jockeying to make self-driving cars a common sight globally. Companies that have received a permit for the testing include Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -0.09% Tesla Inc. TSLA, +2.41%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -1.87%  as well as auto makers such as General Motors Co. GM, -1.62%  and Ford Motor Co. F, -1.07%  and startups such as Faraday Future and Zoox Inc. The California Department of Motor Vehicles’ permit issued to Apple AAPL, -0.53%  covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers, a DMV spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The Lexus is luxury SUV. Read more: Tesla, Google, others accelerate driverless-car tests in California Earlier this month, privately held Uber Technologies Inc. was granted the same type of permit for two vehicles and 48 approved drivers. Uber had initially started its tests without a permit in December only to have the program shut down by the state’s DMV. Meanwhile, GM said Thursday it plans to invest $14 million and create more than 1,000 jobs in a California facility to advance its self-driving car technology and zero-emissions vehicles. Ford, which has beefed up its presence in Silicon Valley, said last year it could sell a driverless car in five years. Apple reportedly has been working on a driverless car for several years under the code name Project Titan, but has never publicly disclosed the effort despite issuing opinions about regulations for driverless cars. Such efforts have excited some observers who believe Apple needs to add another big-ticket item to continue to grow as its iPhone sales level out. Not everyone believes the company can succeed in the field, however. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available.

MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto Apple Inc. has received permission from California to test autonomous vehicles on the state’s public roads, joining a growing list of tech companies, startups and car makers jockeying to make self-driving cars a common sight globally. Companies that have received a permit for the testing include Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -0.09% Tesla Inc. TSLA, +2.41%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -1.87%  as well as auto makers such as General Motors Co.

The Lexus is luxury SUV.

Uber had initially started its tests without a permit in December only to have the program shut down by the state’s DMV. Meanwhile, GM said Thursday it plans to invest $14 million and create more than 1,000 jobs in a California facility to advance its self-driving car technology and zero-emissions vehicles. Ford, which has beefed up its presence in Silicon Valley, said last year it could sell a driverless car in five years. Apple reportedly has been working on a driverless car for several years under the code name Project Titan, but has never publicly disclosed the effort despite issuing opinions about regulations for driverless cars. Such efforts have excited some observers who believe Apple needs to add another big-ticket item to continue to grow as its iPhone sales level out. Not everyone believes the company can succeed in the field, however. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available.

Analysts Speculate How It Could Happen By Denisse Moreno On 04/14/17 AT 2:53 PM Close Wall Street is looking into an Apple-Disney merger, a note by RBC Capital Markets analysts obtained by Variety indicates. The analysts say Apple has the money to take over Disney, and such a merger would create a company worth $1 trillion with “almost limitless opportunities in content and technology.” Although it's all speculation at this point, analysts say it could happen. “Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney,” analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in the note. Read: Apple Reportedly Developing Its Own Power Management Chips For Its 2019 iPhone Lineup Apple could repatriate $200 billion from overseas to take over Disney — with the help of tax proposals from the Trump administration. Apple would need a “tax holiday” to repatriate the cash. Acquiring Disney Could Help Apple Acquiring Disney would help Apple back away from its dependence on the iPhone, which makes up most of its revenue. Disney could help Apple compete with streaming companies, such as Netflix and Amazon, and provide worldwide streaming sports rights for ESPN. “Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand,” analysts said. A possible acquisition of Disney could also do well for Apple shareholders, analysts said. Rumors of a possible acquisition started last October when Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “open to acquisitions of any size” during the company’s 2016 fourth-quarter conference call. Another reason for talk about Disney and Apple is Cook’s interest in television. Apple executives approached Time Warner about a possible merger in 2015, however, talks didn’t go past the preliminary stage.

The largest deal Apple made was for its Beats $3 billion acquisition for in 2014. Speculation from analysts boosted Disney shares, sending them to a 16-month high Thursday while  Apple shares fell.

(http://bit.ly/2pikEgR) Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.  After a five-page letter last November from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company was under increased speculation that they would enter into the competitive self-driving space. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Kenner wrote. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Best & Brightest: Taste of freedom fuels VVC student's drive Friday Apr 14, 2017 at 11:35 AM Apr 14, 2017 at 11:36 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Miranda Felix said she can feel the wind of freedom when she cruises down open desert roads on her Harley Davidson motorcycle. A Victor Valley College student who has also worked at the college as a sign language interpreter for nearly 10 years, the 28-year-old Felix told the Daily Press that VVC has helped her to spread her wings and fly. “I signed up for VVC about three years ago, right after my ex left,” said Felix, who lives in Apple Valley. “As an interpreter, I was assigned to an environmental sustainability class with Neville Slade. I was so impressed and inspired by what he was teaching that I signed up for the class the next semester.” Felix said her taste of freedom didn’t come until after she left a “strict” religious community that she and her ex-husband were a part of. “I’m thankful for the religious environment that taught me how to be motivated and how to talk to people,” Felix said. “It also taught me how to work and talk to people.” After learning sign language to “convert others” into the religion, Felix said she “woke up” to the realization that her actions were “so insincere.” When she shared her thoughts of leaving the religion, her ex-husband left her. “Because of my new world view, I was ostracized by all of my friends, and many of my family,” Felix said. “I still mourn for those I love, cloistered in their own little world where everyone is wrong except them. This drastic change lit a raging fire in me.” Since then, Felix’s hard work in the study of natural resources conservation has earned her an All-California Community College Academic Team Award, an elite honor from the only community college honors society, Phi Theta Kappa. She also plans on transferring to Cal Poly Pomona in the fall. Felix said her goal is to study plant science, with a long term goal of helping create mobile gardens for low-income families and seniors who live in rural areas of the Mojave Desert, adding that she’d like to help shift the community toward more sustainable lifestyles. “Cal Poly Pomona was a pipe dream, but in 2016 I found out that I was selected to receive the Cal Grant,” Felix said. “I wept when the financial aid specialist told me that my tuition would be covered in full.” Felix said she’ll be attending an American Indian leadership conference in Arizona at the end of the month thanks to a travel scholarship from the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. “I belong to the Cherokee nation and I am president of the Native American Student Council at VVC,” Felix said. “My club put on a mini-powwow at the High Desert Farmer's Market this past November where we had a lot of support and I'm really proud of us.” Felix said working at VVC as a student services lab technician has allowed her to experience the joy of helping new students start their journey. “It's so fulfilling to see the hope manifest on the faces of our future transfer students, fire personnel, mechanics, nurses, entrepreneurs and police when they complete their college applications,” Felix said. “It's an odd feeling to be proud of a complete stranger, but that's how I feel everyday about these awesome humans starting at VVC, and it's an honor to be of service to them.” A free spirit who loves to travel the back roads of the Mojave Desert on her Harley where she photographs and gathers native plant samples, Felix said she loves to wear her mother’s turquoise jewelry on her petite frame that includes many piercings and tattoos. “Riding the Harley is so empowering, but my education at VVC has given me a second chance to he a normal person and to live life to its fullest,” Felix said. “I’ve made a lot of friends with common interests here who have encouraged me on my journey. I guess you can say VVC is a facilitator of dreamers and do-gooders.” After only three years of “being free to walk” her own path, Felix said she has close friends and mentors who care about her. She’s also grateful for the chance to live in the Mojave Desert, the only place on Earth where Joshua Trees grow and a place she loves to her “very core.” “Not a day goes by that I realize how many people care about me and how much I truly have,” Felix said. “I’m grateful for my friends, my family and for the opportunities that I have to travel new paths.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

The tech giant received a permit from the California DMV Friday morning to test three Lexus SUVs on public roads. Apple is now the 30th company to have such a permit in California. Apple has long kept its interest in self-driving technology under the radar. The business around autonomous vehicles is likely to be worth trillions, so experts have expected Apple to formally dive into the field. It’s unclear what form Apple’s interest in self-driving technology will take. There have been reports in the last year that Apple scaled back plans to build its own vehicle. Instead, the automaker could focus on building the software and hardware to make cars and trucks self-driving. Waymo, the Google subsidiary that’s seen as the self-driving leader, is taking such an approach. Previously, the clearest signal of Apple’s intent came in December when it sent a letter to the federal government expressing enthusiasm about the impact of automation on transportation. Apple is set to begin testing as the state government becomes more welcoming to self-driving vehicles. The California DMV released proposed rules for self-driving cars in March, clearing the way for cars with an empty driver’s seat to operate on state roads by year’s end. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller was quoted by Buzzfeed this month as saying: “Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now.” And now, the guys over at Curved.de have imagined just what that 'rethought' Mac Pro will look like with a new concept design. Related: Best desktop We know the new Mac Pro won't be available this year, but the concept gives us a glimpse of what Apple could have in-store – and it really is an impressive design. The German site has created a mockup of both the modular computer and the display, the former of which looks something like a cross between a regular desktop tower and a Mac Mini. Gone is the 'trash can' look of the existing Mac Pro, with the tower itself sporting what looks to be an OLED panel on the front. The modular component is envisioned as a swivelling central unit that allows users to access the device's internals to upgrade certain parts. According to Curved's site, the concept includes two slots for full-sized graphics cards, along with removable hard disks and SSD drives. There's even a headphone jack, which Apple may or may not decide to include following its much publicised removal of the port on the iPhone 7. Apple confirmed it would return to making displays this month after speculation arose that it could stop manufacturing its own screens. The speculation started once the company began to promote LG-made displays for use with its MacBook Pro, but it seems Apple will remain in the screen-making business for now. And Curved has made sure to include a screen design with its latest concept, in the form of a 27-inch retina display, which certainly tops the whole thing off. Let us know what you think of the concept in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Maybe Apple’s self-driving car project isn’t a write-off after all? by Chris Smith 12 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Months after the firm was thought to have cooled its 'Project Titan' automotive ambitions, Apple has received a permit to test autonomous vehicles on California roads. The Department of Motor Vehicles in the company’s home state confirmed on Friday the permit had been issued (via Reuters). Apple joins the likes of Google, Ford, Tesla, Faraday Future, BMW, Mercedes and GM among the 30 firms who also have permits to go driverless in the Bear Republic. Related: Project Titan - The ultimate guide Once its autonomous vehicles are on the road, Apple must submit reports of accidents within 10 business days. It is also required to submit annual reports “summerising the disengagements,” which means Apple has to disclose when a human takes over from the automated computer. What this says about Apple’s future in the sector remains to be seen. It remains far from a certainty that Apple will bring the much-vaunted iCar to consumers and it's probably still a long shot. However, the company is continuing to explore many areas where automation is the key component. In November last year, Apple’s director of product integrity told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a letter: "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” What happens next remains to be seen. Do you think Apple will eventually branch out into the auto industry or does this remain an exploratory venture into machine learning that benefits other areas of focus? 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: April 14, 2017 at 10:11 am | UPDATED: April 14, 2017 at 4:18 pm In the first official confirmation of Apple’s automotive ambitions, the secretive Cupertino company on Friday received a permit to test self-driving vehicles on California roads. With major Silicon Valley tech firms and U.S. carmakers jumping into the frenzy to bring the technology to the market, the possibility that Apple will join the fray has fascinated the valley. The company has long been rumored to be working on a mysterious “Project Titan” connected to vehicles, but has never confirmed that. “This absolutely verifies that they are going to do something in this space,” Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said of Apple. “This is likely Titan.” Related Articles Ford overtakes Uber, Waymo and Tesla in self-driving car race, report says Inside the car-eat-car world of self-driving technology Self-driving Ubers back in action in SF following Arizona crash On Friday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles provided tantalizing confirmation that not only is Apple working on automotive technology, it also has plans for autonomous vehicles. On the list of companies receiving permits to test self-driving vehicles on California roads, Apple’s name popped up for the first time at the very end of the list of 29 other firms. “The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers,” the DMV said in a statement Friday. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. No other information was provided by the DMV. With its new permit, Apple joins Google, Tesla, Ford, BMW, Subaru, General Motors and other major automakers and tech companies. Apple is probably not building its own car, however, and Project Titan may just be a code word for the firm’s work on vehicle technology, Moorhead said. “I don’t think to be successful they have to do a car, and I also think it’s a pretty big stretch, without an acquisition, to build what it would take to be really successful at cars quickly enough.” Likely, Apple is working to create the “Apple experience” in self-driving cars, Moorhead said. He expects the firm is creating a safe and effective autonomous-driving system based on computer vision, laser-based navigation and mapping, while also building an in-car environment for passengers that leverages Apple’s dominant position in entertainment and workspace technology. “It’s going to be kind of a living room on wheels or an office on wheels — that’s right up Apple’s alley,” Moorhead said. If Apple were unable to find a carmaker to use its system, “they would have to buy a car company,” he said. “When you have $250 billion in the bank, you can pretty much do anything.” The firm in December sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that hinted at work on self-driving vehicles. Apple noted that it uses artificial intelligence to “make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal,” and said it was investing heavily in studying automation and was “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Aside from the new permit, Apple has provided little insight into its vehicle-related efforts. Company CEO Tim Cook flat out refused in 2015 to reveal any information when he appeared on comedian Stephen Colbert’s TV show. But that year, Apple was renovating an office complex in Sunnyvale, and the city’s permitting documents referred to an “auto work area” in a warehouse. Public records also showed that the company had asked officials in the Contra Costa Transportation Authority about their self-driving-car testing site at the former Concord Naval Weapons Station. Meanwhile, General Motors on Thursday announced it would spend $14 million to expand its San Francisco autonomous-vehicle unit, Cruise Automation, and hire 1,100 people to work on it.   Reading this on your phone?

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 14, 2017 -- 17:55 GMT (10:55 PDT) | Topic: Mobility While Apple has been relatively quiet about its work on autonomous vehicles, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has confirmed on its website that the Cupertino company has a permit to test such vehicles on the road. Apple is listed on the site along with about three dozen other companies that include other tech giants like Google, traditional car manufacturers like Ford and startups like Zoox. The closest Apple has come to confirming its work in this area came in November, when it sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the US agency overseeing autonomous car regulation. Apple "is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," the letter said. Reports about Apple's research into cars, dubbed Project Titan, have existed for a couple years. Last fall, dozens of employees from the project were reportedly laid off. Apple did not directly respond to questions about when it may test autonomous vehicles on the road. The company pointed back to its statements to the NHTSA, when it said, "there are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Future Tense Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in California by Matt McFarland   @mattmcfarland April 14, 2017: 1:14 PM ET Apple unveils new Red iPhones Apple's interest in self-driving cars is becoming more transparent. The tech giant received a permit from the California DMV Friday morning to test three Lexus SUVs on public roads. Apple is now the 30th company to have such a permit in California. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has long kept its interest in self-driving technology under the radar. The business around autonomous vehicles is likely to be worth trillions, so experts have expected Apple to formally dive into the field. It's unclear what form Apple's interest in self-driving technology will take. There have been reports in the last year that Apple scaled back plans to build its own vehicle. Instead, the automaker could focus on building the software and hardware to make cars and trucks self-driving. Waymo, the Google (GOOGL, Tech30) subsidiary that's seen as the self-driving leader, is taking such an approach. Previously, the clearest signal of Apple's intent came in December when it sent a letter to the federal government expressing enthusiasm about the impact of automation on transportation. Related: Your car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself Apple is set to begin testing as the state government becomes more welcoming to self-driving vehicles. The California DMV released proposed rules for self-driving cars in March, clearing the way for cars with an empty driver's seat to operate on state roads by year's end. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans. The project quickly became something of an open secret among technology-watchers, even if it was never truly clear what Apple was working on. The ambiguity surrounding the effort was reflected in the names that circulated about the project, such as the “Apple Car,” “the iCar” and “Project Titan.” Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car or to upgrade a car by injecting it with autonomous capabilities. Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumors. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Despite the permit, it's unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1,100 additional jobs and a $14 million investment, and in February, Ford said that it's investing $1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 percent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. “It’s encouraging to hear that Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars will push the industry to “provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we’re already experiencing.” Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California’s autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles’ website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports, but only those outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle’s autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones — a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Few details have been revealed about Apple’s autonomous driving plans, but the company has hinted about its interest in the field recently. In December, Apple confirmed in a letter to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration it has invested in "the study of machine learning and automation." Read: Are Self-Driving Cars Safe? The company was reportedly working on its own car, but as the Financial Times reports, it has since shifted its current focus to developing software and systems that would power autonomous tech in self-driving cars. Companies that are testing self-driving cars on public roads in California are subject to several rules and regulations. Researchers are required to report accidents involving self-driving technology within 10 days and also have to file annual reports documenting how often human drivers have to take over for a car's self driving features. Apple is the latest company to make significant research investments in autonomous tech. More than 30 companies are testing self-driving cars in California alone, including Volkswagen, Tesla, Uber and Baidu. Additional testing has been approved in Europe and in U.S. cities, including Boston.

(IW 500/2) suppliers committed to using solely renewable energy to manufacture components for the iPhone maker. Compal Electronics Inc., Sunwoda Electronic Co. and Biel Crystal Manufactory Ltd. have made the pledge, bringing the total number of Apple suppliers seeking to use just renewable power to seven, executive Lisa Jackson said in an interview. Apple itself now gets 96% of its energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, according to Jackson, Apple's vice president in charge of sustainability and government affairs. “We look at our carbon footprint as so much more than just our office, our data centers, our stores, even our distribution centers,'' Jackson told Bloomberg Television. ``All that's included in our 96%, but now we're moving onto our supply chain.'' Apple is sticking by climate pledges made under former President Barack Obama even as President Donald Trump relaxes and rescinds some environmental rules and orders. Jackson served as head of the Environmental Protection Agency in Obama's first presidential term. " "One thing this administration has made clear is that they want to hear from business and so we're going to do everything we can to make our values known,'' Jackson said. Apple aims to use only renewable energy to power its facilities, and already does so in 24 countries including the U.S., Jackson also said. Apple and its suppliers expect to generate over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy by the end of 2018, the company said in March. It's building solar panels into the roof of its new headquarters and aims to sell excess energy in the market. Technology companies are among the biggest buyers of clean power, led by Google parent Alphabet Inc. Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. joined forces with more than 60 companies and a series of environmental groups last year to develop 60 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2025, enough to replace all the coal-fired power plants the U.S. is expected to retire by 2020. Corporations agreed to buy nearly 3.7 gigawatts of power generated by clean-energy projects in 2015, and another 2.5 gigawatts last year, almost all from wind and solar, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Companies using renewable energy tend to sign deals with a fixed rate over 20 or 30 years, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Kyle Harrison. ``It gives them stability into what they're paying for their energy prices but it also gives them the potential to save money in the longer term,'' Harrison said.

Apple is testing self-driving cars in California Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains April 14, 2017 It'll probably need larger stores. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains April 14, 2017 Apple may soon join the ranks of Silicon Valley and Detroit companies testing self-driving cars on the streets of northern California. The California department of motor vehicles (DMV) routinely publishes a list of the companies that it has granted permits to test autonomous vehicles and software on public roads. Its most recent list, published today, includes Apple as a permit holder. The DMV confirmed to Quartz that Apple has been granted a permit that covers three Lexus RX450h SUVs, as well as six drivers. Apple wasn’t immediately available to discuss its automotive plans. Although the company has never formally admitted that it’s working on any sort of automotive technology (beyond the software it designed to connect iPhones to car entertainment systems), it has long been reported that the company has been researching electric and self-driving cars, hiring car designers and automotive experts over the last few years. It has apparently struggled with developing a car, and may have shifted to developing more car software (rather than an actual car), reports from October suggested, with some reporters saying the software’s public tests are now imminent. *APPLE SAID TO SOON BEGIN SELF-DRIVING SOFTWARE TESTS ON ROADS — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) April 14, 2017 In December, Apple tacitly admitted that it was indeed working on some sort of autonomous vehicle when it sent a letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) discussing the government’s regulations on testing and deploying such vehicles on US roads. The company implied that it was a “new entrant” to the automotive manufacturing industry, and requested to be treated the same as established car companies in the eyes of regulators. Whether Apple is working on automotive hardware or software, it now has the ability to test its research in public in its home state. Here’s the full list of companies that have been granted permits by California’s DMV to test self-driving cars in the state: Volkswagen Group of America Mercedes Benz Google Delphi Automotive Tesla Motors Bosch Nissan GM Cruise LLC BMW Honda Ford Zoox, Inc.

The first model features Touch ID on the rear however the second model does, in fact, feature Touch ID underneath the display. Considering this it looks like Apple is still fixing the official design for the iPhone 8. However, we are hoping that the design likely to enter mass production will be the sleek-looking device with an embedded Touch ID on the display. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire 5.8-inch OLED display, 2.5D contoured glass on the front and back of the device surrounded by a metal frame, wireless charging. Additionally, the report also says that iPhone 8 will feature an 'invisible' front-facing camera along with a larger power button, same dimensions as the iPhone 7.

Now there’s a new development via Business Insider: Apple has registered with the state of California to test self-driving vehicles. Sony A6500 Apple’s name was added to the list of companies with Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permits on the Department of Motor Vehicles website in California today for the first time after two years of reports that Apple is testing self-driving car technology. Back in September 2015, documents showed Apple was in discussions with the state DMV to review self-driving car regulations. The development shows Apple is actively involved in self-driving car testing to some degree regardless of whether or not Apple is still planning on developing an electric vehicle of its own. Prior to today’s report, Apple partner Didi Chuxing opened its own self-driving lab near Apple in California. Prior to that development, Apple appeared on a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urging the department not to restrict autonomous vehicle testing. Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Last fall KGI released a report claiming Apple’s work on augmented reality would be applied to autonomous driving technology, although a month prior it was reported that work on Apple’s actual electric vehicle was halted as the focus moved to self-driving technology alone. It's official: Apple is testing autonomous vehicles. @CA_DMV says its permit allows for three 2015 Lexus RX450h cars https://t.co/RV1OVC3j56 — Tim Bradshaw (@tim) April 14, 2017 Last summer it was reported that Apple recruited ex-hardware lead Bob Mansfield to reboot the Apple Car project which suggested the electric car could be the product before later reports toned down expectations. While today’s new development doesn’t fully suggest the electric car is back on the table, it does show Apple is actively working on autonomous vehicle technology in some capacity.

Keeps Losing Ground in China Low-cost Android phones are taking over. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 14, 2017 at 11:41AM The Middle Kingdom has not been kind to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in recent months. Kantar reported in January that Apple's market share continued to slip, as local manufacturers continue to eat away at the Mac maker's market share with a powerful combination of improving specs and falling prices. Well, Kantar has now released its latest estimates; unfortunately, it's more of the same. Android has steadily marched higher over the past year, with the three months ending February 2017 posting the strongest gains yet, jumping over 9 percentage points in urban China. Local brands like Huawei and Oppo, among others, are helping drive those gains. iOS saw its share plunge by nearly 9 percentage points, falling from 22.1% to 13.2% during the three months ending February 2017. Ouch. Image source: Apple. Survey says... Kantar notes that this is the lowest market share for iOS in urban China in nearly three years, even as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are extremely popular devices. Apple's newest models grab 8% of smartphone sales, but the previous-generation iPhone 6s and 6s Plus garnered 14% of smartphone sales in that product's comparable period. Urban China Market Share 3 Months Ending February 2016 3 Months Ending February 2017 Percentage Point Change Android 77.1% 86.4% 9.3% iOS 22.1% 13.2% (8.9%) Windows 0.3% 0.2% (0.1%) Other 0.4% 0.2% (0.2%) Data source: Kantar. Greater China revenue has been somewhat volatile over the past couple of years, although sales bounced back in the fourth quarter. Apple's Greater China segment includes Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Some of the weakness in the fourth quarter came from Hong Kong and Taiwan, while in Mainland China -- the largest area of the three included regions -- revenue was even with the record results from the year prior. It's not just the iPhone Investors tend to focus too much on iPhone unit sales. While this is undoubtedly an important metric, it's not the single determinant for Apple's success in a country. The company has been focusing very heavily on growing its services business, targeting $50 billion in annual sales by 2020. CEO Tim Cook noted on the January conference call that Apple also hit record services revenue in China: Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double-digits year-over-year. iPad units were also up double-digits in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And then obviously, our total install base continues to grow there in the strong double-digits. That said, the challenges that are there. One, the currency has devalued 6% year-over-year, and two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it and I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there and I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line. Other parts of the business are faring quite well, even as iOS slips in the smartphone market. To be clear, Apple needs to address its weaknesses in the Chinese market, which will be a challenge, since the company's arguably biggest weakness is pricing itself out of certain market segments and sticking to the premium space. It's a fine line to balance unit sales and profitability. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

The permit allows Apple to test vehicles in autonomous mode on public roads. It’s unclear if Apple sought to obtain a permit because it wanted to test-drive its own autonomous vehicles or if the company was simply looking to experiment with the rumored autonomous driving features in a future CarPlay version. Were the company to test its own autonomous vehicle, we’ll surely know about it because all car vendors are required to file so-called Disengagement Reports, which are publicly shared on the DMV’s website. This is a “confirmation” that Apple continues to work on either a self-driving car or self-driving software for cars. For what it’s worth, a DMV spokesperson told the Financial Times that Apple applied to test three 2015 Lexus RX450h vehicles, with six drivers. Last November, Apple sent a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in which it proposed things like anonymous data sharing to improve accuracy of autonomous systems. Apple also requested that new companies entering the industry be treated the same as legacy manufacturers. “It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production,” reads the letter. “Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.” The company says it’s invested “heavily” in machine learning and autonomous systems. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” according to the firm. The letter left open the possibility that Apple would go on to design and produce a car of its own rather than merely provide its technology to an existing manufacturer. Apple’s former hardware chief Bob Mansfield was unretired to oversee Project Titan following a series of executive departures and internal delays. While the Cupertino firm was reportedly interested in developing an electric vehicle of its own, Project Titan has refocused on developing autonomous driving software. Apple’s Canadian team is reportedly working on a car OS.

As such, it’s possible that Apple has an autonomous car hidden in a garage somewhere, hidden under a pile of rose-gold cardboard boxes so nobody can see it! Or it could mean that Apple is one of a wide variety of companies interested in getting a permit for road testing autonomous vehicles to test a piece of technology in an autonomous vehicle – something so small as a processor or as large as an electric engine. We’re directed to this list of companies at the State of California DMV by writer Mike Isaac on Twitter. It’s through this list we’re given insight on how close Apple is to the autonomous car industry – sort of. We can take some information from this list, but not a whole lot of solid data on what, exactly, Apple is doing. The list includes all of the companies in the image above. This image includes several companies that I’d like to point out specifically: Uber, Telenav, Baidu, Tesla, and NVIDIA. Uber has an autonomous vehicle that they’re driving around – they’re a good example of a company that intends on focusing on a few models or a single model at a time – a real-deal full-sized vehicle. Tesla is a company that has vehicles that’ll be going autonomous sooner than later. Tesla’s Autopilot is almost autonomous already – but they’ll be making autonomous vehicles all on their own at some point in the future, on that you can count. Baidu has been working with a bunch of companies on autonomous cars: BMW and Ford and NVIDIA, too. Baidu is interested in investing – but they’ve got their own car, too. You’ll find NVIDIA’s efforts to mostly focus on their own processor technology for autonomous piloting. They probably wont make their own car – they have a lot more to profit from in selling their processors and software to established car manufacturers. Telenav was one of the first 20 companies to be granted a permit for Autonomous Vehicle Testing in California. That was back in October of 2016, when they suggested the following: “Telenav is developing navigation, ADAS, mapping and big data intelligence platforms to serve various levels of autonomous driving.” Apple may be testing out some new autonomous car technology in some way or another – but don’t jump the gun. Now we’ll see whether Apple takes the approach that has them making the entire autonomous vehicle, or just making certain they’re a part of the autonomous vehicle industry with their already-dominant iPhone – with software, that is to say. They’ve hit some roadblocks already – so don’t be too disappointed when the iCar doesn’t roll off the manufacturing line later this year.

By Matt McFarland WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- Apple's interest in self-driving cars is becoming more transparent. The tech giant received a permit from the California DMV Friday morning to test three Lexus SUVs on public roads. Apple is now the 30th company to have such a permit in California. Apple has long kept its interest in self-driving technology under the radar. The business around autonomous vehicles is likely to be worth trillions, so experts have expected Apple to formally dive into the field. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Seemingly undaunted by this talk, Samsung has put out what is quite simply its best tablet yet in the form of the Galaxy Tab S3 . It's aimed squarely at taking on Apple's iPad Pro and offers a really compelling alternative for those that don't want to dance to Apple's tune. Like the iPad Pro, the Tab S3 boasts a 9:7 aspect ratio and a cover that doubles up as a keyboard. Read More Dell XPS 13 '2-in-1' laptop review: A brilliant bet for the business traveller More importantly, Samsung has managed to cram a whole lot of computing gear into a package that's 6mm thick and weighs a mere 429g. Make no mistake, this is a premium piece of gadgetry. And so it comes as no surprise that the asking price is £599 - and that's without the keyboard cover, which will set you back an extra £119. Design (Photo: Samsung) Read More Google Home review: An excellent gadget for the modern house Samsung is no longer a second stringer when it comes to design and the Tab S3 follows the lead set by the S7 and, more recently, S8 phones. The rounded corners and reflective glass back look great, but it's not long before they start to get covered in oily fingerprints. At the base of the tablet is the USB-C charging port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's a physical phone button that also includes a fingerprint scanner on the front and this is flanked by Android's soft touch navigation keys. Samsung's stylus - the S Pen - also comes with the Tab S3 and works very well indeed. But, because the device is so thin, there's nowhere to store it. You have to rely on the magnetic connection to slap it to the back of the tablet for temporary storage. Features (Photo: Samsung) Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 hands-on review: A fighting return for the ill-fated smartphone maker One of the best features of the Tab S3 is its excellent AMOLED screen. It has a pixel density of 2048 x 1536 and is capable of displaying high dynamic range (HDR) content, which is great, except that neither Netflix nor Amazon have updated their mobile apps to take this into consideration. There are four speakers surrounding the screen which blast a decent amount of volume at you during video or music playback. Samsung has also equipped the tablet with a 13MP rear-facing camera. It's serviceable but nowhere near as impressive as the snapper we've seen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone. Read More Apple launches new iPad tablet - and you can order it TODAY (Photo: Samsung) The software running on the Tab S3 is the latest version of Google's Android. Which gives the tablet both its benefits and its drawbacks. Google's latest OS is power efficient and works well with the tablet. The drawback is that Android developers still haven't bested their iOS counterparts when it comes to making specific tablet apps. Samsung has added some neat programs of its own but Android tablets still don't have the cohesiveness that Apple ones do. Battery life (Photo: Samsung) Read More Huawei P10 Plus review: A straight-shooting upgrade with a Leica camera that still shines Streaming a full-length HD movie will only take about 12% off the battery life. It'll easily get you through a full 8-hour workday if you plan on using it at the office. Running looped video continuously on the Tab S3 killed the battery after about 11 and a half hours. Samsung has opted for a 6,000mAh battery for the Tab S3, which could be considered conservative. However, given the issues with the Note 7 phablet, it's hard to fault Samsung for being careful this time around. Regardless of what the South Korean company could do, what it has done is more than enough to satisfy most users. The bundled fast charge adapter will also juice the gadget up in about two hours. Conclusion Read More Tech predictions for 2017: From artificially intelligent chatbots to the 10th anniversary of the iPhone Top-tier Android tablets are pretty hard to come by at the moment. Leaving aside the Google Pixel C, the Tab S3 is probably the best option for anyone that doesn't want to splash out on an iPad. It's true that the £599 asking price is a bit on the steep side. But, then again, you can reasonably expect this tablet to last you a good three or four years before it starts to show its age. Samsung has pulled out all the stops for this tablet and the payoff is that it's possibly the best Android option on the market right now.

Qualcomm Litigation And The Nuclear Option Related Content Topic :  HTC  Handset manufacturer founded in 1997 Blog :  FCC Drops Proposal to Allow Cell Phones on Planes Article :  Review: PlayBook Tablet OS 2.0 Apple vs. Qualcomm Litigation and the Nuclear Option Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 14 Apr, 2017          |         |     Share I’m fascinated by litigation, largely because much of it isn’t necessary and occurs because one side or the other is delusional. Two sides go in, both believing they can’t lose, and one side comes out the winner. Since you rarely actually go to court, the entire effort becomes an expensive form of negotiation, with negotiators (attorneys) whose financial interest is tied to prolonging an incredibly expensive process. Or, put differently, litigation like this results because one of two negotiating teams didn’t do their job and you don’t know which until a judgement or settlement. In short, at least one of the teams was unreasonable. The dispute that has caught my attention recently is between Apple and Qualcomm. The cause of this appears to be an effort by Apple to pressure Qualcomm into providing a unique discount, largely because Apple has run into an innovation wall, is under increased competition from firms like Samsung, and has moved to a massive cost reduction strategy. (I’ve never known this to end well ,as it causes suppliers to create unreliable components and outright fail.) These two companies are heavily interdependent, but Apple appears to need Qualcomm more than Qualcomm needs Apple. My read is that, while Apple is Qualcomm’s largest customer, Qualcomm also gets revenue from all of Apple’s competitors. Were Apple to stop buying, Qualcomm would initially be hurt but would survive. But Apple has become dependent on its iPhone revenue and, without Qualcomm, that product wouldn’t be competitive (I’ll explain this further later), with potentially deadly impact on Apple’s revenue. Qualcomm has diversity in licensees but Apple doesn’t have the same diversity in suppliers because Qualcomm’s IP is critical to its smartphone. I doubt Apple agrees, which is why it started this war. At the heart of this is the fact that Apple’s perception of reality is very different from what it actually is. I’ll break this down as I see it. (You can read the latest filing here.) Qualcomm’s Problem We think, and I expect so does Apple, that Qualcomm is in the parts business. That should be a surprise because the only big campaign it has done had to do with its Snapdragon processor. It’s actually far more powerful as a modem vendor, but both of those are parts and there are clearly others that can sell processors and modems. But in reality, Qualcomm isn’t in the parts business, it’s in the IP (intellectual property) business. It makes its money from licensing technology, without which your smartphone, and the iPhone, would be a brick. If Apple could pull Qualcomm’s IP out of its iPhones, there wouldn’t be a case. Apple would simply do that. But humans as a group just don’t seem to get the whole IP thing. Most companies don’t license their IP (though they will defend it), and while we license IP individually (for instance, we don’t own the music, movies or software, we “buy” when license it), we often violate those licenses (pirating media and software) because we seem to think we actually own it, thus often unintentionally committing crimes. No one outside of Qualcomm really sees the company for what it is nor understands that the smartphone wouldn’t exist without Qualcomm’s IP inside it, even if it doesn’t have Qualcomm’s processor, radio, modem, or graphics technology. Qualcomm’s other problem is that while it will protect its IP aggressively, it isn’t scary. It doesn’t even have a CMO to fight fights like this in the public domain which, against a marketing driven company like Apple, makes it look incredibly weak and vulnerable to just such an attack.  A lot of people still think of Apple the way it was under Steve Jobs and that was one scary company. Jobs made Donald Trump look like a wimp. But… Apple’s Problem Apple actually needs Qualcomm more than Qualcomm needs it. I don’t think Apple sees this at all. The biggest example of this should be when the new iPhone 8 runs against the new Samsung S8 in market. Apple has been crippling the Qualcomm-equipped phones so that those that test the phones don’t realize that iPhones, which look the same but use another vendor’s technology, are significantly inferior. It got away with this largely because the phone that most showcased this from Samsung, the Note 7, had a “burst into flames” problem that killed any comparisons but that won’t be the case (we hope for Samsung’s benefit) when the iPhone 8 launches. This practice of using inferior parts and crippled technology was part of Apple’s strategy to showcase, by creating a false argument, that it didn’t really need Qualcomm’s better technology, and it could backfire badly. In addition, according to the Qualcomm filing, Apple used a powerful argument that promised to do Qualcomm damage if Qualcomm didn’t capitulate. And then it went ahead and did most of what it had threatened to do, removing that behavior as a bargaining chip. For instance, if I tell you to do something for me or I’ll key your car, and then I key your car, I no longer have that as leverage. The two things Apple did were bad-mouth Qualcomm to regulators and attempt to get other licensees to organize against Qualcomm. Now the one threat it hasn’t executed yet is to turn its entire marketing engine into destroying Qualcomm’s brand, but given that it didn’t do that to Google, which effectively stole the entire iPhone idea (and which Jobs wanted destroyed), and it would pull from its ability to promote its own products, I think, and likely Qualcomm thinks, that is an empty threat (though, were I Qualcomm, I’d have a CMO staffed and funded to counter in case that assumption was wrong). I also think that Qualcomm knows this isn’t Jobs’ Apple and Tim Cook is nowhere near as scary, so the typical fear factor of running against the company won’t kick in. So, Apple doesn’t even have the base leverage it thinks it has. Finally, I think Apple is basing its strategy not just on a false belief as to what business the company is in but the firm’s willingness to fight. Over the last several years, there has been a huge influx of Intel employees into Qualcomm and, unlike the old Qualcomm, which was pretty passive, Intel has a reputation for being far more willing to fight to the death. Given that Apple’s chief counsel is also out of Intel, rather than backing down, Qualcomm could choose the nuclear option of denying Apple Qualcomm’s IP, which could have a massive adverse impact on Apple’s revenue long term and on its valuation short term. Wrapping Up: Fake News Winning a case like this comes down to three things: the believability of the evidence presented, how well each side presents the reality that supports them, and who is the most delusional as to what the dispute actually is. You’ll note I didn’t say who is right and who is wrong. That is a misconception of how courts actually work. Apple does have an incredibly strong legal team and I think it can argue its case compellingly, but I don’t think it has a firm grasp on the reality of its own risk or how Qualcomm is likely to respond. That suggests the foundation for taking this path is false and thus its anticipated outcome is unlikely to occur. That doesn’t mean it can’t hurt Qualcomm, only that it may find that it will be hurt far more than it now anticipates and that might not only cause this action to fail but make a pre-trial settlement impossible. One other item: While the heart of this appears to be an ill-conceived effort to force Qualcomm to give Apple a unique discount and competitive advantage, that now seems unachievable due to the public nature of this dispute. Instead, the best-case scenario would be a crippled Qualcomm and generically lower prices for all Qualcomm licensees, which would lower Qualcomm’s ability to innovate and thus remove a lot of the reason for folks to buy new smartphones semi-annually. In short, on this path, it may not only not gain a unique advantage but could significantly reduce churn, which would put pressure on prices and massively reduce annual revenues. And that is the best case. This is why I titled this the “nuclear option,” because while both sides clearly lose as a result of this going to litigation, I think this resulted because one side didn’t realistically assess the likely outcome of just pushing the litigation button. Bad assumptions, or fake news, can lead to some really bad decisions, particularly when it comes to litigation.

It added that NHK cited unnamed sources, who said this would leave Toshiba as a partial holding under U.S. and Japanese control, allowing the Japanese government to tell investors of any potential risks to national security brought on by the transfer of "sensitive technology". Apple, Foxconn and Toshiba have not commented on the news. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports Apple is mulling partnerships with Hon Hai and SoftBank Group. This morning, Reuters also said "sources briefed on the matter" have today stated Toshiba will likely win creditor approval to use its memory chip business stake as collateral for new loans and loan commitments of about 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion). Meanwhile, Foxconn has asked for SoftBank Group's "cooperation" for its bid for Toshiba's memory chip business, Reuters reports, citing today's news from Nikkei business daily. ForeScout's modules Security vendor ForeScout has announced modules for integration with Palo Alto Networks' next-generation security platform, with the aim of giving users better visibility and control over "traditional" and Internet of Things devices connected to enterprise networks. The modules use real-time device scanning with Palo Alto Networks' firewall and cloud-based malware prevention service WildFire, the announcement said. "By leveraging the integration between ForeScout and Palo Alto Networks, organizations will be able to see and control these devices for dynamic network segmentation and automated response," Michael DeCesare, president and CEO of ForeScout, said in a statement. Microsoft's intelligence requests Microsoft's biannual transparency report claims it received 1,000 to 1,499 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests from the U.S. government in the first half of 2016, according to Reuters.  The report says Microsoft received between 0 and 499 of such requests in each half of 2015. "The number of user accounts impacted by FISA orders fell during the same period, however, from between 17,500 and 17,999 to between 12,000 and 12,499, according to the report," Reuters noted. SentinelOne's appointment Endpoint security vendor SentinelOne has appointed Dee Dee Acquista as its VP of worldwide channels. Acquista will be responsible for driving growth through "strategic relationships with select partners", which will include security-focused VARs, service providers and distributors, SentinelOne's announcement said. The new SentinelOne exec was most recently VP of global channels at Proofpoint.  Previously, she worked at McAfee and Websense. "Our goal is to bring on forward-looking partners that have strong security expertise and an outstanding service record that will benefit our mutual customers," Acquista said in a statement. TBI's 10 Master agent and technology services distributor TBI has announced the addition of 10 new vendors to its portfolio. The new roster features  SD-WAN players Aryaka, BigLeaf, CloudGenix and Ecessa, cloud firms CallTower, Evolve IP and Megaport and international network providers Colt, TATA and Telstra.

Your top questions to Mac 911—and some answers Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac As I pointed out in a recent article, bugs exist in every application and hardware device, and Apple has a bug reporting system that many developers find annoying. But for end users—you and me—dealing with these issues can be frustrating. The error messages you see when something goes wrong with your software or hardware often offer you no help, nor give you any clue as to what is causing the problem. You may have a crash with Mail, and be met with a message saying “Mail quit unexpectedly.” I guess this is from the Department of the Bleeding Obvious, because, unless you direct an app to quit, this shouldn’t happen. This sort of error message doesn’t help you understand anything, but at least it informs you about what happened. You might have an app in the background and wonder where its window went, so this dialog informs you that you won’t find it. Error messages on the Mac often appear as Zen kōans; they suggest that you ponder the deeper meaning of the universe in order to understand what they mean. For example, you sometimes get an error from iTunes saying that there is a “temporary problem.” Kirk McElhearn/IDG iTunes is the leader in perplexing error messages. Or there is the dreaded “error 4001,” which rears its head with the following message: “We could not complete your iTunes Store request. An unknown error occurred (4001).” This error is related to the cloud; it has something to do with the iTunes Store, iTunes Match, iCloud Music Library, or Genius. Google is full of suggestions about dealing with this error message. But the iTunes dialog offers no clues. These error messages are frustrating, because users don’t know where to go to get help. The error is clearly not that unknown if it has a number, and Apple could perhaps have a link in the error message to a support page helping users figure out its cause. Take, for example, this cryptic message: Kirk McElhearn/IDG iTunes doesn’t always sync correctly. What’s a poor iTunes user to do? Where can one get help? It’s not limited to iTunes, of course. Many Apple apps exhibit this behavior. Here’s a message I got from the iBooks app recently: Kirk McElhearn/IDG iBooks can’t find its library. To be fair, this error message does give some clue as to what’s wrong; the app couldn’t find its library. The thing is, I bet you can’t find it either. The iBooks library is not in a folder that users can easily access, like the iTunes or Photos libraries. It’s in your home folder, in /Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService. I bet you wouldn’t think of looking there... So this error message is more than useless; it tells a user to “make sure the disk containing [the] library is connected,” but that disk is the startup disk, so it must be available. Here’s another interesting one I got on my MacBook recently. This laptop has a 256GB SSD, of which about 150GB was used. So I had about 100GB of free space. But the computer told me: Kirk McElhearn/IDG Huh? This sort of message is more than perplexing. If I clicked Manage, it would have invited me to start deleting files on that Mac; files that didn’t need to be deleted. As often, a restart fixed this issue. Everyone encounters error messages like this on Macs, and most users don’t know what to do, and end up frustrated because they can’t resolve their issues. Even with my long experience working with Macs, I’m sometimes flustered by the dialogs telling me what went wrong. Googling a specific error message may help find its cause, but Apple could help users by adding links on some of these dialogs to their support website, or some sort of help system that could direct users to more information.

Apple’s new spaceship-like campus wasn’t the only urban development in California in need of moderately mature trees. A new urban garden is underway atop Transbay Transit Center, and that project needed trees too. Apple’s campus required around 3,000 trees, according to CNBC, though Apple reports in a press release that Apple Park will end up homing 9,000 trees. “Apple park replaces 5 million square feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, and is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.” Transbay Transit Center’s rooftop park only requires 469 trees. Reportedly, the rooftop park’s project architects have “scoured the west coast” trying to find 469 trees that were mature enough to complete the vision the designers had. The Transbay Transit Center’s rooftop urban garden is expected to be completed later in 2017, and Apple’s project is pretty much ready for launch. #architecture #design #arch2o #art #building Transbay Transit Center | Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects – Arch2O.… https://t.co/yIPWH0DNsZ pic.twitter.com/Zw42ISQ117 — Arch2O (@Arch2O) March 29, 2017 According to CNBC, the transit center’s contractor and architect had to brainstorm a strategy that might prevent Apple from buying the trees they wanted before they could get to them. San Francisco’s rooftop park will boast 5.4 acres of green open space enveloped by towers of glass. Below, the transit hub will serve bus lines and possibly even a high-speed rail service. So far, only 60 trees have been delivered, according to a San Francisco Chronicle report. “This is going to be one of the great parks of San Francisco, and it’s going to be a public space unlike anything else we have,” Gabriel Metcalf, president of SPUR, told San Francisco Chronicle. The project needs moderately mature trees, and with Apple’s massive eco-friendly campus competing for trees, it’s been a challenge to find the perfect trees. They have visited 17 nurseries in Oregon and California to find trees for the rooftop garden, the article in San Francisco Chronicle explained. “There are Chinese elms from Rainbow in northern San Diego County, and olive trees from Farmington in San Joaquin County. From Gilroy come island oaks, while Escondido was the source for five or six cork oaks. A Columnar Hornbeam came from a nursery outside Portland, while a rare torpedo-shaped Chilean wine palm was tracked down near San Diego.” Meanwhile, Apple was buying trees. Plenty of trees. The 'Apple Park' spaceship campus will open in April…and it looks amazing pic.twitter.com/Ax21YuERNN — Mashable (@mashable) February 23, 2017 The transit center’s planners couldn’t keep up. They developed a system with the yellow tags to communicate which trees would get quickly moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the project team leased four acres of land. That way, the perfect trees could be held until they were ready to put them in. While waiting in Sunol, arborists from McGuire and Hester reportedly cared for the trees. As the trees waited, they grew, so the arborists had to transfer them into larger boxes when they outgrew the boxes they arrived in. The trees took decades to grow, so obviously, the project leaders had to make sure there were trees available to them. Shipping from great distances can damage trees. While the trees wait, workers waterproof the roof and add a layer of foam that will go beneath the soil where each tree is planted. Because the trees are mature, they need to pay close attention to the direction of growth as well. A tree’s box is labeled with spray-painted “N” for North so that the trees have the best shot of surviving the transplant. “These are important trees,” landscape architect Adam Greenspan said of the Chinese elms that would be planted on the roof of the transit center. “And hard to find. Even though you see them around, there are not that many being grown these days.” It seems that if California is going to keep up with its own demand for bringing the forest into the city, future plans may have to include choosing faster-growing trees in their designs or transplanting wild trees, which would undoubtedly be a more complicated process than moving trees from nurseries.

Apple was added to the list of permit holders that are allowed to participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program in California on Friday, joining companies like Google, Tesla, BMW, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and more. Obtaining a permit for autonomous vehicle testing requires multiple steps, including outlining details for each specific vehicle being tested, suggesting Apple may have some sort of software test vehicle that's road ready. Whether Apple will actually begin testing a vehicle remains to be seen, as some companies sign up and then don't go on to use it, but should Apple begin vehicle testing, public reports will need to be filed. In California, all companies that participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program must file Disengagement Reports that outline how many miles were covered with self-driving vehicles, so if Apple does test a vehicle, the information will be shared on the DMV's website. Apple's acceptance into the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program confirms the company's work on a car-related project. Early rumors suggested Apple was developing its own autonomous electric vehicle, but Apple is said to have since transitioned to building an autonomous driving system rather than a full blown car. Developed under the leadership of Bob Mansfield, Apple's autonomous driving system could allow it to partner with existing car makers or return to its own car development project in the future. Apple executives have reportedly given the car team until 2017 to prove the feasibility of an Apple-designed autonomous driving system, and its approval to road-test vehicles could be a signal that the project is advancing. Update: According to Bloomberg, Apple filed for a permit because it plans to start testing its self-driving car software platform on public streets. The software will be put in existing cars, with the permit covering three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs and six drivers, according to a DMV spokesperson.

Apple would be making its own bid next to Foxconn’s bid, and is considering investing at least several billion dollars for a stake of more than 20 percent. Read: Apple Reportedly Developing Its Own Power Management Chips For Its 2019 iPhone Lineup The report comes after confusion on whether Apple or Foxconn were bidding for a stake in Toshiba’s semiconductor business. Others interested in buying a stake include Western Digital, Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Broadcom and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners. A separate report said Amazon and Google also joined the bidding race for the chip-making unit. Apple’s stake is part of a plan for Toshiba to keep the business under U.S. and Japanese control, NHK reported. Apple’s move would try to reduce the Japanese government's concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it sees as a potential risk to national security. A previous Reuters report found Foxconn lost its bidding ground for Toshiba’s chip business because of its close ties to China. Read: Qualcomm Sues Apple, Says iPhone Success Wouldn't Have Been Possible Without Its Technologies Another bump for Apple’s reported bid is another suitor, Western Digital. Western Digital claimed Toshiba’s plans to sell its chip business is violating a joint venture contract between both firms by inviting outside bidders. If Apple’s bid went forward, it would hurt its rival Samsung, since the iPhone seller would reduce it dependence on the Korean company. After Samsung, Toshiba is the second-biggest maker of flash memory chips.

After introducing himself to the welcoming committee at the Chace Wellness Center, Steve Wozniak proceeded to hand everyone around him his business card. But what was so special about the card, besides the fact that it divulged his personal information? The card was stainless steel. “It makes for a handy tool on airplanes when I need to cut food, especially steak!” Steve Wozniak, for those who don’t know, was the Co-Founder of Apple. He was the engineer who originally built the Apple I and II computers and helped launch the company with Steve Jobs. Along the way, Wozniak has also been a programmer, engineer, entrepreneur, businessperson, inventor, computer scientist, scientist, actor, film producer, and writer. The larger than life man, with a big smile and bright neon sneakers, blessed the stage with charisma and intelligence. He was accompanied by President Machtley, who served as the mediator of the conversation, and one of the original Apple I computers, which was brought by an audience member. Wozniak talked about many things on stage, from the beginning of Apple, his time at Berkeley under the name “Rocky Raccoon Clark”, the early downfall of the company, and the lessons he learned along the way. One of the important lessons that Wozniak learned was, “you don’t have to win arguments with others, only arguments with yourself.” He also said that you should never do business with your friends, because it can hurt relationships, as it did in his case with  Steve Jobs. Woz also discussed how his father had a large impact on his life and how it was important to return back to school to get a degree. Not for the knowledge, but for the satisfaction and to show his kids that they can do it too.One  memorable quote from Woz’s time at Bryant was “Happiness equals Smiles minus Frowns.” Woz wasn’t in it for the fame or the money, in fact, he stated “I only wanted to make computers, I was nerdy back then.” Thanks  to Provost Glenn Sulmasy, The Archway was able to speak with the Woz and ask him some questions that weren’t addressed on stage. Archway Editor-and-Chief Will Tondo interviews Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Archway: What is one myth about the early days of Apple you want to debunk? Woz: There’s a bunch. The main one is Steve Jobs’ role. Steve Jobs is the overall, leader, contender and all that is a big myth. Also that there were two of us that started Apple. We started twice, it was three people that had equal share of the company. You hear about two Steve’s, not the adult who really ran the whole company and really made Apple. We didn’t really have a company in the garage. Yes, you need to use your home when you’re humble. We had no savings account, nothing. We used our home, but we didn’t have a company there. No, we hardly used the garage. About once a week we’d have to drive a few computer boards somewhere else. We would drive them to the garage, hook them up, test them, find the errors, fix them, then drive them to a store where we got paid cash. When you have no money, the parts are on credit. That’s how we made our first $10,000 of earning. A: What can universities do to develop students to become people like yourself? And what advice would you have for the next Steve Wozniak of our generation? W: One thing is be aware that the innovative, creative, “out of the box” thinking in people is generally part of your personality. It’s something that stays with you for your whole life. Were you born with it? No. Some people discover different things about themselves, that’s what got me to be creative. It adds meaning to me that I’m special. Your personality settles between 18 and 23. Okay? College years. That’s who you’re going to be. Take advantage of trying different fields. Maybe it’s formulas and math, or maybe it’s building little devices like an engineer, if you have the luck to do that you may become one of those builders, an innovator, or an inventor. These people have ideas, it’s nothing they’ve done before but they can go in and do it. But that’ll settle at one point in your life, and you don’t really change much after that. Now the world needs both types of people. A company making a big product, like even a phone, needs engineers who can get all the little codings done and everything, but you also need the guys who think of an idea that nobody will try because nobody thinks it will go. It may turn out to be an Uber. A: Knowing what you know now, if you were starting your career in information technology today, what field would you go into? Or what would you do? W: This is a tough one because I covered a lot of disciplines in electronics down at a lower level, not hundreds of lines of code or affecting hundreds of millions of people. So it’s a different time now. I would still explore doing things a little bit different. Just doing apps wasn’t really my thing. I would want to do some whole thing that all fits together, probably internet of things devices. Robotics is very important. High schools have first robotics where they have a contests and it’s in dozens of regionals, what you need to do to build that robot in six weeks… you’re just in high school! You have mentors, but you have to know mechanics and knows how to put things together with arms that move and do certain things. You’ve got to have motors. What voltage to have, how to protect from errors, how to hook microprocessors together, how to put together sensors that can sense light, vision, and things like that so they know how to move around. The robots applies a lot what’s called materials handling. It gets down to how you move materials from here to there. If you study what applies to materials handling, you’ll find company after company that has hundreds of requisitions. They want new employees right out of college. That’s a real fruitful job for having freedom to build and having a great job. A: Going off of that, what are your thoughts on artificial intelligence? W: I’ve been thinking about it my whole life. Basically, negative, we could never come close to the brain and that’s scary because one step at a time they’re understanding our writing, then our voice, just like a human being. Then there’s fear that what if the robots become smarter than us? And with robots walking around, why do you need a human? They’re cheaper, and I believed that for a long time but we haven’t talked about it yet, maybe we’ll get there, but can a robot think, how can I train myself to play a game? We have learning robots now. They never say “what should I do?” only a human with the intuition says that. We say, what needs solving? I think I’ll do that. No they don’t have that high level and we’ve never spoken about artificial intelligence going there. We do not know how the brain is structured. We’re getting closer with neurons in electronics. Simulated intelligence is what they called it. When I was young, I would go up to Samford Artificial Intelligence Research, one of the earliest places in the country. I’d ride my bike up there, watch these machines pick up a yellow ball and put it in a yellow holder. They call that artificial intelligence? But now, with the assistant app, it’s getting impressive. We used to live in a structured world. Everything works a certain way, it’s structured. But now I have a certain thought and I want to just express it. Voice is easy, or type it into google calendar, I just want to be in that unstructured world where I have a thought, I speak it, and it happens. I had Siri before the iPhone had it- it was an app on the app store. The iPhone didn’t change my life it was the app store! With all of the amazing things, what would I have done without these apps? Woah. These computers are starting to understand us better than ever. A: You mentioned in your book that women have unusual talents in technology. Can you explain? W: I taught classes. I told my father in 6th grade I wanted to be an electrical engineer and a 5th grade teacher. I wound up teaching 5th through 9th graders for nine years. No press allowed, didn’t want them near it. I remember in the classes, especially the science classes, the girls were on top of it. They could understand where the data was flowing in a computer and answer all the questions. But starting in 7th grade, when the girls knew the answer they were hesitant to raise their hands. So there’s something in the culture that’s very deep. I also noticed that when I went to finish of my degree at Berkeley under a fake name (Rocky Raccoon Clark), because I was famous by then. I was there taking computer science courses and there were brainiacs from all different countries like India, Korea, and Japan and they were 50:50 gender wise, So it’s something deep in the culture. It’s just what you want to do with your life. I’m glad that many companies are putting money towards sponsoring classes in programming for women. The thing is- it’s a little class that’s for a few days or hours, it doesn’t mean anything really. You can discover you’re interested in something but you need to keep working and building towards it, you need to decide that this is what you really like and what you like is what you’re good at, and if you’re good at something you’ll do it for the rest of your life. I know a lot of incredibly qualified women engineers and women thinkers that hang around in the greatest thinking centers- thinking about technology and humans. Apple is the first technology company to reach equal pay by gender. A: My last question, what have you learned from your failures? W: It’s funny. I’m the worst example of this because people will say we had our successes and failures, what I saw it as was “engineer only.” When I ran a company I wouldn’t get into the politics of it, and I don’t know why, but if you ever read my book it was just an unequal history of going up the ladder of one after another of design products and I never had a failure. Everything I ever tried, especially for apple, came out as an A+ product. I look back at my own designs and say how could a human being ever have thought to do it that way? So, I never had any failures except for maybe later in life I had a startup. I had some goals for a product that would be so great if it were a certain size and battery usage, but I couldn’t meet the engineering goals on those things. Along my way from elementary school on up, every little project that I did that wasn’t worth money, my mind got educated because I would try to make them with fewer parts than anyone else in the world would think of, and I learned tricks and they weren’t failures. Even the Apple 2 computer, which was all of Apple’s revenues for the first ten years of apple, I was trying to build the product for fun, to show the world what I could do. I wasn’t trying to bring personal computers to the world or start a company I wanted engineers to look at my designs and say woah. The Archway Newspaper would like to give a huge thank you to the office of the provost and specifically Provost Glenn Sulmasy and President Ronald Machtley for giving us the opportunity to meet and interview the legend himself. This was a huge treat for not only the newspaper, but for the entire campus, and we are thankful for this opportunity!

Coming from two of the world’s most prominent smartphone makers, the flagship smartphones are two of a kind, bearing the best of what each manufacturer has to offer. Considering rumors about the upcoming Apple device, however, it appears that the iPhone 8 would be quite under-specced compared to the Samsung flagship. Thus, questions have been raised about the iPhone 8’s capability to pose a challenge to the Galaxy S8. While recent years have proven that Samsung’s Galaxy S8 would most likely outgun Apple’s iPhone 8 in terms of raw power and numbers, speculations are also high that the iPhone 8 would have a few aces up its sleeve. Aces which, if Apple plays its cards strategically, could allow the iPhone 8 to dominate the Galaxy S8 completely. With this, here are three rumored iPhone 8 features that would most likely enable Apple’s device to overcome its Samsung counterpart. 3D-Sensing Front and Rear Cameras The Samsung Galaxy S8 is arguably the best smartphone in the market right now. Currently, the Galaxy S8 practically dominates all of its rivals, thanks in no small part to its innovative features and unique capabilities. With this in mind, rumors are high that Apple would be playing the same game with the iPhone 8. According to a 9to5Mac report, noted KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that the upcoming iPhone 8 would launch with a revolutionary 3D-sensing camera. Initial reports have speculated that Apple’s 2017 flagship would equip the feature exclusively on the device’s front sensor, but recent rumors have emerged stating that both the iPhone 8’s rear and front cameras would feature the technology. #GalaxyS8 vs #iPhone8: Rumors vs Reality https://t.co/FtECXduPRK pic.twitter.com/7KJt3XU0gy — Tom's Guide (@tomsguide) April 3, 2017 The 3D-sensing cameras have numerous real-world uses. Apart from security features, the highly-advanced sensor could also effectively change the mobile gaming industry. It could also usher in the widespread use of applications that are built on augmented reality (AR) platforms. Apple has been quite optimistic about the future of mobile technology and AR, and the iPhone 8 might very well be the catalyst that the Cupertino-based tech giant could utilize to usher in the augmented reality revolution. Superior Facial Recognition Sensor Samsung did not hide the fact that the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ had facial recognition security features. Much like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 of 2016, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ included a feature that enabled users to unlock the smartphone simply by looking at the device’s front camera. Inasmuch as the feature is unique and convenient, however, it also had one notable flaw. As discovered by users and reviewers of the flagship, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ could also be unlocked by holding a photo of the device’s owner in front of the smartphone’s front camera. Overall, Samsung’s facial recognition technology might be innovative, but in its current state, it is still far from perfect. According to an AppleInsider report, however, this security feature is something that the Cupertino-based tech giant would aim to perfect in the iPhone 8. Recent rumors have pointed to the upcoming Apple flagship being equipped with a revolutionary facial recognition sensor that could determine if the object in front of the camera is a three-dimensional image or not. This particular sensor would, in a number of ways, improve upon the feature that Samsung released for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Considering that mobile security is among the top concerns of smartphone users, the iPhone 8 might very well utilize its superior authentication features as a means to overtake its South Korean-bred rival. Samsung's new Galaxy S8 has facial recognition to unlock your phone.. but can be tricked with any photo of your face https://t.co/NPIOBsRsL4 pic.twitter.com/3wZdVvMhHS — USI IT Department (@USIITDept) April 3, 2017 Embedded Fingerprint Scanner There is no question that Samsung Galaxy S8 is a stunning device. From its subtle Infinity Display to its extremely thin bezels, the device looks almost like it came from the future. If there is anything that critics have pounced on with regards to the device’s design, however, it would be its fingerprint sensor, which is awkwardly placed beside the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+’s rear camera. Since the device’s launch, users and critics alike have complained that while the fingerprint sensor on the Samsung flagship is accurate and fast, it is also quite challenging and uncomfortable to use. The iPhone 8, on the other hand, is widely rumored to feature an entirely superior fingerprint scanner. Apple has long been rumored to be working on a way for the upcoming flagship to have a TouchID fingerprint sensor built directly into the display of the iPhone 8. If this particular feature does make it to the 2016 flagship, the iPhone 8 would be able to directly address the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+’s most noticeable design flaw, making it an ideal alternative to the Samsung device. Overall, the iPhone 8 might not feature as much RAM or screen resolution as its Samsung counterpart. Despite this, however, the Apple flagship is expected to feature an extremely refined mobile experience for its users, which would, in turn, enable the iPhone 8 to be more than a match for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 14, 2017 at 9:30AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) won the modem spot inside last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with its XMM 7360 cellular modem. Intel didn't get this spot exclusively -- it shares it with fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) -- but it's believed to supply a substantial portion of Apple's cellular modem needs for the iPhone 7. The XMM 7360, unlike most of the chips that Intel builds, isn't manufactured by Intel. Instead, it is manufactured by a third party -- very likely Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) -- on a (rather mature) 28-nanometer manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. The follow-on, known as the XMM 7480 -- the chip that's likely to power a large portion of Apple's upcoming iPhone models -- is also expected to be manufactured by TSMC, likely again using a 28-nanometer technology. After the 7480, though, comes the XMM 7560, which Intel says is manufactured in the company's 14-nanometer technology. This modem should power some of the 2018 iPhone models. This chip, as well as its successors, has the potential to be a good way for Intel to keep its older-generation factories utilized. Some background Chip manufacturing companies usually put into place some fixed amount of capacity for a given manufacturing technology, based on the company's demand forecasts. In Intel's case, it builds capacity for a new technology based on what it believes will be peak shipments on that technology (driven largely by the expected demand for its PC and data-center processors). Intel's main PC and data center processors will be manufactured on a given technology for several years -- historically, it has been about two years, but that's lengthening to at least three years. Once an all-new manufacturing technology is introduced, though, Intel will begin transitioning its core processor products from an older technology to a newer one. Now, just because Intel transitions its processors to a new manufacturing technology doesn't mean that there will be no use for the older manufacturing capacity. Some of the equipment inside those older factories is reused for future manufacturing technologies, but Intel has a lot of non-processor product lines that it usually keeps a step or two behind its main processor products in terms of manufacturing. It's those products that can ultimately fill the void left by the processors. Today, Intel's cellular modems don't serve the role as "factory filler" -- at least not for Intel, since those chips are manufactured elsewhere. However, with Intel's XMM 7560 and beyond, they will be able to do their part. What does this mean for Intel? Over time, I expect Intel's annual modem shipments to roughly trend to one-half of Apple's annual iPhone shipments on a unit basis, or somewhere around 100 million units (obviously varies based on Apple's own iPhone shipments and the exact split between Intel modems and Qualcomm modems). It's hard to know exactly how large these modem chips are, since die sizes are not readily available. However, I think we can make a somewhat educated guess as to how large the die size of a typical cellular baseband chip is. According to Chipworks' teardown of the iPhone 6s, the package size of the Qualcomm MDM9635 cellular baseband is approximately 75 square millimeters. The package size of the Apple A9 applications processor (APL0898) is about 215 square millimeters. The die size of the APL0898 is 96 square millimeters, so the ratio of the die size to the package size is 96/215 or ~0.44. If we assume a similar ratio for the baseband's die size to the package size, then we get a die size of around 33 square millimeters. So, for the purposes of our analysis, let's suppose that the XMM 7560, manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, is roughly 30 square millimeters (greater functionality than the older Qualcomm modem offset by the smaller manufacturing technology. From a volume perspective, working under these (admittedly very crude) estimates, 100 million cellular modem chips at 30 square millimeters a piece is equivalent in volume to 30 million chips measuring in at 100 square millimeters a piece -- the approximate size of a current dual-core Intel Core processor. Looked at another way, the potential volume here is roughly equivalent to between 10% and 15% of Intel's personal computer chip shipments. Cellular baseband chips, then, wouldn't be enough to completely make up for the migration of Intel's main processors to a newer manufacturing technology, but it would dramatically boost the volumes of chips that Intel builds on its older-generation manufacturing technologies. In other words, a nice way for Intel to wring out more revenue and profits from preexisting factory infrastructure.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

(Richard Drew/AP) By Allan Sloan By Allan Sloan Columnist April 14 at 11:10 AM Just about the time you think you may have finally figured out what the stock market is doing, it changes on you. Today, let’s look at two actual examples and one possible example of this phenomenon: Apple’s share price, the alleged “Trump bump” and the battle between index funds and actively managed funds. Apple first. Over the past year or so, I’ve had a lot of fun pointing out how Apple’s stock began to tank soon after it replaced AT&T in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average in 2015. Using numbers from Howard Silver­blatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, I wrote several times about how Apple, which had been a hot stock, became the Dog of the Dow after it replaced AT&T on March 19 of that year. I’d calculate how much higher the Dow would have been had Apple stayed out and AT&T stayed in. At one point, the difference was close to 300 points. The Dow would have topped 20,000 way before it did on Jan. 25 had the AT&T-Apple switch not taken place. [The Dow’s climb to 20,000? Whoop de doo.] But Apple has stopped barking. According to Silverblatt, as of Tuesday’s close, Apple ranked 13th among the 30 Dow stocks since joining the average. It’s up about 13 points during that period, compared with just under seven for AT&T. The net result: The Dow is about 40 points higher than it would have been without the Apple-for-AT&T swap. That’s not a terribly impressive difference. But it’s a major improvement over the past few months. Now let’s talk about the U.S. market as a whole and the alleged “Trump bump” shorthand used to explain its increase since the November election. I say “alleged” because a president’s influence on the economy and the stock market is marginal. Unless, of course, a president does something brilliant (which hasn’t happened since President Trump’s inauguration) or something profoundly scary (which also hasn’t happened). Stocks tanked sharply in the futures market the evening of Nov. 8, when it became clear that Trump was going to be the surprise winner, then bounced back sharply, closed higher on Nov. 9, and then kept going up. But since March 1, the total value of U.S. stocks has fallen about $775 billion (2.85 percent), according to Wilshire Associates. In other words, for the past six weeks, the Trump bump has gone thump. Read about the “Trump thump”? I didn’t think so. As someone who has most of his net worth tied up in stocks, I’m rooting for higher prices. But I think that whatever happens is attributable to earnings, interest rates and the economy in the long run, and to market momentum over the short run. I don’t attribute the gains I’ve made to Trump. And I won’t blame him for declines, unless he does something profoundly foolish and dangerous and sets off a selling panic. Now to the index-active fund debate. Index funds are the “in” thing these days, sucking up cash that’s pouring out of actively managed funds. Because index funds seek to replicate an index rather than to outperform it, they’re less expensive to run than active funds, which incur serious expenses to hire stock pickers and analysts and frequently do lots of trading. Therefore, index funds collectively are lower-cost than active funds and will collectively outperform them. [How Vanguard’s decision to forgo profit has paid off for investors] But if you pick the right, relatively low-cost active fund, you can exceed indexes. That’s especially true in a down market because index funds by definition are 100 percent invested, and active funds have to keep cash reserves. In addition, active funds can invest in non-U.S. stocks, which U.S. index funds don’t do. If U.S. stocks begin to seriously underperform other markets, the index-active fund performance numbers could shift. I generally recommend index funds to people who want to get into the market but don’t know how. And I’ve got far more money in index funds than in active funds. But in some small tests I’ve been running, active funds (which I won’t name) have caught up to the index funds against which I’ve pitted them. Will the switch from active funds to index funds continue? Probably. But don’t be surprised if something happens to slow or even reverse the current trend. Because in the stock market, nothing is forever.

New, 90 comments The war for cheap computers is about to begin by Dieter Bohn@backlon Apr 14, 2017, 10:51am EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge It feels like a long time since we've had a great big knock-down, drag-out operating system battle. Windows vs. Mac shook out in the ’90s. iOS vs. Android is mostly settled. But another one is starting this summer if you know where to look. It's not in classic PCs, where the relative qualities between Mac and Windows have remained stable for some time now. It's not in phones, where the iPhone is dominant at the high end and Android owns massive marketshare. This time it's happening in one specific place: cheap computers. And the fight for it is going to be as brutal and fascinating as the ones we've seen before. The players aren't surprising at all: Google, Apple, and Microsoft. But this is a different kind of platform war, one where all three have a legitimate chance of coming out ahead. Over the past year, we've been watching the players line up. The operating systems and ecosystems that will be competing are the ones you'd probably guess: Google's Chrome OS (with Android apps) Apple's iOS (on the iPad) Microsoft’s Windows 10 Cloud (and new-style Windows apps) In all three cases, what you're looking at are "underpowered" operating systems that most people think can't be used as "real computers." But in all three cases, those assumptions are based more on preexisting biases than fundamental flaws. More to the point, I think Google, Microsoft, and Apple each have a roadmap for eliminating those flaws. A $500 PC could be good enough for nearly everybody, if the software is designed right All of which is kind of exciting! You can spend the next few months and years watching genuine competition between companies motivated to make the best possible products. And even better, those products will be available at prices that used to mean "crap" but will soon mean "why would I spend twice as much?" And if the web and app developers keep supporting all three, you won't have to compromise a ton by opting for any one of them. Let's break down exactly what Google, Apple, and Microsoft have in store for this battle. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Google and Chrome OS By now, Chrome OS feels like a known quantity. People understand that it's "just" a Chrome browser, but that the Chrome browser can do way more computer things that just open webpages. That's because many of those webpages are full-blown apps, some of which work pretty well even when you're offline. It's easy (and justified) to knock Chrome for being a bloated battery hog on your Mac or Windows PC — but the flip side is that when it's running on a computer custom-built just for Chrome, it tends to run much better. Nearly one year ago, Google announced that Android apps will run natively on Chrome OS. It wasn't (and may never be) the all-smoke, no-fire "Andromeda" hybrid OS. It'll just be Chrome OS with Android apps on it. They'll be resizeable, like any regular app window on a desktop computer, and they'll work better offline than web apps. The dream, then, is that Chrome will be able to take on a two-front battle with both the iPad and Windows. Against the iPad, Chrome OS will have a more powerful, desktop-class browser, real windowing, and more hardware options. Against Windows, it has easier software management and better performance at cheap price points. Most $500 Windows PCs are crap. Most $500 Chromebooks are great. Can Google finally make Android apps good on big screens? But as I noted in February when I looked at how that Android Beta is coming along, that dream is presently a nightmare. Chrome OS's challenges are twofold. First, there's the new challenge of making Android apps run well on top of Chrome OS and on top of the various hardware architectures it has to support. We should know very soon if Google has figured that out, as the long-running beta is supposed to be over this month. The second challenge is the harder one: Android apps on big screens have been bad for as long as there have been Android apps on big screens. Developers have focused on phones to the detriment of tablets, and over the years the number of Android tablets has dwindled down. Today there's only one or two that are even worth mentioning, and you shouldn't buy them anyway. But if Google succeeds in its goals, that advice will rapidly change. That's because this Android on Chrome OS plan means Chrome OS tablets are coming. I doubt Android apps will be great on tablet or laptop screens this year, but that will be less of a problem than it was before because you can just use Chrome web app versions of most of the ones you want instead. Apple and the iPad Ever since Apple introduced the giant, 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015, it's been making the case that the iPad can replace your computer. It introduced a smaller, less-expensive iPad Pro last year and has even been running ad campaigns that argue that it's just as good as a "real" computer. So the answer to the question "what is Apple's cheap computer" already seems settled. Apple has made its bet: it's the iPad. Rumors and speculation that Apple will put the Mac on an ARM-based processor may well turn out to be true someday, but I believe that Apple would rather improve iOS and the iPad to take on Chrome OS and Windows at the low-end than try to produce a hobbled Mac that works well on the cheap. Apple's strategy is slightly more nuanced, price-wise, than either Google or Microsoft. Those companies will have products coming in at multiple price points, but the best stuff will probably hover around $500. For Apple, there's a low-end iPad without keyboard and stylus, or the Pros that start at $599 and go up as you add necessary accessories. And Apple's not wrong at all in this strategy. The iPad Pros are very powerful, very capable computers. They have several huge advantages over their two competitors. Several million advantages, in fact, and they're called iPad apps. Compared to both Android and modern-style Windows Store apps, there are so many more good quality iPad apps that it's not even a discussion. The other big advantage for the iPad is simply that it's good hardware running an operating system that was designed for it. That means that the OS is much faster even though it runs on relatively inexpensive hardware. Even the most recent non-Pro iPad, which lacks a keyboard connector and stylus support, feels faster than any other computer you can get for $329. Making iPads work for multiple users is still a chore But one of the key reason that iPads feel so fast is that iOS was designed with a "mobile-first" mentality that constrains apps from doing much in the background. It's locks users out from making the kind of customizations they tend to expect on a "real" computer. Instead of moving windows around, you get a two-pane split screen. Instead of choosing your preferred browser and email client, you tend to get locked into Safari and Mail. I don't have the space here to litigate whether that philosophy of computing is good or bad, nor whether it's going to hurt Apple, nor even whether Apple will change it sometime soon. But I will point out that Apple does need to resolve some of the limitations in its OS fairly soon, because those limitations are precisely why Chrome OS is eating the iPad's lunch in the education market. I'm talking about multi-user support and updates, primarily. On Chrome (and increasingly on Windows), a new user simply needs to enter their user ID, wait a tick, and then they're logged in with all their apps and stuff ready to go. And if somebody else picks up that computer, they can't get into your stuff. If an administrator wants to wipe the computer, it's relatively simple. All of those features makes Chrome OS a dream for education and very compelling to the enterprise. Apple has created a system that allows for multi-user support for schools, but compared to the simplicity of Chrome OS it's still a convoluted system. More importantly, it's currently only available in schools. Any parent that's gritted their teeth as they handed their work iPad to a child knows what I'm talking about: iOS needs proper multi-user support. I'll be both shocked and disappointed if Apple doesn't address it at WWDC this June. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge Microsoft and Windows 10 Cloud Somewhat surprisingly, we know less about Microsoft's plans than we do about Apple’s and Google’s. All that will change on May 2nd, when Microsoft will hold a splashy event in New York that we expect will be focused on the rumored Windows 10 Cloud. We've been tracking this new version of Windows since January, and most indications are that it will be a lightweight iteration of Windows 10 designed to take on Chrome OS, especially in the education market. If the current rumors pan out, it will run Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps but either won't run (or will badly run) the traditional Windows apps you've been using since 1995. Microsoft needs to stop Chrome OS from taking over the low end of the market There are other reasons to think that Microsoft is setting itself up to attack Chrome OS in the education market. The biggest? One of its top executives, Joe Belfiore, has just come back from a hiatus with a new job: “education sponsor and advocate in the Windows team.” Good timing! Another very obvious reason is the branding of this version of Windows. As Tom Warren has explained, the "cloud" in Windows 10 Cloud "doesn’t mean it’s literally powered by the cloud or streamed to a device." Instead, it'll likely focus on Microsoft's own services and generally imply that it's a lighter-weight OS, like Chrome OS. Microsoft will no doubt strenuously argue that this won't be "Windows Lite" — heck, it'll probably argue that calling it a "version" of Windows is the wrong terminology because all Windows 10 computers are simply Windows 10 computers. Microsoft is still bruised from all the (justified) criticism it ran into with multiple variants of Windows, to say nothing of the Windows RT debacle. But maybe that will be a mistake. A "lite" version of Windows could be exactly what most people want and need — it would be as simple to manage as Chrome OS, and it would run better on inexpensive hardware than full Windows does. And running better on inexpensive hardware has been an ongoing series of headaches for Microsoft. From netbooks to Windows RT, Microsoft has been trying to find a way to help its manufacturers drive down the cost of their devices without sacrificing performance. To date, it hasn't exactly been successful. The conventional wisdom is still that spending anything less than $500 or so means you'll get junky hardware, a slow computer, or both. But there's no inherent reason that Windows can't run well on cheap hardware. Windows 10 is a really good operating system that still doesn't get the credit it deserves for pushing desktop software forward. The problem is that many traditional Windows apps tend to just require more power than they really ought to. Windows still has an app gap The solution to that problem are those UWP apps, which is the terminology for apps that you get from the Windows Store that follow Microsoft's new design language and coding standards. They're the apps that put dynamic live tiles in the Start menu, snap to the side in clever ways, and generally just look better. The apps, in other words, that Microsoft needs way more of in order to execute on this plan. So far, the effort to get more developers to make more of those apps hasn't gone very smoothly. The lack of them is one of the main reasons that Windows RT bombed, and so many users assume that they're just underpowered and bad compared to traditional Windows apps. The big question for Microsoft is whether or not to allow Windows 10 Cloud to run traditional Windows apps — signs point to "no," though Belfiore did tell Mashable that he doesn't intend to make a version of Windows "that doesn’t run rich Windows apps." And we also know that Microsoft has found a way to get traditional Windows apps running on inexpensive ARM processors. We'll find out the answer to that question (and hopefully many others) on May 2nd. Get your popcorn In brief, here's how I see this upcoming fight for your next cheap computer shaping up: Google has a strong position in the education market, but has to prove it can make Android apps good on big screens. Apple has a dominant lead in quality apps, but the iOS platform needs to grow up a little more Microsoft has the most powerful operating system that can run on cheap hardware, but it needs more apps and better apps that can also run on cheap hardware. For years, all of the important action has happened on phones. They are, by far, the most important computers everybody owns. But that doesn't mean that there isn't opportunity for innovation on PCs and tablets. And for the first time in a long time, I think we're also going to see genuine competition in that space, as these three companies vie to convince you that you can get a great PC that does everything you need for less than $500.

The overall consensus appears to be that the company is testing two prototypes, one with the fingerprint scanner on the front and the other on the back. Offering evidence for the twin prototype theory is iDrop News, with the publication citing a Foxconn employee as a source. According to him, one iPhone 8 model currently being tested sports Touch ID on the front underneath the display, 4mm bezels running along the edge, and 2.5D contoured glass on the front and back held together by a metal frame. The insider also hints that the iPhone 8 features wireless charging, a 5.8-inch OLED screen, the same dimensions as the iPhone 7, an invisible selfie camera hidden underneath the panel, and a big power button with two points of contact. Most of these have been rumored before, with the notable exception of the last one. Also See: Red iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus to hit India this week The other possibility comes via a Weibo leak of the iPhone 8’s technical schematics. The image depicts the fingerprint reader on the back below the Apple logo, similar to a previous iDrop News report. The handset is apparently still in the early stages of testing, meaning it isn’t final yet. In a separate note obtained by AppleInsider, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri claims that Apple’s biggest bottleneck in manufacturing the iPhone 8 is integrating Touch ID underneath the screen. The yield rate of the brand’s own AuthenTec solution is supposedly very low. Arcuri thinks there are 3 possible solutions if Apple can’t manage to turn things around. The first would involve getting rid of fingerprint recognition and adopting only facial recognition, the second pushing the unit to the back, and the third delaying production of the iPhone but announcing it alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Arcuri’s research also turned up in another MacRumors report. The analyst believes that Apple will stuff all 3 new iPhones with 3GB of RAM. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are apparently going to be sold in the same regular 32/128/256GB models, but the iPhone 8 may be available only in 64GB and 256GB options. Interestingly, he also predicts that the iPhone 8 will feature two packs of batteries for extended battery life. Previous speculation has hinted towards a 2700mAh unit in an L shape to accommodate the new stacked logic board design.

Apple is looking to invest several billion dollars in the company for at least a 20% stake that it would share with Foxconn. Apple looking to team up with Foxconn for Toshiba NAND flash memory company bid Foxconn has already bid US$27 billion for Toshiba’s memory business, although Japan is leary of approving the offer if Toshiba accepts it. Foxconn isn’t a Japanese company, and is seen as an unwelcome outsider, just like when it purchased Sharp. Teaming up with Apple could, however, sweeten the pot enough to make the deal go through. Assuming the bid is accepting, Apple wants Foxconn to own 30 percent of Toshiba, according to Reuters. Toshiba would still be an owner in the business, which could make the deal more acceptable to Japanese regulators. Toshiba is selling off its NAND flash memory business to cover a several billion dollar loss from its U.S.-based Westinghouse division that threatens the future of the entire company. Right now, Toshiba can’t repay its debts or secure loans to cover expenses. Once Toshiba has a buyer lined up it can use the deal as collateral for new loans. The Wrench in the Toshiba NAND Business Sale Apple and Foxconn aren’t the only companies bidding on Toshiba. Broadcom has partnered with Silver Lake Partners to bid on Toshiba’s business, and SK Hynix, and Western Digital are in the game, as well. Western Digital claims it should have exclusive negotiating rights because of its partnership Toshiba. The company said Toshiba putting its memory chip business up for sale like this violates their joint venture contract. Western Digital’s claim doesn’t seem to be slowing down the bidding process, but it’s possible the company could throw a legal wrench in the works at some point. Assuming Apple and Foxconn land the winning bid, this will be the first time Apple has been a memory chip company owner. The deal will be a big win for Foxconn because it’ll be able to provide Apple with iPhone and iPad memory chips in addition to building the devices. That, of course, is still a big “if.” Toshiba could accept a lower bid from a Japanese company, Japanese regulators could block an Apple and Foxconn buyout, and Western Digital could stall everything with lawsuits. Right now it’s a race for Toshiba to make a deal come together before its financial losses make the entire company implode.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Apple may be looking to bid on Toshiba’s chip-making business Apple may be looking to bid on Toshiba’s chip-making business Matthew Wilson 17 hours ago Channel, Component, Featured Tech News Toshiba has found itself in a tough spot financially recently, with the company recently admitting that its future is very much in doubt following its most recent financial report. As a result of this, it seems very likely that Toshiba may sell off its semiconductor business and it looks like there are already a few companies looking to buy, with Apple being the latest to join the list. According to reports today, Apple is currently considering teaming up with Foxconn in an effort to bid for Toshiba’s semiconductor business, which is currently the second largest flash memory maker in the world. With an investment of several billion dollars, Apple would take a stake in the business while Toshiba keeps a partial holding, according to a report from NHK (via Reuters). Apple has yet to comment but Toshiba has previously shown interest in buying up parts of Toshiba in the past. According to the report, Apple is looking for 20 percent ownership in the semiconductor business, while Foxconn gets 30 percent. Toshiba would then keep the remainder. However, this sale could end up being difficult to pull off, as Western Digital is a partner in Toshiba’s chip making business. A direct sale without keeping WD in the loop would be a violation of the joint venture contract. KitGuru Says: Toshiba seems to be a sinking ship at this point. However, with big names like Apple potentially looking to buy a stake in its semiconductor business, Toshiba may make enough money back to cover some of its debts.

Problem Solving | 07 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (3) Colonel Mustard in the Library with the Shift Key by Adam C. Engst I love a good mystery… as long as it has a solution. The case of the Library’s changing modifier key had me stumped for a while, but thankfully, our buddy Rob Griffiths figured it out. Starting with OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple hid the home folder’s Library folder (~/Library) to prevent users from meddling in it and causing trouble (see “Dealing with Lion’s Hidden Library,” 20 July 2011). We’ll ignore for the moment the question of whether this was a good move. To access that folder, you had to hold down the Option key and choose Go > Library in the Finder. If you were sufficiently irritated by having to do this, as many of us were, there was a Terminal command you could run to reveal the ~/Library folder within Finder windows permanently. (Remember, there are multiple Library folders in macOS; ~/Library is the one in your home folder. Oddly, Apple leaves /Library and /System/Library visible, even though users should never mess around in them.) In OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple pulled back a bit on pretending that we users weren’t capable enough to work in ~/Library, adding a Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window for the home folder. That checkbox appears only when your home folder is displayed in the frontmost Finder window, and if you’re in column view, you might need to select a folder inside the home folder. When that checkbox is selected, ~/Library appears in Finder windows, but Library does not appear in the Go menu unless you hold the Option key down too. In macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple made it so that checkbox adds Library to the Go menu too, and in 10.12.3, also added a keyboard shortcut — Command-Shift-L. However, Sierra is also where things started to get funky. For many people, including me, the old Option key trick stopped working in Sierra. That wasn’t a problem for me because I had permanently revealed my ~/Library folder long ago and seldom used the Finder’s Go menu. But I did notice that Option had stopped showing the Library menu item, and when Kirk McElhearn wrote a blog post about how the key had changed to Shift in one of Sierra’s minor updates, I was pleased to discover that, indeed, the Shift key now worked to show the Library folder in the Finder’s Go menu. I didn’t explore further because Kirk’s solution worked fine for me, and it solved Tonya’s confusion over the loss of the Option key trick as well. Thinking I was sharing a neat little trick, I mentioned it briefly in an email message to Take Control readers. Little did I realize the can of worms I was opening. Several people replied to say that Shift did not work for them, and Option still did. Lauri Reinhardt, who does support for Take Control, tested before passing those messages on to me. She found that, while the Shift key worked initially, after she toggled the Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window, Shift stopped adding Library to the Go menu, and Option started working again. Nothing she could do would make the Shift key work anymore. I confirmed that Shift still worked on both my iMac and my MacBook Air, toggled the checkbox on my iMac, and found exactly what Lauri had. A new test account showed that Option really was still the right key, but why had it been Shift for a while? Madness! I was stumped, so I tracked backward from Kirk’s post to Michael Tsai’s initial Twitter thread and then followed a link to a post by Rob Griffiths that explained the situation. Rob’s discovery was that relaunching the Finder (Control-Option-click its Dock icon and choose Relaunch) puts the Finder in a weird state where the Shift key takes over from the Option key. I was able to reproduce that as well. Doubly weird — this state persists across restarts! It’s a bug, and Rob reported it, so we hope Apple will fix it in a future macOS update. My suspicion is that this weird Finder state, which may date back to the Sierra betas, can be triggered in ways other than relaunching the Finder. Quitting or force-quitting the Finder from within Activity Monitor doesn’t seem to do it, but I can imagine other scenarios that might leave the Finder in an unusual state — a kernel panic, for instance, or a loss of power to the Mac. Over years of usage, it’s easy to see something like this happening to many people. Regardless, the practical upshot of this minor mystery is as follows: Sierra Power Users: If you’re running Sierra and you want ~/Library to be visible in Finder windows and in the Go menu, select your home folder, choose View > Show View Options, and select Show Library Folder. Regular Sierra Users: If you don’t mind getting to ~/Library via the Go menu in Sierra, open the Go menu and press the Option key to reveal the Library menu item. If the Option key doesn’t work, use the instructions in the previous bullet to show and then hide the Library, after which Option should work. OS X Users: Those using 10.7 Lion through 10.11 El Capitan should either use Option with the Finder’s Go menu or enter this Terminal command to make ~/Library show up in Finder windows permanently. chflags nohidden ~/Library/ Finally, why might you want to work in ~/Library? Lots of reasons, but in 2012, Ted Landau wrote an article for Mac Observer about the top six reasons to visit the Library folder. It’s old but remains essentially correct. Still, as Ted says, don’t mess around with files in ~/Library if you don’t know what you’re doing — you can cause real problems. Always make sure you have a backup first!

The report noted that Foxconn's chairman Terry Guo had said that demand for storage would start rising as the 8K resolution era arrived. Then news surfaced that the Japanese government would shut out Chinese bids for reasons of security. To get around Japanese regulations, the one time Foxconn-TSMC deal could become a Foxconn-Apple deal (or Foxconn-Softbank deal) and ensure that Toshiba remained a Japanese company.   We noted in a report on April first that a Nikkei report was first to throw Apple's name into the bid for Toshiba even though Apple wasn't listed as one of the ten official bidders.   Today, a Reuters report confirmed that currently Toshiba has narrowed the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors: Broadcom, SK Hynix, Western Digital and Foxconn. SK Hynix   The speculation now is that because Foxconn's bid dropped TSMC as a partner, that Foxconn looked to Apple as a backer to secure the deal. Toshiba, Foxconn nor Apple have commented officially on Apple being involved in the Foxconn bid. Yet Reuters is going full tilt in the belief that such a bid is on the table by quoting the Japanese public broadcaster NHK who reported earlier today that "Apple Inc is considering teaming up with its supplier Foxconn to bid for Toshiba Corp's semiconductor business."   The NHK, citing unidentified sources, stated that "The U.S. technology giant is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 percent as part of a plan that would have Toshiba keep a partial holding so the business remains under U.S. and Japanese control."   The NHK further noted that the idea would be to allay Japanese government concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a potential risk to national security. They also added that Apple wants Foxconn to own a stake of around 30 percent of Toshiba's chip business.   One fly in the ointment is that Western Digital Corp, Toshiba's partner and one of the bidders for its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm's plans to sell its chip unit violates a joint venture contract. Western Digital wants to be given exclusive negotiating rights. For more on this read the full Reuters report.   On Tuesday Toshiba warned it may not continue as a 'going concern. In their twice-delayed financial report they noted that there are material events and conditions that raise the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.   Last Sunday Bloomberg reported that Foxconn (Hon Hai's) has the highest bid on the table, so having Apple enter the scene now is an interesting twist. Foxconn's Terry Gou acquired Japan's Sharp last year, so Gou has the know-how to work with the Japanese government.   And, should Apple not be a part of the deal, Foxconn could always get needed funding from Japanese partner Softbank via it's technology fund that both Foxconn and Apple have invested in. The connection to Japan's SoftBank could be the key to a deal for the Foxconn bid. Remember that Foxconn and SoftBank have a joint venture for designing ARM chips and so having Toshiba would be a nice fit for both Foxconn and SoftBank.   If anything, the tension is building and it's going to be interesting to see how this concludes in the coming weeks.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile It looks like the iPhone 8 will be even sleeker than we thought Image Source: Vianney le Masne Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 14th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet With Apple reportedly still trying to improve yields associated with embedding the Touch ID sensor into the iPhone 8 display, a new report from iDropNews suggests that the company will not opt to place the sensor on the back of the device. This is particularly encouraging news as a recently leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 seemed to indicate otherwise. As it turns out, the leaked iPhone 8 schematic we highlighted yesterday is in the EVT (Engineering Validation Test) phase, which is to say that it’s just one of many prototypes Apple was busy exploring. Indeed, it’s no secret that Apple often tests a handful of different iPhone models before choosing a final design and sending it off for mass production. Once a final design is approved, it goes through DVT (Design Validation Test) phase. In other words, there’s still plenty of reason for iPhone enthusiasts hoping for a radical new redesign to get excited. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive That said, iDropNews, citing a source working within Foxconn, writes that Apple is currently testing two different iPhone 8 designs but that the design likely to enter mass production will be the sleek-looking device with an embedded Touch ID we’ve been dreaming of. [The] informant divulged there are two iPhone 8 prototypes currently being tested. The first model features Touch ID on the rear, however the second model does in fact feature Touch ID underneath the display. There are a few major differences between the two prototypes listed below. Based on the following information, we’re hoping this version becomes the official design for the iPhone 8, and the source is confident that it will be. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire OLED display. Additionally, the report relays that the device will feature an ‘invisible’ front-facing camera along with a larger power button. Helping us envision what this mythical iPhone 8 might look like, iDropNews yesterday published some eye-popping new renders which provide us with clearer idea as to what the final iPhone 8 design will look like. Image Source: iDropNews Image Source: iDropNews Placing the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8 would certainly make life easier for Apple engineers, but such a design would undoubtedly be a huge step backwards with respect to usability. An edgeless display is certainly something most everyone wants to see, but sacrificing easy access to Touch ID — a feature most people use dozens of times a day at the very least — would be a net negative as far as the overall design is concerned. Design issues aside, an analyst report recently disclosed that the iPhone 8 will include 3GB of RAM and will come in 64GB and 256GB storage options. Additionally, Apple’s next-gen device will reportedly include improved water resistance, fast-charging capabilities, and incredible battery life.

Apple is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 percent as part of a plan that would have Toshiba keep a partial holding so the business remains under US and Japanese control, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing unidentified sources. The idea would be to allay Japanese government concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a potential risk to national security, the broadcaster said. Apple was not immediately available to comment. Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesman said he could not comment on specific transactions. Foxconn, which participated in the first round of the chip sale auction, has been considered a national security risk due to its ties with China. The bulk of Apple’s iPhones are made at Foxconn’s extensive manufacturing base there. NHK said Apple wants Foxconn to own a stake of around 30 percent of Toshiba’s chip business. An investment by Apple would be its first direct stake in a major global memory chipmaker, as it seeks to secure a stable supply of key components. Samsung Electronics is the biggest maker of flash memory chips, followed by Toshiba, SK Hynix and U.S.-based Micron Technology.

Hanna HowardApr 14, 2017 9:09AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestiDrop News Even though we're still months away from its launch, the never-ending stream of iPhone 8 rumors have been continually piquing our interest (though, let's be real, we're interested in any new product Apple puts out). From suggestions that the new phone could cost up to $1,000 — we're saving our pennies — to a hinted Workflow integration that would automate much of how we use our device. Now new reports say that Apple is working on two versions of the iPhone 8, each of them with some exciting features — but experts don't expect both to make it to market. The iDrop News leak citing sources from an Apple manufacturing partner the two prototypes have different features, and if the more ambitious design makes it through testing, that's the one we'll see when the iPhone 8 hits Apple stores. So what could we possibly expect from the new phone? According to iDrop News: Front-facing Touch ID beneath the display. 4mm bezels around the entire edge of the device. 2.5D contoured glass on the front and back of the device surrounded by a metal frame. Wireless charging. 5.8″ OLED display. “Invisible” front-facing camera hidden underneath the display. Large power button featuring two points of contact. Reason unknown. And if you're not excited already, iDrop has concept images of what this all could look like...and it's pretty awesome. But before we pin all of our hopes on that huge glass screen and wireless charging (um, too late) they also remind us that there's another version of the phone in case this dream falls through. That iPhone 8, according to Forbes, would be bigger than the iPhone 7 — instead of the same size with larger screen — and the back would be aluminum, eliminating the chance of wireless charging. The rear cameras would also get a vertical alignment as opposed to the current horizontal configuration on the iPhone 7, though experts haven't said whether that improves your pics. But if everything goes as planned, we'll see that first version hit stores — and our hands — before the end of the year.

Qualcomm’s share price is down 19% so far this year. We saw recently the impact on the share price of Imagination Technologies when Apple announced that it expected to stop using the company’s GPU tech within two years. The stock plummeted by 70%, reducing its market valuation by hundred of millions of dollars. Not surprising when it turns out that royalty payments from Apple on the company’s chip designs forms almost half of the company’s income – and it is not the only company to be so heavily dependent on Apple’s business … NordVPN Statista has put together an interesting chart (below) showing the other companies which rely on Apple for between half and three-quarters of their total sales. As our chart illustrates, many companies from different fields have their relationship with Apple to thank for more than 50 percent of their annual revenue. Relying on a single customer in such a way poses a big risk, which is why Apple’s publicly-listed suppliers often trade at lower multiples than similar companies with a more diverse customer base. It also puts Apple in a position of power in contract negotiations, where the iPhone maker can use its leverage to dictate terms and conditions. Imagination is also not the only one on the list to be at specific risk. A recent report suggested that Apple may also be planning to drop Dialog as a supplier, and Credit Suisse believes that Cirrus Logic is at ‘medium to low risk.’ The remaining companies on the list are Foxconn, Japan Display and Glu Mobile.

By: Bloomberg | Tokyo | Published:April 14, 2017 6:01 pm Apple’s entry into the auction may improve Toshiba’s prospects for emerging from a fiasco in its Westinghouse nuclear business that has led to billions of dollars in losses. (Source: Bloomberg) The iPhone maker is actively looking at options for helping the troubled Japanese company by investing in its semiconductor unit, which has been put up for sale, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple is considering a range of options from partnering with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to joining with Japanese investors on a bid, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private. SoftBank Group Corp. is considering getting involved in the Toshiba chip unit bidding and may cooperate with Hon Hai or Apple, the people said. Apple’s entry into the auction may improve Toshiba’s prospects for emerging from a fiasco in its Westinghouse nuclear business that has led to billions of dollars in losses. Toshiba needs to raise money from the semiconductor sale to plug the hole in its balance sheet, but the bidding process so far has been rocky. The Tokyo-based company is wary of Hon Hai’s bid to take full control of the chips unit on its own because it anticipates Japanese and US governments would object. Mitsuhiro Kurano, a spokesman for SoftBank, declined to comment. Representatives for Apple in Japan didn’t respond to calls for comment. The iPhone maker’s move caps a hectic week for Toshiba. First, the 142-year-old electronics conglomerate warned it may not be able to continue as a going concern because of the Westinghouse losses. Then, amid signs of progress in the company’s efforts to sell its semiconductor unit, joint-venture partner Western Digital Corp. notified Toshiba such a sale may violate their contract. “How do you even judge what happened this week for Toshiba?” said Kazunori Ito, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Services. “One positive is that the company showed third-quarter profits in the memory business, giving some assurance it may sell it for a good price. But there are so many negatives, I don’t even know where to begin.” Toshiba’s memory chips are used in smartphones, personal computers and data centers, putting them at the heart of a shift away from hard drives. The semiconductor unit, which reported this week healthy profit growth in the memory unit, has fetched proposed prices of 2 trillion to 3 trillion yen, with Hon Hai, Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. and chipmaker Broadcom Ltd. emerging as the most aggressive bidders. The twists and turns won’t go away anytime soon. Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit, which is behind a 716.6 billion yen impairment at the center of the imbroglio, is mired in lawsuits and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Also Read:  Toshiba warns Westinghouse Nuclear losses jeopardize its future On Tuesday, Toshiba took the unusual step of reporting third-quarter earnings without approval from its auditors. Toshiba said losses last year had left it with negative shareholders equity of 225.6 billion yen at the end of December. Toshiba has been at odds with PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata over accounting at Westinghouse, where the billions of dollars in losses stem from cost overruns on nuclear construction projects. This further jeopardized Toshiba’s listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The TSE kept Toshiba on its list of securities on alert in a December announcement, after originally being included for overstating profits from 2008 through 2014. Toshiba last month submitted a report detailing plans to improve internal controls. If deemed insufficient, the company will face delisting. Then in the middle of the week, news emerged that Steve Milligan, Western Digital’s chief executive officer, warned a sale may violate a joint venture it has with Toshiba. He wrote a letter to Toshiba’s board on April 9 advising them that they should negotiate exclusively with his company before any sale and that the proposed offers were more than the fair and supportable value of the chip business, according to a person familiar with the process. Also Read:Google, Amazon eye Toshiba’s chip unit, says Report Toshiba shares fell as much as 8.1 percent in Tokyo on Friday, but pared losses after NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster, reported on Apple’s plans. The stock fell 5.4 percent to 198.7 yen in Tokyo, leaving it down 30 percent this year. Apple has not made a definitive decision about what role it will play in the chips sale, if any, the people said. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has an interest in the unit’s future because iPhones and iPads use flash-memory. Apple could take a minority stake in the chip business with Japanese finance firms, as well as working with Hon Hai or SoftBank, the people said. It’s not clear whether SoftBank is weighing an investment in the Toshiba chips unit or another role, the people said. The Tokyo-based company is in the process of raising a $100 billion fund and has yet to close the initial investment round. “The share price right now is a pretty reasonable assessment of what Toshiba is worth without the flash memory business, assuming there is no delisting or bankruptcy,” Morningstar’s Ito said.

An alleged  schematics of an iPhone 8 has emerged online, offering what could be the best look yet at the upcoming flagship smartphone. The leaked image has been posted on a Chinese social networking site Weibo (via Slashleaks) and is supposed to have come from inside Foxconn, which also happens to be the manufacturing partner for Apple. The schematics gives us a closer look at the upcoming iPhone 8. As you can see, the screen dominates the front side of the device, similar to that of the Galaxy S8. Compared to an iPhone 7, the top and bottom bezels are significantly smaller. On the back, the dual rear camera system and flash is stacked vertically in the top-left corner. Also, you can see the a Touch ID fingerprint sensor below the Apple logo. Also read: Apple iPhone 8: OLED display, possible launch delay and other rumours The rendering is supposed to be a third reversion of the Engineering Validation Test (EVT).

X Apple reportedly considering bid for Toshiba chip business Tech giant said to be keen to take stake of more than 20 per cent in troubled firm Fri, Apr 14, 2017, 06:56 Apple is said to be keen on investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 per cent in Toshiba’s semiconductor business.         Apple is considering teaming up with its supplier Foxconn to bid for Toshiba Corp’s semiconductor business, public broadcaster NHK said on Friday – the latest twist in the sale of the world’s second-biggest flash memory chipmaker. Apple is said to be keen on investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 per cent in a plan that would have Toshiba maintain a partial stake to keep the business under US and Japanese control, NHK reported, citing an unidentified source. The proposal is aimed at allaying the Japanese government’s concerns over any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a risk to national security, it said. Apple was not immediate available to comment. Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. The report comes as Western Digital, Toshiba’s partner and one of the bidders of its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm is violating a joint venture contract in plans to sell to its chip unit, and urged that it be given exclusive negotiating rights. Toshiba has narrowed down the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors, sources have said previously. They are US chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners; South Korean chip maker SK Hynix; Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics maker, and Western Digital. – (Reuters)       Topics: Japanese Government Apple Broadcom Foxconn Nhk Silver Lake Toshiba Western Digital Read More Apple may ditch Dialog, analyst says, hitting chipmaker’s shares Toshiba files results unapproved by auditor; warns of ‘going concern’ risk Samsung to roll out contactless pay in UK, Ireland  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Tetrarch lodges planning application for €65m scheme Work Preparation key to dealing with trauma of product recalls Sport João Carvalho: The life and death of a cage fighter Innovation The 94-year-old professor heralding a new type of long-lasting battery Sponsored Ten thrifty tips to brighten up your home Let a Hume PhD scholarship unlock your potential at Maynooth University Broadband and digital technology essential for Irish business growth Lifting the diamond to a higher level Latest Business AIB’s offloading of Project Cypress distressed loans is timely 07:00 Stress test shows economy vulnerable on interest rates 07:00 Republic should be next to introduce gender pay audits 06:20 Zoetis pays $85m for Irish petcare biopharma Nexvet 06:00 Is there a boom?

Loses Top Smartphone Vendor Crown to Samsung (AAPL) Recent Posts: The Growing Perils of Being an Apple (AAPL) iPhone Supplier Report: Apple Inc. Is Making an Apple Watch for Diabetics (AAPL) Apple Inc. Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC Declines View All Posts Companies compete hard to be an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone supplier. Winning a contract to supply iPhone components can be a big deal — after all, AAPL sold more than 210 million finished devices last year alone. But there’s a dark side to being a a link in the iPhone supply chain. Source: Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified) Because Apple boasts the highest profit margins in the business, the company is always squeezing suppliers for lower prices. And if a component is deemed critical to the iPhone’s success, AAPL may take it in-house. In just the past several weeks, three suppliers have learned their iPhone business is at risk, with reports that Apple may move to designing their components itself. The latest to be singled out is Synaptics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA), maker of the iPhone’s display driver chip. Companies Go to Great Lengths to be an Apple Supplier There are dozens of primary components that make up an iPhone and hundreds of smaller bits, from screws to camera lenses. With the kind of volume an AAPL order offers, companies are willing to go to great lengths to win a contract to produce iPhone components. For example, last year Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) was reportedly spending $6.82 billion to expand its OLED production capacity by 50% in order to meet the volume AAPL will need for iPhone 8 displays. British chipmaker Imagination Tech. (OTCMKTS:IGNMF) saw its stock increase nearly 1,500% in three and a half years after signing a 2008 deal to design a graphics chip for AAPL’s iPhone. Its business as an Apple supplier now generates more than half of Imagination’s total revenue. Supplying iPhone Components Can be Risky Business Being an Apple supplier is not without risk, and recently it’s become even more so. Some companies implode under AAPL’s demands. GT Advanced Technologies Inc (OTCMKTS:GTATQ) is a classic example of this problem. Tapped to produce sapphire glass for the iPhone, the company signed a $578 million dollar contract with Apple in 2013. Under pressure to rapidly expand its operations and unable to meet Apple’s aggressive demands, GTAT was forced into bankruptcy by 2014.

Apple’s professional video editing software is used to make lots of Hollywood TV shows and movies. Now they have an editing app for the rest of us called Clips. Clips makes it easy for the average person to make slick little videos to share on social media or with friends. The free app works on iPhones and iPads and helps you create cool videos for social media in minutes. There are lots of fun effects and the best part is that you can learn it just by playing around. If you have a little knowledge of video editing it will be even easier to get the hang of, but no prior editing experience is necessary. You start building your project with photos and video that already live on your phone, or you can shoot a new picture or video straight into Clips. You can even do live voiceovers by enabling your phone’s microphone as you shoot. There are lots of fun filters to instantly transform the look of your video – two fun ones are comic book and line art. You can get really creative from here – Apple has made the task of adding on-screen graphics easy. You can drop in animated text, emoji and even full-screen graphics. One of the coolest features is called Live Titles. This lets you add captions that sync up perfectly with your voice. This way people can see what you’re saying and read it on screen at the same time. There are various styles to choose from and the transcription and sync is really great. Of course, if Siri gets something wrong you can always go in and correct the words. Once you create something, just about everything can be tweaked – the length of clips, the on-screen text, the audio and more. There are some non-obvious tricks too. You can move around your photos as you record them to your project and zoom into your videos too. This is stuff that takes professional editors lots of know-how. When you’re ready to give your creation a soundtrack, Apple has dozens of free tracks to choose from. Again, just like a pro the app will automatically clip the music to fit your project, so your music has a natural ending and doesn’t abruptly cut off. For a version 1.0 of the program, Clips is surprisingly full featured and well done. But keep in mind, this is a hands-on approach to editing. In the past I’ve covered other editing programs such as Google Photos, Magisto and Adobe Clip that will auto-magically create movies from your photos and videos. There is no way for Clips to autogenerate a project. This requires your creativity, but that’s part of the fun. When you’re ready to share, Apple will suggest the people in your video, or you can export to other apps including Facebook, Instagram, your camera roll and more. If you’re feeling creative, Clips is definitely a fun little way to make videos. It’s free, so it’s worth a download to check out. Just keep in mind your Apple device has to be running the latest version of iOS – 10.3 – to install it.

"As Apple continues our renewable energy efforts, we're thrilled to work alongside our manufacturing partners to advance China's green future," said Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, in an email to Xinhua. The tech giant earlier saw four major suppliers commit to doing so by the end of next year in a supplier clean energy program, according to Jackson. Three more suppliers in China -- Sunwoda, Compal and Biel -- will join this program and power all Apple production with renewable sources, Jackson said. To fulfill this commitment, Compal Electronics, a final assembly supplier for iPad, is constructing solar panels totalling 12.6 megawatts across 224,000 square meters of rooftop space at its facilities in Nanjing and Kunshan in east China's Jiangsu Province. Sunwoda Electronics, a Shenzhen-based battery supplier, has built a 50-megawatt solar farm in central China's Henan Province. The solar plant, which is 90-percent owned by Sunwoda, will produce more clean electricity than the power that Sunwoda uses in battery production for Apple. Biel Crystal Manufactory, a glass supplier in Huizhou of south China's Guangdong Province, derives 50 percent of its energy from wind and solar. The company vows to increase the proportion to 100 percent in 2018. "These companies are leading the way to a greener supply chain in China, demonstrating that protecting the environment also makes good business sense," said Jackson. In recent years, Apple has made efforts to improve the environmental impact of its production and operation. Jackson said Apple is now powering 96 percent of its global facilities, including offices, retail stores and data centers with renewable energy. Meanwhile, Apple will continue to plant or protect enough fast-growing forests around the world to meet its growing paper demands in product packaging, Jackson said.

The iOS 10.3.1 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is now available and today we want to walk you through the most important things to know as we push away from today’s release. Apple recently released two new versions of iOS 10.3. One version, iOS 10.3.2, is an unreleased bug fixer that’s in beta testing ahead of an unknown release date. The other version, iOS 10.3.1, is a small maintenance release for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 is available right now for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models capable of running Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. While it’s not as big as its predecessor (iOS 10.3), iOS 10.3.1 is still an important release. It comes with a security patch and some bug fixes and it could also have a dramatic effect on your device’s overall performance. With that in mind, we want to walk you through the most important things to know, right now, about iOS 10.3.1. iOS 10.3.1 Review: Should You Install? The iOS 10.3.1 update is tiny if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.3. On the iPhone 7, you can expect a 30MB download. We were able to finish up the the download in a matter of seconds though the installation process took about 5 minutes to complete on our phone. We recommend putting aside 10 minutes or so to monitor the situation. Our installation went smoothly but there’s no telling what you might encounter. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older than iOS 10.3 your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3’s features and fixes will be baked into your update so make sure you put aside 30 minutes or so to monitor the installation. In the day since its release we’ve downloaded and installed the update on five versions of the iPhone: iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. If you want some quick feedback, head to those links. We’ve also installed the software on four versions of the iPad including the iPad Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro. Right now, iOS 10.3.1 is looking good. And given what’s on board (an important fix for a potential Wi-Fi exploit), it’s definitely worth a look if you own one of these devices. If you need more feedback about iOS 10.3.1 and its changes, take a look at our reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. iOS 10.3.1: What’s New The iOS 10.3.1 change log states the update comes with bug fixes and security patches meaning it’s a maintenance update. Don’t expect any new features on board. Apple lists the iOS 10.3.1 update as having an single security patch. The update also reportedly fixes unnamed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c issues. That said, if you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, you’ll get a bunch of new features with iOS 10.3.1 due to iOS 10.3. If you’re unfamiliar with iOS 10.3 we recommend taking a look at our walkthrough so that you can get familiar with its features before you install iOS 10.3.1 on your device. It’s also worth noting that Apple’s Clips application is finally out on the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad. Clips is available for select devices running iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s a small update but the iOS 10.3.1 update is causing problems for many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. iOS 10.3.1 users are complaining about battery drain, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, various first and third-party apps, lag, random reboots, and more. We expect complaints to pickup as more people find and discover the iOS 10.3.1 update lurking in Settings or on iTunes. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems. You’ll also want to take a look at our tips to improve performance. You’ll also want to report any issues you see to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix for the issue. Note: You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to fix performance issues. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 which means you’re stuck on iOS 10.3.1 until the company rolls out a new update. iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak If you’re jailbroken, skip the iOS 10.3.1 update for now. Jailbreak developers haven’t released a working jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 and we’re not expecting one for iOS 10.3.1 today or in the near future. For now, you must be on iOS 10.2 or something older to jailbreak an iPhone or an iPad. Unfortunately, there’s no way to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, see our roundup. What’s Next With the iOS 10.3.1 release out of the way, Apple’s now focused on iOS 10.3.2, another maintenance update. Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta for developers and the general public. We still don’t have a release date and we might not get one ahead of time. Apple typically doesn’t confirm iOS release dates ahead of time. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 update out ahead of its release, note that early software can and probably will cause problems on your device. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our walkthrough. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 3 Responses 04/05/2017 H. Mitchell Reply I would like to see a fix for the recent calls listed on mutiple devices linked to the same apple id. Apple seems to store your call history ‘somewhere’ and my recent calls are displayed on my husband’s and daughter’s device (and vice versa). Apple has no business with my call history, this is private information and should only be accessible by my service provider and myself. Call history should not be linked via an apple id. 04/10/2017 Sebastian Reply DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE! I have had several problems. I gave an iPhone 6s. 2 factor authentication did not work. When I got a hold of apple support they said to turn it off and wait for the next update. Worst part, my battery gets depleted very rapidly. Within 30 minutes my fully charged phone died! 04/14/2017 Thomas Meredith Reply Ever since I have done the update. My messaging system is saying waiting on activation. I can no longer message anyone. How do I fix this? Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Guide to the car smartphone hook-up system Image 1 of 5 Image 1 of 5 14 Apr, 2017 10:00am Chris Rosamond facebook twitter google+ email Our guide to Mirrorlink the most popular automotive smartphone integration system that mirrors your phone screen in your car. MirrorLink is a car based technology system that is designed to allow you to safely access information, entertainment and communication features of your mobile phone while driving. MirrorLink has become increasingly popular alongside similar systems like Apple CarPlay for iPhone users and Android Auto, because as smartphone users become ever more reliant on their devices, the advantages of accessing apps, playlists and data on the move have become more and more appealing. The big difference between the three systems is that while Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are closed proprietary systems with ‘built in’ software for functions such as navigation or voice controls – as well as the ability to run certain externally developed apps – MirrorLink has been developed as an entirely open source system. • Best sat-nav apps: 2016 group test Originally developed by Nokia for its own mobile phones, MirrorLink compatible phones are now much more widespread since the tech has been taken over by the Car Connectivity Consortium, which is a non-profit industry body dedicated to safe and simple connections between vehicles and smartphones of any make. Its aim is to work with as many individual smartphone operating systems as possible, and various MirrorLink Android phones are available, although iPhones are not currently supported and you can check which phone models can be connected at the MirrorLink website. Either way, MirrorLink claims it is currently the industry leader as it is available on more cars and smartphones than any rival system. Do many cars and phones have MirrorLink? There are dozens of consortium members, and CCC car makers include Citroen, Fiat, Honda, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru and the VW group. CCC phone makers include HTC, Huawei, LG, Samsung and Sony, while Alpine, Bosch, Clarion, Denso, Harman, Panasonic and Pioneer are amongst the participating members making infotainment hardware for cars. With such a wide range of Mirrorlink compatible brands and hardware, the system has several advantages over proprietary systems from Apple or Android. • Car infotainment systems test The open source approach means any developers around the world can seek approval for new MirrorLink apps. If they meet the CCC standards they can be certified for use with the system, leaving drivers free to download the MirrorLink apps they want to their smartphones. If you’re concerned about the future of data privacy and the ‘big brother’ nature of emerging technologies though, you may not like the what the Car Connectivity Consortium has up its sleeve for future development. They are currently exploring technology that will enable MirrorLink to be used as a data sharing system suitable for usage based car insurance. This will enable MirrorLink to send information about your journeys, speed and driving style to third parties, all via an insurance company app on your smartphone.  How does MirrorLink work? That’s a question with two answers depending on whether you’re asking from a user’s perspective or from a technical point of view. From the user’s perspective, it couldn’t be simpler. First make sure you have downloaded MirrorLink compatible apps to your phone – we’ve highlighted some below, but for a fuller list visit the MirrorLink apps list on the official website.  Then, once inside your vehicle, your phone must be connected to the MirrorLink onboard system using a cable connection to the car’s USB port or via Bluetooth. If your car has multiple phone connection systems installed – e.g. CarPlay and MirrorLink, you may have to go into vehicle settings and select the correct system. After that, you select your smartphone settings screen, find a ‘connections’ tab, and select the MirrorLink option. The MirrorLink display should appear on your vehicle’s touchscreen and you can navigate through compatible apps on your phone using the big on-screen icons. Voice control systems, and controls on your steering wheel will also work with MirrorLink too, but your mobile phone itself cannot be used to control functions while the MirrorLink dashboard interface is enabled. The technical point of view is far too complicated for the purposes of this guide, but basically the MirrorLink system works with a variety of existing technologies such as IP, USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RTP and VNC, integrates various car signals like GPS location and vehicle speed, plus system control hardware, and makes it all work seamlessly thanks to clever coding. Using MirrorLink Apps Although this system is called MirrorLink because it theoretically ‘mirrors’ your phone screen on the dashboard, in fact the MirrorLink dash interface is far less complicated than your phone. Part of the reason is that it creates big ‘driver friendly’ icons for the touchscreen, but it’s also because there are only a limited number of MirrorLink apps that you can download and run. • Best sat-nav systems However, as well as the expected apps like Facebook, Twitter and Spotify, and a host of radio apps, weather, travel info, Parkpopedoa and car company apps, there are a few more intriguing selections available. For example Glympse, which allows you to send your position to friends or family, and for them to track your journey home, and others, which record vehicle data and provide tips on a more efficient driving style. More apps are under development all the time, too, and as well as the prospect of MirrorLink enabled insurance ‘black box’ apps, there’s a project underway to integrate MirrorLink with car makers’ keyless go systems. This will potentially be useful in all sorts of future scenarios like car sharing schemes where your smartphone will unlock vehicles for occasional use.  What phones are compatible with MirrorLink? As stated above, there’s a wide variety of mobile phones that will hook up to a MirrorLink enabled car, including most Android models. iPhones are not officially compatible as Apple prefers proprietary systems, but because MirrorLink is open source many pundits suspect there’ll be a workaround app developed by an independent third party that may bring the iPhone into the MirrorLink fold. We’ve not heard anything to confirm this, however.  What cars have MirrorLink fitted? MirrorLink is widely fitted to VW Group cars, as well as Fiat, Peugeot/Citroen, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, SMART, Suzuki and Toyota vehicles. The best and most up-to-date list of cars fitted with MirrorLink can be found on the official website. Have you used MirrorLink? Tells us what you thought of it in the comments section below...

Street12 Apr 2017Newport Beach, CA0 12 Apr, 2017 12 Apr, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Although Apple claims its fingerprint scanner is 5 times more secure than a typical 4-digit passcode, security researchers claim they have developed a set of fake MasterPrints that demonstrate criminal intruders could access 65 percent of fingerprint scanners. In a joint study by New York University and Michigan State published in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Transactions on Information Forensics & Security, researchers claim to be able to hack fingerprint scanners almost two-thirds of the time. Although human fingerprints are highly differentiated, the researchers discovered that enough pattern similarities existed, they could create a handful of master fingerprints that could fool most biometric readers. Mobile devices originally used numerical passcodes for login security, because there is only a 1 in 10,000 odds of guessing a 4-digit passcode and a 1 in 1,000,000 odds of guessing a 6-digit passcode. But simple transmission of numerical passcodes to an authenticating machine or a person have become increasingly vulnerable to electronic scanner data packet interception. To increase security, Apple led the move to biometric sensors with the acquisition of AuthenTec fingerprint identification software for $356 million in 2012. Claiming that the probability of its home button fingerprint scanner matching finding a match in two fingerprints is 1 in 50,000, Apple standardized Touch ID scanning access beginning with the iPhone 5S on September 10, 2013. A month later, Apple introduced the Touch ID fingerprint scanning for its 5th generation iPad. According to the Web Cusp blog, almost all high-end mobile devices from Samsung, Google, LG, Xiaomi, Sony, Motorola and many more also started offering fingerprint scanners in 2014. Apple Pay, iTunes Store, App Store and Android Pay also implemented fingerprint authentication in 2015. The Proctor Cars blog reported that auto manufacturers were expected to soon offer biometric fingerprint access as a standard vehicle feature. The NYU and Michigan State researchers’ reported that their claims of being able to access 65 percent of fingerprint enabled devices is based on computer simulations, not testing on actual devices. But researchers warned that with the technology available to unauthorized intruders to create fake fingerprints rapidly advancing, the percentage access rate availability for criminal intruders will move higher. Samsung received huge kudos on March 29 when they introduced iris scanning and facial recognition access with the release of their Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. But 2 days later, iDeviceHelp demonstrated on YouTube that facial recognition could be accessed with a picture. Both Apple Touch ID and Samsung are expected to soon introduce software patches to make their biometric sensors much more secure.

The tech giant is mulling a deal to join the growing number of suitors interested in the urgent firesale of Toshiba’s highly prized business as it struggles to plug the £9bn hole in its balance after the floundering and collapse of its US nuclear business Westinghouse. Apple is considering paying several billion dollars to take a more than 20 per cent control in the company to aide Foxconn’s bid by keeping the chip business under partial US control, according to the Japanese national state broadcaster. Foxconn, Hon Hai Precision Industry, reportedly made a $27bn play for the company earlier this week but faced a backlash from critics who said its close ties to China, where the majority of its operations are based, could pose regulatory approval delays which Toshiba can ill-afford. Foxconn has declined to comment to media reports and Apple was not available. Apple’s support for the FoxConn bid would hand a key advantage to the company over a rival bid from a fellow Apple supplier Broadcom. The US-based chipmaker is understood to have made a far lower $18bn bid for the company, but offers the reassurance of US owner. Meanwhile, Toshiba’s joint-venture partner Western Digital has also made a bid for the business and warned that the sale would be a breach of the pair’s contract unless it is offered exclusive negotiation rights ahead of rival bids.    South Korea's SK Hynix, another Apple memory supplier, is also understood to have submitted a bid but is said to be trying to recruit Japanese investors in order to clear political obstacles. Toshiba, which makes everything from flash memory drives to laptops and semiconductors, admitted it is considering selling some or all of UK nuclear developer NuGeneration to keep itself afloat.

Apple is considering teaming up with its supplier Foxconn to bid for Toshiba’s semiconductor business, public broadcaster NHK said on Friday […] Apple is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 percent. If the deal went through, it could be bad news for Samsung – but there are a couple of hurdles to be overcome before agreement could be reached … NordVPN The obvious rationale for Apple to take a significant stake in the business is to secure supplies of flash storage. After Samsung, Toshiba is the world’s second-largest manufacturer of flash memory, so having control of the company could allow Apple to reduce its dependence on Samsung components. However, the Foxconn element of the bid could prove problematic, as there are laws controlling the sale of ‘sensitive technology’ to investors the Japanese government considers a risk to national security. The relationship between Japan and China is often strained, and Taiwan’s own status as either an independent state or a part of China is a contentious issue. NHK’s source says that Apple’s plan would be for Toshiba to retain a partial stake, so that control of the company would be jointly held by Japan and the USA, with Foxconn having only a minority holding. A second complication is that one of the other bidders – Western Digital – alleges that Toshiba is violating a joint agreement between the two companies by inviting outside bids. Finally, two other players remain in the game: Broadcom and SK Hynix, chipmaking companies from the U.S. and South Korea respectively. It appears that another Apple supplier reported to be bidding, TSMC, has now dropped out. Apple appears to be attempting to reduce its dependence on outside suppliers as it designs more of its own chips, and having a sweetheart deal with a chip supplier would have obvious appeal.

Share Tweet Share Tags : T-Mobile-T-Mobile+ AT&T-AT&T+ Verizon-Verizon+ Sprint-Sprint+ iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Update (April 14): Two credible sources reported they have successfully received and installed 32-bit builds of iOS 10.3.2 on their iPhone 5 and 5c devices. As far as we know, such weren't available at the time of writing this article, or at the time of release of the first beta 10.3.2 iOS update, leading us to a conclusion that seemed overwhelmingly plausible. Therefore, we apologize for unintentionally misleading you. Chances are the iOS 10.3.2 update will be available for the iPhone 5 and 5c, although Apple will very likely drop support for these models in the iOS 11 update. The upcoming iOS 10.3.2 will be an unprecedented one, and not in a pleasant way. Apple is doing something very unusual in that it appears to be shutting down support for older iPhones in the middle of iOS 10's "shelf life", so to speak. Both beta iOS 10.3.2 releases available are skipping 32-bit devices altogether, which is out the norm. No former iOS release, beta or final, has ever done this unless it was a dedicated bug fix for a specific device. This means the 10.3.2 update won't reach an approximate 43.7 million iPhone owners who still use the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. These are the last 32-bit iPhones to run iOS 10, and they will be forever stuck on iOS 10.3.1. Apple is keeping quiet about this, but the writing's on the wall. Granted, that isn't a bad place to be, and the fact these ancient models run the latest operating system is a little miracle in itself (cough, Android). But it looks like Apple won't see them all the way to iOS 11. It's also setting up for the somewhat unfortunate possibility of cutting off device support mid-iOS cycle in the future. The iOS 10.3.2. update includes a fix for third-party virtual private network apps. New SiriKit car commands are now working, and some bugs have been exterminated. That's what the beta updates contain so far. In case you'd like to inquire about our approximation of the number of iPhone 5 and 5C owners – BMO Capital Markets estimated a 715 million total iPhone installed base in December 2016. Likewise, Mixpanel's April 10 stats on active iPhone models report a 6.11% combined share for the iPhone 5 (3.77%) and 5c (2.34%). Since Apple doesn't issue official data like this, these stats are the best we've got to work with. It's important to be transparent about this stuff in journalism's "fake news" era.

Sony for example updated old Xperia Z1 to Lollipop 5.1. It is great for Apple to have such long support, but lets face it from top to bottom - yea, long life support, in this case 5 years, but let see the difference between 10.3 for iPhone 6, 6S, 7 and 10.3 for iPhone 5: there is huge difference in functionality and prductivity. Latest OS updates on iPhone 5 laggs too much. It is limited 10.3 OS. Not full one. And fluidity of iPhone is gone/speaking for iPhone 5 with iOS 10.3/ From that perspective maybe, just maybe, most Android OEM's do not keep such long life of OS updates. My example: SONY Xperia Z1 will lagg and freaks with 6.0 or 7.0. That is why Sony stop updated old SD400 at 5.1. This is not a fight or fan words. Apple make very nice phones, but the same is valid for some Android OEM's. Cheers. posted on 3 days ago, 06:44 1 Reply 30.

Android OEM may not support their phone as well as apple but they also charge much less. Everything even out in the end. I chose go with Android route not because I like Google any particular Android OEM or that I hate apple. It's because Android has compelling mid range at the price range less than $300. The ecosystem is also less controlled by Google compared to Apple. Frankly it's just the less of two evils for me. Apple user choose apple for good reason. I understand that apple security update is currently top notch with better apps selection. posted on yesterday, 08:46 1 Reply 42. marorun (Posts: 4818; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) Take an ipbone 5C then iphone 6 then iphone 7. all on same ios.

So i will repeats. I take a stable android phone over an unstable ios phone. Too many update is as worst as too few. older android version only mean lesser security but thats can be handled with a good security program like bitdefender ( its protect against vulnerability1-2 days after they are out ) As for app support 99% of all app can be run on almost any android version as the API are updated directly by google. So stay with your false sense of security ( vulnerability only known after they are patched on ios even if they been there and exploited for years lol ) and stay with your unstable mess of 20 update per years. posted on 4 days ago, 01:57 1 Reply 6. cnour (Posts: 1189; Member since: 11 Sep 2014) Android lovers: shut up and don't talk about this.
