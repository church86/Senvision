Coys, a valuation and auctioneering company, sold the Aston for £825,000 using a social media platform known as Vero. Payment was taken via the Apple Pay app. The car is a right-hand-drive, silver birch model, that features red leather trim. It has been fully restored – with an engine rebuild and overhauled suspension and gearbox – after being kept in dry storage for 20 years. Earlier this month, Coys announced at the Paris Motor Show that a number of historic cars would be available for sale through Vero, including the aforementioned DB5. The car was also featured on the Coys exhibition stand at the famous motoring show. The anonymous buyer saw the car when it was on the stand in Paris, and made the decision to buy it almost immediately. Chris Routledge, CEO of COYS, said: “The proud new owner saw the DB5 at the Paris Motor Show, he was overjoyed to see the car of his dreams and didn’t want to lose it. “He was keen to quickly get in front of the queue, so a few days later he hit the ‘Buy Now’ button on Vero to guarantee the purchase, leaving two other collectors disappointed in his wake.” Routeledge added that the sale was an important milestone for Coys’ online presence, and signals a new era for classic car sales. “The ‘Buy Now’ feature on Vero will give informed and savvy collectors a crucial head start in a highly competitive market place,” he said. “Collectors worldwide fight fiercely amongst themselves to obtain the best machines and we certainly feel that Coys’ presence on Vero will give our clients that essential edge.” Ayman Hariri, co-founder and CEO of Vero, said: “Classic cars set the pulse racing like few other things. We’re delighted that Coys have chosen Vero as the platform to express their love of classic cars. “Coys remind us of the influence classic cars have on us through movies such as the Italian Job, Ronin, and of course, Bullitt. With Vero’s unique Buy-Now feature, Coys is offering collectors a new way to purchase the cars they’ve always dreamed of owning.” Other classic cars that are listed for sale on Coys’ Vero profile include a Ferrari Dino 246 that was once owned by Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant, a Ferrari Daytona and a Bentley Continental S2. apple PayAston MartinMotoringsocial mediavero Related Chris Evans 'relieved' Top Gun pilot was sick during Top Gear challenge Previous ArticleNext Article Newsletter Sign up Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. A shopkeeper dressed as an Apple store employee looks out from a window of a shop masquerading as a bona fide Apple store in China Credit: AP Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment.  Apple has long had to battle with the problem of counterfeit products, most notably in China, where dozens of fake Apple stores sprung up. Many of the stores look just like Apple's signature outlets, right down to the sales staff kitted out in blue T-shirts bearing the company's white logo and the sample iPads and iWatches displayed on sleek wooden tables. Where to buy | iPhone 7 and 7 Plus  In 2013, the company advised anyone worried their USB charger might be a counterfeit to take it into an Apple store and have it replaced by one made by the company.  It followed reports that a Chinese woman was electrocuted when she picked up a call on an iPhone 5 as it was charging. However, there have also been similar cases in Britain. Two years ago, the London Fire Brigade warned of fake iPhone chargers on sale in markets and online that could cause fires, electrocutions or burns. One  such device  caught fire and set alight to a house in Tottenham.  Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Apple iPhone Amazon Show more Technology latest 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

That's according to a lawsuit Apple filed Monday against Mobile Star LLC. Apple claims the chargers—manufactured by Mobile Star and wrongly bearing the Apple logo—"pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." According to Mashable, the lawsuit claims the cables and chargers are being sold "as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images." And they're being sold by both third-party sellers and Amazon itself. Apple says customers would have no reason to believe the faulty products are anything but the real deal. And it says that could damage its reputation, 9to5Mac reports. Apple says it routinely buys its own products off Amazon to make sure everything is on the up and up. Apple's lawsuit claims that over the past nine months, nearly 90% of the cables and chargers it purchased were counterfeit. Amazon is cooperating with Apple and has turned over its inventory of cables and chargers. In a statement, Amazon says it "has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." Apple is seeking $2 million per type of counterfeit product from Mobile Star.

Was that just to be greedy & sell more replacements?) 4) Now that I've tried out 1 Windows phone and 2 Androids, so far I've never had an issue with a cracked screen. It sure seems to me Apple screens crack more than their competitors. 5) Wifi antenna dying (fixed it twice by refluxing - putting the iPhone innards in the oven to melt and reflux the solder - but the fix only lasts so long. You can only pull this off once on a phone.). 6) Cables, chargers, covers, stands etc. - seem to cost 4 or 5 times more than BETTER equivalent standard equipment for non-Apple equipment. I have never experienced any of these problems with non Apple products. Scott Newbury Oct 21, 2016 9:36 AM CDT A few months ago, I bought a slew of these "knockoff" chargers and cables because I have had success with Amazon's audio and video cables, which are priced much more reasonably than the brand names, and among my family, we have several iPads, laptops, and phones, but the kids keep losing the chargers. Today, I wish I could return all of them (the chargers, not the kids...most days). Several of the cables are already falling apart, and clear compatability issues plague these chargers, which sometimes fluxuate between "charging" and "not charging" states while the device is plugged in and immobile. In this case, I agree with Apple. Avoid Amazon's chargers until they fix the quality problems.

However following the recall of the Galaxy Note 7 after reports of explosions, Apple was surprisingly mum on the whole issue. Samsung’s other rivals on the other hand took this opportunity to poke fun at the company and their misfortune. LG was one of those companies who took advantage of the situation to promote their brand, and it looks like once wasn’t enough. According to a report from the Korea Times, it seems that LG has invited the press to a tour of the company’s Digital Park in South Korea. During the tour, LG showed the press what went on behind the scenes during the development of their phones, like the recent LG V20, and how the handset apparently underwent 60,000 safety and usability tests before it went into mass production. Apparently it performed well enough to pass the military-standard transit drop test of the United States Department of Defense. The company performed all kinds of tests, such as dropping the device onto a steel bar, dropping a steel ball onto its display, stress tests to see if it can take a person’s weight, and more. Now to be fair, we’re sure tons of companies test their devices just a vigorously ahead of selling them. Even Apple themselves invited the media to see their testing process following the “Bendgate” scandal in 2014, so in this instance we can only imagine that this is just LG taking another swipe at Samsung.

So much so that if you wanted one, you’d have to wait until December. According to the shipping times for the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s website has listed it as shipping in 6-8 weeks. What this means is that if you’re lucky, you will get it on the 1st of December at the earliest, If you’re not so lucky, you’ll be looking at a mid-December shipping and hopefully in time for Christmas. While demand for the device is probably to blame for the delayed shipping, last we heard even Apple’s manufacturers are having a hard time producing that particular model, so combine that with the demand and you’ve got yourself a nice backlog. That being said, this is for Apple’s online store so there’s a chance that if you really wanted one today, or sooner than 6-8 weeks, you can try Apple’s retail stores or any of their authorized third-party resellers. Alternatively you could always choose to get a different finish if you’d rather not wait. The matte black option isn’t looking too shabby either, we reckon. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a story Oct. 19 about LeEco's entrance into the U.S. market, The Associated Press erroneously reported the address of the company's online store. It is LeMall.com, not LeWeb.com A corrected version of the story is below: China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market Story continues below video × Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeMall.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

Jones , USA TODAY 7:48 p.m. EDT October 20, 2016 7.1k Shares 'Watch the Throne' fall?  (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images For BET) Kanye West aired a little Family Business during his Saint Pablo tour stop in Seattle Wednesday. While onstage, the rapper shared that he and his "big brother" Jay Z will not collaborate on a follow-up to their platinum-selling collaborative album, Watch the Throne. The reason? "TIDAL/Apple bull----." West says the ongoing tension between the competing streaming services is also why his verse on Pop Style didn't make the studio version of Drake's Views album, which was released exclusively on Apple. "It will never be a Watch The Throne 2," he said. "You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song. I wasn’t on the song 'cause of Hov. 'Cause it’s this TIDAL/Apple bull----." And those politics seem to have gotten personal with West revealing that North, his 3-year-old daughter with Kim Kardashian, and Blue Ivy, Jay Z's 4-year-old daughter with Beyoncé, haven't even had a playdate. "I can’t take this (expletive), bro!" West said. "Our kids ain't never even played together." And if that wasn't enough to have fans say Mercy, West added that he and Jay Z haven't seen each other since Kim Kardashian's traumatic robbery experience in Paris. "Don't call me after the robbery and say, 'How you feelin'?'" he said. "You wanna know how I'm feelin'? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house. Like we brothers, let's sit down."

The merger was announced in April. If the Justice Department grants approval, Tilden said the financing is already in place and the deal can close quickly. Retail Apple warns of phony cables Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that “pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.” It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn’t named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has “zero tolerance” for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues “wrongdoers” aggressively. Mobile Star didn’t return a voice mail seeking comment. Earnings Microsoft hits record Microsoft’s quarterly earnings blew past investor expectations on Wednesday, fueled by growth in sales of server software and the company’s range of cloud-computing offerings. The report sent the software company’s share price around all-time highs after hours. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in recent years to reshape the company into a seller of on-demand software and computing power over the Internet, as its traditional businesses of Windows and out-of-the-box Office stagnate. Investors have cheered the company’s progress in that aim, particularly in an environment in which other business technology giants such as IBM and Oracle have struggled to navigate similar transitions. Microsoft’s “commercial cloud” — a grouping that includes business sales of Office 365, the Azure network of on-demand computing power, and other business tools — was on pace in September to bring in $13 billion over the course of a fully year. That set of businesses “continues to impress,” Brent Thill, an analyst with UBS, said in a note to clients. In after-hours trading, Microsoft shares climbed more than 5 percent, exceeding $60 a share and reaching above the all-time closing highs reached in 1999. Rite Aid sale gets delayed Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings topped $1 billion in the fourth quarter, easily surpassing analyst expectations, but the chain also announced a delay in closing its latest megadeal. The company said Thursday that it expects to wrap up its $9.4-billion purchase of rival Rite Aid Corp. early next year, rather than by the end of 2016. Walgreens leaders then cautioned analysts against reading too much into the delay. Walgreens revealed plans to buy the nation’s third-largest drugstore chain nearly a year ago, a deal that could create a chain with about 12,000 U.S. locations, or several thousand more than its closest competitor, CVS Health Corp. The combination also would give Walgreens beefed-up negotiating muscle and enlarge its presence in the Northeast and Southern California. Airlines Warriors are flying United The Golden State Warriors have named United Airlines as their official airline, as well as being a founding partner for Chase Center, the planned sports and entertainment complex in in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood. In a news release, United said it is beginning its partnership with the Warriors for the 2016-17 season at Oracle Arena in Oakland, and then will continue the relationship when the team relocates to San Francisco in a few years.

Those who wanted their own multiple displays and great expandability. Lately, Apple seems to have lost interest in that market and focussed on mobility. There is a smattering of hopeful signs, the weight of evidence is that the Mac Pro is headed for the annals of Apple history. A New Mac Pro: Pros There are just a few hopeful signs that we’ll get a refresh of the Mac Pro. The most notorious is the discovery by Pike’s Universum in late 2015 that a kext plist made a reference to a new model identifier, “AAPLJ95,1.” The current 2013 Mac Pro is codenamed “AAPLJ90,1”. Reference in the plist is made to 10 USB 3.0 ports. That’s what we might expect to see in a powerful, headless desktop. However, a year later, we’d expect USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C, so perhaps that code was for an older prototype that, clearly, never went into production. 2013 Mac Pro. The oh-so beautiful, but “ugly black duckling” still for sale. At full price. Recently, our Bryan Chaffin suggested that Apple’s use of the event tagline “hello again” could represent a reinvigoration of Apple’s commitment to the Macintosh line. “Apple ‘hello again’ Media Invites Suggest Reintroduction of Mac Product Line.” Apple has been taking some heat recently, from many circles, for its inattention to the entire Mac line. Our appetite is thoroughly whetted. A not so great scenario would be if Tim Cook and Phil Schiller come out and give us a 1) new MacBook Pros 2) Updated MacBook Airs, and maybe a A10x-based 12.9-inch iPad Pro with all the display niceties of its smaller sibling. Then stop. We’d be left hanging, wondering what Apple’s commitment is to the entire Mac line for professionals and consumers alike. The beatings would continue. Understanding the effect this would have, feeling some heat from customers and the competition hot on its heels, Apple may have decided, during this long respite, to breathe new life into the Mac line. To make the wait worth it. On September 9th, Tim Cook responded to a MacRumors email: “I love the Mac and we are very committed to it. Stay tuned.” But does that refer to unbridled enthusiasm for the entire Mac line? Or perhaps just the ones in use by a subset of the customers: The notebooks and iMacs. The use of the Steve Jobs phrase “stay tuned” could mean that Apple is finally ready to surprise and delight us after a long period of stellar engineering development. The last of its kind?  It was a great ride. A New Mac Pro: Cons Back in June of 2013 when the current Mac Pro was announced at WWDC, Apple was still catering to technical professionals. The previous “cheese grater” Mac Pro was a professional’s dream. Lots of drive bays and slots. Lots of power and fans. Industrial strength. The 2013 Mac Pro disappointed many who sought a certain technical path for upgrades, but it, at least, punctuated Apple’s passion for continuing the pro, headless desktop. Since then, however, several things have happened. Apple discontinued its Thunderbolt display without replacing it. That sends a message that headless Macs may be endangered. Next, Final Cut Pro X 10.2 hasn’t been updated in 18 months. (Although 10.3 was recently, accidentally divulged.) The last update to Aperture was 24 months ago and development has been discontinued. For some insights, see: “Everything you need to know about Apple’s decision to kill Aperture and iPhoto.” The point is that Apple has done nothing conspicuous to reverse the notion, from 2014, that it is losing interest in the professional market. This colors my expectations. For example, one outward sign that would have telegraphed a clear, positive message would have been to release a new 2015 version of the Mac Pro with upgraded Xeon processors (for example, the Xeon E3-1200 V4 Broadwell) and new GPUs. However, one could argue that Apple was waiting for Thunderbolt 3 support. Even so, whatever happend to the days of upgrading Macs incrementally? Why do we have to wait years and years for Apple to refresh some Macs these days? Is it too much trouble to reassure the professional community with frequent hardware upgrades? Hardware upgrades are the surest way to provide warm fuzzies and allow customers to plan intelligently We haven’t received any of those warm fuzzies. The Mac Pro Verdict This long delay could mean that Apple has been working on an exciting new vision for Macs and how they interoperate with our iPads and iPhones. That will probably entail the thoroughly rumored Skylake-based MacBook Pro, perhaps an upgraded MacBook Air, new iMacs, perhaps a new 27-inch 5K display with internal graphics for the underpowered notebooks and FCPX 10.3. We’d be pleased, but not out of our minds. However, what if Apple, on October 27th, were to announce, in addition to all the above, a fabulous new “Late 2016” Mac Pro, kept secret in the bowels of Austin, Texas. We’d be all shocked, surprised and delighted. Consider that re-imagined Mac Pro with a 50 teraflops of computational power connected to a LG manufactured, Apple branded 38-inch ultrawide curved display. LG’s new model 38uc99 38-inch curved display, in Apple branding, would be a perfect desktop partner. Image credit: LG It would take our breath away. We’d go out of our minds. Shall Cook’s Apple settle for anything less? Apple’s track record and the pessimist in me say I fantasize too much. I think the weight of evidence is that, instead, the 2013 Mac Pro will just be left to linger and die quietly. Stay tuned.

They can’t sell an orphaned product at the prices they’re at now. If the price drops significantly on the ones that are left, I may buy one. Then again, it’s been languishing so long that there may not be very many out there. Maybe they just won’t be available after next week. October 20, 2016 at 4:58 EST PM Rick Allen October 20, 2016 The ship has sailed! I hope that there would be a new Mac pro. I held onto my Grater 2009 pro as long as I could (in fact I still use the 27 inch Cinema display at home). I passed on the new Mac Pro as I had 4 drives in old one, and had upgraded the Video card as much as I could. I eventually sold it and transitioned to the display and a MacBook Retina 15 maxed out. Now I think “Consumer” is the Apple way. Also “Closed” and “Contained” are they way their hardware is designed these days. No user replaceable parts, no expansion, very few options. This is at odds with how I view a Pro level machine. Sadly I say “The Mac Pro is Dead” And I hope next week I can add the rest of the traditional phrase “Long Live the Mac Pro!” October 20, 2016 at 5:08 EST PM Christopher Fox October 20, 2016 How about an iMac Pro? This could be made thicker with 2 or 3 SSD slots with a 27inch 5k display? Not the same as the cheese grater (I had a G5) but time has moved on and maybe hanging onto the past is something Apple does not do. October 20, 2016 at 5:30 EST PM geoduck October 20, 2016 I just had a thought. Suppose they roll out a whole new line of Macs, from laptops to all in ones, but drop the Pro moniker. The 12″ Macbook would be joined by a 13″ and 15″ models. The iMac would be an iMac, or possibly just be called the Macintosh. The MacPro would quietly disappear, but you could buy a Macintosh with a lot more power just in a different case. Similarly Pro means little on the iPad. They could drop it and just have 7″, 9.7″ and 12″ iPads. Apple might be going back to the old nomenclature where all of their machines are Macs, and if you want there would be enough power in the upper end of each line for the professional engineer/animator/film maker/scientist. Remember the Macintosh IIci. It was the Pro machine of its day, without the name. The SE/30 similarity. Calling some Macs “Pro” machines is a competitively recent innovation. October 20, 2016 at 5:31 EST PM Chazaska October 20, 2016 And what of Apple’s investment in that advanced new manufacturing process for the MacPro, not to mention all the Made in USA hoopla? Hard to imagine they would have taken such a major leap for a one-off product. Despite their almost 100% consumer product focus, I remain hopeful. October 20, 2016 at 6:27 EST PM Lee Dronick October 20, 2016 Chazaska writes “And what of Apple’s investment in that advanced new manufacturing process for the MacPro, not to mention all the Made in USA hoopla? Hard to imagine they would have taken such a major leap for a one-off product. Despite their almost 100% consumer product focus, I remain hopeful.” As geoduck says suppose that they go back to old ways with the option of ordering a more powerful CPU and such. That is the currently the case to a limited extent though they could offer greatly faster CPUs and much more RAM. Something needs to be done with the number of ports, perhaps Apple branded hubs Oh and for the love God can they put the audio port on the front or at least the side. Be it a 3.5, or whatever. October 20, 2016 at 6:48 EST PM CudaBoy October 20, 2016 Jeez, to me the Mac tower has always been a subset almost literally saying “I do shit with this Mac” from killing it on Avid or Digidesign, MOTU or in the visual Quark,Aldus,Freehand,Pshop, sheeit – even Kai’s Power Tools – this was the ammo we’d throw at those Microsloth clones. But when my bud’s studio here in Hollywood that does trailers for the top and I mean Spielberg type top – I’ve met all my heroes through out partnership in Mac crime – did NOT upgrade to the ash can I knew the jig was up. The thing was one of the first Macs designed with ZERO pro ergonomics in mind vis a vis cables and cards and external pro gear!! And, as far as grunt good news/bad news depending on Apple/Customer his previous newest Macs still ran the external cards that run Avid HD stuff just fine. The great news for all you guys is that if Timmy kills the tower (and I don’t think he will) as joining member #763 (i think) I will never post again here. I know I know, You’ll really miss me being a pissed off nitwit lo these years but hey, it was fun, I’m just not a “mobile toy” guy. October 20, 2016 at 6:50 EST PM PSMacintosh October 20, 2016 The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was an obvious design failure from the start. What idiot (Ivy?) designs a costly computer for sophisticated professional users without easy access to upgrade slots and add-in slots and with lots of ports, excellent ventilation, and perhaps even a rack-mountable configuration? Instead, they made it beautiful, but not functional. It’s like making a gold hammer. Of all the computer user types, Professionals want functionality over beauty everyday all day long. If you can make it beautiful as well, OK. Otherwise, they don’t care about beauty! They want a hard-working, powerful tool that can keep up with them and move into the future. The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was everything that they didn’t want. That designer FAILED at his/her basic job–supply the target audience with what they want and need. Most people would have been FIRED!!! October 20, 2016 at 7:19 EST PM Michael Burke October 20, 2016 Please no iMac pro. We need a headless Mac. A Mac Mini Pro on the other hand would actually be very nice. (Think headless high-end iMac) October 20, 2016 at 7:24 EST PM PSMacintosh October 20, 2016 If Apple makes a new Mac Pro, it needs to be FUNCTIONAL to the hilt. If they are not going to do that, then they should abandon the effort. But they SHOULD make a new Mac Pro. The Graphic Design industry (and other science and art industries) are what built up Apple in the first place. If Apple abandons the very people who built it, what does that say about what they will do to their current users in the future. Wow! We will LEARN a lot on Oct 24th. October 20, 2016 at 7:24 EST PM JustCause October 20, 2016 The sky is falling, the sky is falling. (damn, we have to be right one of these times if we keep writing it.) October 20, 2016 at 9:48 EST PM Duane Bemister October 20, 2016 There was some speculation that Apple was designing their own Data Center servers. This could lead to a more powerful Mac mini. This form factor has already been incorporated into a racked solution by some third parties such as Doreo Hosting. This would be great for our new WebSonar Libraries coming soon. October 20, 2016 at 11:05 EST PM Cacho October 21, 2016 I think the ship has sailed on a new MacPro or any pro mac workstation. Apple has been bleeding its pro base for years since 2012 when it switched to a more consumer/iOS focus, so it seems a bit late that they would try to appeal to the pro market again. But I could see them coming out with some sort of cloud-acceleration / cloud-computing service ala HP’s RGS or Xbox’s Microsoft Cloud (Crackdown), where some of the processing gets handed off to the cloud, essentially turning your MacBook into a workstation. Working in the post production industry, in 2014, I noticed many post houses phase out their cheese graters for HP workstations switching from FCP 7 to Premiere. They had already been switching to HP for years for their Avids, as Avid was being slow on its Mac updates to compete with FCP. FCP 7 was the reason to have a mac editing suite but when FCP X came out, Premiere instantly filled that void, without requiring Mac hardware. The MacPro cyclinders didn’t help either, less I think because of their non-upgradeability, but because they use AMD FirePro cards with undersupported OpenCL hardware acceleration, as opposed to Nvidia’s CUDA. Not having a CUDA option on the MacPro cylinders was a breaking point for me and many of my colleges who need it for apps like Octane, not to mention it being better supported by Adobe. It was why after 20 years of being Mac-only, I ended up building my own PC workstation that is faster and half the price of a MacPro. It sucks to be on Windows, but Apple gave me no choice. Right now I need to upgrade my 2011 MacBookPro. I’m really hoping the upcoming refresh will be worth it and not make me abandon Apple all together. October 21, 2016 at 6:48 EST AM Dudemeister October 21, 2016 FCP X hasn’t been updated for EIGHTEEN MONTHS??!! LOL! Talk about ultra-crappy research!! It’s just barely been six months and before that it was never more than four months between updates, mostly three!! The only reason it’s taken longer this time around, is because it’s a major re-write with new features and functionality that are geared almost exclusively to “pros”, whatever that even means anymore today… so so much for that tired, nonsensical blather. Maybe actually know what you’re talking about before you write it?? Never mind that the whole pathetic “Apple doesn’t care about pros!” whining is getting SO old. Someone call a waaaaaaaahmbulance!! October 21, 2016 at 7:31 EST AM Robbo October 21, 2016 ~The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was an obvious design failure from the start.~ Could it be that it was set up to fail? To me it was almost like the Mac Pro last Hurrah type design. Apple thought, ‘if we can make it work with this design, fine, if we can’t, at least it went out with a bang’. October 21, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM mrboba1 October 21, 2016 @geoduck I think you are on the right track with the naming conventions. Apple is shedding the “i” moniker from their line, slowly but surely, except for the ones that use iOS. iMac makes no real sense anymore, and it’s been a long time since there was an iBook. The question will be what the lines actually look like at the end of it all, and whether there will be a headless, high powered version of the Mac line. October 21, 2016 at 1:16 EST PM Ryan Kelly October 21, 2016 The new Matte Black MacBook is here: http://imgur.com/gallery/jXMp5 You guys should think about integrating these pics into your article. October 21, 2016 at 2:13 EST PM MikeSmoke October 21, 2016 One thing often overlooked is how on top of the game Apple has been with maintaining and advancing Logic Pro X. What’s more, you don’t need the latest greatest hardware to use this and use it professionally. The Pro market is dying faster than pro hardware. Recording studios in my area have closed down faster than Sports Authority and Circuit City. October 21, 2016 at 3:22 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The company introduced the Satechi Slim Rechargeable Aluminum Bluetooth Keypad in Gold, Silver, and Space Gray on Thursday. They look pretty spiffy to me, and the battery lasts up to 2 weeks on a charge time of 1-2 hours. They’re priced at US$39.99 and are available now. Check It Out: Satechi Slim Rechargeable Aluminum Bluetooth Keypads Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 3 Comments Add a comment John Kheit October 20, 2016 Watching these guys try and make an appropriate numeric keypad is almost as bad as apple being brain dead and not making a keyboard with a key pad. So this has NO function keys. It also has no cursor or page navigation keys. You know the very things that demonstrated as being nice on the freak’n corded apple keyboard. They usually make these keypads with bad materials, wrong fonts, bad key throw different from the apple keyboard. Here is a dramatic re-enactment of apple and 3rd parties making wireless keyboards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdKa9bXVinE October 20, 2016 at 11:14 EST PM Awilliams October 21, 2016 This is what I’ve been looking for for a long time. Looks like this will match the Magic Keyboard perfectly and it is rechargeable. October 21, 2016 at 7:19 EST PM Andhaka October 24, 2016 And this is why I still use an Apple Extended Keyboard II “hacked” with a teensy micro-controller to go full USB. This new “slim” keyboard does not sit well on a desk. 😉 Cheers October 24, 2016 at 3:58 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

But would you expect anything else?   It’s so nice to be able to say that what was formerly known as the Nintendo NX is, in fact, exactly what we suspected it was: a tablet that docks to your TV. Now that we know exactly what it is, we can talk about what Nintendo didn’t say today, and what that might mean. Do those Joy-Cons have motion sensors in them? (Maybe.) Is that screen a touch screen?

Jake’s been playing Gears of War 4. Matt and I have been playing PlayStation VR, and talk about Thumper in a little more depth than I think we expected.

Podcast RSS iTunes Download   Still reeling from the announcements of Wednesday? You’re not alone. From Nintendo partnering up with Apple for Super Mario Run on iPhone, to the upgraded PlayStation 4 Pro, it was a non-stop day of news.   WIRED’s Jake Muncy and I are joined once again by Time’s Matt Peckham on today’s Game|Life podcast to discuss everything that went down, and what this all means for Nintendo, Apple, Sony, Microsoft, and you.

And the Wii U, too, of course, but it’s 3DS that Nintendo focused on in its latest Nintendo Direct, announcing a few more games for the aging handheld.   All of them have a little bit of weirdness to them. There’s a port of the Wii U game Yoshi’s Woolly World that heavily features the tongue-lolling dog-thing Poochy (unless he dies on the way back to his home planet). There’s Super Mario Maker with no online level sharing. There’s a new Pikmin… but the real-time strategy has been traded in for Mario-ish side-scrolling action.   All in all, as I argue on this week’s Game|Life podcast, it’s a very safe lineup from Nintendo—taking as few risks as possible, attempting to provide 3DS software that could sell very well while still reserving the majority of its effort for the launch of NX.   After calming me down about Nintendo, as is their job, WIRED’s Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham discuss Obduction, the new puzzle adventure game from the creators of Myst.

But also, Matt Peckham of TIME is on hand to discuss the new indie game Abzu, and Jake Muncy is here to run down the basics of Quadrilateral Cowboy.   Plus, I recently actually got to play a game of Street Fighter II Turbo on the long-lost “Nintendo PlayStation” prototype system, and I discuss why that terrifies me.

On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Time’s Matt Peckham joins in and we run down our favorite VR experiences so far, and talk about what makes a good VR game versus a bad VR game.   Going off on a bit of a tangent, we talk about the idea that Microsoft and Sony might be introducing slightly-better game consoles soon, getting players into an incremental upgrade cycle.   Later, we pick up on a few news stories that have hit this week: Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is going to be available on Steam soon, and the publisher is PlayStation. (More like Everybody’s Gone Third Party!) Finally, rumors from a reliable source suggest that The Legend of Zelda for Wii U will feature voice acting… and an option to play as a female character.

Maarten de Boer/Getty Images Podcast RSS iTunes Download At the DICE Summit this week, I got the chance to talk with Penn Jillette, one half of Penn & Teller, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, following their keynote presentation. The pair are working together on a new version, with some virtual reality elements, of the classic Desert Bus. Their session at DICE focused on how game developers can use principles of magic in their designs.   After a few minutes of conversation, I realized I wanted to share the whole session with everyone. So on this episode of the Game|Life Podcast, it’s the whole interview. To call it “wide-ranging” might undersell it a bit. Here’s some of what you can expect:   Desert Bus Hillary Clinton Janet Reno Virtual Reality, Shakespeare, and politics The Music Man The time Penn met Notch The Residents Guarding magical secrets The Internet as world-peace engine Fake lottery tickets   And more.

I had a lot of thoughts about the message that this game was trying to convey, but I held a lot of them back at the time of its release for fear of “spoilers.”   Well, the statute of limitations on that is quite up, and more to the point, I haven’t been able to find other analyses of the game that get at what I was taking away from it. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture tackles one of the great questions of human existence—coming to terms with the inevitability of death—and gives us a metaphor to help us think about it. It can be a profound experience, aided by one of the greatest (and most impactful, in terms of its literary connection to the game’s message) original musical scores in recent memory.   On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham join in for a no-holds barred pull-apart of Rapture. But first, we do some relatively spoiler-free Firewatch discussion. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture firewatch Game|Life Audio Skip Social.

There are certainly a lot of leaks and rumors coming out about it, which would tend to indicate that Nintendo is getting close to announcing something about the new dedicated game machine that it’s often said it planned to discuss at some point in 2016.   TIME’s Matt Peckham joins me on this episode of the Game|Life podcast to discuss the NX rumors and what it might all mean, what we might hear at Nintendo’s upcoming financial briefing on February 2, and of course what we both think about Jonathan Blow’s The Witness, because you pretty much have to talk about that these days on gaming podcasts.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock". It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively.

Although the lawsuit is not against Amazon itself, the retail giant is implicated because it fulfills the orders on behalf of the supplier. The case, spotted by Patently Apple this week, says: “Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon's 'Fulfillment by Amazon' program. “Apple's internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit." Related: iPhone 7 review Apple even cited Amazon reviews from customers whose chargers caught fire, in its legal filing. "These counterfeits have the potential to overheat, catch fire and deliver a deadly shock to consumers while in normal use,” Apple’s counsel wrote. Amazon responded by claiming it had ‘zero tolerance’ for fake products on its site. It told the BBC: "We work closely with manufacturers and brands and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." If Apple succeeds in getting these accessories removed from stores like Amazon, it stands to make more money from selling officially manufactured or licensed cables.

The only reason reason why chargers for Apple are expensive is because of the silly chip inside every lightning connector that has to be sourced from Apple. I say silly because at the other end of the cable is a dumb USB connector. Whatever the chip inside the Lightning connector does, can be placed inside the device so you have 2 dumb connectors on the cable: USB and lightning. But then that wouldn't be the apple way .....!! toboev October 21, 2016, 6:02 am There's loads of counterfeit Samsung batteries.

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighborhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. - 'Big battle' - A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smoothly accessing content or services. "I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. FILE - In this Sept. 16, 2016, file photo, Lisa Gao, from Chicago, compares a new jet black iPhone 7, right, with her iPhone 6 at an Apple Store in Chicago. Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple claims more than 90 percent of ‘genuine’ Apple chargers sold on Amazon are fake Apple claims more than 90 percent of ‘genuine’ Apple chargers sold on Amazon are fake By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Update (10/20/2016):  Amazon has reached out to Extremetech with the following statement:  “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.” Amazon has a reputation for delivering quality goods at low prices, but a new lawsuit filed by Apple sheds unwelcome light on just how good some of those products actually are. It’s common to see Apple-compatible chargers and hardware for sale on Amazon and advertised as genuine Apple products — but according to Apple, the vast majority of these products are fake and built to terrible quality standards. According to Patently Apple, Apple has filed suit against one such manufacturer, Mobile Star, whose products are available directly from Amazon and advertised as being genuine hardware, as shown below: Image by Patently Apple Underwriters Laboratories Inc (the testing facility responsible for certifying a great many products) recently conducted a series of tests on 400 counterfeit Apple adapters. Here’s how they describe the outcome: The results of UL’s testing of counterfeit phone adapters were literally shocking. Part of the test equipment was damaged by energizing some of the counterfeit adapters. Twenty-two samples were immediately damaged during the process of energizing or during the leakage current test with 12 samples having a very high leakage current with a capacity for electrocution. With regard to the electric strength test, only three of the four hundred samples passed, which corresponds to a 99 percent failure rate. Selected construction reviews found issues with the isolation transformer design. The internal components are vastly diﬀerent when compared with a genuine UL Listed Apple adapter. Post testing analysis of the tested samples revealed a complete lack of triple isolation wire used for the secondary windings; neither the primary or secondary windings were separated properly, which is the major reason for the dramatic failure rate on the electric strength test. When only three out of 400 samples can pass a test, you’ve clearly got a problem — and Apple is acting to isolate and reduce the possibility of product damage by suing one manufacturer directly. On the one hand, this is not surprising. Counterfeit and cheap generic power supplies from no-name vendors are a known point of failure. Generic power supplies tend to use cheap components and often aren’t designed for anything like the load ratings they advertise. We’ve also seen a number of problems with USB-C in the past year, thanks to the efforts of Benson Leung, who took on the challenge of testing whether myriad cables advertising USB Type-C compatibility were actually built to spec and up to code (the answer has been no, in many cases, particularly when dealing with cheap Chinese manufacturers). Goods and services in China are often built with a mindset of “Chabuduo,” or close enough — this essay over at Aeon explores the problems and root causes of the philosophy and how the tech industry, in particular, has pushed to adopt manufacturing philosophies more in line with what Western customers expect. When you don’t get what you pay for The problem with counterfeit devices these days is that many of the counterfeits are good — so good, you need to literally read the fine print or examine the UL and Apple logos extremely closely to determine whether the hardware is actually legitimate. That’s not something you can plausibly do from an Amazon order page, not when stock photos are easily available and can be substituted for the product you’re actually buying. The fact that this hardware was sold directly by Amazon is another problem, though Amazon appears to have cooperated with Apple in removing the offending listings. The problem here is that consumers tend to assume that a product is genuine if it is sold by Amazon and advertised as an official Apple product. There’s an unconscious assumption that someone — either Amazon or Apple — has already verified that products being advertised as genuine actually are genuine. Situations like this drive home the point that this is not the case. But the consumer has no practical way of validating the authenticity of the product without purchasing it and doing a close examination of its external markings and/or internal structure. The simplest way to avoid the problem is to buy directly from the manufacturer. Don’t try to cut corners when it comes to power adapters and supplies — you may save a few bucks up front, but it could cost you significantly more later on. Feature listing by UL.

Thursday, October 20, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Amazon Selling Fake Apple Chargers and Cables Ben Lovejoy (Hacker News): There’s no shortage of third-party chargers and cables sold for Apple equipment, some of them claiming to be the genuine article, but Apple has found that even Amazon has been selling counterfeit products labelled as the real thing. The products concerned were sold by Amazon directly, and not by a third-party Marketplace seller. The items have now been removed from sale, and Apple is suing the company that made them … Patently Apple reports that Apple has filed a trademark infringement case against Mobile Star LLC, which Amazon named as the primary supplier of the counterfeit products. Apple said that Mobile Star was not only illegally using its trademark, but that the fake chargers had not passed safety tests and posed a risk to consumers. Apple: Apple makes great efforts to combat the distribution and sale of counterfeit Apple products bearing its trademarks. Despite Apple’s efforts, fake Apple products continue to flood Amazon.com. Each month, Apple identifies and reports many thousands of listings for counterfeit and infringing Apple products to Amazon.com under its notice and takedown procedures. Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon’s “Fulfillment by Amazon” program. Apple’s internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit. John Gruber: I can certainly see why Apple is suing Mobile Star (hopefully right out of business), but why not sue Amazon too? John Gordon: This has been going on for a long time… Previously: Amazon’s Chinese Counterfeit Problem Is Getting Worse. Amazon Apple Lawsuit Shopping Trademark 2 Comments 2 Comments Rich Cheng October 21, 2016 10:37 AM Selling counterfeit products is illegal (in the jurisdictions I just checked, at least). I don't believe that if a physical department store's was selling counterfeit products that this would be tolerated by the authorities. (Maybe I'm being naive, here) I don't get why, just because Amazon are online, it falls to Apple to open civil lawsuits in an attempt to prevent this. Smokey Ardisson October 23, 2016 12:33 AM I don't understand Amazon's thinking here—it's going to sell Apple chargers, but it's going to source them from…some unknown company that's not Apple? That's extreme stupidity at best, deliberately criminal at worst. So, like John Gruber, I don't understand why Apple isn't suing Amazon, too (well, I do—it would open up all sorts of other cans of worms, but I hope they privately agreed to some sort of settlement and compensation).

According to a lawsuit filed by the iPhone maker, 90 percent of Apple power accessories found on the retail site are fake, even those labeled as genuine. Patently Apple reports that the Cupertino company is suing US-based firm Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement, alleging that it has been selling counterfeit goods using Apple logos and product images in its listings. Apple states in the lawsuit that, so far this year, it has bought more than 100 Apple-branded products from Amazon, such as "iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables,” 90 percent of which turned out to be fake. Mobile Star is reportedly responsible for the “majority” of these items. Buying one of these fakes doesn’t just mean you're missing out on an authentic Apple product, you could also be putting yourself at risk. Apple says they’re often poorly built with inferior or missing parts, flawed designs, and inadequate electrical insulation. Meaning they have the potential to cause fires or even “deadly” electric shocks. Apple argues that its reputation is damaged when consumers buy these products. The company is seeking an injunction against Mobile Star selling any more of the fake goods, destruction of all counterfeit items, and damages of $150,000 for alleged copyright infringement and up to £2 million for trademark infringement. When Apple alerted Amazon to the fake Mobile Star products, the retail giant handed over all the stock purchased from the company. Amazon said it “has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.” Just remember: if you find something that seems too good to be true when shopping online, it probably is.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 4:23 pm Comment Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph below is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. Image and data by Cellular Insights RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. Image and data by Cellular Insights First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.

This year’s event kicks off Friday and is full of events at varying price points that highlight the versatility and variety of hard cider. There will be a block party meant to remind you of farm to plated dinners as well as food tastings to show off how cider can pair with a meal just as well as wine or beer can. It will also feature the debut of some local ciders, including Big Apple Hard Cider. “We’re just launching commercially at Cider Week this year, so it’s a really big year for us,” cider master Danielle von Scheiner said. Von Scheiner is hoping to highlight the way New Yorkers drink cider — more like a wine, as opposed to West Coasters who drink it more like a beer. Big Apple’s ciders, including one dubbed Brooklyn Brew, use 100% New York apples fermented with 100% juice and with no added sugar — and thanks to that, “there’s really no hangover.” “It allows people to kind of get into a drink that is gluten-free, paleo and it supports a local economy,” she said. It will also be the first year at Cider Week NYC for Brooklyn Cider House, which has an orchard in New Paltz and is in the process of building a tasting room, production facility and restaurant in East Williamsburg that will serve as a “flagship location.” Brooklyn Cider House will be pairing its cider with pork at Porktober Fest on Saturday at Solar One ($55 a ticket), and will be pouring samples at the free Lower East Cider festival on the appropriately named Orchard Street Sunday. The Lower East Cider Festival is among the more rustic events this week, said Lindsey Storm, whose business card lists her as the “cider goddess” at Brooklyn Cider House. “It’s kind of the closest thing to the afternoon at the farm that you can get here in New York City,” she said. For those looking to experience cider in a different way, this year features the inaugural Cider Revival ($55-$65) on Monday, a more high-end tasting of more than 25 ciders paired with fondue and other snacks from Murray’s Cheese Bar, held on the terrace at the Bowery Hotel. Both Brooklyn Cider House and Big Apple Hard Cider are among the cider makers who will be on hand to pair their cider with savory snacks. “Cider doesn’t have to be this stand-alone beverage that you have once in a while in the afternoon,” Storm said. “It can stand up against food the same way as wine.” Cider pairs especially well with spicy foods thanks to its low alcohol content, Smith said, and while people often think of it as sweet, many varieties offer the dry, mineral-focused flavors of white wines that complement foods like oysters. “The true wine geeks consider themselves acid hounds, that’s their phrase that’s used, and apples — nobody can beat apples for bringing that kind of sensory experience to the finished product,” she said. But of course, despite the varieties that make cider a beverage diners can drink year round, there’s something alluring about it this time of year, especially in New York — the second biggest producer of apples in the country. “People often have, particularly people in the northeast, have a personal connection to apple-growing and orchards. A lot of people, whether growing up or now that they have their own kids, spend time in the fall apple picking,” Smith said. “It’s this wonderful fruit that we kind of take for granted and it has this wonderful second life when it’s fermented.” IF YOU GO Cider Week NYC is Friday through Oct. 30.

The US asked India to consider relaxing local sourcing norms in single-brand retail trade, aimed at helping American companies such as Apple. The issue was highlighted at a meeting between Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and US Trade Representative Michael Froman. India, however, pointed to reforms in foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, which allow relaxation in local sourcing norms in specific cases. In July, the government had announced relaxation of FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption to foreign players from local sourcing in single-brand retailing and a five-year relaxation for companies providing ‘cutting edge technology’. But companies like technology major Apple had sought a blanket exemption. Apple has not approached the commerce ministry after the rules were relaxed, Department Of Industrial Policy & Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek said on Thursday. At present, 100 per cent FDI is permitted in single-brand retailing, but it requires 49 per cent permission from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. India has pushed for a greater market access for agricultural export as well as institutional mechanisms to improve food export. Problems faced by Indian exporters of mangoes, Basmati rice and grapes due to unwarranted requirements and restrictions were raised, Sitharaman said. That country’s Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) and Food Safety Modernisation Act have created an elaborate system of inspection and high inspection fees, affecting smaller exporters, she added. Bilateral trade is $109 billion a year. Both sides wish to increase this to $500 billion. Foreign direct investment from the US was $4.2 billion in 2015-16, up from $806 million in 2013-14. The Government of India’s (GOI’s) concerns on the US totalisation pact were also discussed. GOI says it discriminates against Indian workers in the US, who lose their social security contributions due to discrepancy in the visa and social security regime rules. GOI wants early conclusion of a totalisation agreement to protect the interest of professionals of Indian origin. The US has signed such a pact with several nations, with the aim of avoiding double taxation on income with respect to social security taxes. The issue of increase in visa fee and reduction in the number of available H1B and L1 visas, proposed by US lawmakers, was also discussed. GOI says it will adversely affect the Indian information technology sector. “In 2014-15, as much as 69 per cent of all H1B visas and 30 per cent of L1 visas were issued to Indians,” US commerce secretary Penny Pritzker had earlier said. On Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), GOI has maintained Indian laws comply with World Trade Organization norms. The US has raised concerns over the patents regime, particularly in pharmaceuticals. On trade secrets, the US wants a separate law. Later in the day, USTR officials are said to have met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

Single-brand retail trade: US asks India to relax local sourcing norms India pushes for greater agri trade, quick conclusion of totalisation pact India pushes for greater agri trade, quick conclusion of totalisation pact India pushed for a greater market access for agricultural export and better institutional mechanisms to improve food export at the India-US Trade Policy Forum (TPF) on Thursday. The US asked India to consider relaxing local sourcing norms in single-brand retail trade, aimed at helping American companies such as Apple. The issue was highlighted at a meeting between Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and US Trade Representative Michael Froman. India, however, pointed to reforms in foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, which allow relaxation in local sourcing norms in specific cases. In July, the government had announced relaxation of FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption to foreign players from local sourcing in single-brand retailing and a five-year relaxation for companies providing ‘cutting edge technology’. But companies like technology major Apple had sought a blanket exemption. Apple has not approached the commerce ministry after the rules were relaxed, Department Of Industrial Policy & Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek said on Thursday. At present, 100 per cent FDI is permitted in single-brand retailing, but it requires 49 per cent permission from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. India has pushed for a greater market access for agricultural export as well as institutional mechanisms to improve food export. Problems faced by Indian exporters of mangoes, Basmati rice and grapes due to unwarranted requirements and restrictions were raised, Sitharaman said. That country’s Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) and Food Safety Modernisation Act have created an elaborate system of inspection and high inspection fees, affecting smaller exporters, she added. Bilateral trade is $109 billion a year. Both sides wish to increase this to $500 billion. Foreign direct investment from the US was $4.2 billion in 2015-16, up from $806 million in 2013-14. The Government of India’s (GOI’s) concerns on the US totalisation pact were also discussed. GOI says it discriminates against Indian workers in the US, who lose their social security contributions due to discrepancy in the visa and social security regime rules.

He said that conflict between Tidal and Apple is part of the reason that the Throne does not appear on the album version of Drake's "Pop Style," and will prevent a sequel to Watch the Throne from happening.  Kanye's monologue was impassioned and, as a result, sometimes difficult to follow. Here are a handful of questions we have.  What does Apple Music have to do with Watch the Throne 2? Q: Jay Z and Kanye are both part-owners in Tidal. Neither have any publicized stake in Apple Music. Presumably, an album made between the two of them would have nothing to do with Apple’s streaming service. Why does Kanye say that the politics of the streaming economy are affecting the one record that should be hermetically sealed from additional corporate interference? A: This is an impossible question to answer, in part because Kanye, in true Kanye fashion, isn’t too clear on what, exactly, he’s talking about. When he calls out the politics between streaming services, he could be just conflating the “Pop Style” conflicts with whatever is hampering Watch the Throne 2. Completely hypothetically, though, it could go deeper than that—Kanye could be pushing for the album to not be a Tidal exclusive, for example. Or, there could be a dispute about its exclusivity period on the streaming service—if Kanye wanted it to be on Tidal for two weeks, say, and Jay Z was pushing for it to be on Tidal, and Tidal alone, for good. Why couldn’t they pull a Radiohead? Q: What’s stopping Kanye and Jay from releasing an album themselves, like Radiohead did with In Rainbows? A: Surely they could, but it would involve a serious financial contribution from both to record the project. Given the lyrics of “Saint Pablo,” Kanye is likely hesitant to spend his own money on music—something he’s usually had label support for—when he’s investing so much of his time and money in his fashion endeavors. People would definitely buy the album if they released it themselves out of the blue, but there would still be money left on the table, and both clearly believe that streaming is the future of music. From Jay’s perspective in particular, this would do little for the reputation of Tidal. In fact, a release outside of the service he’s spent so much time and money building cache for would likely harm the streaming service. What does Kanye’s Tidal contract say? Q: Since March 2015, when Kanye appeared on stage with Jay Z to help launch Tidal, he’s been involved with the streaming service. Sometimes that means full-voiced support on Twitter and exclusive releases, and at others times the relationship seems far more cloudy. What, if anything, is Kanye required to release on Tidal? A: Nothing. According to a Tidal spokesperson, he is an artist-owner. So, while he stands to make money from any Tidal releases, he is in no way legally prevented from releasing his next album on Apple Music—or however else he wants. It’s why, weeks after stating that The Life of Pablo would only ever be available on Tidal, the album showed up on Spotify and Apple Music. It’s also why Kanye has been free to discuss an Apple Music exclusive deal, something he did last year and later rapped about on “Saint Pablo.” What does Drake have to do with this? Q: Does Kanye recording an album with Drake, who is an Apple Music artist, affect the situation? A: Maaaaaybe? Both Jay and Kanye worked on a version of “Pop Style” released in advance of Drake’s Views, but their verses did not appear on the album version, according to Kanye, because of Hov’s relationship with Meek Mill, a Roc Nation artist, and because of "some political shit" involving Tidal and Apple. (Weirdly, the version of “Pop Style” with the Throne is available on Apple Music; but it wasn’t heavily promoted by Apple the way Views was.) If Apple Music wouldn’t allow Drake to use verses from Tidal artists on his album, or vice versa, that’s no good for art. But Jay appears on DJ Khaled’s latest album, which was an Apple Music exclusive. This suggests that Apple Music’s policies aren’t strict. Of course, Khaled is managed by Roc Nation, meaning money from Khaled’s project would’ve found its way to Jay via some channel. Ultimately, it seems that Jay will make the decisions that benefit him financially; or, that pulling out of “Pop Style” could be a sort of “fuck you” to Drake and Apple Music. After all, why support the project of a rival business? True, Jay gave a few lines to Drake initially, but even that reads a bit like a “fuck you.” Like, here’s this pittance. And perhaps Jay feels cool about the prospect of Watch the Throne 2 when Kanye and Drake have discussed their joint album, which would likely have to be an Apple Music exclusive, at least for some period of time, given Drake’s involvement. Why doesn’t Spotify get brought up? Q: There’s a name missing from these conversations: Spotify. By its subscriber numbers, the Swedish streaming service is larger than Apple Music and Tidal, combined. If this is really about politics between streaming services, why isn’t one of its biggest names more of a point of contention? A: It comes down to strategy. In the streaming economy, Apple and Tidal are the primary players dealing in exclusives—signing the biggest names to their platforms. Artists like Jay Z, Beyoncé, Kanye, Drake, Rihanna, and Chance the Rapper give their music to either Tidal or Apple Music exclusively, for a time, ostensibly driving more subscribers to either service. Spotify has largely stayed out of the race for big name exclusives, opting instead to wait the typical two week grace period for the album to hit other services. Whatever is happening here appears to be the streaming economy’s race for exclusive leaking down to the upper echelon of hip-hop. So, is this personal? Q: During Wednesday night’s show, Kanye seemed hurt that Jay only called him after Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris, instead of coming by their house to show his support and concern. Is Kanye’s anger with Tidal really him lashing out at Jay? A: Your guess is as good as mine. Kanye’s comments went past music last night, as he went on to make a personal tirade about his and Jay’s relationship. "Don't call me, after the robbery, and say, 'How you feelin?' You wanna know how I'm feelin? Come by the house," Kanye said. (He also bemoaned the fact that his kids don’t play with Jay and Beyoncé's daughter.) Whatever is going on here, it appears that there’s something else going on underneath the surface, and with Jay inextricably tied to Tidal, it’s tough to parse where the dividing lines of either issue lie.

Microsoft’s Surface business skyrockets as the iPad’s slows Posted Oct 20, 2016 by Matt Burns (@mjburnsy) 0 SHARES Next Story A trip to Google’s New York City Pop-Up Shop Microsoft saw revenue from its Surface line jump 38% over last year’s total, according to its most recent financial report. Released today, the report states that Surface revenue hit $926 million during the last quarter, up from $672 million last year. Even at this level, Apple’s iPad business is still much larger, though growing more slowly. Apple’s iPad business is still dramatically larger than the Surface, though. During Apple’s last quarter, iPad revenue was $4.9 billion up from $4.4 billion compared to the same quarter the year prior. That’s a growth in revenue of 11% year over year, but the first growth Apple’s iPad business saw in ten quarters. The substantial jump in Surface revenue was on the back of just two products: the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Microsoft has been pushing these hard with a major ad campaign and key partnerships like with the NFL — though Coach Belichick and others might not be big fans. It’s said Microsoft is set to release new Surface products at an event next week, which should mean Microsoft will have a fresh line available for purchase in time for the holidays. A better picture of the iPad vs Surface fight will come into view next week when Apple announces its latest quarterly earnings, but as it stands right now, Apple should take notice. The Surface is coming. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Microsoft Founded 1974 Overview Microsoft is an American multinational corporation that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells a range of software products and services.

Telemundo, owned by NBCUniversal, is syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages. For those unfamiliar with universal search, it's a feature that allows users to conduct Siri voice searches or text-based searches to find TV and movie content across a wide range of channels. At launch, universal search only supported a few channels, but Apple has been rapidly expanding the feature to encompass additional channels. Apple TV universal search is now available for a wide number of apps in the U.S. and Australia, but the feature is limited to iTunes and Netflix in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In some other countries and regions, only movies in iTunes are supported.

And the conjugation of the verb. OK, that's a mighty simplistic translation, never mind :) So, Siri is language specific though, would you have to put your Apple TV in Spanish language mode for her to "understand" that statement? Bilingual Siri isn't really a thing yet, I wonder if you need to anglicize pronunciations for Siri to find shows on Telemundo if your primary language is set to English. I'll have to try it out. edit: so I just tried it out. I attempted to find Al Rojo Vivo both pronouncing it correctly and anglicized (al ro-joe vie-vo) and got about three of four interpretations back from Siri that were all wrong (El rodeo vevo for example). Maybe I'd have better luck if I switched over to Spanish as the primary language but I don't have time to do that right now. [doublepost=1477005856][/doublepost] Search Plex and you have a winner. I'd accept this as a fallback but I'd still rather have Apple support their own home sharing functionality. [doublepost=1477005924][/doublepost] Does Siri even understand Spanish? Spanish is one of the Siri languages. It's supported in primarily Spanish speaking countries (e.g. Mexico) as well as the US. Rating: 5 Votes ksnell 4 weeks ago Search Plex and you have a winner.

I'd rather watch movies that I already have downloaded and I can access over my local network, rather than stream it. There are other people in my house using the internet for their own purposes that would prefer I access already downloaded files too. Rating: 1 Votes KazKam 4 weeks ago Universal Search is honestly one of the best things about Apple TV. It's by far the easiest way to check where a show is available. Whereas before you'd go to shady sites or have to check each site individually. Now you can just ask Siri and it displays all the services the show is available on along with what seasons are available on each. It's great. It'll check where a show is available... except on your Home Share where you've already purchased and downloaded it so you don't have to stream it. One more cool thing about it is, if you search for say, "Find American Horror Story for free", it'll parse through all the services you're logged into, like Netflix, and show you where it's available to watch for free; along with all the other services it's available on. Pretty cool. But you can't search for say, "Find American Horror Story locally" so you can return results from your Home Share where you've already purchased and downloaded it so you don't have to stream it. [doublepost=1476998280][/doublepost] Nope. Yup. It's searches all supported legal services available regardless of which apps you have, which is the best thing about it, and also sorta the point. Legal? Also, it's the WORST thing about it IF you want to bypass Apple's kludgy navigation and only want to search the content you already purchased and/or downloaded, or just search the channels you've determined for yourself may have relevant content instead of returning results from services you'll never pay for which essentially equate to advertising in your results. You and Apple have made a lot of assumptions about how users want to discover and access content... mostly skewed in favor of using up bandwidth and selling content.

Not that there are many Apple TV apps in the UK to search anyway, as the UK app store is a batten wasteland of shovelware and sewage.

Software updates coming this year will give movies and TV shows from Netflix, HBO and other competitors equal prominence on the devices' home screen.  The approach is similar to one Apple took when it refreshed its Apple TV device last year. Amazon's own video store will no longer have the starring role on the company's Fire TV streaming devices.  HOW IT WILL WORK  While Amazon has long had a watch list for viewers to keep track of what they want to watch, choosing a title has directed the viewer back to Amazon's store.  Now, Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers.  If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option, even if Amazon's own store is selling the same title. Amazon's Fire TV has offered solid performance at reasonable prices, but its home screen has been cluttered with Amazon products — whether to rent or buy, or offered at no extra charge through Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program.  That's made it tough to find video from competing providers without turning to a voice-search feature that, until recently, excluded Netflix.  For the most part, finding video typically required opening a service's app first. Now, competing services will be offered space on the home screen.  Netflix, for instance, could choose to highlight its original series 'Stranger Things' alongside personalized recommendations.  Netflix could also include a short video trailer that plays on the home screen.

An Amazon-centric search penalizes viewers looking for not just Amazon's 'Transparent' but also Netflix's 'Luke Cage' and Hulu's 'The Mindy Project' (pictured) The development comes as leading video services make major investments in original shows, making it difficult for any single service to fulfill all of a viewer's needs.  An Amazon-centric approach penalizes viewers looking for not just Amazon's 'Transparent' but also Netflix's 'Luke Cage' and Hulu's 'The Mindy Project.' The refreshed Fire TV Stick, which begins shipping Thursday for $40, will get the free software update first, followed by the standard $100 Fire TV device released last year.  Both will get the updates by the end of the year.  Amazon says older devices will get the updates, too, but no timetable was given.

Linley SandersOct 20, 2016 4:40PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest After receiving complaints that its chargers were overheating and catching on fire, Apple took matters into its own hands. The tech giant began purchasing so-called "genuine" Apple power adapters and charging cables directly from Amazon, ABC News reports, then tested them for authenticity. After undergoing tests, Apple found that approximately 90% of those purchased on Amazon were counterfeit. The faulty electronics were eventually traced back to a company called Mobile Star, which Apple promptly filed a trademark infringement against and opened a lawsuit for selling counterfeit products through Amazon, PatentlyApple reports. An Amazon spokeswoman told BBC that "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site," and that it works closely with manufacturers and brands to pursue wrongdoers aggressively. In the lawsuit, Apple says the cables and chargers “pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.” Unless you're sure your charger came from a genuine Apple source, be careful the next time you charge. And if you're deliberating a new Apple purchase, just go into the store until this is all sorted out.

The rapper is once again venting about streaming music services that have apparently put him "Through the Wire." Back in July, West was on Twitter seemingly trying to negotiate a deal where Apple Music would buy rival Tidal. "I need Tim Cook, Jay Z, Dez, Jimmy, Larry, me and Drake, Scooter on the phone or in a room this week!!!" West tweeted. Fast forward to West's concert in Seattle on Wednesday, and Jay Z, Drake, Apple Music and Tidal were once again on his mind. West went into an expletive filled rant to explain that he and Jay Z would not be doing a sequel to their successful 2011 collaborative album "Watch The Throne." Such a project would not be happening, West said, for the same reason he and Jay Z didn't make the album version of the Drake single they performed on titled "Pop Style." The reason? "Some Tidal/Apple bulls***," he told the audience. "There will never be a Watch The Throne 2 ," West said. "I wasn't on the [the album version of 'Pop Style'] 'cause [Jay Z]. It was some Tidal/Apple bulls***." Jay Z owns Tidal. Drake's album "Views" was released exclusively on Apple. West went on to explain that while he and Jay Z had rapped on the "Pop Style" single, Jay Z declined to be on the album version out of respect for his rapper and friend Meek Mill, who was feuding with Drake at the time. "I said, look, I'll call Drake, I'll call Meek, we gotta squash this s***," West said. "We gotta let people have this song!" Yeezy is, after all, a man of the people. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Hands on: LeEco Le Pro3 Christian de Looper Digital TrendsOctober 20, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share LeEco hungrily eyes the U.S. market with the $400 flagship-killing Le Pro 3. LeEco is making a serious push into North America, and on Wednesday, October 19, announced its LeEco Le Pro 3 and LeS3 smartphones, which will both be available in the U.S. in November. But the company has some serious competition – Google just launched the Pixel and Pixel XL, and it’s not like Apple is going to bow down and give up its throne anytime soon. We managed to get our hands on the new Le Pro 3 at the LeEco announcement event to see how the phone compares to other flagship devices for this year. These are our first impressions, so hang tight for a full review. Slim aluminum design sacrifices the headphone jack The first thing to notice about a smartphone is always its design, and the Le Pro 3 has a very nice one indeed. The device continues on the recent tradition of offering a very minimalistic look that’s similar to the HTC 10 both in look and feel. For example, the device offers the same aluminum unibody build made famous by the likes of HTC and Apple. The phone boasts a 5.5-inch screen, which puts it in phablet territory. However, it doesn’t feel huge in your hands, which is  largely owed to the thin, inconspicuous bezels. Speaking of thin, the phone is quite slim, coming in at 0.29-inches, which is on par with the likes of the iPhone 7 Plus. Unfortunately, it feels a little thicker than it actually is because of the blocky design on the edges. They aren’t really rounded over like the edges on the iPhone. Part of the reason the Le Pro 3 is so thin is that LeEco has followed Apple’s lead and removed the headphone jack. That’s right, if you’re a music lover, you’re going to need to get used to using Bluetooth headphones with the Le Pro 3 or cough up more money for a pair of USB Type-C headphones. LeEco does include the headphone adapter in the box, which will make your old 3.5mm headphones work with the Le Pro 3, but we haven’t had a chance to test it out yet. If it’s anything like the iPhone 7’s adapter, it’ll likely annoy you. Specs and display The Pro 3 has a great design, but the premium feel doesn’t stop there. Featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, this phone can compete with the best Android phones out there. Related: LeEco introduces 4K HDR TV lineup, featuring the 85-inch, $5,000 uMax85 Those are strikingly similar specs to the newly unveiled and very well-reviewed Google Pixel, although the Pixel offers slightly more storage at as much as 128GB. Beyond specs on paper, however, the phone feels pretty zippy. It manages to open and close apps really quickly and with no stutter. Of course, many of the apps included on the Pro 3 we held were LeEco’s own. We’ll talk a little more about that later. leeco le pro hands onMore Christian de Looper/Digital Trends leeco le pro hands onMore Read More Christian de Looper/Digital Trends leeco le pro hands onMore Christian de Looper/Digital Trends leeco le pro hands onMore Christian de Looper/Digital Trends When it comes to the display on the phone, LeEco continues to impress. Although the 5.5-inch screen has a Full HD, 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution and not a Quad HD resolution, it looks very nice indeed. Colors popped, blacks were deep, and we never found ourselves wishing the display looked better. That’s often the case with strong 1080p smartphone screens. You don’t often miss the Quad HD resolution until you start to use VR headsets. Google’s Pixel also has a 1080p screen, though the XL version, which is the same size as the Le Pro 3 features a Quad HD screen. A big ol’ battery with Quick Charge 3.0 The Pro 3 is an absolute beast in the battery department, boasting a whopping 4,070mAh battery that LeEco says will get you 33 hours of talk time. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus will last for 21 hours of talk time, so LeEco is really going above and beyond here. It’s a wonder the company has managed to include such a huge battery in this very thin device. We couldn’t test LeEco’s claims with battery life in the short time we had with the phone at the event, but we’ll update you on how it lives up to those claims when we do a full review. On top of the high capacity battery, LeEco went a step further with quick charging tech from Qualcomm. Quick Charge 3.0 will reportedly charge your phone by one third charged in only 20 minutes or fully charge it in an hour. That may seem like a long time, but for such a high capacity battery, it’s not bad at all. Camera holds promise The camera continues the tradition of high-quality specs on the Le Pro 3. While we were really only able to test the camera in the low-light conditions of LeEco’s event hall, it managed to handle taking photos in those conditions quite well indeed. The sensor on the device is a hefty 16-megapixel camera that can record 4K and slow-motion video. The front-facing camera is 8 megapixels, so you’ll get plenty of quality for those selfies, too. LeEco Le Pro3More Christian de Looper/Digital Trends We’ll have to test the camera further to offer a full judgement, so stay tuned for our review. LeEco meddles with software Perhaps the most interesting thing about the Le Pro 3 isn’t the specs at all, but rather the software. The phone uses Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but LeEco uses its self-built EUI over the top. As you might have guessed, that interface seriously pushes LeEco’s apps and services. Related: LeEco wants to woo Americans with the affordable, feature-packed Le S3 For example, when you swipe to the left on a Stock Android phone, you’ll  find Google Now, which will offer you personalized information, news, and events. On the Le Pro 3, you’ll find “LeView” instead, which is basically LeEco’s version of news and current events. The changes continue across the board. Instead of an app drawer, you’ll see a little button that says “Live,” which is basically an app designed to give you access to live and recorded TV. It seems like a slightly weird place to put a feature that might better serve as a standard app, especially considering the fact that watching TV isn’t really central to how a smartphone works, but it’s clear that content is a big part of LeEco’s vision, so it’s pushing that by bringing it front and center. Overall, EUI isn’t bad, but it’s best for those willing to dive headfirst into LeEco’s ecosystem rather than those that simply want a new phone to do phone-like things. LeEco is seriously pushing its ecosystem, which includes TVs, VR, and eventually electric cars, so if that interests you, then maybe switching to LeEco isn’t such a bad idea. However, we’re not sure too many people will be so enthusiastic to join into the ecosystem of a company they’ve never even heard of before today.  If you’re not into LeEco’s ecosystem and just want a nice Android phone, the Le Pro 3’s custom software approach may put you off. Price The best thing about this phone has nothing to do with the specs or the software. It has to do with the price. Coming in at only $400 – with a Snapdragon 821 chip, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage – this phone is a steal. The Google Pixel XL, which has mostly the same specs, starts at $770. LeEco is staring down fellow flagship killers like the OnePlus 3 and ZTE Axon 7, too, both of which offer similar specs for $400. Conclusion LeEco has come up with a winner with the Le Pro 3. With excellent specs at a very low price, the company is entering the U.S. market pretty damn aggressively. Only time will tell if LeEco manages to actually make a big splash in the U.S. market, which is dominated by the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google. One thing’s for sure, though – if LeEco does have a chance, it’s certainly seizing that opportunity with a pretty serious contender.

The company has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development and production of this new case. Funds will also go towards creating a case for the 13-inch MacBook Pro model being announced by Apple next week. The revolutionary new DropTech case is designed to protect users' MacBooks not just from the rigors of daily use, but from bumps and drops as well. Once a laptop has been dropped, it's too late to try to protect it and may have already caused permanent damage to internal components. With the high cost of high-end computers like the MacBook, it is better to have protection from day one. It is important to note that damage to the outside of a MacBook, even scratches simply from normal wear and tear, can often void the computer's warranty. This means that the user will be responsible for the cost of repair or even full replacement (AppleCare will not cover repair costs if external damage is visible). For a computer that costs well over $1,000, repair or full replacement costs can quickly burn a hole in your wallet. In developing its new DropTech cases, Gumdrop Cases engaged in extensive drop testing and found that drops of just one foot can cause enough damage that voids the Apple warranty. Gumdrop's durable DropTech case features a 10mm silicone bumper that is designed to protect the MacBook from bumps, scratches and even disastrous drops. The silicone material absorbs the impact so that its effect is minimal by the time it reaches the computer. Gumdrop Cases Kickstarter campaign has a funding goal of $10,000. At the time of this release, the campaign has generated over $1,300 from more than 35 backers. The campaign must achieve the full amount by November 11, 2016 to receive the funding. As a thank you for their contributions, backers will be rewarded with a free case for donations of $20 or more. Backers have the choice of putting their pledge money towards a reward case for either the MacBook Air 13", or the new MacBook Pro 13" that is being announced by Apple on October 27th. Gumdrop Cases expects to ship its MacBook Air 13" cases to backers beginning November 2016, while backers putting their pledge dollars towards the new MacBook Pro 13" will receive their cases in January 2017. About Gumdrop Cases Gumdrop Cases designs and manufactures heavy-duty protective cases for smartphones, tablets and laptop computers. These cases are designed for busy, on-the-go people, offering more protection than most standard cases. Their cases cover a wide range of products from popular brands, including Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, Lenovo, HP, Asus and more.

Luke Perry's kind words for Shannen... Blac Chyna won #MannequinChallenge Dave Chappelle and the history of the... Bikers rescue stranded Bruce Springsteen Ruth Bader Ginsburg, star of the... Leon Russell, member of Rock & Roll... The rapper is once again venting about streaming music services that have apparently put him "Through the Wire." Back in July, West was on Twitter seemingly trying to negotiate a deal where Apple Music would buy rival Tidal. "I need Tim Cook, Jay Z, Dez, Jimmy, Larry, me and Drake, Scooter on the phone or in a room this week!!!" West tweeted. Fast forward to West's concert in Seattle on Wednesday, and Jay Z, Drake, Apple Music and Tidal were once again on his mind. West went into an expletive filled rant to explain that he and Jay Z would not be doing a sequel to their successful 2011 collaborative album "Watch The Throne." Such a project would not be happening, West said, for the same reason he and Jay Z didn't make the album version of the Drake single they performed on titled "Pop Style." The reason? "Some Tidal/Apple bulls***," he told the audience. "There will never be a Watch The Throne 2 ," West said. "I wasn't on the [the album version of 'Pop Style'] 'cause [Jay Z]. It was some Tidal/Apple bulls***." Jay Z owns Tidal. Drake's album "Views" was released exclusively on Apple. West went on to explain that while he and Jay Z had rapped on the "Pop Style" single, Jay Z declined to be on the album version out of respect for his rapper and friend Meek Mill, who was feuding with Drake at the time. "I said, look, I'll call Drake, I'll call Meek, we gotta squash this s***," West said. "We gotta let people have this song!" Yeezy is, after all, a man of the people. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource.

The Apple Watch Nike+ has specially designed sports bands along with a version of the Nike+ app.  The two giants hope it will help them battle Fitbit and others in the market. Scroll down for video  The Apple Watch Nike+ has specially designed sports bands along with a version of the Nike+ app designed to make it easy for runners to see their progress on the move. WHAT'S DIFFERENCE? Purchasers of the Nike+ version of apple's Watch will get a choice of four two-tone color combination bands that are unique to the collection. Apple Watch Nike+ also has two exclusive watch faces designed to let runners stay informed at a glance. The watches were first shown off last month, but will finally go on sale next week in both Apple and Nike stores. The two firms have worked together many times, and in July, Nike appointed Tim Cook as its 'lead independent director'. He has been on Nike's board of directors since 2005 - and always sports the firm's footwear at Apple launches, unlike Steve Jobs, who famously favoured New Balance sneakers. Nike is bullish on the new edition's chances in a crowded marketplace. 'The market is full of complex, hard-to-read devices that focus on your data,' said Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike Brand.

NIKE'S RUN CLUB APP  If you need a little motivation to get off the couch, the Nike+ Run Club app can cajole you daily with run reminders, challenges from friends and even alerts informing when the weather is right to get outside.  Training data, including pace, distance and heart rate are available at a glance, and through shared run summaries, the app promotes friendly competition, even allowing users to send fist bumps to each other right from the wrist. Nike+ Run Club app offers run reminders, friend challenges, weather alerts and more.  Purchasers of the Nike+ version of apple's Watch will get a choice of four two-tone color combination bands that are unique to the collection.  'We know runners — and we know many are looking for a device that gives them an easy, fun way to start running,' . The two firms even redesigned the straps of the new version to evaporate more sweat. The fluoroelastomer Nike Sport Band reduces weight and improves ventilation via row after row of compression‑molded perforations.  'Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and we wanted to push it further to create the best smartwatch in the world for runners and athletes,' said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer.  THE BATTLE FOR FITNESS TRACKERS  Shipments of wearable devices reached 22.5 million in the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16) according to IDC. Despite a decline in shipments for one of the largest vendors, the overall market for wearable devices grew 26.1% year over year as new use cases are slowly starting to emerge. 'Fitness is the low-hanging fruit for wearables,' said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers.  'However, the market is evolving and we're starting to see consumers adopt new functionality, such as communication and mobile payments, while enterprises warm to wearables' productivity potential.' Basic wearables (devices that do not support third party applications) grew 48.8% from 2Q15 levels while smart wearables (devices that support third party applications) declined 27.2% year over year.  'Smart wearables, meanwhile, are still struggling to find their place in the market,' added Llamas. 'There is plenty of curiosity about what smart wearables – particularly smartwatches – can do, but they have yet to convince users that they are a must-have item. THE FIRMS VYING FOR DOMINANCE  Fitbit's dominance remains unchallenged for now as the company's name is synonymous with fitness bands.  The latest Charge 2 and Flex 2 are indicative that the company is growing up, giving form and function equal importance. Xiaomi Mi Bands remain extremely popular in China. The recent launch of the Mi Band 2 includes heart rate tracking and still maintains a price below $20 USD. The challenge for Xiaomi, however, is growing beyond China's borders and onto the global stage. Apple was the only vendor among the market leaders to post a year-over-year decrease in shipment volumes, primarily because it did not launch a new model on the anniversary of its first generation Watch.   Garmin's vertical integration and constant expansion of the ConnectIQ app store have allowed the company to slowly expand its channel presence and gain consumer mindshare. While it remains focused on fitness enthusiasts and athletes, the latest design of the Fenix Chronos will certainly help broaden its appeal to the masses. This is the first time Lifesense has broken into the top five on the strength of by its low-cost Mambo fitness trackers shipping into China.  It also connects with WeChat, an immensely popular messaging service in China, to share data with others without having to log into a separate application. 'Apple Watch Nike+ takes performance tracking to a whole new level and we can't wait to bring it to the world's largest community of runners.' Apple says the Nike version of its smart timepiece also includes exclusive Siri commands and Nike watch faces along a specially integrated version of the new Nike+ Run Club app.  This includes coaching plans that adapt to each user, and guidance from the world's best coaches and athletes.               Share or comment on this article e-mail 15 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

(Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images For Roc Nation) Kanye and Jay Z during happier, less shit-filled times. (Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images For Roc Nation) Share Tweet In the latest casualty from the ongoing Apple Vs. Tidal feud—whose legal battle over streaming rights is the closest 2016 will get to a genuine hip-hop rivalry—Kanye West says that some “some Tidal/Apple bullshit” has killed any chance for a sequel to his 2011 collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch The Throne. West made the announcement during his nigh-customary mid-show airing of grievances on a Seattle tour date, stopping three times to enumerate the various kinds of shit that were vexing him. ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP— ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 pt. 2 @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/N64PEXu7N7— ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 “There will never be a watch the throne 2 because of Hov” pic.twitter.com/PvzldnvEQ6— Ransom Hatch (@HandsomeRansom7) October 20, 2016 “Some Tidal, some shit, some political shit, some shit about percentages on songs,” West said, first came between him and Jay Z around the release of Drake’s 2016 single “Pop Style.” That song had originally featured guest verses from both of them—or rather, one Kanye verse and two bars Jay Z threw on as a “surprise,” West says, like the rap equivalent of adding your name to a Christmas gift tag. But when Views was officially released as an Apple Music exclusive, both of their contributions had been wiped from that track, replaced by another Drake verse. During his lengthy explanation, West suggested this was due to Apple’s grudge against the Jay Z-owned Tidal service, a conflict he’s lamented before. This Tidal Apple beef is fucking up the music game.— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) July 30, 2016 However, West also blamed it on Jay Z’s allegiance to Drake rival Meek Mill (“Out of respect for Meek Mill, he didn’t want to be on the track”) and “the politics and the bullshit,” as well as a more personal falling out between the two. In particular, West complained that their kids have never played together, and that Jay Z barely reached out after Kim Kardashian’s armed robbery. “Don’t call me after the robbery and say, ‘How you feelin?’ You wanna know how I’m feelin’? Come by the house,” West said. It was the kind of heartfelt, honest moment that can only be shared while atop a floating stage in front of thousands of strangers. “Don’t call me, after the robbery, and say ‘how you feelin?’ You wanna know how I’m feelin? Come by the house,” - Kanye #SaintPabloTour pic.twitter.com/G6wkIzbY0n— McKenna Moe (@MoeMunyMoeProbs) October 20, 2016 Concertgoers also noted the symbolic omission of Watch The Throne track “N***as In Paris”—a nod to the ongoing friction perhaps (or you know, maybe Kanye isn’t so hot on Paris right now, given the circumstances). Whatever the specific shit that led to this current shit, the point is, Kanye and Jay Z aren’t working together ever again. At least until this is all revealed to be a viral stunt for another Lemonade, where the two turn their own fake problems into genuine cash.

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7. TNT 8. HGTV 9. Nickelodeon 10. AMC 11. Adult Swim 12. FX 13. Cartoon Network 14. Food Channel 15. Lifetime 16. ABC Family 17. Syfy 18. TLC 19. Hallmark 20.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

 Apple's TV boss: 'Television needs to be reinvented' Kif Leswing Oct. 20, 2016, 3:03 PM 5,005 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple's head of internet software and services Eddy Cue discussed the problems with the current television landscape during an interview at Vanity Fair's conference in San Francisco on Thursday.  It's particularly notable because Cue leads Apple's television efforts, including its Apple TV and the shows currently available through iTunes.  "I do think television needs to be reinvented. Today, you live with a glorified VCR," Cue said. "The problem is the interface." "It’s really hard to use [a cable box or satellite TV]. Setting something to record, if you didn’t watch something last night, if you didn’t set it to record, it’s hard to find, it may not be available. There may be some rights issues," Cue said. "It's great to be able to tell your device, 'I wanna watch the Duke basketball game, I don’t care what channel it’s on.' I just want to watch the Duke basketball game. Today you got to bring in the TV, go through the guide, find which sports programs or whatever — it’s just hard to do." Since 2009, Cue had led on-and-off negotiations with content owners to build an Apple-made live TV package that would be delivered over the internet to Apple devices. But those talks fell through — some media insiders reportedly blame Cue's negotiating style — and now Apple's plan is to create a digital TV guide that organizes shows and content hidden inside various apps.  Cue's comments seemed to be directly addressing a future in which Apple could organize content from the likes of HBO, Netflix, and ESPN. Apple is also rumored to be interested in making its own high-quality TV shows. Cue did not directly say that was in the company's plans, but he didn't deny it either, and said Apple would have made the popular HBO show "Game of Thrones" if it had the opportunity.  NOW WATCH: This Lego-style home can be built in a few weeks with just a screwdriver Loading video...

Roston - Oct 20, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple is working with home builders like Brookfield Residents Properties to create showroom homes filled with Internet-of-Things gadgets, the end result being an automated home that shows potential homeowners the extent of what smart technology can do for them. These smart gadgets, as you’d expect, all work with Apple’s HomeKit, and could prove a fruitful way for Apple to draw in new customers to iOS. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working with several builders to ultimately pitch homes to prospective buyers that offer automation control via the iPad and iPhone. One could, for example, have the lights turned on automatically at certain points of the day, remotely control things like blinds and shades, trigger music to play through a home audio system, and more. While gadgets that facilitate these things can be purchased and fitted into an existing home, builders are increasingly looking toward offering such connected items ahead of time, allowing buyers to, for example, choose to have smart lighting installed versus regular lighting, video doorbells instead of regular doorbells, and other options. By teaming with these builders, Apple is further inching its way into the smart home market, and it could prove valuable for not only garnering new iOS customers, but retaining them in the future. Most customers are new to the world of home automation, and getting them established with HomeKit may be an excellent way of making sure they don’t gravitate toward Amazon or Google later on. Though smart devices like the ones mentioned above are costly, consumers may be more willing to embrace them if the cost is folded into a larger mortgage, allowing them to be paid for over time as part of the monthly rate rather than having to pay for them entirely upfront. Still, the industry is very new and only time will tell whether consumers are interested in choosing Internet-connected gadgets from the start, and whether they’ll stick with Apple because of them.

I held off updating until recently just in case there were any major bugs in the initial release. Now that I’m using it daily, I thought I would write up a few tips on using the new OS. I’m not going to go through what the new features are in iOS 10 because you’ve probably already read about that. Instead, I’m going to talk about some tweaks you can make to the settings and how to get the most out of some of the new features. Tip #1 – Revert Home Button The most jarring aspect of iOS 10 was the removal of Slide to Unlock. Even more so than that was the fact that you now have to press the home button rather than just rest your finger on it to unlock the phone. I preferred the old method and wanted it back. Thankfully, Apple put in an option to allow you to unlock iOS 10 by just resting your finger on the home button. To do this, go to Settings – General – Accessibility – Home Button and then enable the Rest Finger to Open option. Tip #2 – Raise to Wake This is a really small feature, but something I am using all the time now. It should be enabled by default, but if not, go to Settings – Display & Brightness and turn on Raise to Wake. Before iOS 10, the screen would only light up if you got a notification on the lock screen, but with Raise to Wake enabled, you can just pick up the phone and the screen will come on for about 1 to 2 seconds. This is great for quickly seeing any notifications you missed or for unlocking your phone without having to press the Home or power buttons. If you’re thinking that this feature will significantly drain your battery, you’d be mistaken. At least for me, my battery life has remained the same before and after iOS 10, which was surprising! Tip #3 – Invisible Ink You can do all kinds of crazy stuff in iMessage now, but one of my favorite features is Invisible Ink. It basically lets you type in a normal text message, but hides the content with a visual effect. To see it, you must tap on the text. It’s worth noting that the message remains hidden on your phone and the other person’s phone too. In addition, after you tap to unhide it, the message will become hidden again after a few seconds. I have found that I use this quite a bit for sending messages I wouldn’t want anyone else to see on either my phone or the recipient’s phone like passwords, financial details, health info, etc. Tip #4 – Using More Emojis I personally am not a huge emoji user simply because of my age probably, but also because I find it annoying to have to look through 500 tiny emojis to find the right one for the text. With iOS 10, the software will try to figure out which emoji is the best to use for the text. All you have to do is write out your message and then tap on the smiley face icon (emoji icon) that is located on the bottom of the keyboard. You’ll see certain words highlighted in orange and if you tap on those words, you’ll get suggested emoji. If you tap on the emoji, it’ll replace the word. It would be nice if you could also add the emojis to the end of the message rather than simply replacing the word, but overall it’s still a useful feature. Tip #5 – 3D Touch Apps 3D Touch has been around since the last iPhone, but I don’t think many people use it all that much. Luckily, Apple made it a bit more useful in iOS 10 by allowing apps to display information from the app along with the shortcuts. As of right now, this feature is mostly only useful for the default Apple apps, but it is slowly gaining traction in other apps. You can also use it on the bottom row of icons in the Control Center. Basically, any app that has a widget that you can add to the home screen can eventually show that information when you hard press on the app icon. This doesn’t happen by default, though, so you have to wait until the developer updates the app. Tip #6 – Search Photos I’m a huge picture and video person, so I was really happy to learn that Apple is finally catching up with Google. They are still so far behind it’s not even funny, but it’s better than nothing. In iOS 10, you can finally find photos by person, place or thing. If you go into Albums, you’ll see two new options: People and Places. It’s just much easier to find a picture when you can search by a face or by location. In addition, you can also tap on the search icon and person searches on anything else that might be in a picture like trees, beaches, cars, etc. Tip #7 – Markup Photos In the same vein, you can also add markup to your photos now directly from the Photos app. Previously, you could only do this using the Mail app. Tap on the photo in question, then tap on the small icon with three horizontal lines with circles on them (to the left of the Trash icon) and then tap on the circle with the three dots. The feature is quite hidden for some reason and frankly most people wouldn’t even know about it unless they read an article like this explaining where to look. Hopefully, it gets moved to a more prominent location in a future update because it’s a fun tool to use on your photos. Tip #8 – Universal Clipboard This is another one of those small features that prove to be useful. This tip is only for people who have multiple Apple devices, including an Apple computer. In addition, you have to be running iOS 10 and macOS Sierra for this to work. Basically, the universal clipboard lets you copy something on one of your Apple devices and paste it on another. Also, some content works over LTE, but heavier content requires you to have Bluetooth or WiFi enabled on all the devices. Plus, all the devices have to use the same iCloud account. It’s worth noting that it works best when you copy and paste text. It works with images, but AirDrop is a much faster way to transfer pictures and video. Tip #9 – Start Using HomeKit iOS 10 finally includes a Home app that you can use to control any HomeKit enabled devices you have. If you have been holding off on the whole smart home thing so far, now might be a good time to look into trying HomeKit. I’ve used SmartThings and even though I like it, I find using HomeKit easier since it is now integrated right into my iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. If you’re already heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, the Home app and associated HomeKit devices are a great fit. Once you add devices to the app, you can also control them using Siri and from the Control Panel tabs. Tip #10 – Collaborate on Notes I use Notes all the time, so I was happy to see a new collaboration feature that allows you to have others edit a note along with you. I’ve kind of done this before iOS 10, but it was only between the people using the same iCloud account as me, which is just a few members of my family. Now, I can have anyone with any iCloud account access my note and make edits. It’s kind of like the shared albums feature in the Photos app. There are a lot of new features in iOS 10, but these are some I have found myself using more often. If there are any features you are using regularly, post a comment here and let us know. Enjoy! October 20th, 2016 by Aseem Kishore File in: Smartphones There are 0 comments, care to add yours?

Yeezy went all the way off on his mentor and (former) friend, claiming that drama from the Apple/Tidal beef kept Hova from recording with Drake. Kanye also fired shots at Jay-Z over the fact that Blue Ivy and North aren’t playmates and that all he did was call to check in with them after Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris. “Let me tell y’all something,” Kanye ranted at Key Arena. “There will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song [‘Pop Style’]. I wasn’t on the song because of Hov. Because of some Tidal/Apple bulls**t. This shit get me tight every time I perform this motherf**ker.” Kanye West Blames Rivalry Between Apple and Tidal for Lack of New Collaboration With Jay-Z https://t.co/8vrwk4mvtc by @mbrsrd — MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) October 20, 2016 Kanye West went on to explain how Jay-Z was almost on a Drake song, but it didn’t happen because of Meek Mill, according to a report from BET. Chalk that up to just one more reason not to like Meek. So far, neither Meek nor Drake have commented on Jay-Z’s reluctance to record on the “Pop Style” track. “Jay thought of a couple lines,” Kanye said. “I said, ‘Man, just go ahead and throw that on there. They’ll be so surprised. He probably wouldn’t expect you to be on there.’ And [Drake] was like, ‘Oh s**t, The Throne is on this s**t!’ Then Jay thought about it and, out of respect for Meek Mill, he ain’t want to be on the track. And I said, ‘Look, I’ll call Drake, I’ll call Meek, I’ll call y’all… We gotta let people have this song!’ But then it went out of that territory and it went into some Tidal s**t, some political s**t, some s**t about percentages on songs. I can’t take this s**t, bro! Our kids ain’t never even played together. Run that s**t.” Kanye West rants about Jay Z not coming by after the robbery Kim Kardashian was involved with. pic.twitter.com/PZxYfDvq84 — MEFeater Magazine (@mefeater) October 20, 2016 It turns out that Kanye really is salty about how North and Blue Ivy don’t play together. It was rumored for quite some time that Beyonce doesn’t care for Kim Kardashian, and that has driven a wedge between Jay-Z and Kanye West. Now it looks to be true, because with kids so close in age, it seems the rappers should be getting their kids together or at least inviting each other to birthday parties. Then Kanye moved on to another touchy subject: Kim Kardashian’s Paris robbery. Apparently, he is also bent out of shape that Jay-Z hasn’t reached out in a big enough way in the wake of the robbery. It turns out that Hov did call and check in on Kanye, but he feels like they are close enough friends that Jay-Z should have shown up for him, in person. Kanye West just went OFF on Jay Z: “I can’t take this sh*t, bro. Our kids ain’t never even played together.” https://t.co/ybMbWvCrNl — ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) October 20, 2016 “Don’t call me, after the robbery, and say, ‘How you feelin’?'” Kanye continued. “You wanna know how I’m feelin’? Come by the house.” Kanye West and Jay-Z have had little arguments in the past, one of the most notorious was covered in detail in the aptly named song “Big Brother” from Kanye’s Graduation album. It looks like West is having a post-graduate meltdown this time around because Jay-Z has let him down again. This time, it seems that Yeezy wanted to mingle families and keep making music, but Jay-Z is all about the business. Will Jay-Z and Kanye West be able to get past this latest rant and squash their beef, or does Yeezy’s refusal to make Watch The Throne 2 mean the end of their friendship?

 What to expect from Apple's big event besides new Macs Steve Kovach Oct. 20, 2016, 2:45 PM 11,610 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple AirPods. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple's event on October 27 will focus on Macs, but we're also expecting some news beyond that. So what's coming besides that much-anticipated new MacBook Pro (which you can read all about here)? Let's break it down: AirPods Apple's new wireless headphones are supposed to go on sale in October. And since the month is rapidly coming to close, you can expect the company to announce when you'll finally be able to buy the AirPods. Our guess? They'll go on sale immediately after the keynote wraps up. In the meantime, check out our review of the AirPods. iOS 10.1 iOS 10.1 is the first major update to iOS 10, the latest operating system for iPhones and iPads. It also comes with a big feature: Portrait mode for the dual-camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus. The new mode lets you mimic the "bokeh" effect from DSLR cameras, where the subject is clear and the background appears blurry. iOS 10.1 has been in beta for a few weeks, so there's a good chance Apple will announce when the final version is available. A new Cinema Display? Apple discontinued its external Cinema Display a few months ago, leading some to believe a new version with a 5K screen is in the works. There haven't been many solid reports on the likelihood of a new Cinema Display, but launching one along with a powerful new MacBook Pro would make a lot of sense.

When Spotify first tried to open the ultimate library of popular music, there were a handful of missing authors whose names were so major they threatened to undermine the integrity of the entire collection: The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC. A decade and several rival services later, those groups have fallen like dominoes to the supremacy of the streaming era, and earlier this week, a similarly gigantic name joined their ranks: Garth Brooks, the greatest selling solo act of all time and a long-time on-demand holdout, whose entire catalog will eventually be available at the brand-new Amazon Music Unlimited.  Although Garth may have been the biggest name whose music was unavailable across all major services, it's hardly a complete set for the streaming world just yet. Here are 11 of the biggest names still at large, before the Internet can truly catch 'em all: Aaliyah If your favorite Aaliyah album was her Jive debut Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, you're fine, as that LP (featuring Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits "Back and Forth" and "At Your Best (You Are Love)") is available on most streaming services. But if you prefer her post-R. Kelly period -- as most fans do -- you're out of luck, as 1996 follow-up One in a Million and her 2001 self-titled third album are widely unavailable, thanks to the distribution hell of the now-defunct Blackground Records. (Certain albums by Tank, Toni Braxton and Timbaland & Magoo -- and perhaps most upsettingly, the Romeo Must Die soundtrack -- find themselves in similar limbo.) Bikini Kill The digital-only soundtrack to The Punk Singer, documentary about Riot Grrrl queenpin Kathleen Hannah, has made a handful of songs by the Olympia punk gods accessible to streaming, but otherwise, Bikini Kill's EPs and albums are totally absent. "It's just a crappy deal for the bands, exposure or not," bassist Kathi Wilcox explained to Verge in 2015. "I know a lot of people really love those streaming services, and they say they hear about a lot of bands they would otherwise never hear, but how much of that translates into financially supporting those bands?” De La Soul Paperwork has held up the legendary rap trio's Golden Age material, including classic LPs like 1989's 3 Feet High and Rising and 1991's De La Soul Is Dead, from reaching streaming services. “Unfortunately, a lot of the earlier stuff we did on Tommy Boy [Records], from what we understand, a lot of the legal language that needed to a part of the contracts between ourselves, the owners of the master and the publishing, I guess it didn’t include the world of digital,” Kelvin "Posdnous" Mercer told Bloomberg in 2015. “So when dealing with that it took a lot [and] is taking a lot of time to reach out to these different people." At the very least, the group's last few albums (including this year's excellent, Kickstarter-funded and the Anonymous Nobody...) were post-Tommy Boy, and thus accessible on most services. Def Leppard There's no shortage of re-recordings of the arena-rock group's most popular work to be found on Spotify and Apple Music, and some of the band's more recent albums (including 2015's impressively solid self-titled effort) are there for your perusal. But if you want to hear the original versions of "Photograph" and "Pour Some Sugar on Me," no dice -- disputes over royalty rates have led to the group denying streaming their classic material, and lead singer Joe Elliott referred to that wing of the industry as "semi-evil" in a 2015 Maxim interview. King Crimson The complex time signatures and double-digit-minute lengths of King Crimson's most famous songs are non-existent on demand -- you can't even find a live version or a soundtrack one-off from the prog-rock greats on Spotify or Apple. Legendary guitarist and King Crimson leader Robert Fripp has been a long-time critic of digital and streaming, doing the math when a couple songs of his were briefly made available on Spotify, and asking in an incredulous 2009 Internet diary entry: "Is this seriously being presented as a future for the industry?” The KLF The notorious top 40 anarchists who literally wrote the book on conning the music industry are perhaps the least-surprising holdouts of the streaming age, having publicly deleted their back catalog and retired from recording nearly a quarter-century earlier. Strangely, the group's material -- including their standard-bearing early-'90s ambient house LP Chill Out -- briefly appeared across digital and streaming services in early 2013, but was removed barely a day later. Yoko Ono The art-pop icon can be heard on streaming through her collaborative releases — remix albums Yes, I'm a Witch and Yes, I'm a Watch Too, as well as John Lennon co-projects like Double Fantasy and Plastic Ono Band. But outside of some compilations and one-offs, solo Yoko is still a no-go for most services, including her influential early-'80s albums Season of Glass and It's Alright (I See Rainbows). Bob Seger One of the most formidable catalogs still sitting out the streaming wars is that of Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bob Seger, who had two decades' worth of heartland rock hits, including the classic-rock standards "Night Moves," "Against the Wind," "Hollywood Nights" and "Old Time Rock and Roll." Seger referred to his absence from services like Spotify as "an ongoing issue with my manager and Capitol Records" in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview, but it seems like the Motor City legend is in no hurry to embrace the new technology: "I don't use the computer much at all," he admitted in the same Q&A. Suede The first breakout band of the Britpop era had their '90s and '00s material available on Spotify and other services until recently, when it was pulled without explanation. (Billboard has contacted the band for comment but had not heard back as of publishing.) You can still listen to the group's delectable recent works, 2013's Bloodsports and this year's Night Thoughts, as well as the 20th Anniversary Live performance of 1994 artistic high-water mark Dog Man Star, but not the original release of that album, or their hit-stacked 1993 self-titled effort, among others. Tool The alt-metal enigmas of the '90s and '00s have gone platinum with each of their four studio albums, but if you want to hear them, you still gotta track down physical copies -- the group has continually resisted digital distribution, and is unavailable for on-demand listening. There does appear to be one song of the band's available on Spotify, but don't be fooled by the plausible title: "Anti-Nuclear Bacteria" is actually a deep-house track by a Japanese DJ named TooL. Thom Yorke The Radiohead frontman has relinquished most of his primary band's music to streaming -- recently even making long-absent 2007 album In Rainbows available on the service, as well as its bonus second disc -- but has held out with most of his other work. Neither of Yorke's solo albums (2006's The Eraser or 2014's Tomorrow's Modern Boxes) are available for conventional streaming (the latter was exclusively released via BitTorrent) and his supergroup Atoms for Peace's 2013 LP Amok is similarly invisible. You can hear Yorke singing on a couple Modeselektor tracks on Spotify, however, as well as -- somewhat ironically, given Neil Young's own absence from the service -- a cover of "After the Gold Rush" from a 2011 charity compilation.

Donald Trump has one idea that conservative economists would probably agree with: He wants lower taxes. “We're going to cut taxes massively. We’ll cut business taxes massively. They’re going to start hiring people. We’re going to bring the $2.5 trillion that's offshore back into the country,” Trump said in the third debate. “We’re going to start the engine rolling again because right now our country is dying at 1 percent GDP [growth].” More specifically, Trump has said that he wants to lower taxes for corporations, from 35 percent to 15 percent, so that the nation’s economy can grow again. When companies pay lower taxes, the thinking goes, they have more money to spend on research and development, hiring, and producing things—all of which can lead to growth. After all, the United States has the third-highest tax rates on corporations in the world, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, and there has been no shortage of examples of companies such as Apple moving parts of their operations to other countries to avoid paying such a high rate. So would lowering the tax rate bring companies back to the U.S., create jobs, and stimulate the economy? Economists are divided on this. On the one hand, if companies get to pay lower taxes, they have more money to invest in new innovations and perhaps more hires. Lower taxes could entice new companies to settle in the U.S., and could convince companies that have offshored some of their business to bring those parts back. But on the other hand, cutting taxes doesn’t necessarily mean that companies will create jobs—they could just hold onto the extra cash or distribute the profits to shareholders and those at the top. Luckily, there is more to go on than just theory. There have been two real-world experiments in which developed countries cut their corporate tax rates in an effort to stimulate economic activity: Ireland’s tried it and so has Great Britain. Ireland for decades has touted its low tax rates as one of the reasons its economy has flourished. Its corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is the one of the lowest in the developed world. Perhaps inspired by Ireland’s success, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, after being elected to lead the government in 2010, began to cut corporate taxes in the U.K., lowering the rate from 28 percent to 20 percent between 2010 and today. The architects of the plan say they intend to further lower the tax rate to 15 percent. So how did lowering corporate taxes work out for Ireland and Britain? Was the policy a boon to their economies? Did it create the growth spurt that developed Western economies are desperately seeking these days? The short answer: Perhaps, but that doesn’t mean it would work for the U.S. In Ireland, for instance, the economy is booming, at least by some measures. The country’s gross domestic product grew at a rate of 26.3 percent in 2015, which is a staggering figure, especially when compared to the growth rate of the United States, which in 2015 was 2.4 percent. Companies including Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe all have subsidiaries in Ireland in order to take advantage of the country’s tax rates and permissive tax code. Ask the Irish government, and it will tell you that low corporate tax rates are one of the reasons Ireland is doing so well. “Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s, and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then,” Grainne O’Rourke, a press officer for Ireland’s Department of Finance, wrote me in an email. According to a study by the nonpartisan Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), Ireland’s corporate tax rate has been successful in attracting foreign companies to invest in Ireland. If Ireland changed its rate from 12.5 to 13.5 percent, the study found, it would reduce the likelihood of companies choosing it as a location for foreign direct investment by 4.6 percent. “You can be special and lure in companies as long as you’re the only one in town doing that game.” Still, GDP isn’t everything. After the release of Ireland’s latest GDP figure, some economists called the metric “meaningless.” That’s partly because some of the growth in GDP is owed to the fact that companies such as Apple last year had to pay higher taxes, producing more money for the government. This highlights the fact that many of the profits reported in Ireland don’t necessarily have to do with the on-the-ground business of companies located there, but rather with the accounting of those companies. In short, Ireland’s tax code, which allows companies to use maneuvers like the “double Irish” to port profits from country to country to avoid taxes, is what is most important, not Ireland’s rate, said Jim Stewart, a professor of finance at Trinity College, Dublin. Ireland’s corporate tax rate may be 12.5 percent, but very few companies actually pay that rate, since they can use accounting strategies permitted in Ireland, Stewart told me. They tend to pay a rate that’s much lower, he said, and contribute far less to the economy than Irish companies that don’t have a multi-national presence.. “The problem is the nature of the companies attracted to Ireland,” Stewart said. “If you are here for tax reasons, you have a particular kind of operation in Ireland—with few linkages with the local economy.” The tax strategies allowed in Ireland fell under public scrutiny a few years ago when the U.S. government began to investigate how Apple was using Ireland and other offshore locations to avoid paying taxes in the U.S. “Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple, providing it with minimal income tax rates approaching zero,” a Senate report concluded in 2013. In August, the European Union ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple; Ireland is appealing the ruling, saying it doesn’t want the money from Apple. Even if Ireland’s economic growth is more than just companies shifting their profits to the nation for tax purposes, the growth can’t all be attributed to the country’s tax rate, according to Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men Who Stole the World. There are other factors that have helped jumpstart the Irish economy, he said, and they’d be difficult to replicate elsewhere. “The corporate tax was an ingredient; it was an important ingredient, but it is not the magic elixir for success that so many people point to,” he told me. For one thing, Ireland’s growth really took off in the 1990s. That coincides with when Ireland joined the European Single Market, which allowed goods and people to flow freely across borders between Ireland and other EU members. This was a boon for multinationals: Ireland became an entry point into the European market. Companies could manufacture goods in Ireland and then sell them elsewhere in Europe without tariffs, or set up a presence in the country and then have access to the whole EU. The fact that Ireland was an English-speaking country gave it a huge advantage over other European-market members, Shaxson said. What’s more, in the 1960s, the Irish government oversaw a series of educational reforms, which led to a large number of highly educated graduates coming out of Irish schools in the 1990s. That also helped attract companies looking for a foothold in Europe. Essentially, Ireland became in the 1990s and 2000s a country that was friendly to multinationals, where they could access the European market, hire educated professionals, and enjoy low tax rates. So it wasn’t just the tax rates that attracted companies, Shaxson said. In fact, Ireland raised its corporate tax rates a bit, from 10 percent to 12.5 percent, in 2003. “What happened in Ireland is extremely, exquisitely specific to Ireland,” he said. “It was a whole collection of things that all came together that cannot be replicated by any other country in the world.” That’s not exactly a strong case for lowering the corporate tax rate in the U.S. So what can be said, then, of the U.K., which has lowered its corporate taxes 10 percentage points in the past decade and plans to further reduce them ahead of the country’s departure from the EU? This one is more difficult to suss out. In the years leading up to 2010, the U.K. was in recession, and its gross domestic product fell 4.2 percent in 2009. It started growing again in 2010, and has grown every year since then (though this year’s growth has been weak, in part because of fears of Brexit). But it’s hard to attribute that recovery solely to changes in the tax regime, because it came at the same time as the global economic recovery, according to Gavin Ekins, a research economist at the Tax Foundation. Still, there are some signs that companies are looking at relocating to Britain because of its tax changes. Shortly after the initial rounds of tax cuts in 2011, Ernst & Young said that it was aware of 60 multinational companies looking to move headquarters to the U.K. in the following 18 months. “When you look at a corporation trying to do the best for its shareholders, one of the key issues to address is your tax position,” Ferdinand Mason, a partner at the international law firm Jones Day in London, told me. According to Ekins, at the Tax Foundation, the number of UK corporations may overtake the number of U.S. corporations by 2017. This is a reversal from when the U.K. had taxes that were about as high as those in the United States, Ekins said. When the U.K. tax rate was 28 percent, a number of companies moved their headquarters to Ireland to avoid the tax rate, according to Ekins. Now, some of those companies are moving back. A lower tax rate, then, could stem the tide of companies leaving the U.S. for cheaper pastures. But cutting taxes won’t necessarily jumpstart Britain’s economy, said Helen Miller, the associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in London. The British economy is performing tepidly both because of the Brexit vote and because consumers aren’t buying as much as they used to; cutting corporate taxes won’t mean that consumers will shop more. And the danger of depending on a low tax rate to attract companies is that another country could make its tax rate even lower, thus erasing any advantage. After all, the UK was losing out to Ireland, and now Ireland is losing some business to the UK. According to the ESRI report, when the UK lowers its tax rate one percent, the probability of Ireland being chosen as a location for new foreign-investment projects from non-EU companies fell by 4.3 percent. “You can be special and lure in companies as long as you’re the only one in town doing that game,” Miller said. What should the U.S. take away from these examples? First off, lowering the corporate tax rate alone won’t necessarily make any difference—there are plenty of other things that shape where companies choose where to locate—an educated workforce, a robust regulatory regime, and access to capital among them. Second, it’s entirely possible that companies can move somewhere for a low tax rate and still create little economic activity and few jobs there. Third, lowering taxes can lead to a race to the bottom in which many countries compete to lower their taxes. Indeed, the U.S. would see dramatically lower revenues if it lowered its corporate tax rate. This wasn’t a big deal in Ireland when the country designed its tax code, because it had few companies at the time—every company that chose to locate billion-dollar businesses there meant an increase to Ireland’s tax revenues, even if it was just tens of millions of dollars. That money meant a lot to the Irish economy. But the U.S. economy, which is much bigger and already has lots of companies based within its borders, is in quite a different situation: The U.S. would lose revenues from its existing companies if it lowered its tax rate, and potentially only gain small amounts of revenue if new companies chose it as their new home. That revenue wouldn’t provide much of a bump to the U.S. budget. Perhaps most important, though, is that the U.S. is already home to many companies, despite its high tax rate. Companies locate their operations and employees in the U.S. and (sometimes) pay a 35 percent tax rate, even though that rate is one of the highest in the developing world. Ekins says the the U.S. actually has a favorable regulatory regime for companies, a large number of willing investors, and an extremely productive workforce. Why limit the tax revenues from those companies if they’ve already committed to staying in the U.S. despite its high taxes? If there’s any change to corporate tax policy in the U.S. during the next presidency, perhaps it should focus more on making sure companies can’t so easily offshore their profits to places like Ireland and England to avoid U.S. taxes. It’s something the Obama administration has been trying to tackle this year; in June, the Treasury Department released new rules that would take aim at foreign companies acquiring multiple U.S. companies for tax purposes. (If a smaller foreign company acquires a U.S. company, the combined firm can often save money by paying foreign, not U.S., tax rates.) There are many more steps the U.S. can take to try and recoup some of the corporate tax revenues it’s losing out on. This doesn’t necessarily mean lowering the tax rate, but instead changing the tax code so that companies operating in the U.S. actually have to pay its tax rate. It’s not as simple as just lowering the rate, perhaps, but it’s a change that makes much more sense for the U.S. economy. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video What Does St. Louis Feel Like Now?

Last night, and later tonight, skywatchers around the world will be treated to views of this year's so-called "supermoon," the largest full moon of the year. Today, on November 14, at 6:20 am Eastern time, the moon approached within 356,500 km (221,500 mi) of Earth, in what is scientifically known as a perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system (perigee: closest point of an elliptical orbit; syzygy: straight line made of three bodies in a gravitational system). Though the moon does appear larger than normal, the size difference is so small that a casual observer would probably never notice. Nonetheless, photographers across the globe set out to capture the event, and collected here are 21 of the most super images of this year's supermoon. If your skies are clear, be sure to look up around moonrise tonight.

In most of the time since the election, I have been in transit for a long-scheduled set of American-innovation events in the mountain west, Cheyenne and Laramie in specific; and trying to write a completely unscheduled article for the magazine; and absorbing the psychological and intellectual effects of what our country has just done to itself. I had not expected that I would ever again feel as paralyzed, withdrawn, and downcast as I did after my father died eight years ago. But that expectation was a failure of tragic imagination on my part. I was wrong. Continue Reading HBO John Oliver, Activist Megan Garber “We need to stay here and fight,” he told his audience on Sunday evening. During Sunday night’s episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver made an impassioned plea to his viewers. “We need to stay here and fight,” the comedian said. For the last eight years, we’ve had a president we could assume would generally stand up for the rights of all Americans. But that is going to change now. So we’re going to have to actively stand up for one another. And it can’t just be sounding off on the internet or sharing think pieces or videos like this one that echo around your bubble. I’m talking about actual sacrifice to support people who are now under threat. It was a striking monologue—not just because it was distinctly earnest, but also because it was distinctly unfunny. The comedian’s first show since Donald Trump clinched the U.S. presidency (which doubled, as it happens, as the comedian’s final show of the 2016 season) had its laugh-out-loud moments, but for the most part Oliver’s message was sober. It was sad. It largely dispensed with the jokes in favor of some selective Real Talk. Continue Reading Jim Urquhart / Reuters The Post-Election Surge in Donations Adam Chandler Following Donald Trump’s victory, groups that pledge to fight his proposed policies are seeing record contributions. In the aftermath of last week’s elections, many of those dismayed with the results took their frustrations into the streets, fashioned justice-minded movements on social media, and consoled themselves by tuning into various late-night shows, some of which broke from comedy to address national tensions. But perhaps the most notable (and most concrete) action to follow the end of the divisive election season has been a surge in donations to various organizations whose agendas counter those proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. In recent days, groups that champion causes like civil liberties and women’s health as well as focus on immigration rights and anti-discrimination initiatives have seen record responses to the election, in the form of contributions and volunteer applications.

It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency.

You can attribute that to a combination of factors—his genial, expressive face; his persona’s mixture of frankness and affability; the fact that he occupies an office that lends itself especially well to fan-fictional speculation; his general intolerance for malarkey—but they have resulted, all in all, in Biden becoming, in the worst way and also the best, a running joke. One of the most common memes goes like this: Take a picture of Obama and Biden together—bonus points if Biden looks giddy, and even more if points if Obama looks reluctant. Add dialogue—usually something that will get at the idea of Biden being childlike and needy and mischievous, and of Obama, decades younger and yet much more the adult, keeping his vice president in check. Apply it to the State of the Union. Or, really, to anything. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters Why White Women Continue to Back the GOP Michelle Cottle The voters have largely supported Republican candidates for years, which underscores the complicated nature of their political interests. People are processing last week’s election shocker in a million different ways, many of them involving large quantities of alcohol. But I swear I’ve read, heard, and been asked to explain one particular aspect of the vote at least a million times: How on God’s green earth did Hillary Clinton fail to win the support of white women? The prevailing sense seems to be that Clinton was a candidate inexplicably, uncommonly unpalatable to this voting block. After all, women trend Democratic, right? Plus, this time around, there was a woman at the top of the Democratic ticket. And on top of that, Clinton’s opponent was a proudly vulgar, overtly misogynistic, self-proclaimed sexual predator. So what the hell happened with white women? Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Radical Anti-Conservatism of Stephen Bannon Conor Friedersdorf Donald Trump’s campaign manager wants to destroy the left. And the GOP nominee is just the most recent vessel of convenience in his consequences-be-damned crusade. Stephen Bannon, who recently took over as Donald Trump’s campaign manager, once gave an interview, while promoting his 2010 film, “Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman,” where he argued that Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Ann Coulter pose an existential threat to the left. “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he explained. “That's one of the unintended consequences of the women's liberation movement––that, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be feminine, they would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the 7 Sisters schools." The quote captures a key attribute of the former U.S. Navy officer, whose stints at Georgetown University, Harvard Business School, and Goldman Sachs afforded a foothold at the core of America’s elite, enabling him to launch a film career that began with a Sean Penn collaboration before segueing into polemic right-wing documentaries. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Trump Administration Starts to Take Shape Clare Foran To the dismay of some Republicans and Democrats alike, Steve Bannon has earned a top spot in the White House’s inner circle. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is starting to take shape. In a statement on Sunday, Trump announced that Reince Priebus, the chair of the Republican National Committee, will serve as White House chief of staff. Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative website that has promoted white ethno-nationalism, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. Priebus literally presides over the GOP establishment; Bannon has numbered among its fiercest critics. But although in most administrations, the chief of staff runs the White House, the announcement went to some pains to present them as peers: Bannon and Priebus will continue the effective leadership team they formed during the campaign, working as equal partners to transform the federal government. Continue Reading Eric Nyquist The Case Against Cats Britt Peterson The animal so many dote on is among the world’s most destructive predators. New Zealand’s recent announcement of a plan to eradicate all invasive predators, including feral cats, sparked an immediate response—and not in defense of the stoat, up there with cats among the top 100 on the Global Invasive Species list. “Cat murdering New Zealand[ers] are for the birds,” one commenter vented on The Washington Post’s website. “Removing cats from an area is a futile effort—one that cannot succeed,” another warned. When Australia announced a plan in 2015 to cull 2 million feral cats, the singer Morrissey declared them “2 million smaller versions of Cecil the lion.” The actress Brigitte Bardot called the cull “animal genocide.” Needless to say, no celebrity outrage or online indignation has greeted New Zealand’s or Australia’s expensive and long-standing rat-eradication programs.

A just uncovered trademark filing seems to confirm the MacBook Pro really is getting a touch sensitive bar to replace the keyboard’s row of function keys. The new MacBook Pro will sport Magic Toolbar OLED touch strip The new MacBook Pro—presumably coming at next week’s media event—is rumored to be the model that finally makes some big changes. Reports claim Apple is replacing the Thunderbolt 2 and USB ports with combo USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports, retiring the MagSafe charging port, and replacing the keyboard’s function keys with an OLED touch-sensitive strip that dynamically changes based on user’s activities. Since Apple is all about secrecy, the Magic Toolbar name isn’t directly linked to the company yet. The Trademark Ninja put the puzzle together, and considering the site’s reputation for ferreting out trademarks like this, odds are the Magic Toolbar name really does belong to Apple. The trail starts in early February with Presto Apps America LLC filing an application for the Magic Toolbar name outside the United States—two weeks after incorporating in Deleware. The attorneys who filed for the AirPod trademark outside the United States are named in the Magic Toolbar application, which seems like quite a coincidence. The company then waited until the last possible minute to file globally for the Magic Toolbar trademark. Presto Apps America’s trademark filing dates seem perfectly timed to keep anyone from linking the Magic Toolbar name with Apple for as long a possible. More trademark files started popping up at the beginning of October, and now we’re only days way from Apple’s “hello again” media event, which comes the day after the deadline for Presto Apps America to file globally for its trademark. If Presto Apps America—and by extension, Apple—gets lucky, the late trademark filing won’t get spotted until after the new products are unveiled the following morning. Add to that the fact that Apple already has trademarks on Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, Magic Slate, and Magic Keyboard, and it isn’t much of a leap to link Presto Apps America directly to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac maker. As Trademark Ninja said, “Either Presto Apps America is Apple and the Magic Toolbar is going to be part of the Macbook announced on 27 October or else it’s the strangest set of coincidences and unlikely events I’ve ever seen.” Everything lines up far to neatly for Presto Apps America to not be a dummy corporation for Apple, and that means odds are we’ll see a new Retina MacBook Pro on October 27th with a Magic Toolbar.

October 20 AAPL: 117.06 -0.06 Report: iPhone 7 models w/ Qualcomm modem feature better cellular performance versus Intel Jeff Benjamin - 4 weeks ago @JeffBenjam iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In this latest iPhone generation, Apple has brought to market two iPhone 7 variants: the GSM/WCDMA/LTE with Intel modem version, and the GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE version with Qualcomm hardware. A new report is highlighting the first performance differences between the iPhone 7 featuring Intel’s modem hardware compared to the iPhone 7 featuring Qualcomm modem hardware. The report from Cellular Insights finds that iPhone 7’s equipped with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, which powers the (A1660, A1661) Verizon, Sprint, and SIM-free models, features better cellular performance than the (A1778, A1784) Intel version. Not only that, but the Qualcomm version’s ability to take advantage of Ultra HD Voice has been disabled as well according to the report. Ultra HD Voice The first interesting point gleaned from Cellular Insights’ report is that Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem is capable of Ultra HD Voice, which is the marketing name for the Enhanced Voice Services codec, or EVS. EVS can result in significantly improved audio quality over cellular connections, but according to this report, Apple decided to disable this feature. It’s a decision that Cellular Insights claims may be an attempt to level the playing field with the Intel-powered version of the iPhone 7. As of now, only T-Mobile has deployed EVS on its network, so coverage is limited in the US. T-Mobile says that EVS brings several notable benefits to its customers, including the following: EVS improves voice call reliability in areas of weaker signal, which means the rare dropped call on LTE will happen even less frequently. EVS provides even higher-fidelity calls than the HD Voice. EVS does this with a broader audio frequency range, which translates to richer, more realistic-sounding voice audio. It’s ironic, because T-Mobile customers are being supplied with the iPhone 7 (Intel version), which isn’t capable of supporting this feature from a hardware perspective. It should be noted that at least two other T-Mobile-compatible phones, the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7, support EVS. If you’re not on T-Mobile, then this isn’t a big deal, as no other carriers appear to support Ultra HD Voice at the moment. That could change in the future, however, and since the AT&T and T-Mobile versions aren’t capable of supporting the feature from a hardware perspective, we probably won’t see support for EVS until future iPhone models are released. But the EVS/Ultra HD Voice details aren’t the only interesting data points to trickle in from this report. The information contains RF tests that pit the Qualcomm version of the iPhone 7 Plus vs the Intel version. Cellular Insights says that it procured the iPhone 7 Plus units and all test hardware from Rohde & Schwarz using its own funding for independent analysis. Cellular performance The report begins by measuring the LTE throughput for both devices in order to compare data between the Intel-powered and Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 Plus models. The findings are quite interesting. Both versions of the iPhone 7 Plus were able to achieved maximum sustained data throughput while at cell center, but when reducing power levels to simulate edge of cell scenarios, each phone responded differently. For example, in the graph above, you can see how Band 12 (10MHz) performance differs between the two basebands during a controlled environment test. Notice how the throughput drops drastically on the XMM7360 (Intel) version as power levels are reduced. Band 12, which is a low frequency band, can propagate further, and penetrate walls better than high frequency bands. In other words, it’s a band that is frequently needed when using LTE inside of buildings. Note the significant difference in throughput around -108 dBm. Cellular Insights tested two additional LTE bands as well: Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO. The results, as you can see, follow the same trend. Be sure to check out Cellular Insight’s test page for the full explainer. There you’ll find details on testing methods used, hardware used, etc. You can also find its results and corresponding graph when testing Band 7, and see how the iPhone 7’s modem performance stacks up to other devices, like the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5. It’s an enlightening read on a technical level that’s well worth the time. Conclusion After testing, the conclusion is that the iPhone 7 hardware with the Qualcomm-powered modem has a significant cellular modem performance edge over the Intel variant. As to why Apple has sourced two baseband suppliers after years of using Qualcomm hardware exclusively, it likely has much to do with broadening its supply chain. In this case, however, it looks like supply chain diversification has resulted in a measurable performance difference between the two models in a lab-controlled environment. Of course, controlled tests differ from real world usage and scenarios, but these findings are nonetheless interesting. I tend not to read too much into this data, because Apple has no-doubt tested both models, and found that each performed satisfactorily in real world usage. Also worth noting is that the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is only being sold in China, Japan and in the United States, which means that Apple deemed the Intel version to be good enough for every other territory. That said, if you’re buying an iPhone 7 for full price in one of the aforementioned territories, then I highly recommend going with the Verizon/Sprint/SIM-free version. Not only does this version seem to perform better from a cellular modem perspective, but it’s also capable of working with most cellular carriers in the US and abroad.

The figure also represented a 13.3 percent increase from August. Apple Inc. unveiled the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus on Sept. 7, with global sales rolled out on Sept. 16. The MOEA last week predicted growth in September export orders, noting that the new iPhones have been well received by the market, which has benefited local Apple suppliers. The continuous rollout of new handheld mobile devices has boosted orders in the assembly, high-end mobile phone chip, wafer foundry, DRAM and passive component industries, pushing up orders for information and communication products and electronic products to their highest ever monthly total, the MOEA said. The ministry said export orders for information and communication products reached US$14.63 billion in September, up 8 percent from the same period last year, while orders for electronic products reached US$11.6 billion, up 10.1 percent year-on-year. Orders have increased from most major export markets, including the United States, China and Hong Kong, Europe and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with orders from the U.S. increasing by as much as 12.9 percent from the same month last year. Orders from Japan, however, continued to fall, declining by 14.9 percent from a year earlier, the MOEA said. In the traditional manufacturing sector, export orders for plastics/rubber and chemicals dropped 7.3 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, while orders for base metals and machinery rose 4.4 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, from a year earlier. The ministry forecast that export orders for electronic and information communication products will continue to grow in the near future, as companies roll out new handheld mobile devices, wearable devices and notebook computers, and as internet of things technology and automotive electronics continue to proliferate. Demand will also be boosted by the approach of the year-end shopping season in Europe and the United States. Orders in the traditional manufacturing sector are also forecast to increase as oil prices rebound and steel prices hold steady. In August, Taiwan's export orders rose 8.3 percent year-on-year to reach US$37.93 billion, ending a 16-month falling streak caused by weak global demand.

Apple Holds Major Consequences for Design Patent Owners The $399 million judgment Samsung owes Apple is the least consequential matter the Supreme Court will decide when it rules on the case. Image credit: Peter Macdiarmid | Getty Images Eric Amundsen Contributor Shareholder October 20, 2016 Apple and Samsung recently faced off in the Supreme Court over the amount of damages that Samsung has to pay Apple for infringing three design patents directed to aspects of the iPhone. The current dispute is not about specific numbers, such as which Samsung phones infringed the Apple design patents, or how many phones Samsung sold; instead, the controversy is much more conceptual. The Supreme Court will address what constitutes an “article of manufacture” in the context of design patent infringement. Samsung hopes to reduce the award of $399 million that is due to Apple for infringement of design patents directed to three elements of early versions of the iPhone: the bezel shape, the black rectangular shape of the casing with rounded corners, and an arrangement of colorful icons on a black screen. Many people are familiar with utility patents, which protect the structure or function of inventions. But a lesser-known type of patent is a design patent, which protects the look of a design applied to an object. The design could be primarily a surface ornamentation, such as wallpaper with a certain pattern, or the shape of an object, such as a chair backrest with a new shape. Design patents can protect designs applied to portions of objects as well as entire objects. One design patent might protect the look of only the backrest of a chair whereas another patent might protect the look of the entire chair. Related: Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Samsung-Apple iPhone Patent Fight When a patented design is infringed, a patent owner can recover as damages the total profit of the infringer for any article of manufacture to which the infringer has applied the design. Courts have consistently held that because the law says “total profit,” the damages payable to the patent owner cannot be limited to only the profit attributable to the design, but rather must include the profit attributable to sales of the entire article. Continuing with the example involving a patented chair: Because the chair provides value as a place to sit, the entire value of the chair is not derived solely from the appearance of the chair. Yet the patent owner can still collect the infringer’s total profit from the chair sales. That much is clear. Less clear is the question of what to do when an infringed design patent is directed to only a part of a product, especially a product that has many components. Should total profit from the entire phone still be the resulting damages, as lower courts decided in earlier rounds between Apple and Samsung? Samsung and Apple agree that an entire product should not automatically be deemed the relevant article of manufacture in every situation. If this were the case, seemingly absurd damage amounts could result. As discussed during oral arguments, a patent owner with a design patent to a cup-holder should not recover the total profit from a competitor’s sale of a car which includes an infringing cup-holder. Related: Designers Come Out for Apple in Patent Fight with Samsung As a result, the Supreme Court is wrestling with two main questions: how to determine what the article of manufacture is if the article may be less than the entire product; and how to determine the total profit associated with the determined article of manufacture. Samsung argues that the relevant articles of manufacture should be the discrete components of the phones to which the designs of the design patents were applied. For example, Samsung believes the relevant article of manufacture should be the phone casing, not the entire phone. Samsung additionally argues that because Apple did not offer any evidence as to the profits associated with these discrete components, Apple’s attempts to recover the design patent damages should be dismissed. Apple argues that the determination of what constitutes the articles of manufacture should be decided by the jury. To avoid a retrial, Apple further argues that in this particular case the jury reached the conclusion that the entire phone is the article of manufacture, and therefore the damages award should stand. If the Court holds that an article of manufacture could be less than an entire product, which appears likely, the damages available for design patent infringement will be less than previously assumed in many cases. If the Court prescribes a test for what constitutes the relevant article of manufacture, and the test looks to what is claimed in the asserted design patent, companies may adopt a strategy of pursuing numerous design patents for a single product. Much like Apple has historically done, companies could pursue design patents directed to parts of a product, and also pursue design patents directed to the entire product. If a prescribed test relates to whether components are physically separable or separately sold, companies may file design patent applications where the claimed design includes a main component and at least a small portion of one or more additional separable components so that the damages apply to a greater percentage of the product than if the claim design included only the main component. For example, if a company has a design patent for a chair cushion, they may additionally include a small part of the chair as part of the patent to include the entire chair as part of the damages calculation. If a factor for a prescribed test includes assessing the prominence of a design within the product, companies may seek to protect what they deem to be eye-catching or otherwise significant to the appearance so that this factor weighs in favor of the entire product being the article of manufacture. Related: Government Asks That Apple Patent Case Against Samsung Be Returned to Lower Court A precise formula for determining how much profit is attributable to an article of manufacture that is only a part of an entire product is not likely forthcoming. Instead, given the nearly infinite number of different situations that could arise, guidance in the form of factors to consider may be handed down by the Court. Regardless of whether the Court sides with Apple or Samsung, or sends the case back down to the lower courts for further consideration, the decision will have a large effect on the determination of design patent infringement damages and strategic approaches when seeking design patent protection.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple will live-stream October 27 Mac keynote By Christian Zibreg, Oct 20, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment Invites for a new media event went out yesterday and Apple just confirmed that the keynote will be live-streamed through its website. As you’ve come to expect from iDownloadBlog, we will be providing remote coverage of the keynote along with details of the announcements. This could be the last event at Infinite Loop’s Town Hall campus. That’s because the massive Campus 2 building AKA “iSpaceship” should open come January 2017, barring any unforeseen delays. The site includes a massive underground auditorium where future corporate and press events will be taking place. Apple will live-stream the event at apple.com/apple-events/october-2016/. Like previous events, this one will use Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming technology which requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0+, a Mac with Safari 6.0.5+ on OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5+ or a PC with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. You can also watch the event on your TV via the Apple Events app on a fourth-generation Apple TV and a second or third-generation box with Apple Tv software 6.2+. Our Android friends and PC owners can enjoy the presentation by pasting a live-stream link into the VLC media player application (the actual live-stream URL is typically revealed a few hours ahead of the event). We’ll be making sure to post a “How to live stream the Mac event” explainer in a timely fashion so stay tuned.

We’re not sure what’s new in tvOS 10.0.1 but we’ll keep the post updated if any notable changes are found. It’s highly not recommended to run this beta as it may cause problems with your Apple TV down the road. However, to proceed: head to Apple’s Developer portal and download the necessary profile to your Mac or PC. Plug the device in via the USB-C port on the back of your Apple TV and fire up iTunes. From there, tap Option (Mac) / Shift (Windows) + Update and select the profile. Once completed, head over to your Apple TV’s settings > system > Software Update. If it does not appear, reboot your Apple TV and it should prompt you to update. If you spot anything interesting, be sure to leave us a comment below!

ADVERTISEMENT "There will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why?" West explained Wednesday during a concert in Seattle according to Pitchfork citing fan videos from the event. "Because of some Apple, Tidal [expletive]," he continued. The rant started after the outspoken rapper began performing his verse on Drake's track "Pop Style" that also features Jay Z and was notably absent from Drake's album Views ,which is an Apple Music exclusive. "I wasn't on the song because of Hov, because of some Tidal, Apple [expletive] ... So y'all didn't get, what y'all was supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal, Apple [expletive]," he continued. Notably, Jay Z and West are Tidal co-owners with West last releasing his latest project The Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal before it reached other streaming services. West did not mention his rumored collaborative album with Drake that was teased in September during an interview with Vogue. "We're just working on music, working on a bunch of music together, just having fun going into the studio," West said of the pairing. West made headlines Wednesday when he added 21 more shows to his currently ongoing Saint Pablo Tour. << PRIOR STORY Christopher Lloyd joins '12 Monkeys' ensemble NEXT STORY >> Sarah Jessica Parker: Robert Downey Jr. reunion wasn't 'weird' Get more Reality TV World!

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7. TNT 8. HGTV 9. Nickelodeon 10. AMC 11. Adult Swim 12. FX 13. Cartoon Network 14. Food Channel 15. Lifetime 16. ABC Family 17. Syfy 18. TLC 19. Hallmark 20.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple will unveil new Mac computers on October 27, when we expect it will also discuss the new MacBook Pro. Several rumors have suggested Apple is going to outfit the laptop with an OLED bar above the keyboard that will provide shortcuts, information on open applications and more. New evidence now suggests it may be called the “Magic Toolbar.” The name was spotted by The Trademark Ninja, which discovered a company representing Apple coughed up somewhere around  $17,500 for the moniker. It’s not directly registered to Apple, rather a company named “Presto Apps America,” and you can follow The Trademark Ninja’s logical tracing to Apple at the source below. It’s far from confirmed, though Apple frequently uses “Magic” in its accessory family. Apple likes Magic The Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard are just three examples. The naming might even suggest that it won’t be limited to the MacBook Pro. Perhaps we’ll see it land in other products, too. Apple probably has much more up its sleeves for the October 27 event, but the “Magic Toolbar” may very well be one of the early highlights. We’ll know the final name next week.

Earnings Preview: iPhone 7 Sales Mystery Will Finally Be Solved October 20, 2016 12:39pm Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Zacks Research: Technology behemoth Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, it posted a 2.16% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.03%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Apple is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Apple has the right combination of the two key components. Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.21%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.67 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.65. Zacks Rank: Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. APPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise APPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | APPLE INC Quote What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings? Since the beginning of this year, Apple has been on a rollercoaster ride given muted demand and sluggish macroeconomic conditions especially in China. Despite this, in the last reported quarter, the company managed to beat expectations on both counts. We expect the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter to be driven by recovering iPhone sales and robust upgrade cycles. Historically, the fourth quarter has been a strong one for Apple as the company launches its most important offerings during this time. This September, Apple launched the new iPhones (iPhone 7 and 7 Plus), which appear to be significantly better than their predecessors. The company also unveiled a newer version of Apple Watch in addition to providing updates on Apple Music, App Store and Apple Watch in addition to the software upgrades. Apple remains optimistic about growth in regions like India and a decent rebound in China. It has been taking initiatives like setting up R&D facilities to strengthen its foothold in China. A loyal customer base, a strong ecosystem and a robust installed base are the other positives.  Apple’s Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. The company has also been seeing strength in the number of switchers from Android and other operating systems to iOS. Apart from this, other revenue drivers to watch out for ahead of this quarter’s results include sales from iPad, the App Store as well as Apple’s other products division. Further, its collaborations with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and Cisco (CSCO –Analyst Report) in the enterprise space are likely to be accretive to the fourth quarter and beyond. However, continued macroeconomic headwinds in some key regions amid increasing competition may pose some challenges. Apple shares fell $0.05 (-0.04%) to $117.07 in Thursday afternoon trading. Year-to-date, APPL has gained 11.24%, more than doubling the return of the benchmark S&P 500 in the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of Zacks Research.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the tvOS 10.0.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable and downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. No obvious outward-facing features were discovered in the first three tvOS 10.0.1 betas, so it's likely the update focuses on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance improvements to address issues discovered since the release of the first version of tvOS 10. Single sign-on, a feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all live cable content included in a cable subscription, does not appear to be included in this beta and will be introduced in the future. tvOS 10 brings improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a new dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic download of universal apps, easy access to live TV, and more.

The upcoming software update for fourth-gen Apple TVs follows the more featured packed tvOS 10 release from September. So far consumer-facing features haven’t been included, although single sign-on is still a feature debuting soon. This feature will let you sign in to your cable provider once, then be logged in to each available channel automatically rather than going through the set up process with special codes and Safari over and over and over. The App Store will even present you with a list of all the available channels for your cable provider so you don’t have to hunt for the right channels on your own. The lack of SSO during developer betas (and the 10.0.1 version number versus 10.1) suggests the feature won’t make the cut for this release. We’ll update with any new information found in tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4.

US copyright chief was assigned to shop till, tweeting Apple is silently stiffing customers who don't spend enough on the latest iPhones. For the past few years, the cheapest new iPhone model had a storage capacity of 8GB, then 16GB, which in practice meant just over 12GB available if you include the bundled software. This meant there was insufficient space to perform an update comfortably. “Essentially you will have to delete half your [typical] content in order to make space for the iOS 8 download,” MacWorld noted two years ago. For this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, how could Apple quietly wallop cheapskates? Blogger Lewis Hilsentenger has the answer. The more expensive iPhone 7's flash memory is up to eight times faster than the slowest model. The read speed for the 256GB model is 856MB/s to the 32GB model’s 686MB/s. But write speeds are far slower on the entry-level iPhone 7. The 32GB iPhone 7 writes data at 42MB/s while the 256GB writes at 341MB/s. Race ... Hilsentenger's benchmark findings iFixit’s teardown of the iPhone 7 reveals that its 32GB flash part is made by SK Hynix. Apple may use different modules in different markets. The Cupertino idiot-tax operation is the world's biggest buyer of flash memory, and has used slower parts before, as KBench found in 2014. Crucially, the difference in flash access speeds is not advertised by Apple; buyers are kept in the dark. It's a little detail the iGiant would rather you didn't know. Having said that, the difference may not always be noticeable. Even writing 4K video requires less bandwidth than the maximum throughput of the 32GB flash in the iPhone 7. The read-write speeds for 32GB and 256GB are likely to be good enough for most mobile applications. The eightfold speed difference is probably due to the 256GB model using eight blobs of 32GB of flash in parallel. That's very convenient for Apple. That design decision means that for the fastest storage memory, you have to make a larger donation to the Temple of Apple.

Summit Didi Chuxing Is “Definitely Going Global” Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER V.F. Summit Didi Chuxing Is “Definitely Going Global” Onstage at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit, Didi president Jean Liu talks about Uber, Apple, and growing her own company. by Maya KosoffOctober 20, 2016 1:01 pm Email Facebook Twitter Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing giant better known in the U.S. as the “Uber of China”—at least before Didi took over Uber’s China business earlier this year—is looking beyond the borders of the People’s Republic. “We’re definitely going global,” Didi Chuxing president Jean Liu said Thursday at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit, in conversation with Alibaba president Michael Evans and Bloomberg News anchor Emily Chang. “We’re a big sponsor and big believer in local players. If there are no existing local players, we’ll go there by ourselves. We will play a global game.” Didi has expanded strategically, forging alliances with other key players in the tech world. In May, Apple poured $1 billion into Didi. But Liu side-stepped a question about the significance of Apple’s investment, responding by talking about Siri integration in Didi rides and the prevalence of iPhones in China. ”China is such a big market for Apple,” she said. “We’re such an important player in China. You can imagine, there’s a lot of things we can work on.” At the time, Apple’s investment seemed like a snub toward Uber, then Didi’s chief rival in China. Both companies reportedly had been burning billions of dollars in a race to gain market share in the country. But in August, Uber and Didi came to what appeared to be a truce. Didi Chuxing bought Uber China to create a new entity worth an eye-popping $35 billion—the combined valuation of Uber China and Didi, then worth $28 billion. “Our love will last till the end of time,” Liu remarked at the time. Weeks later, Foxconn—the Taiwanese iPhone supplier—invested $119.9 million in Didi, valuing Didi alone at $33.8 billion, and bolstering the four-year-old Chinese ride-hailing company’s position as the second most valuable venture-backed private company in Asia, behind only Xiaomi.

Travis Kalanick, the prospect of expanding into China was worth the risk. “We thought it would be super interesting and maybe impossible to do a transportation thing in China,” Kalanick told Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter in a revealing conversation Wednesday on the first day of the New Establishment Summit. “China is just so different from the rest of the world. I got my best six or seven people and we camped out in an apartment for a couple weeks in Beijing and figured it out. Six or seven months later we launched.” But doing business in China wasn’t easy. “In China, the government is involved in business in many different ways,” Kalanick continued. “They’re involved in media and business. When you go to China, you have to rethink how you’re doing everything. You have to become Chinese. And if you’re not willing to become Chinese, and you think you know how to do something best, you’re going to get your ass handed to you. You have to be humble and assume everything is different until proven otherwise.“ Didi, meanwhile, has been building out its ride-hailing ambitions beyond China’s borders. Last year, the company reportedly entered into a global alliance with Grab, Ola, and Lyft, whose relationship with Didi appears more complicated following the Uber China merger. Didi’s deal with Uber, too, is complicated. Just days after the merger was announced, Bloomberg reported that Didi and Softbank were backing a massive new round of funding for Grab, Uber’s most powerful rival in Southeast Asia, effectively maneuvering to block Uber from redirecting its resources into another contested Asian market. (Grab announced in a press release in September that it had raised $750 million in a round that included “both new and existing investors.”) For now, Didi appears to have conquered China in the wake of its $35 billion deal with Uber—and other ride-hailing companies have taken note. “After more than a year of intense competition, our investor and global partner Didi has effectively won the battle for market share dominance in China,” Grab C.E.O. Anthony Tan said in an e-mail at the time. “Didi’s success reinforces what we have believed all along: That we live in a very diverse world and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Localized solutions best solve local problems.” This story has been updated.

Chances are, it's FAKE and could be DANGEROUS iPhone - Bought a new charger on Amazon? Chances are, it's FAKE and could be DANGEROUS A NEW Apple lawsuit claims 90 per cent of the "official" or "genuine" iPhone chargers sold on Amazon are FAKE – and could be dangerous to customers. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 16:58, Sat, Oct 22, 2016 | UPDATED: 16:58, Sat, Oct 22, 2016 GETTYApple is waging war on companies pretending to authorised iPhone products Ever bought a brand-new iPhone charger from Amazon? According to a recent lawsuit filed by Apple, the vast majority of iPhone and iPad charging cables sold as "official" or "genuine" on the US online store are fake. The iPhone manufacturer is currently suing a company called Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement. Apple alleges the company has been selling counterfeit charging cables as the real deal. APPLEOfficial Apple accessories can be bought online at the Apple Store The Cupertino-based company claims to have bought a number of chargers from Mobile Star LLC to conduct routine safety tests. Despite being listed on Amazon as genuine Apple products, Apple engineers said they were "poorly constructed, with inferior or missing components, flawed design, and inadequate electrical insulation." Apple wrote: "Consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine. "This is particularly true where, as here, the products are sold directly 'by Amazon.com' as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images." In the lawsuit, Apple describes buying more than 100 "iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine" by other sellers on Amazon. Apple's investigation found that 90 per cent of these products were fake. According to Apple, these fake cables can be dangerous to customers – with the potential to catch fire or electrocute, thanks to poor electrical insulation. iPhone 7 – In Pictures Tue, September 13, 2016 The iPhone 7 is, without doubt, the best smartphone Apple has ever created. It is fast, incredibly powerful, has a much-improved camera and is now water resistant. However, it’s a shame there’s not more innovation with this two-year-old design Play slideshow EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS 1 of 12 It might not have a new design but the useful updates make the iPhone 7 a worthwhile upgrade The lawsuit claims that when Apple alerted Amazon to the problematic chargers supplied by Mobile Star, Amazon turned over the entire stock purchased from the company. In a statement sent to 9to5Mac, Amazon said it has "zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits." It added that it works "closely with manufacturers and brands, and [pursues] wrongdoers aggressively."

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that 'pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.'  Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake.  Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source.

China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market From the Associated Press Oct 20, 2016 AP Photo | Jeff Chiu Rob Chandhok, LeEco North America chief research and development officer, holds a LePro 3 phone while speaking at an event in San Francisco, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. SAN FRANCISCO — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

"There will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why?" West explained Wednesday during a concert in Seattle according to Pitchfork citing fan videos from the event. "Because of some Apple, Tidal [expletive]," he continued. The rant started after the outspoken rapper began performing his verse on Drake's track "Pop Style" that also features Jay Z and was notably absent from Drake's album Views ,which is an Apple Music exclusive. "I wasn't on the song because of Hov, because of some Tidal, Apple [expletive] ... So y'all didn't get, what y'all was supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal, Apple [expletive]," he continued. Notably, Jay Z and West are Tidal co-owners with West last releasing his latest project The Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal before it reached other streaming services. West did not mention his rumored collaborative album with Drake that was teased in September during an interview with Vogue. "We're just working on music, working on a bunch of music together, just having fun going into the studio," West said of the pairing. West made headlines Wednesday when he added 21 more shows to his currently ongoing Saint Pablo Tour.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 20, 2016 9:31 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Tablets Healthcare IT Apple Comments A US hospital is putting iPads and an Apple TV inside 245 rooms in an attempt to empower patients with easy to access real-time insights into their treatment and conditions, yet more evidence of Apple’s big plans for health. Empowering patient recovery The newly revealed Jacobs Medical Center plans are yet another public expression of the transformative impact Apple’s technologies are having across the industry. They were announced at the event at which IBM also revealed the it is three times more expensive to manage Windows PCs than to manage Macs. Patients will be able to use the two Apple devices to check their patient notes and Electronic Health data, using Epic’s MyChart app. This will enable them to understand their condition and treatment. The Apple devices will also help improve their stay, controlling room temperature and lighting, keeping in contact with friends and family using FaceTime or Skype, and accessing multimedia entertainment. The best solution The decision to use Apple kit was based on how easy it is to manage once deployed, using Jamf solutions. The hospital tried using 25 Android tablets because they were cheaper, but things didn’t work out. “Other devices were evaluated, but weren’t easy-to-execute because someone had to physically touch each device to reset it after it was wiped,” said Marc Sylwestrzak, director of IS experience and web services, UC San Diego Health. “This process took 15-20 minutes per device each time we needed to prepare a device for the next patient.” I’ve no doubt Apple’s critics will try to dismiss these plans, asking what value the solutions will provide to patient health. They miss the point. Patients that are empowered with knowledge concerning their condition are better at handling the recovery. Not only this but the ability to stay in contact with friends and family reduces feelings of isolation and access to your chosen forms of entertainment can help stave of the demoralization that so often impacts patients in long-term care. Patient morale is an important component to recovery. Not only this, but with so many of the patients at this hospital likely to be suffering from mobility, voice or hearing impairment, Apple’s industry-leading accessibility tools will likely play a part. Why it matters "We're giving patients visibility into why they are there," Eric Boyd said. "We're reducing the worries of being in a hospital and empowering patients" to have quick and easy access to what is happening to them as part of their treatment.” Apple is completely dedicated to digital transformation across the healthcare industry and is already working with some of the world’s leading digital health experts. Sensor and software development is on the fast track at the firm, as it attempts to find a way to marry the very best in medical science with product development strategies to create mass-market health-related devices that truly make you well. Think about the actual engineering commitment that went into ensuring the Apple Watch heart sensor is the most precise such sensor you can get. Building better iPhone has a big part to play in health research. The smartphone brand with the highest customer satisfaction in the industry is able to translate customer engagement into real world research data thanks to Research Kit, Care Kit and HealthKit in iOS. “What Apple is offering at a large scale with these frameworks is an ecosystem for digital health,” explains Ryan Rossier is VP of Platform Solutions at Medullan. Once again the notion is that by linking what we habitually do with sensors and data collection for health, Apple can succeed in identifying patterns to help keep you healthy. The future potential of this kind of technology is immense. It is possible a recent AI deployment in Germany may help show how profoundly these solutions could transform healthcare. IBM and Germany’s Rhön-Klinikum’s Center for Undiagnosed and Rare Diseases are using Watson to analyse large quantities of complex patient data in order to help improve diagnosis of some of the world’s rarest and hardest to identify conditions. That’s one of those sentences that may fly by you, so let me reprise it: Watson is being used to analyze huge collections of patient data in order to spot relationships and inconsistencies that may help identify what ails a person. In less complex cases, these technologies should also be capable of identifying good practice to avoid potential illness. Apple a day So, returning to the Jacobs Medical Center, you’d be foolish to dismiss the deployment of Apple solutions there – soon they will be everywhere, including the operating room. Apple’s big game plan is to ensure that using an Apple each day will really keep you well. Google+?

The new beta arrived ten days following tvOS 10.0.1 beta 3 and more than two weeks after the second beta was seeded to developers. Release notes accompanying tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4 make no mention of any outward-facing feature additions. For beta 4, Apple is asking developers to focus on one last remaining issue in UIKit that causes the “Hold To Dictate” text to appear in a dark color when the search keyboard is configured to be explicitly dark. tvOS 10.0.1 is expected to bring about mostly performance improvements and various bug fixes. “tvOS 10.0.1 includes bug fixes and improvements in the OS,” as per Apple. We’ll update the article with other changes in tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4 as we encounter them. tvOS 10.0.1 has been in testing since September 21.

Kanye West's Saint Pablo tour continued in Seattle last night (Oct. 19) at the KeyArena and Yeezy, as he has all summer long, dedicated a piece of his set to some of his high-profile guest verses he's lent out this year so far. But before he went into "Pop Style," the Drake song that originally included a verse from West and a few lines from Jay Z -- aka the Throne -- 'Ye had something to get off his chest. "I wasn't on this song 'cause of Hov. 'Cause of this Tidal-Apple bullsh-t," he said, according to videos from the show originally reported by Fader, and also adding that there will never be a Watch the Throne 2. "And this sh-t be getting me tight every time I perform this motherf---er. That y'all didn't get what y'all were supposed to get with me and Drake on this song 'cause of some Tidal - Apple bullsh-t." He continued, "This sh-t got me tight, yo. Every time I perform the song I think about this sh-t. I think about the politics and the bullsh-t. I think about how hard I go for music, for art, for y'all, for the fans, how hard we go." In a second video, as part of the same monologue, West went into some detail about how he and Jay first came to be on the song -- and why Jay ultimately backed out, citing his respect for Meek Mill, who is signed to Jay's Roc Nation management company and over a year into a long-running beef with Drake. "I start freestylin' to it. Jay thought of a couple lines, I said, 'Man, just go ahead and throw that on there, [Drake] would be so surprised he probably wouldn't expect you to be on there,'" Kanye said. "And we sent it back to him. And he was like, 'Oh sh-t, the Throne is on this sh-t.' Then Jay thought about it, and out of respect for Meek Mill he didn't want to be on the track. And I said, 'Look, I'll call Drake, I'll call Meek, I'll call y'all, we gotta squash this sh-t, we gotta let people have this song.' "But then it went out of that and went into some Tidal, some political sh-t, some sh-t about percentages on songs. I can't take this sh-t, bro." Now for some context: Kanye, of course, is one of the 20 artist-owners of Jay Z's Tidal streaming service, and released his Life of Pablo album as a streaming exclusive on Tidal for six weeks earlier this year. (In February he claimed it would "never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale." It is now available on all platforms and is for sale on his website.) Drake's close relationship with Apple has included the exclusive release of his album Views and his short film Please Forgive Me via Apple Music; his OVO Sound radio show on Apple's Beats 1; his Summer Sixteen Tour with Future that was sponsored by Apple Music; and his music being used in Apple Music's now-iconic Taylor Swift treadmill commercial. (Oh, and that jacket.) The situation, digitally at least, puts Kanye and Drake on opposite sides of the fence as Apple and Tidal compete for subscribers in the race to catch market leader Spotify. It's a frustration that Kanye has voiced before; in July, he started a run of tweets criticizing the arms race that began with, "This Tidal Apple beef is fucking up the music game." He continued by saying he wnated Apple's Tim Cook, Jimmy Iovine and Larry Jackson to get together with Jay, Drake, Roc Nation's Desiree Perez and himself and his manager Scooter Braun to work things out. "F--k all this dick swinging contest. We all gon be dead in 100 Years. Let the kids have the music." Finally, referencing the persistent (and frequently denied) rumors that Apple is lining up a bid to purchase Tidal: "Apple give Jay his check for Tidal now and stop trying to act like you Steve." The last time West addressed the topic, Billboard dove into the myriad reasons why Kanye would be so insistent on ending this "beef" between Apple and Tidal, which have been the two most prominent players to use exclusives from high-profile artists to boost their services. (Amazon joined them this week, too.) But while he's clearly frustrated with the business -- the "political sh-t," as it were, that blocks him from putting out whatever he wants with whoever he wants -- the reference to percentages is a little more vague. Tidal's initial launch, marred in confusing messaging as it was, came with the promise of a higher royalty rate paid to artists than what Spotify was paying at the time (Apple Music wouldn't launch until three months later). The reality is a little more muddled than that, but if a joint Drake-Kanye album were to be released, it would likely not be exclusive to Apple or Tidal individually (though maybe to both collectively) and would seem to make that distinction a moot point. Any other analysis would be speculation as to what Kanye was referring to, whether it be writing credits or production points or label politics or some combination of them all. But Kanye's frustrations seem to have ended any potentially imminent joint release, either collectively with Drake or collectively with Jay. Reps for Apple and Tidal did not return requests for comment as of press time. And the streaming merry-go-round continues spinning for another day.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Will iOS 10.1 release for public consumption next Tuesday, October 25? By Christian Zibreg, Oct 20, 2016 Tweet 21 Comments Apple is holding a media event on October 27 to refresh Macs and we’re pretty sure that the upcoming machines will run macOS Sierra 10.12.1 out of the box. Currently being beta-tested, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 includes, among other things, support for Portrait albums in Photos. Apple is also beta-testing iOS 10.1 which, too, packs in support for a new Portrait mode on dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus models. If the Sierra update drops ahead of new Macs, so should iOS 10.1. We believe iOS 10.1 will release for public consumption next Tuesday, October 25, two days before the Mac event, and here’s why. First and foremost, iOS 10.1 does not contain a myriad of new features that would require extensive testing. So far, iOS 10’s first major bug-fix release comes with a pair of new features: Portrait photography mode on the iPhone 7 Plus and a toggle in Settings to allow Messages animations when Reduce Motion is enabled. We’re now on a fifth beta of iOS 10.1 and it’s very stable, indicating there could be one or two additional beta releases before the software update is ready for wider release. Then there’s a “smoking gun”: during Tim Cook’s whirlwind tour of Japan, local media reported that Apple Pay will be launching in the country on October 25. According to notices on the websites of Docomo iD and JR East Suica, their services will be completely down for “unscheduled system maintenance” in the early morning hours of October 25—possibly in preparation for Apple Pay launch. Now, Apple Pay will feature support for Japanese railway JR East through its dedicated Suica payment system, and it’s going to require an iOS firmware update. Another clue: Apple Maps transit directions have gone live for iOS 10.1 beta testers and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta users in Japan. Conventional wisdom tells us Apple will want Japanese customers using Apple Pay to purchase railway tickets through the Suica payment system to also be able to look up transit directions and railway lines in Apple Maps at the same time. Therefore, it would make sense to release both Apple Pay support and transit directions in Maps simultaneously for users in Japan. And if Apple Pay is launching in Japan on October 25, we could infer that iOS 10.1 will almost certainly release for public consumption globally on the same day. Make sense?

GarrettD Is there any reason that the iPhone 7 couldn’t get Portrait Mode? I seriously doubt that the software uses both lenses for to create the bokeh effect, just significant softening of out of focus areas. I say this because the second lens is 2x, how could the lenses work in tandem with such a difference? askep3 When you use portrait mode the picture you see is through the 2x lens. So let’s say you are in normal camera mode and you are in 2x zoom, that is the same as what you see in portrait mode. Also it’s pretty obvious it uses both lenses, especially from the way you have to take the picture for it to work PhoneTechJay if you don’t have a 7 Plus it doesn’t really have much to offer..

Y’all didn’t get what y’all are supposed to get when me and Drake on this song cause of some Tidal-Apple bulls–t.” According to the rapper things got “political,” citing “some s–t about percentages on songs. I can’t take this s–t, bro.” Back in April, Drake told Beats 1’s Zane Lowe that Jay Z and West’s verse didn’t appear on the studio version of “Pop Style” because “It didn’t play out how I wanted it to go. Sometimes [Jay Z and I] just fall on opposite sides of the spectrum.” West continued to talk about Jay Z and told the crowd that he and his wife Kim Kardashian West didn’t hear from him after she was robbed in Paris this month. “Don’t call me after the robbery,” West said, “and say, ‘How you feelin’? You want to know how I’m feelin’? Come by the house, bring the kids like we brothers. Let’s sit down.” See West’s comments below. ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP — ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 pt. 2 @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/N64PEXu7N7 — ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 “Don’t call me, after the robbery, and say ‘how you feelin?’ You wanna know how I’m feelin?

The Le Pro3 packs one of the fastest mobile processors available and a huge battery into a $399 package. LeEco isn't a brand that most U.S. consumers will be familiar with. It's typically described as "the Netflix of China," but it's actually far more than a streaming provider. The company makes an incredibly diverse range of products, ranging from cars and bikes to smartphones. At an event yesterday, LeEco announced it is bringing a large swathe of its portfolio to the U.S., including a virtual reality headset, 85-inch television and Android-powered bike. In comparison to these products, the Le Pro 3 could seem mundane. It's a highly competitive phone aiming to gain market share from Apple — on the company's own turf. It's part of Le Eco's "Ecophone" line, itself part of the larger LeEco ecosystem. The company's extensive product range links together into a complete family of devices. The Le Pro 3 has a 5.5-inch Full HD display. It's made of aluminium with a brushed metal finish. The back of the phone contains elements of most popular Android flagships. The body looks like recent HTC devices but the slight camera bump is distinctly Samsung. There's also a hint of the minimalism of OnePlus and Apple. The result is a good-looking phone, even if it doesn't do anything that hasn't been seen before. LeEco Le Pro 3 LeEco LeEco has concentrated its engineering efforts on the Le Pro 3's internals. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor is widely regarded to be the fastest mobile chip currently available, excluding Apple's A10. It's a brand new processor that's so far only been used on Google's Pixel and Pixel XL. The phone has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The main camera has a 16MP sensor capable of shooting 4K video. Alongside the main specs, you'll find a fingerprint sensor, NFC, USB Type-C, Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and a huge 4,070mAh battery. The battery capacity is all the more remarkable considering the Le Pro 3 is just 7.53mm thick. Apple would do well to take notes. The Le Pro 3 isn't all about the hardware though. LeEco realises that it needs to do more than sell smartphones if it's to succeed in the U.S. The Le Pro 3 runs LeEco's Ecosystem User Interface (eui) on top of Android, providing "open access to Android apps, entertainment, games and content." More significantly, eui also enables "seamless navigation" between LeEco's range of connected devices. The company thinks that once customers have bought one product they'll start to buy more. Soon, all their devices will be manufactured by LeEco, due to the ties between each one. LeEco Le Pro 3 LeEco The plan is bold and critics are divided on whether LeEco is being too ambitious. The company is hinging its platform on a competitive entry price. At just $399, the Le Pro 3 is significantly less costly than rival high-end phones. For comparison, Google's Pixel starts at $649. However, some analysts doubt whether consumers even want another ecosystem. With Apple, Google and Microsoft already touting their own families of devices, LeEco may find it hard to promote its platform. "There's no clamoring for another ecosystem in the U.S. right now," Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, commented to WIRED. "People don't want something completely new or different — they want the stuff they have to get better." Despite this warning, there is evidence that budget products can convince customers to adopt ecosystems. Amazon's success with its range of Fire tablets and Kindle e-readers is testament to this. Amazon had the advantage of an existing brand reputation though. LeEco is entering the market as a complete outsider likely to be overlooked by consumers. The Le Pro 3 will go on sale in the U.S. on November 2. It will be available in grey and gold colours for $399. A lesser-powered sibling, the Le S3, will be available for $249. To try to get customers hooked into the LeEco ecosystem early on, LeEco will be offering a $100 "LeRewards" loyalty voucher with purchases of either phone.

Today we’re happened upon details tipping two of the next MacBook’s most major features. One of these is a touchscreen that sits just above the keyboard of the notebook, the other is a button. According to the next-level investigatory skills of The Trademark Ninja, Apple’s MacBook Pro 2016 will feature two new bits of technology. Of course this machine will feature a new processor inside and more RAM and different ports, too. But the most interesting bits come in two trademark filings. One is for a technology (presumably for the MacBook Pro) called Magic Toolbar. We’ve heard of this sort of feature before – we’ve even seen some high-quality renders. Now with a brand attached, or appearing to attach, we’re an extra step closer to confirmation. This Magic Toolbar would play host to new controls for a variety of apps. Music controls would be right up there with the first wave, as would gallery browsing. Expect integration with all applicable Apple-made apps right out the gate, and 3rd-party support in the future. There’s also a “Smart Button” rumored in the mix. This Smart Button could well be the fingerprint sensor we’ve been waiting for on the MacBook Pro. It could also be that this Smart Button will be a close relative of the iPhone’s Home Button. It wouldn’t be the first time that two Apple devices would have similar technology with slightly different names. This Smart Button would likely keep user accounts extra safe and secure. Like Apple’s dedication to security with the iPhone with Touch ID, the MacBook Pro should – and very likely will – be next. Apple will be holding their next big event on the 27th of October, 2016. We’ll be there with bells on, and you’ll be able to read about everything they show here on SlashGear in our big Apple hub.

Henne Oct 20, 2016 10:00 AM Apple Inc. Apple Inc. Share Tweet Apple recently scrapped its plans to build and market its own self-driving car. But that doesn’t mean that the Cupertino, CA technology giant has abandoned its dream of outfitting every inch of your future in aerospace-grade aluminum and sapphire glass. Bloomberg is now reporting on a partnership between Apple and some of the U.S.’ largest home builders. A pair of demonstrations reveal Apple’s strategy to literally be installed into the foundation of your new home. Lennar Corp. delivered a sleek demonstration in a spec home outfitted with $30,000 worth of upgrades, including shades, climate, music, lighting, and security all working in concert to ensconce you in a harmonious environment that expensively anticipates your every move. Meanwhile, KB home pitched a similar system at a more affordable, $2,000 entry-level price point. While Amazon and Google have long competed in this space, Apple is not developing their own suite of exquisitely manicured hardware. Instead, the company is leveraging its free HomeKit app and SDK to help builders and hardware providers use Apple as the brains of their smart home products. The strategy here being that smart homes running HomeKit will be operated by a family of iPhone and iPad users. Using the same strategy behind iPods and iTunes to re-infiltrate the personal computing market, Apple likely sees this as a way to reinvigorate flattening sales of their touchscreen products. Of course, Apple is probably already looking forward to a sales boost, thanks to consumer blowback over their competitor’s novelty-exploding smartphones.

Amazon Music is currently free but not as user-friendly. I have been happy with Spotify and don’t need another music subscription service (Beats1). Although I couldn’t easily useSpotify on Apple TV (no app), I do use it in Roku and Chromecast. iTunes Radio was a big reason I stayed with Apple TV. Now that iTUnes Radio is gone I learned how to play Spotify through my Apple TV using an old iPhone as the source. Works great. I am no longer locked into Apple to listen to music and won’t be buying I songs from iTunes like I did from iTunes Radio. I will not get the next iteration of Apple TV when I upgrade.

With this new subscription only radio play, you are asking me to spend twice what I would normally spend in music every year. Granted, yes, more music to listen to, but not what I am willing/wanting to do. I will have to explore music somewhere else, and ultimately buy from somewhere else. You are cutting out the middle class, just like all the arrogant aristocratic companies in the US, only wanting to cater the rich. Your $10,000+ watches sure make this clear.

By Natalie Theodosi on October 20, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Claridge's hotel in London's Mayfair. Courtesy Photo APPLE TREE: London’s Claridge’s hotel is looking outside fashion this year, for designers to create its popular Christmas tree. The famous Mayfair hotel revealed that it has partnered with Apple’s chief design officer Sir John Ive and Marc Newson — a designer who works across multiple disciplines, from furniture to aircraft and yachts — for the occasion. “We truly believe that both Jony and Marc’s innovative spirits and groundbreaking approach will make this year’s annual tradition one to remember for our guests,” said Paul Jackson, Claridge’s general manager. Ive is responsible for the look and feel of some of the most recognizable and used products in the world, from the Macbook to the iPhone and iPad, while Newson’s work ranges from creating kitchen appliances in partnership with Smeg, objects to house Dom Pérignon Champagne bottles and business suites for Qantas Airways. Newson has also been dipping his toes in fashion, having recently participated in a project with Louis Vuitton to create a series of rolling trunks, as well as working with Nicolas Ghesquière on his “Celebrating Monogram” initiative by designing a sculptural leather and shearling backpack. He has also teamed with Safilo on an eyewear capsule and designed a line of futuristic workwear in collaboration with Dutch label G-Star Raw. The Claridge’s Christmas tree, located in the hotel’s lobby, has become known as somewhat of a city landmark during the holiday season, drawing large numbers of visitors to admire its design. In the past seven years, the hotel has tapped a number of fashion designers to design the tree including Alber Elbaz, John Galliano and Dolce & Gabbana. Last year, Burberry’s Christopher Bailey worked with the hotel on the holiday-themed project, adorning the tree with metallic umbrellas from top to bottom. The 2016 Christmas tree will be unveiled in Claridge’s lobby on Nov. 18. RELATED STORY: Claridge’s Unveils Burberry’s Umbrella Tree >> You're missing something!

Remember Jay Z’s two-bar verse on Drake’s “Pop Style"? While performing in Seattle last night, Kanye revealed that they were both supposed to be on “Pop Style” but, in a complicated turn of events, Tidal co-founder Jay Z’s verse was removed from the song when Drake’s album Views was eventually sold on Apple Music. Yeezy blamed “some Tidal, some political shit, some shit about percentages" for decisions made around the song. Clearly enraged at the idea that “some Tidal/Apple bullshit” could affect his art, Kanye declared, “There will never be a  Watch the Throne 2.” Yeezy also revealed that Jay Z had the audacity to call him after Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris, rather than visit the pair at home, all of which is going to make Watch the Throne 2 good as hell when they inevitably patch things up and release it on whatever streaming platform everyone has implanted directly in their brains in ten years. ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP— ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 pt. 2 @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/N64PEXu7N7— ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 "Don't call me, after the robbery, and say 'how you feelin?'

The company this week sent invitations to the media, asking them to gather at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., for a product launch event. Apple is widely expected to introduce a batch of laptops at the event – an area of the company’s product lineup that has gone without a major refresh for quite a while. Apple hasn’t updated its Retina MacBook Pro or MacBook Air in more than a year; the company did offer a refresh of its MacBook in April. The standard MacBook Pro hasn’t had an update in four years. As a result of the long gap, many Apple experts have advised putting off Mac laptop purchases in anticipation of the new models. The timing of the event puts Apple in the sweet spot for the holiday season, when it can feature computers running the latest version of its desktop operating system, MacOS Sierra. The new system has a lot of new features, but chief among them is the addition of Siri. Rumors have been flying for some time about what Apple might have planned for its laptops. In May, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and 9 to 5 Mac both reported that Apple could be adding a row of touch-screen keys to the top of the keyboard – replacing the “function” keys. Other rumors include the suspicion that Apple will add Touch ID to its laptops, and that the firm will add USB-C to all of its laptop models.

Apple is mostly making a fashion and branding statement with Apple Watch Nike+ via a special band and color schemes. The core features of the special version of the watch are the same as other Series 2 models, including a built-in GPS to track your pace, distance, and route. But independent GPS tracking is a critical fitness upgrade for a product co-branded with Nike, because it gives you the option to untether your iPhone when exercising. That is not possible on the first-gen watch, which needs the iPhone’s GPS. Apple also needs to do this to match the competition. Fitbit, the wearables’ market leader, offers the Fitbit Surge with built-in GPS at a price considerably lower than the Apple Watch Series 2. Though the Surge is not a full-featured watch like Apple’s, it starts at $250, compared to the Nike version of the Apple Watch 2 that has a starting price of $369. Basic wearables, like most of FitBit’s offerings, are still “a clear value proposition for end-users,” Ramon Llamas, an analyst at IDC, said in a statement when the company announced second-quarter global wearable shipment tallies last month.   Related: Wearable translation device promises a science-fiction future, almost That said, the Apple Watch Nike+, via its exclusive watch faces, can typically show off more metrics on the same screen -- including distance, duration, heart rate, and pace -- than a basic Fitbit wearable. Features exclusive to the Apple Watch Nike+ There are nice-to-have add-ons you get with Apple Watch Nike+. First and foremost is the band, which is probably its signature feature. Apple calls it light, flexible, and breathable, with perforations that reduce weight and boost ventilation. And the Nike Volt lime color scheme (what Nike calls “bright green-yellow”) matches the groundbreaking Nike FuelBand. The Nike+ version also comes with an exclusive Nike watch face, which adds the iconic Volt color in digital and analog styles. In the app department, there’s Nike+ Run Club. While you’re tracking your runs, you can get coaching and workouts created by Nike “master trainers.” And, like other Watch models, you can connect with friends for encouragement. For example, you can receive reminders triggered by your friends’ shared activity and share run results on leaderboards. Like all Watch 2 models, the Nike+ version can be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. The Apple Watch Series 2 has a water resistance rating of up to 50 meters under water, but it is not recommended for scuba diving or waterskiing, or other activities involving “high-velocity” water. And, like all Watch 2 models, it packs a faster processor (dual processing cores) and brighter display than the first-generation Watch. The Apple Watch Nike+ also comes in Space Gray Aluminum Case with Black/Cool Gray Nike Sport Band and a Silver Aluminum Case with Flat Silver/White or Flat Silver/Volt Nike Sport Band.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeConsumerIs Amazon A Safe Marketplace To Buy Apple Accessories? (AMZN, AAPL) Is Amazon A Safe Marketplace To Buy Apple Accessories? (AMZN, AAPL) Apple sued New York-based Mobile Star for supplying Amazon with counterfeit products. October 20, 2016 WSP In Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), there are two ways brand owners that do business: 1P (first-party) and 3P (third-party). The first-party sells direct wholesale to Amazon Retail using the Vendor Central interface, while the third-party allows private brand owners to sell direct to consumers through the Amazon marketplace using Seller Central interface. This system may seem unfazed, but not for long. According to a report on Patently Apple, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently purchased several power adapters, charging and syncing cable products directly from Amazon.com – not third-party, but the first-party platform. These items were tested and they found out that they were counterfeits. When Apple brought this to Amazon’s attention, the latter reported that the counterfeit products were sourced from Mobile Star. Amazon immediately handed over the entire inventory of items bought from Mobile Star. Then on Monday, Apple filed a lawsuit in California against the New York-based company Mobile Star. The lawsuit targets the company’s USB power adapters. Apple maintains that the products are not only fake, but potentially hazardous since they may have insulation and voltage circuits deficiencies. Meaning, these counterfeit items can possibly overheat, catch fire, and electrocute consumers in normal use. Apple is regularly taking steps to combat counterfeit accessories. In fact, the iPhone maker claims that in the last 9 months, it purchased more than 100 iPhones, power products, and charger and syncing cables that were advertised as genuine and authentic through Amazon.com’s “Fulfillment by Amazon” (FBA) policy and revealed that nearly 90% of these were counterfeits. Apple has expressed concerns over the increasing number of counterfeit products circulating the market. The safety of customers is the most at risk with this recent development given that knock-offs have not undergone  industry-standard consumer safety testing. Aside from that, these products were sourced from e-commerce giant Amazon.com, a reputed online marketplace that is popular worldwide. Since these counterfeits were sold directly by Amazon, consumers are less likely to be aware that those products were outsourced. In a statement,  Amazon said that it has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to counterfeiting and that the company is currently working closely with manufacturers and other vendors to pursue any wrongdoings. When Apple tried to contact the company regarding this issue, Mobile Star would not reveal the name of its supplier. In fact, they even started selling fake accessories directly, and the site carries other brands as well. Apple is seeking injunction against the company, destruction of all fake products, and $2 million worth of damages per product type. Before removing the selling privileges of Mobile Star, the accessories listings went as low as $9.43 while the official Apple price of the same item costs $35.00. Considering that there are a lot of counterfeit Apple products in the market, vendors offering items that cost significantly lower than the official price should already be a red flag to consumers. While there are authorized resellers, it is always better to be cautious than fall prey to counterfeits. Hopefully, more companies will follow suit, as these counterfeit activities are damaging not just in Amazon but everywhere else.

Apple has sued Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement, claiming the company sold counterfeit power products through Amazon.com. As reported by PCMag sister site IGN, Apple purchased a number of Apple-branded accessories on Amazon—power adapters, charging/syncing cables—over a nine-month period, and found that 90 of 100 were fakes. "[They] pose an immediate threat to consumer safety because, unlike genuine Apple products, they are not subjected to industry-standard consumer safety testing and are poorly constructed with inferior or missing components, flawed design, and inadequate electrical insulation. "These counterfeits have the potential to overheat, catch fire, and deliver a deadly electric shock to consumers while in normal use," according to the lawsuit, which was published in part by Patently Apple. Cupertino's four claims for relief cover trademark counterfeiting and infringement, false designation of origin, copyright infringement, and unfair competition. The company is requesting compensation up to $150,000 for each registered copyright infringementt and up to $2 million per counterfeit mark per type of goods sold, among other damages. "The safety of Apple's customers is of paramount importance to Apple, and Apple devotes significant resources to ensuring its power products meet industry safety standards and are subjected to rigorous testing for safety and reliability," the filing said. "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site," the company said in a statement. "We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." Cupertino also alleged that Mobile Star supplied Groupon with "dangerous counterfeit" accessories, as well. //Related Articles Apple Hosting Oct. 27 MacBook Event Neither Apple nor Groupon immediately responded to PCMag's request for comment.

Magazine tabs Corning Inc. as economy "superstar" Larry Wilson, Correspondent 11:02 a.m. EDT October 20, 2016 The Economist groups the Twin Tiers’ largest employer with GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and others as top corporations The Economist, a respected British magazine, has tapped Corning Inc. as one of the “superstars” of the global economy, putting the Southern Tier's largest employer in a group that includes GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and others. (Photo: FILE PHOTO) 114 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CORNING —  The Economist, a respected British magazine, has tapped Corning Inc. as one of the “superstars” of the global economy. That designation lands the Twin Tiers’ largest employer in a group that includes GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and other firms in the forefront of the 21st century corporate life. It wasn’t always like that. A couple of generations ago, Corning — then known as Corning Glass Works — was a family owned company in a rural upstate New York region. Its growth was generally unremarkable. Today it is a publicly owned, global enterprise with nearly $10 billion in annual sales and billions in annual profits, much of which comes from Asia. One of the routes Corning Inc. — the name was adopted in 1989 — took to its new incarnation was patient and significant investment in its core skills. Those skills included developing new glass and ceramic formulations and new manufacturing processes. The large and persistent investments paid off with a series of new products — optical fiber and liquid crystal display glass among them — that remain at the root of the company’s success. Today, The Economist notes, Corning produces much of the world’s glass for consumer electronics and much of the optical fiber for global communications. By continuing to invest in its core skills, Corning muscled its way into the market for cover glass for cell phones and similar devices. It is now expanding its reach to automobiles, where its strong and light Gorilla Glass promises to help improve safety and fuel economy. One of the major engines of Corning’s success is its central research and development complex, Sullivan Park in the Town of Erwin near Corning. The Economist describes Sullivan Park as resembling “a university campus,” and says some of its scientists continue working there into their 90s. Corning has also benefited from its origins as a family owned company, which meant it was originally free to set its own goals and pursue its own course without investor input. The “superstar”designation didn’t come as quickly for Corning Inc. as it did for some of the internet startups like Google and some of the tech giants like Apple. With a few deviations here and there, Corning has grown by relying on its discoveries in its glass laboratories and its application of its manufacturing expertise to those discoveries.

Many orchards produced very small apples, in small quantities. Posted Thursday, October 20, 2016 5:22 am By Makayla McGeeney mmcgeeney@benningtonbanner.com @MC_McGeeney on Twitter BENNINGTON >> Typically, apple picking season runs from the second week in August to the end of October, but this year some orchards were closed by the beginning of October, or before. Ever since March 2010, apple crops have clicked into a biennial system due to some kind of weather event, according to Terence Bradshaw, Ph.D., research associate at the University of Vermont. "It's not random and it's not just shortages," he said. "Apples are perennial crops developing next year's fruit buds at the same time they are developing this year's apples. If you have overproduction one year, there's not enough for the next year." The U.S. Apple Association estimated a 14 to 15 percent decrease in apple production in Vermont from last year, which Mark Seetin, director of regulatory and industry affairs, said held up to the expectation. Bradshaw cited a Mother's Day frost the year the pattern started. In 2011 the production was better. The following year it was short, and so on. This year it was a warm front that visited in March, breaking fruit buds too early, followed by a drop to 5 degrees on April 5, Tom Smith, owner of Mad Tom Orchard in East Dorset said. Mad Tom announced on its Facebook page on Oct. 3 that it was closed for the season due to a short crop. "Thanks for your support in a difficult year," the post read. "[The weather] killed about 60 percent of our crop," Smith said in an email. "McIntosh and Cortland varieties were hardest hit — Gala and Honeycrisp, which were still mostly dormant, had close to a full crop." He added that orchards farther north in Vermont and New York made out better because the fruit buds were still dormant when the temperature dropped in April. In addition to climate changes, little rain has watered crops to keep soil moist. To compensate, some orchards use an irrigation system, but find that sometimes it's not worth the cost. Bradshaw disagrees. "For new orchards [it's worth it] without a question," he said. "If you're putting in the expense to establish a new orchard, it's foolish not to irrigate. We're shifting to smaller and smaller trees. There's a lot less space using that soil, yes with the new orchards, it's imperative that they find a way to water. A lot of places don't have a good place to get water. The established trees still around have a solid root system." Even though the systems are expensive to implement, Bradshaw says they produce high quality fruit. It's a "high risk, high return" situation. Seetin said growers have to go through an economic worksheet to evaluate how many years they would actually use the irrigation system. "A lot of the eastern orchards that employ irrigation have a trickle irrigation," he said. "'How many years out of 10 will I benefit from irrigation' and they weigh that against the installation and they'll find that it won't pay for itself. You have to go through those numbers, that's the decision-making process. It's a little about looking at the past and looking to the future and what you feel the likelihood of the change of the moisture situation is." Irrigation may help the dry weather situation, but to protect crops from weather changes early in the year isn't practical, he added. "I've seen growers do some things with benefit but there's no research [behind it]," Bradshaw said. For example, setting bails of hay on fire and rolling them down the orchard rows, propane cannons or wind machines. The Apple Barn, which harvests from Southern Vermont Orchards, sees an average of one thousand visitors each weekend during harvest season, said owner Lia Diamond. They harvested half a crop with many small apples. "We planted older varieties with dwarfs," she said. "We're blessed to have apples. It was a good year." She added that the early frost didn't reach her orchard like the one Mad Tom's experienced. Diamond's orchard has irrigation and she said this year would have "been worse without it." Honeycrisp turned out well for Southern Vermont Orchards, Diamond said. The bright side to a short crop year, according to Bradshaw, is that it will be fuller next year due to the odd year pattern. Despite southern Vermont's turnout, the U.S. Apple Association won't have final reports on 2016 until after Nov. 1, Mark Seetin said. Contact Makayla-Courtney McGeeney at 802-490-6471.

 Some iPhone 7 models are slower than others, tests show Kif Leswing Oct. 20, 2016, 10:56 AM 13,782 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Unbox Therapy Apple says all of its iPhone 7 models are basically identical except for the amount of storage. The basic 32GB iPhone costs $649, but for $100 extra, Apple sells a 128GB version of the iPhone 7. For $200 extra, you can get a phone with 256GB of storage. The screen, chips, and shape of the phones are identical. But there's one big difference: The 256GB iPhone 7 has much faster write speeds than the 32GB iPhone 7, according to benchmarks being done on devices in the wild. Other tests show the 128GB model is faster in terms of write speeds than the 32GB model, too. That means that iPhones with more storage can, say, have big files transferred much faster than the entry-level iPhone 7.  The most recent look at this issue comes from prolific gadget YouTuber Unbox Therapy. First, he uses a benchmarking app to show the difference in write speeds in raw numbers. Then he runs a real world test: transferring a 4GB copy of "Star Wars" from a Mac to the phone. The 256GB iPhone 7 smoked the 32GB iPhone 7. The file transferred to the 256GB iPhone nearly a minute faster than the 32GB iPhone. There's no consensus explanation for why this might be, but larger solid state drives often have faster write speeds than smaller drives. Also, Apple could be using a different vendor for its 32GB chips.  It's not a dealbreaker. I don't transfer GBs to my iPhone often, and the bottleneck is usually the internet connection speed, not the limits of memory write speeds. But if I were buying an iPhone 7, this would certainly push me towards the models with more storage space.

(Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) San Francisco — Apple says it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit chargers and cables for its products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on products that “pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.” It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn’t named in the suit. Mobile Star didn’t immediately return a voicemail seeking comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-10-20 Print               Third-party vendors like Jamf offer deeper tools to replace Apple administrative tools that may not be adequate for larger users. MINNEAPOLIS—With some 20,000 Apple laptops being used around the world by employees of business processing outsourcing company Concentrix, the built-in Apple device management tools, such as Profile Manager, often can't keep up with the deeper needs of growing enterprises. To solve those limitations, businesses often must find and deploy targeted administrative tools from third-party vendors, which are more scalable and more efficient at configuring and maintaining Apple devices for workers anywhere around the world, said Brent David, the North American IT lead for Apple products at Concentrix. That's what brought David here to the Jamf Nation User Conference, where he talked to eWEEK about what he was learning about the latest Apple management tools from Jamf, which today provide help for his company's Apple machines. The problem with Apple's own Profile Manager, he said, is that "it's not fully scalable in the ways that Jamf is scalable." As his company moves to a global device configuration and deployment standard for all of its Apple laptops around the world, it becomes important for Concentrix to have better tools, he added. Apple's standard management tools are focused on small businesses and on home offices, where there might be a maximum of 20 to 30 devices, said David. "When you get to where you have 500 devices, [Apple Profile Manager] works, but there are better ways to do it." The basic Apple tools are good for small operations, but their shortcomings show up when larger businesses try to use them, he added. Concentrix began working with Jamf's Apple device management tools following the recent acquisition of business services vendor The Minacs Group by Concentrix parent Synnex. About 4,000 Apple devices so far are being used with Jamf 9.9.6, while a global rollout of the upcoming latest Jamf Pro Version 10 edition (pictured) will follow later, David said.       By using Jamf applications, the company will be able to reduce IT labor costs for deploying and configuring Apple devices because it will be done through the air, rather than by physically modifying individual machines one by one, and that's huge for Concentrix, he said. "We're trying to get out of the logistics game" where companies have to image laptops, prepare them, store them in warehouses and then send them out as needed, he said. Instead, users will get their machines, and the needed configurations and settings will be installed automatically the first time they fire them up, using Jamf tools. Other Apple administrators shared similar stories here at the Jamf conference. Elizabeth Langer, director of technology training and development at the Northside Independent School District in San Antonio, Texas, told eWEEK that her district is moving to Jamf tools because as they add more Apple devices for its teachers and students, its configuration problems and costs have been rising. The district has about 106,000 students and about 8,100 teachers and administrators who are supported by the IT team. The district had been using Apple's own device configurators to prepare iPads for distribution to teachers and students, but the process was time-consuming and inefficient, she said. A 50/50 mix of iPads and Chromebooks is planned for the district. "The iPads, we knew, we couldn't continue [to configure] in the way we had been" managing the devices using the Apple configurators, said Langer. "It was eating our lunch," and as the district looks at expanding the distribution of iPads to students, it became clear that the IT team "would be doing nothing more than constantly updating them and adding apps" without using the Apple tools. That's why the district is now preparing to use Jamf to configure and administer its iPads when they start going out to students through 2017, said Langer. "With Jamf, the changes will be over the air without a visit," she said. Meanwhile, in the Cape Henlopen School District in Delaware, Jamf Apple administration tools were brought in two years ago to replace a previous vendor's tools that didn't fill the district's needs, said Rob Jennings, a technology specialist with the district. The district had brought in about 1,300 Apple iPads for each of its high school students and needed more robust tools than were found in the standard Apple offerings. "We tried another brand, but it just didn't do what we wanted," said Jennings. Those shortcomings were resolved through the use of Jamf products, which brought scalability, patch management, profile administration and the ability to turn features on and off for users on the fly, said Michele Ritter, another technology specialist for the district. "All of those were not available or good enough with the Apple tools," and had to be done manually, she said. Overall, the changes for the IT department in how it administers Apple devices today have been massive, according to her co-worker, Jennings. "We're so far past [the old manual processes] that once we found the good stuff, we don't want to remember the past."           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

 Kanye West says he'll 'never' have another album with Jay Z due to 'Tidal/Apple bulls--t' John Lynch Oct. 20, 2016, 10:02 AM 33,432 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kanye West and Jay Z. Michael Buckner/Getty Kanye West, who earlier this year called out Apple and Tidal's streaming rivalry for "f---ing up the music game," has again spoken out against the two services, Pitchfork reports.  At a concert in Seattle on Wednesday night, West reportedly said that the possibility of releasing a sequel to 2011's "Watch the Throne" — his critically acclaimed collaborative album with Jay Z — has in some way been prevented by Jay Z's ownership of Tidal and its streaming conflicts with Apple Music.  "There'll never be a 'Watch the Throne 2,'" West said. "Because of some Tidal/Apple bullsh-t." West also said that his and Jay Z's appearances on Drake's 2016 single "Pop Style" were later removed from Drake's blockbuster album "Views" because of "some Tidal, some political sh-t, some sh-t about percentages on songs." West and Jay Z have both released their own recent music on Tidal. The implication seems to be that West has personally given up on "Watch the Throne 2" because of a falling out with Jay Z over Tidal's role in changing Drake's "Pop Style" for "Views."  In July, West urged Apple CEO Tim Cook to "stop trying to act like [he's] Steve [Jobs]" and instead write a check to Jay Z to acquire Tidal. Apple has since denied rumors that it will purchase Tidal or any other streaming service.  Meanwhile, West confirmed in September that he's working on a new collaborative album with Drake, Apple Music's poster child.  Watch a fan video of West's comments below: ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP— ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 SEE ALSO: Kanye West to Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'Give Jay his check for Tidal now' NOW WATCH: Here's how to survive the zombie apocalypse according to 'The Walking Dead' fans Loading video...

News18.com First published: October 20, 2016, 7:46 PM IST | Updated: October 20, 2016 Apple has announced that will now host a launch event on October 27. (Image: Reuters) After launching the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus recently, Cupertino-based technology giant Apple has announced that will now host a launch event on October 27. This event will be dedicated to MacBooks. Also, expect Apple to announce more features of macOS Sierra. Here is what Apple is expected to announce on October 27. Brand new MacBook Pro Apple is expected to finally launch MacBook Pro laptops this time. After a long wait, the new MacBook Pro might get new Intel processors, Touch ID among other upgrades. However, the major attraction of the upcoming MacBook Pro will be the touch OLED bar which will replace function keys. Also, reports suggest that the new MacBook Pro will have only USB Type-C ports and no USB 3.0 ports. New MacBook Air Apple might kill the cheapest 11-inch MacBook Air model in favour of 12-inch and 13-inch Macs. Also, expect new MacBook Air laptops get USB Type-C but the design will most likely remain the same. The 5K Monitor With the death of Thunderbolt display, Apple might introduce a separate 5K display with 5120x2880 pixels resolution powered by an in-built GPU to help older MacBooks to deliver 5K display output. Others What happened to the unique entirely wireless earphones from Apple, the AirPod? Apple is expected to announce the availability.

With today’s release for Xbox One, it becomes the first app to enable support for AirPlay streaming on Xbox One. Xbox One players can use the feature to stream audio in the background from their iOS devices or Mac while using Xbox, or alternatively mirror the entire display to stream mobile games or video to the big screen. AirPlay mirroring for Xbox One is finally here! AirServer for Xbox transforms your Xbox into a high performance AirPlay receiver. With AirServer running on the Xbox, you can wirelessly mirror your iOS and Mac displays over to the Xbox. Use AirServer to project your mobile screen on to the big screen or simply use it to play music on your home theater system. AirServer has been completely redesigned for the Xbox and promises buttery smooth mirroring performance with super high quality audio playback. For the home-theater enthusiasts, AirServer for Xbox also brings multi-room AirPlay audio support. If you own a set of AirPlay speakers, be sure to try out the multi-room AirPlay audio feature, now available on your Xbox through AirServer. Officially, Apple allows iOS device users to AirPlay photos and videos to a second-gen Apple TV or later, or music to an Apple TV, AirPlay speaker, or AirPort Express. You can also mirror the entire display of your iOS device to an Apple TV. As for support on third-party devices like Xbox, that is left up to workarounds by others like AirServer. You can use AirPlay on Xbox One by downloading the AirServer app for Xbox. It costs $14.99.  blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate. Please view our tips policy or see all contact options.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Amazon condemnation escalates as Apple claims 90% of its branded items sold on site are fake 20 Oct 16 < Back to Blogs Jack Ellis Criticism of the availability of counterfeits on Amazon has been turned up a notch after Apple suggested that as much as 90% of items being sold as genuine Apple products by the e-tailer are fakes. The claim was made in a lawsuit filed by Apple in the Northern District of California this week, in which it accuses a company named Mobile Star LLC of trademark infringement. As reported by the Patently Apple fansite, Apple alleges in the court filing that Mobile Star sold counterfeit power supply units, including adapters and charging cables, through the online platforms operated by Amazon and Groupon. It states that Apple “purchased a number of Apple power adapters and charging and syncing cables… that were directly sold by Amazon.com – not a third party seller – and determined that they were counterfeit”. On reporting this to Amazon, the e-commerce giant identified Mobile Star as the supplier, and agreed to turn over remaining Mobile Star inventory to Apple. The filing makes this further startling claim: “Despite Apple’s efforts, fake Apple products continue to flood Amazon.com. Each month, Apple identifies and reports many thousands of listings for counterfeit and infringing Apple products to Amazon.com under its notice and takedown procedures. Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon’s ‘Fulfillment by Amazon’ program. Apple’s internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit. Apple is concerned that consumers are being deceived into purchasing counterfeit products on Amazon.com and elsewhere in the mistaken belief that they are purchasing genuine Apple products.” That represents a stark appraisal of both the extent of counterfeiting faced by the company and the role that the e-commerce company can play in facilitating the sale of allegedly fake goods. The  fact that the items at the centre of the Mobile Star litigation were fulfilled by Amazon itself, and not by a third party, is highlighted as a concern in the court documents, Apple stating that “consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine”. This is not the first time that a major brand owner has called out Amazon on its efficacy at rooting out counterfeits. Back in July, Birkenstock announced that it would be halting its supplies to the Amazon marketplace, as well as cancelling authorisation of third-part resellers. In a letter written at the time, David Kahan, CEO of the footwear company’s US operations, said that “policing this [counterfeiting] activity internally and in partnership with Amazon.com has proven impossible,” adding that Amazon had been seemingly unwilling to pursue “multiple proposals and ‘out-of-the-box’ ideas” that he and his team had presented to the e-commerce firm on how to combat the issue. Kahan acknowledged that Birkenstock’s chosen course of action would not necessarily lead to an immediate removal of counterfeits from Amazon, but would at least guarantee any products sold via the website and claiming to be Birkenstocks are not sanctioned by the company. “By taking this course of action, we are, in effect, leaving the Amazon marketplace to counterfeiters, fake suppliers and unauthorised sellers with whom we have no relationships,” he wrote. Amazon hasn’t commented on the Apple suit, but following Birkenstock’s letter released a statement noting that it “does not allow the sale of inauthentic items on its marketplace and occurrences of inauthentic products are rare”, adding that “every customer who orders on Amazon is covered by our A-Z guarantee and if they do receive inauthentic goods, we will refund or replace that item”. Apple has not yet taken the more drastic approach adopted by Birkenstock but this latest complaint mounts more PR pressure on Amazon, which respondents rated as the fourth most challenging online marketplace from an enforcement perspective in this year’s World Trademark Review benchmarking survey. Online marketplaces run by Alibaba took top and third spots; and recently, a number of trademark stakeholders have called on the Office of the US Trade Representative to reinstate the Chinese company to its Notorious Markets list. The challenge of policing online e-tailers clearly remains a time and resource drain for many counsel. For the cover story of the current issue of World Trademark Review, we asked some of the world’s biggest brand owners what gold-standard protection mechanisms they would like to see implemented by online marketplaces. We are some way off seeing the adoption of the top ten wish-list. In the meantime, Apple's court filing is a timely reminder of the scale of the problem.

Wang October 20, 2016 The would-be kings. (Reuters/Mario Anzuoni) Share Written by Amy X. Wang October 20, 2016 Apple Music’s not interested in buying Tidal anymore, which seems to have given Kanye West all the more reason to hate on it. The rapper—a part owner in Tidal, as well as a longtime friend of fellow rapper Jay Z, who owns the music streaming service—pushed for the tech giant to acquire Tidal earlier this summer. That never ended up happening, despite initial rumors that it would. Now West is saying Apple is the reason he and Jay Z haven’t released any new music collaborations of late. “Let me tell you something—there will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why?” West called out to his audience during a concert last night in Seattle, and referring to the well-received joint album that the two rappers put out in 2011. “Because of Hov, because of some Tidal-Apple bullshit.” Vague. But West alleges that behind-the-scenes drama between the two streaming services is also what prevented him and Jay Z from appearing on Drake’s album Views earlier this year: apparently, both rappers originally had guest verses on Drake’s song “Pop Style,” but were taken out due to “some political shit” between Tidal and Apple. (Drake’s album came out as an Apple Music exclusive, and he’s also been tight with Apple on other projects.) A fan recorded West’s entire rant in the video below. ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP — ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 West first railed against Apple on Twitter a few months ago, insisting that Tidal deserved to be bought out by one of its bigger peers. Such a move would’ve boosted Apple Music’s star power and subscriber base, but it would have more importantly bailed Tidal out of some messy financial entanglements. “Apple, give Jay his check for Tidal now,” the rapper complained. He added: This Tidal Apple beef is fucking up the music game. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) July 30, 2016 I need Tim Cook Jay Z Dez Jimmy Larry me and Drake Scooter on the phone or in a room this week!!! — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) July 30, 2016 Spotify was almost spared from Ye’s ire.

A letter addressed to the FTC has called on the committee to investigate concerns over anti-competitive activity in the app marketplace.  The letter points to two trends that have emerged in the app ecosystem: The global app marketplace is controlled by the Google/Apple duopoly. The iOS App Store and the Google Play store are by far the largest and most important channels through which app publishers bring their offerings to market. They've established a duopoly with a combined inventory of more than 4 million apps. Furthermore, the stores have a combined market share of about 97% globally. Most publishers will need to contend with the ins and outs of both, making it incredibly difficult for smaller vendors to have any impact. The app ecosystem is weighted toward bigger players. The top performing apps are also the mainstays of the Top App Categories. This gives them better visibility within the App Store, which in turn, makes it more likely that users will download them. In the US, for example, 94% of all iOS App Store revenue went to the top 1% of publishers, according to Sensor Tower. This revenue can be used to pay for advertising, which also helps raise awareness of the app. These two trends could lead to a number of negative implications for consumers and developers, according to the committee. These include stifling innovation, decreasing the number of viable channels for distribution, and diminishing the number of cost-effective choices for consumers. The conflict brings attention to the immense power app vendors wield over publishers. For example, Spotify accused Apple of blocking its app update for iPhones in order to boost Apple Music earlier this year. Apple responded by noting that the App Store blocked the update due to Spotify’s attempt to circumvent the 30% revenue cut that developers fork over to the tech giant. This issue has yet to be resolved, but Spotify's claim puts a spotlight on the control Apple has over publishers' ability to conduct business.   Still, both Apple and Google are working hard to appear more developer friendly. For instance, both companies recently announced changes to how they divvy up subscription revenue, increasing the cut that publishers receive to 85% of subscription fees, up from 70%.  Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Copyright Ethan Miller, Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp.’s (IW 500/20) fight to overturn a record 1.06 billion euro (US$1.16 billion) European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving U.S. tech giants from Google to Apple Inc. Intel’s appeal should be totally reviewed by a lower court, which was wrong to rule against the company’s system of rebates, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The European Commission in Brussels declined to comment. Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World Who is Killing American Manufacturing? The Automotive Industry: Economic Impact And Location Issues A victory for Intel would be rare setback for EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of a probe that culminated in the iPhone maker’s 13 billion-euro tax bill. The Intel ruling may also have affect the EU’s handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines. Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4% of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10% of yearly sales regulators can impose. While urging a review of the case, Wahl didn’t criticize the size of the fine, saying Intel failed to prove the amount was disproportionate. The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95% of chips for PCs from Intel. Intel raises restructuring charge to $2.3B, beats with Q3 sales of $15.8B, EPS $0.80 https://t.co/CTp90JKLFj — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) October 19, 2016 The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5%, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm Eyes Intel Case Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn’t intervene in the EU court hearings.

Last night (Oct. 19, 2016), West went off on his longtime friend Jay Z and spilled some insanely hot tea in the process. The rant began when West was set to perform his verse on the original version of Drake’s “Pop Style,” but before the song could begin, he decided to let fans know why the verse never made it to the final version. “Let me tell yall something. There will never be a Watch the Throne 2,” he declared. “That’s the reason I wasn’t on this song, I wasn’t on the song cause of Hov. Cause of some TIDAL/Apple bullshit. And that shit be getting me tight every time I perform this mother fucker.” ye talking about Watch The Throne 2 & Apple/Tidal problems @TeamKanyeDaily #SAINTPABLO pic.twitter.com/kXZNZuvTfP — ike®☄ (@IkerLopez27) October 20, 2016 West went on to explain that it wasn’t just a TIDAL/Apple beef that prevented the song from making it on the album, Jay Z was also concerned about remaining respectful to Meek Mill, who had a very public feud with Drake. “I start freestyling to it. Jay thought of a couple of lines. I said, ‘Just go ahead, throw that on there. He’ll be so surprised, he probably won’t expect you to be on there.'” he explained. “We sent it back to him and he was like, ‘Oh shit, The Throne is on this shit.’ Then Jay thought about it, and out of respect to Meek Mill, he didn’t want to be on the track. I said, ‘We’ve got to squash this shit and let people have this song.’ But then it went into some political shit, some shit about percentages on songs.” Kanye West Goes Incognito Exiting His Big Apple Apartment 7 Photos » But West didn’t stop there. It seems as though Jay Z’s music decisions aren’t the only thing rubbing the Life of Pablo rapper the wrong way. West’s rant continued with him slamming Jay Z, someone he’s always considered as a brother, for never checking up on him after Kim Kardashian’s armed robbery. “Don’t call me, after the robbery, and say ‘how you feelin?’ You wanna know how I’m feelin?

Back to site Globalization Taxes Editorial November 7, 2016, Issue Bad Apples What will it take to end favorable tax treatment for multinationals? By Arthur Goldhammer October 20, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the new iPhone 7 during an event to announce new products Wednesday, September 7, 2016, in San Francisco. (AP Photo / Marcio Jose Sanchez) Taxes may be unavoidable for the average citizen of the world’s advanced industrial nations, but the same cannot be said for corporations with global reach. According to Gabriel Zucman, a Berkeley economist and author of The Hidden Wealth of Nations, “About 55 percent of all the foreign profits of US multinationals are artificially booked to countries that tax capital at zero or close to zero.” Recently, the European Commission decided to take a stand against such corporate tax avoidance, fining Apple €13 billion ($14.5 billion) for an arrangement with Ireland that led to its overseas earnings being taxed at rates as low as 0.005 percent. Apple CEO Tim Cook has denounced the EC ruling as “total political crap.” His position reflects the belief that corporate “treaty shopping” for the lowest tax rate has nothing to do with politics, whereas any attempt by legally constituted authorities to apportion the burden of taxation fairly amounts to unwarranted political interference with the market.1 Ad Policy Thomas Piketty, an economist at the Paris School of Economics and author of the global best seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century (which I translated into English), disagrees. I asked Piketty if he thought the EC ruling might be a first step toward the “global tax on capital” that he calls for in his book. “I am not sure whether it is the beginning of something, or the beginning of nothing at all (judges could still cancel everything),” he replied via e-mail.2 For Piketty, the crucial political decision has yet to be taken: “It will happen when a subset of European countries decides to create a common corporate tax…or at least a common minimal corporate tax rate for very large companies.” As for the EC ruling, it “is simply trying to get Ireland to apply its statutory 12.5 percent tax rate to Apple, without questioning the fact that this statutory rate is far too low. Ideally, the largest European countries and the United States should set a minimal tax rate of at least 25 or 30 percent on the profits of large European and US (and other) multinationals. I am sure this will come at some point, but I do not know when.”3 The Obama administration’s strong support for Apple in its dispute with the European Union has disappointed European reformers like Piketty. In a recent blog post for Le Monde, he expressed the hope that if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election, leadership on global corporate-tax reform might come from the United States. Piketty notes that the Sanders insurgency (which he supported) put pressure on Clinton to demonstrate that she is not a tool of Wall Street, as Sanders alleged. One way to demonstrate her independence would be to “announce strong measures on the taxation of multinationals and the largest fortunes.” Piketty reiterated his point that the best solution would involve the imposition of a substantial “minimum tax rate—at least 25 to 30 percent—on the profits of all European and American multinationals.” If the United States adopted such a tough stance, he argued, it would force the EU nations to follow suit.4 Zucman, who collaborated with Piketty on “Capital Is Back,” an influential paper about the growing wealth inequality, agrees. In response to a query about the Apple case, he suggested a measure that would not require international cooperation: “The US Treasury should do the same as the European Commission: try to stop multinationals dodging taxes, and have them pay what they owe. The quickest way to do this would be to levy a tax on the stock of unrepatriated offshore profits of US companies: a 5 percent annual tax on this $3 trillion stock would generate $150 billion in tax revenue a year, and would encourage companies to repatriate their profits to the United States, where they would pay the US corporate income tax.”5 Most Popular 1 Welcome to the Fight 2 The GOP’s Attack on Voting Rights Was the Most Under-Covered Story of 2016 3 Inequality Among Women Is Crucial to Understanding Hillary’s Loss 4 Keith Ellison Is the Leader the DNC Needs 5 Donald Trump Won on White-Male Resentment—but Don't Confuse That With the Working Class The EC’s ruling is not without its paradoxes. It was issued not out of a desire to rein in growing wealth inequality or to curb the ability of multinational corporations to play one country against another, but rather in the name of “free and undistorted competition”—a phrase that former French president Nicolas Sarkozy had stricken from the EU treaties because it was too redolent of “Anglo-Saxon neoliberalism” for French tastes. But EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager rejected the Apple tax break precisely on the grounds that it distorted competition by granting the US firm unlawful state aid under EU rules. Vestager is confident that her decision will survive any challenge in the courts.6 The decision was issued under the aegis of a European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker, who as prime minister of Luxembourg presided over a regime of favorable tax treatment for multinationals. In hindsight—and in response to a censure motion filed shortly after he assumed the commission’s presidency—Juncker said in 2014 that he wished his government had scrutinized these tax deals more closely, but that at the time his desire was to diversify Luxembourg’s economy, which he believed depended too heavily on the country’s “monolithic” banking industry. To counter this, he sought to attract high-tech firms by offering generous tax incentives, just as Ireland did. In his new role as head of the EC, however, Juncker has changed his tune. His newfound ethical zeal is no doubt abetted by the fact that Apple is a US corporation; a tough stance against allegedly predatory American firms can be expected to play well at home.7 LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Despite these recent signs of a heightened EU scrutiny of corporate tax-avoidance strategies, the path ahead remains uncertain. Apple is far from the only US tech company to engage in a shell game with its vast profits. As numerous investigators have shown, from the journalist Jesse Drucker to those working for the International Monetary Fund, Google has been no less resourceful than Apple in exploiting every legal means to maximize shareholder profits, while minimizing its obligations to the countries from which it reaps its earnings. Its strategy has been dubbed the “Double Irish Dutch Sandwich.” Zucman explains that, before going public in 2004, Google US transferred part of its “intangible capital” (search and advertising technologies) to Google Holdings, a subsidiary headquartered in Ireland but registered for Irish tax purposes in Bermuda. Google Holdings then created another Irish subsidiary, Ireland Limited, which in turn pays royalties to a Dutch shell company named Google BV. To make a long story short, Google has learned to exploit the terms of international tax agreements so thoroughly that in recent years, “its effective tax rate on foreign profits has ranged from 2 to 8 percent,” according to Zucman’s 2014 paper “Taxing Across Borders,” published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives.8 All of this is perfectly legal, but it is also highly inefficient: Significant corporate resources are devoted to the exploitation of tax loopholes rather than productive investment. Firms also have incentives to locate their factories, headquarters, and workforce in places where taxes are low, at the expense of countries whose public investments in research and development help to create the very technologies on which their profits depend. The EU’s move against Apple may be a first step toward a more rational world. Or then again, as Piketty warns, it may lead nowhere at all.9 2 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Arthur Goldhammer Arthur Goldhammer is a writer, translator, and affiliate of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University.

By Christian Zibreg, Oct 20, 2016 Tweet 6 Comments Apple is holding a media event on October 27 to unveil new Macs. Everyone is expecting the company to announce a next-generation MacBook Pro with a rumored OLED strip that would replace the physical function keys at the top of the keyboard with programmable shortcuts which would change from one app to another. But what could Apple call that rumored OLED touch bar? According to trademark agent Brian Conroy who was able to uncover a trademark application that a shell company quite likely filed for on behalf for Apple, the feature could be marketed as “Magic Toolbar.” The company that filed a trademark application is called Presto Apps America LLC, incorporated in Delaware on January 22, 2016. Just two weeks after Presto Apps America was incorporated, it filed the “Magic Toolbar” trademark. We know Apple keeps its trademark filings secret either by filing them overseas or at home, through shell companies. Given that this particular trademark application costs around $17,500 and knowing Apple already owns trademarks for “Magic Trackpad”, ”Magic Mouse” and “Magic Keyboard”, it is highly unlikely that “Magic Toolbar” was protected by any other company. Conroy writes: They would almost certainly be able to stop any other company applying for the trademark ‘Magic Toolbar’, on the basis it’s similar to their existing trademarks and likely to cause confusion.  So, another company would have to be 100% certified insane to spend €16,000 in outlay for a trademark application that someone with the clout of Apple was almost certain to be able to object to and defeat. And that’s the main reason that I’m putting my neck on the line and saying that ‘Presto Apps America LLC’ is actually Apple. Besides, the lawyers that applied for the “Magic Toolbar” application are the same people behind Apple’s “AirPod” trademark. I think “Magic Toolbar” would be the perfect marketing moniker for the rumored OLED strip on the next MacBook Pro. Apple’s keyboards, mice and trackpads have “Magic” in their name and it would make sense to call the upcoming feature “Magic Toolbar”. Thoughts?

That’s the take-away from Google’s recent spate of hardware products, easily seen with its new Pixel, available for sale on Thursday. It’s the first phone the company has designed from the ground up, and the search-engine giant has taken a page from Apple’s book. The Pixel is really good as an Android smartphone, and great as a showcase for Google’s software, and what can happen when the company tries to optimize both to work together. And along with other products the company announced a few weeks back, such as Google Home — a smart speaker that can answer queries and play music — and Google Wifi — a new modular router system — Google wants you to buy into its ecosystem, and stay for a while. Apple’s strategy has always been that walled garden, the closed-off operating system and series of products that work well together. Google, meanwhile, focused on software, and was the much more open competitor. That approach worked well for the company; Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, and Google works with many partners, offering a huge variety of products. The problem is that the open approach has led to fragmentation. While the latest versions of Android are slick operating systems, how the software upgrades depends on your device, and is often left up to the carriers. With the Pixel — similar to Google’s Nexus line — users are promised that they will get software upgrades when Google provides them. The phone itself is a showcase device designed to take on the premium players out there, the iPhone in particular. A perfect example of that approach is an included adapter that makes it quick and easy to switch over from an iPhone; that works well, but the fact that the adaptor is included in every box shows that Google truly hopes people will make the move. The Pixel is also in the same price range as the iPhone, with the 32GB version starting at $899 and the XL 32GB starting at $1,049. (In Canada, Apple’s 32 GB iPhone 7 starts at $899, while the iPhone 7 Plus 32GB is $1,049. At this point, though, most people have made their decisions between Apple and Android, and their preference is likely about more than just the phone. It’s about the other stuff they bought to work nicely with that phone. It’s the ecosystem. If you care about apps, Apple still wins, while Google hopes that its artificial intelligence expertise — and using the all the data it has gathered about you to help its personal Assistant — will be the differentiator that keeps you there. Google CEO Sundar Pichai pitched this concept as the beginning of creating a “personal Google” for each person. At this point, Assistant feels slightly smarter than Apple’s Siri, and there were a couple of cool moments with Google’s helper: it can quickly answer queries from the web, recognize and offer to automatically schedule events, and give a handy daily briefing. Some services like OpenTable work with Assistant, but others like Uber don’t yet. There are times when it can get frustrating, but it’s still early days. Google’s plan has been about using what it learns about you, and acting on it. That used to mean serving up ads based on your search queries. Now, by getting serious about hardware, including the new devices like the smart speaker, they can be everywhere that you are. It’s a step toward the idea of pervasive computing, where no matter the device, the benefits of technology are available all around us. For Google, that’s a plan that starts with the Pixel. Pixel XL Review Design decisions: It looks a bit like an iPhone, although it has straight edges on the side, making it easier to grip than Apple’s curved design. There are no buttons on the front, and there’s a fingerprint scanner on the back, copying something that LG phones have been had. It feels like a premium phone but, other than a back panel, nothing stands out. Samsung still wins on design. The basics: The three most important things in a phone are the screen, the camera and the battery. All three are very good here. The long-lasting battery got me through two business days, and the quick-charging works very well. It has a gorgeous 5.5-inch screen. The camera is very good, with great video stabilization, although to me the iPhone 7 Plus is slightly better. Google’s services: I like Google Assistant and am still testing its capabilities. There are great automated moments, and it is very good at search and web queries. I also like Google’s Duo, the FaceTime competitor that also works across Android and iOS. And if you use Google Photos, the cloud-based service backs up your pictures, you can think about getting the smaller 32 GB version. The switch-over: iPhone users can quickly switch over email accounts, text message and photos simply by plugging in an adapter to the Pixel. It was surprised at how well it worked. Now if there was a way for the apps you bought on one platform to cross the divide. A few knocks: There are really only two issues with this phone. First, it is lacking in water resistance, which has become fairly standard on premium devices. And it is expensive. But it is still an excellent phone that deserves a spot at the table near its premium phones competitors.

 Apple's new keyboard could be named the 'Magic Toolbar' Kif Leswing Oct. 20, 2016, 9:10 AM 5,537 facebook linkedin twitter email print Martin Hajek Apple will release new MacBooks next week, and all signs point to them having a new kind of keyboard with an integrated touchscreen replacing the function keys. Now we have a good clue what it could be called: "Magic Toolbar." Trademark sleuth and intellectual property lawyer Brian Conroy of Remnick Solicitors found a trademark registration in the Benelux Union for just that term relating to computers and computing devices.  He previously dug up several terms that Apple revealed when it launched the iPhone 7. There's one catch: Conroy wasn't able to find a piece of paper with the name "Apple" on it. Apparently, a Delaware company called "Presto Apps America" formed this past January filed the trademark application.  But there are several signs that point to Apple: The application was duplicated in Canada, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and the lawyers in those countries were the same lawyers that registered "AirPods," which is certainly an Apple trademark. Apple uses the "Magic" moniker for most of its mice and keyboards, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Apple has used shell companies to register trademarks in the past, including Entertainment in Flight for AirPods and IP Application Development LLC for the term "iPad." For more details on Conroy's hunt, visit his blog.  Apple will reveal the new MacBook Pro on October 27 — which is the day after Apple would have to file another global application for other interesting Apple-related trademarks, including "Touch Bar" and "Apple Smart Button." Business Insider will be covering Apple's announcement live, which is when we'll see for sure if Apple's wild new touchscreen keyboard will in fact have a feature called "Magic Toolbar."  SEE ALSO: Apple came up with 'AirPods' in 2015 — here's how it kept it under wraps NOW WATCH: How to choose the best cut of steak — according to Anthony Bourdain Loading video...

"Almost nine out of 10 Apple-branded products the iPhone maker bought on Amazon were fakes," according to the trademark infringement case reported by Patently Apple on Thursday. Apple seeks up to $150,000 per copyright violation and $2 million per trademark infringement, believing that these counterfeit products could lead to fires and are, therefore, a risk to the public. "Consumers, relying on Amazon.com`s reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine. Consumers are likewise unaware that the counterfeit Apple products that Amazon.com sourced from Mobile Star have not been safety certified or properly constructed... and pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock," the lawsuit read. The suit targets 5 Watt USB power adapters and Lightning-to-USB cables sold by Mobile Star, according to court documents from the US District Court for the Northern District of California, highlighted by Patently Apple. "Apple purchased the power products from Amazon.com and determined that they were counterfeit. Apple was informed by Amazon.com, and upon that basis believes that Mobile Star was the source of those particular counterfeit power products purchased by Apple," the lawsuit further read. Reacting to this, Amazon told AppleInsider in a statement: "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively."   IANS First Published: Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 18:46 More from zeenews   India Attack on Hindus: Bangladesh announces bounty for nabbing attackers Foreign media hails PM Modi's bold currency move, compares him with Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew Demonetisation: Hospitals reaching out to patients More from India World Censorship: Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps 11 Arab nations accuse Iran of sponsoring 'terrorism' EU backs defence plan after Donald Trump win fuelled fears More from World Sports Sachin Tendulkar welcomes DRS with open arms, says it's positive step for India WATCH: Virat Kohli drops off lady love Anushka Sharma at Rajkot airport Epic mess-up: Bangladesh newspaper uses Kevin Pietersen​'s photo in Alviro’s match-fixing story More from Sports Entertainment Box Office: Opening weekend collections of Farhan Akhtar's 'Rock On 2' are finally here Brad Pitt back in China after 20 years for his movie 'Allied' Anu Malik hails PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move More from Entertaiment Health Protein drives inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients Overweight kids in Delhi-NCR are more prone to diabetes: ASSOCHAM study Keep a check on diabetes to avoid visual impairments More from Health Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Most Read Most Viewed Note ban: PM Modi pledges fifty days; is India ready to cooperate?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple An iPhone feature people have been clamoring for was just found hiding in iOS 10 Zach Epstein BGR NewsOctober 20, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Buried deep within the code in iOS 10, there's a special dark mode just waiting to be activated. It was discovered shortly after the first iOS 10 developer beta was released back in June, and it was believed that Apple might finally enable the new dark mode feature ahead of iOS 10's public release last month. We all know that didn't happen, and it doesn't look like dark mode will be available in Apple's iOS 10.1 update either, since we're already on iOS 10.1 beta 5. Dark mode is a feature that has been wished for over and over again by iPhone users, but it's not the only oft-requested iPhone feature that's currently hiding inside iOS 10. MUST SEE: These 5 insanely thin iPhone 7 cases are perfect for people who hate iPhone cases Apple's gigantic iPhone 7 Plus is now officially the iPhone. In our recent follow-up review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus one month after launch, we discussed how the Plus version of this year's iPhone is the iPhone experience that Apple truly wants to put in users' hands. Meanwhile, the smaller iPhone 7 is basically now an "iPhone Lite," offering a down-sized, stripped version of the iPhone experience. But the iPhone 7 Plus has some downsides as well. Chief among them, perhaps, is the fact that Apple recycles the same exact design from the 4.7-inch iPhone on the larger 5.5-inch model. This design is great for a smaller phone, but when it scales to the Plus it's far more unwieldy than rival smartphones with the same display size. It's top-heavy, it's uncomfortable, and it's very difficult for many (most?) people to use with one hand. Apple's Plus-sized iPhone is expected to be much more compact next year when Apple releases the completely redesigned iPhone 8. In the meantime, many users have gone in search of third-party keyboards that make one-handed typing easier on the iPhone 7 Plus and earlier Plus models. Microsoft has a nice free option called Word Flow, but third-party keyboard support is still pretty terrible in iOS. People want a first-party keyboard that makes one-handed typing easier, but there has been no indication that they're going to get one... until now. iOS developer Steve Troughton Smith discovered a nifty one-handed typing mode buried within the code in iOS 10, though he says that the feature has actually been there since iOS 8 and maybe even in earlier versions. When enabled, a swipe inward from the outside edge of the keyboard activates a one-handed mode that shifts the keys a bit to one side of the keyboard. He posted a video on Twitter showing the keyboard in action: https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/788869300283146240 The bad news is that, like dark mode, there's no indication that Apple will actually enable this feature anytime soon. In the meantime, slap a case on your iPhone and try not to drop it.

It allows you to perform a variety of different tasks depending on what program you're running.

In India, Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked fans for the good response to the iPhone 7 series launch. But shoppers have been disappointed with shortage of supply of the iPhone 7 Plus, which is the showstopper of this year's flagship smartphones. Apple iPhone 7 Plus is still running out of stock on Amazon and Snapdeal, while Flipkart has a "coming soon" label on both the iPhone models.

By Tyler Lee on 10/20/2016 05:22 PST Apple’s presence at trade shows has been pretty much non-existent for the longest time ever. Instead the company has chosen to host their own events whenever they want to announce a new product, something that has been working out for them pretty well. However could that change in 2017? It has been recently discovered that Apple was listed as an exhibitor at MWC 2017, which for those unfamiliar is a trade show that is centered around mobile devices. Apple’s listing is said to be in the App Planet, which has been described as “a unique area focusing on the latest technology from the fast-moving apps industry.” What this means is that Apple’s presence will most likely have to do with apps rather than hardware. However it should be noted that shortly after the company’s listing came to light, they were quickly removed from the MWC website. We’re not sure what this means as it could indicate that Apple’s presence was an error, or if maybe the Cupertino company wanted a bit more discretion, but we guess we’ll have to wait for an official statement from either the organizers or Apple themselves if we want to be extra certain. The company had previously stated that the reason they stopped appearing at trade shows such as Macworld was because they were reaching more customers through its website and their retail stores, thus the need to be present at trade shows was no longer needed.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? March 12, 2015 Opinion: Are we bidding farewell to MagSafe, and does it matter? Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro MacBook MacBook Air Opinion AAPL Company Comments (102) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When Apple unveiled the new 12-inch MacBook with just a single port (plus a headphone socket), it was doing not just one radical thing, but two. Reducing a machine to just one port was the first; dropping MagSafe was the second. MagSafe has been one of the key features of MacBooks since it was first introduced by Apple in 2006. It is still highlighted on Apple’s website as one of the key design features of both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. MacBook Air offers innovations you won’t find anywhere else — like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord. The magnetic power cord attaches securely and detaches cleanly. It’s one of the features that even the most die-hard opponents of Macs tend to grudgingly admit is a good idea. And yet that (very) shiny new MacBook aimed at the largest slice of the MacBook Air market doesn’t have it. Is this a one-off move for a single model, or will we see USB C power replacing MagSafe across the entire MacBook range … ?  I argued before that there’s no risk of Apple heading down the single-port route in the MacBook Pro–at least, not for some years yet. We’re going to have multiple ports, the question is: which ones? Getting at least one USB C port on the next-generation MacBook Pro is a no-brainer. It’s the latest, greatest standard. It’s incredibly flexible. And Apple has already backed the standard by putting it in the new MacBook. The next question, then, is how many? The most radical approach would be for Apple to drop Thunderbolt, USB 3 and HDMI and simply replace them all with two or three USB C ports. Update: Thunderbolt can now be integrated with the USB-C port. Less radical would be to retain one or more legacy ports while introducing a couple of USB C ports. Either way, it’s a certainly there will be at least one or two of them. Question three and perhaps most important: will one of them be used for power, replacing MagSafe? I think so, yes. In taking that step with the 12-inch MacBook, Apple has demonstrated a willingness to move on from MagSafe. The company has never been afraid to leave legacy technology behind: it was one of the first companies to drop optical drives, Steve Jobs famously refused to allow Flash on iPads (a technology the rest of the world is starting to drop only now) and it was one of the first to switch from spinning metal disks to SSD. Dropping MagSafe is a bigger deal, I know. It’s been a headline feature of MacBooks for almost a decade, and it’s a much-loved one. But Apple isn’t afraid to leave behind its own technology as well as technology borrowed from others. FireWire was developed by Apple, and was enormously popular with AV professionals, many of whom still use it today. But Apple decided that Thunderbolt was the new FireWire, and dropped it. In the new MacBook, Apple has decided that USB C is not just the new Thunderbolt (a standard that never took off in quite the way that either Apple or Intel had hoped), it’s also the new MagSafe. I think the decision is made: MagSafe is dead, long live USB C. I have to admit, that thought makes me sad. I’m a huge fan of MagSafe. As I wrote before: I love MagSafe. Not just because it has saved me from an expensive MacBook nose-dive on more than one occasion, but also because it’s so damn easy to use—none of the fiddling around with the power lead you get with lesser laptops. Just hold the connector somewhere near the right spot and it snaps into place. MacWorld did some very impressive number-crunching on just how big a deal MagSafe is compared to USB C. It’s the kind of in-depth look at the issue that really appeals to the geek in me, and I thoroughly recommend it if the physics of laptop disasters is your kind of thing. I’d hoped that Apple might introduce a MagSafe adapter for the USB C connector in the power supply, perhaps at the power brick end, but nope. MagSafe is gone. But MacWorld‘s physics calculations aside, how big a deal would the loss of MagSafe be in the real world? Our own Seth Weintraub made a specific point about the new MacBook: [tweet https://twitter.com/llsethj/status/575311204727582721] And perhaps the MacBook Air is not long for this world, set to be replaced by the new MacBook once Apple can produce a model at a price that caters for entry-level buyers. But a MacBook Pro without MagSafe could potentially get expensive if a single incident of tripping over a power cable sees it come crashing to the floor. There is, though, a counterargument to this: battery-life. Back in the days when a MacBook was good for 2-3 hours’ real-world battery-life, they spent a lot of their time plugged in while we were using them. These days, not so much. With 8-12 hours’ claimed life, and 5-6 hours of real-life use, I don’t even bother carrying my power brick when I’m out & about with my MacBook Air, and the same would be true if I were using the latest MacBook Pro instead of my 17-incher. At home, the pattern seen with many users is to leave it plugged in out of the way (where the power lead can be safely routed so no-one trips over it), then unplug it in order to use it. So really, the main time today’s MacBooks are actually being used while they are connected to power is while sat at our desk. And that’s another situation where we can route the power lead safely away from becoming a trip hazard. In which case, perhaps MagSafe is yesterday’s solution to yesterday’s problem? And dropping it from future MacBooks is not, despite the physics, that big a deal? As ever, take our poll and let us know your views in the comments.

Kevin Miller - 2 years ago Reply I think you nailed it at the very end there. Apple’s intended primary use for the MacBook is completely unplugged, just like with the iPad or iPhone. Plug it in when you need to charge it back up, then go wireless again. If it were otherwise we’d be asking why iOS devices don’t use MagSafe. LikeLiked by 4 people andreasgrill - 2 years ago Reply This is probably true for the new Macbook, but I can’t see this the case of the MacBook Pros. You usually plug them in when you want to do some cpu intense work. The removal of the MagSafe would be a step backward here.

LikeLike Rudy (@RudyChidiac) - 2 years ago Reply I believe magsafe was dropped from the new macbook because of limitation, the limitation of the device’s thinness and weight, the macbook is too light to even break the magsafe magnet. I don’t think the magsafe is going to be discontinued in the macbook pro anytime soon. LikeLiked by 2 people gshenaut - 2 years ago Reply Yes, I had the same thought. If my iPad had a MagSafe connector plugged into it and I tripped over the cable, the iPad would end up on the floor and the cable would probably still be plugged in. As MacBook* get lighter and lighter, the value of MagSafe diminishes considerably. LikeLiked by 1 person Jurgis Ŝalna - 2 years ago Reply That does not make any sense.

In fact, for those who are concerned about the new Macbook being too thin to have much effect, I think Apple can consider using a weaker magnet to achieve the same effect. Perhaps, modifying USB-C connector to have the magnet capability would make it much more attractive. As I’ve fallen deeper in love with my 2014 Macbook Air each day, I think I will most likely get a new Macbook Air for its replacement when the time comes. And if it’s the only laptop that still has a magsafe connector, it’ll definitely be the reason I’d choose that over the new Macbook. On a side note, the macbook air right now is perfect for what it does. I could care less about it getting thinner or that it has butterfly switches. All it really needs is a retina display and a more compelling battery to support that 12 hour battery life on the retina display and you’ve got me lining up for the next Air. LikeLike Daniel Farmer - 3 months ago Reply Just today I tripped over the power cable to my Macbook and it safely detached from where it was perched. Might have ended up on the floor if not for MagSafe. The two technologies are apples and oranges in my eyes. Afaik USB-3 is designed to deliver data and power, MagSafe is a technology that is used to deliver power while also providing an intelligent solution for connection ports wearing out. Plugging something in and out wears it out. Apple has shown by way of its IPad, IPhone connectors that it is not immune to this…. though I have not personally seen USB3 in action or measured its durability and would be interested in the reports. I’ve said goodbye to a few laptops ( and one iPod ) because of worn out a/c power connectors. Its one of the reasons I would put so much cash into a device, I don’t want that device to have weak points. I’ll be looking for the current lineup of Macbook Pro and I will never buy a new one if it doesn’t have Magsafe. LikeLike gshenaut - 3 months ago Reply It seems to me that a good solution to this problem has to do with the power cable, not the power connector. If the device is being charged through a USB-C connector, then that connector is probably not going to be used for anything else. So, there’s no reason I can see why USB-C cable that integrates a magsafe-style safety release such as the Griffin BreakSafe wouldn’t retain the safety attributes of the current magsafe connector, while also allowing the same connector to be used for other purposes when the device is not plugged into power. Hopefully, Apple will move in this direction. In a sense, putting the safety release in the cable rather than the connector is a better idea anyway. LikeLike Cold Spring - 2 weeks ago Reply No value in magsafe. I use macbook and thinkpad everyday. Magsafe is just pure annoyance, falling off at slightest disturbance. It’s sheer pain to keep putting it back on the macbook, where as thinkpad with old fashioned round plug is just insert and forget. In the 20+ years I have used laptop for work, I have never tripped over a power cord that made laptop go crashing to the floor, and it’s good riddance to the magsafe, a useless feature!

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeFeaturedAAPL Stock: Famed Analyst Predicts Half of Note7 Owners Will Flock to New Apple iPhone AAPL Stock: Famed Analyst Predicts Half of Note7 Owners Will Flock to New Apple iPhone Due to the unfortunate Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall, it looks like tech giant Apple will be the primary beneficiary of this mishap. October 20, 2016 WSP South Korean electronics giant Samsung had to recall their Galaxy Note 7 units which are reportedly prone to catching fire. With more and more customers complaining about the Note 7, the company cancelled the production of its flagship mobile device entirely. But while Samsung remains hopeful that customers will swarm over their other units – especially the Galaxy S7 – it looks like this huge blunder’s biggest benefactor are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Chinese brand competitor Huawei. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kou, who has been predicting Cupertino’s hardware details with a high degree of accuracy for years, the approximate 5-7 million cancelled Note 7 orders will likely turn to iPhone 7 Plus sales. Additionally, Kou reported that customers will probably lean towards Apple’s iOS and camera features. This is certainly good news to Apple and definitely not a good one to close rival Samsung. The iPhone units have become significantly more attractive and this shift will most likely convert to sales. This recent report also exposed user’s loyalty towards a brand. It showed that customers display little loyalty to a particular brand and are easily swayed to jump to iOS. But this also remains subjective because some Note 7 users refused to return their units simply because of its exclusive features like the iris biometrics scanner. However, it is still undeniable that Apple has the ball on their court with this one. They have the upper hand to seize the market given the fact that there are approximately 12 million Note 7 orders and when you factor in cancellations, Apple will most likely bag 50% of the customers while the remaining will be shared by other Android phone makers like Huawei. Reports have shown that Apple shares have steadily increased in the last month, printing a 3.2% upside. It’s worth noting that some of that increase is due to the unfortunate setback of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Kou also stated that, given a few months, Samsung will be able to recover from the fiasco but he warned that another round of faults might destroy the trusted brand. Apple is set to announce its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings after the market close on Tuesday, October 25. The Street expects the iPhone maker to report EPS of $1.65 and revenue of $46.9 billion. That would be $0.23 higher the $1.42 per share posted last quarter but $0.31 lower the $1.96 posted in the Q415. Revenue is projected to come in $4.62 billion lower than the $51.5 billion posted in the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, EarningsWhisper.com reports a whisper number of $1.75 per share. Apple earnings will of course include the much anticipated initial sales report for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It should be noted though that Apple and other brands shouldn’t feel complacent. Google’s flagship, Pixel, is reportedly out of stock. The model seems to have become a preferable choice for ex-Samsung customers. Pixel boasts many superb features that Samsung phones are known for. Many customers are especially keen on Pixel’s impressive camera. So until all these factors are accounted, no one knows for sure who the real champ is right now in the phone arena.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation Apple’s October 27th event – Here’s what we know so far Published by Sia,in Internet— October 20, 2016October 21, 2016 On the 27th of October, Apple will be hosting its “Hello Again” event, where the company is expected to announce the new generation of Macs. The last time Apple held an event that was focused solely on Macs was back in March 2015. Since then, Mac-related news was relegated to press releases and small-scale private meetings. The announcement of a Mac-centric event may indicate that Apple will be bringing some huge changes to the company’s computer line, and judging from the rumours and leaks that we’ve heard so far, the Mac may be receiving a huge refresh across the board. Let me break down the rumoured features that will be coming to the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the regular iMac as well. MacBook Pro Seeing as much of the rumours are related to the MacBook Pro, let’s start with Apple’s flagship laptops. In terms of design, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro will be thinner and lighter, with the bezels and the overall frame of the device stated to be smaller than the current MacBook Pro. Information about the MacBook Pro’s specifications are scarce, but it is said that the laptop will be powered by Intel’s Skylake processors. Of course, last minute changes could be made so that it runs on Kaby Lake processors instead. Continuing the trend that first began with the omission of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7, Apple is said to have dropped the USB 3.0 and Magsafe ports from the MacBook Pro, meaning that the new laptops will come with USB Type C and Thunderbolt 3 ports only. Thankfully, there will be multiple ports on the laptop, so cable rationing is unnecessary. Pin it The MacBook Pro will also be getting two new features. The first is the much talked about OLED display located above the keyboard, which is stated to function as a touchscreen, thereby replacing the physical function keys found on the laptop. The second is a Touch ID sensor that would allow the user to unlock the MacBook Pro via biometrics instead of a password. Pin it MacBook Air While the MacBook Pro line is getting some very swanky updates, things don’t look quite as promising for the MacBook Air. Rumours are going around that Apple will be discontinuing the 11-inch variant of the MacBook Air in favour of the existing 12-inch MacBook. Apple is expected to reveal an updated 13-inch MacBook Air during the event, but actual information about the nature of this update remains scarce. If one were to take a guess, I’d probably say that the MacBook Air will receive a hardware update, as well as the removal of USB 3.0 and MagSafe ports. iMac AMD may be a huge presence for Apple’s iMac line this year as rumours are going around that AMD graphics chips will be present on the updated iMacs. Aside from that, Apple may also debut a 5K Retina display with an integrated GPU during the event. The discontinuation of the Thunderbolt Display earlier this year means that we may also be seeing a new display. Apple has been reportedly working with LG to develop a new 5K screen, so that monitor could make its debut at the event. Others Noticeably missing from the rumour mill are the MacBook, the Mac Pro and the Mac mini. With the MacBook, the lack of information regarding an updated version is understandable, as that particular laptop model received a refresh back in April, as well as a new colour – Rose Gold. For the Mac Pro and Mac mini though, things are a little more concerning. Both the Mac Pro and Mac mini was last updated back in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and no information has leaked surrounding these two products. It could be possible that Apple plans to introduce a small amount of updates to keep them relevant, but it is more likely that Apple is hoping to phase them out naturally. Overall, Apple’s Mac event could potentially be a huge one for those looking to replace or purchase a new MacBook. If you’re looking to get a new Mac sometime soon, I’d advise you to do so after the event is over. At best, you’ll be able to get a new updated Mac with shiny new features. If none of the new Macs appeal to you, at the very least, the pre-existing Macs will be receiving some decent discounts.

Click here to PIN this Low-Sugar and Whole Wheat Apple-Pear Cake! (Once a week for Thursday Treats I feature recipes that are a bit higher in carbs or more indulgent than my usual low-carb offerings and this Low-Sugar and Whole Wheat Apple-Pear Cake with Cinnamon and Pecans is a whole wheat cake with just a little sugar that's delicious for fall.) There's something about cinnamon-laden cakes with fruit that just screams Autumn, but this cake recipe actually got started when it was still summer and I had a surplus of zucchini and made a low sugar and whole wheat Garden Harvest Cake with apples, zucchini, and carrot. Despite the fact it looked more like a bread than a cake, it was definitely one of my favorite new recipes that year. At the time I wondered if you could adapt the recipe to make a cake with just apples, but when I had both pears and apples I decided to try it with that combination. Apples and pears together in a low sugar cake sounded so good to me, but my first attempt was far too wet, and I also decided I wanted a flat cake instead of the loaf pan the original recipe called for. It took me two more cakes to get to the version you'll find in this recipe, which is a low sugar dessert that I'm thinking just about anyone would enjoy. You can  skip the touch of brown sugar for a cake that's even lower in sugar or if you don't care if the cake is low in sugar, skip the Stevia and make it with all sugar if you'd like. When I went to photograph this cake, it screamed for a dollop of something creamy on top, and I used a dollop of whipped cream from a can that I had in the fridge, which was actually pretty low in sugar but probably not that healthy. Of course you could use sugar-free or low-sugar ice cream of frozen yogurt, but an anonymous commenter suggested topping the cake with plain low-fat Greek yogurt, which I think sounds good.  Start by combining the white whole wheat flour, sweetener, brown sugar (or 2 T more sweetener), baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. I found I got best results with this recipe when I grated the pear and apples in a food processor (hand grating made it wetter) so I'd recommend using that if you have one. One pear and two apples gave me 2 cups of grated pear-apple mixture. Mix the pear-apple mixture into the dry ingredients, turning over several times until all the grated fruit is coated with the flour-Splenda mixture. Then measure 3/4 cup pecans, chop pecans with a chef's knife, and stir into the floured fruit mixture. In a small bowl, whip eggs with a fork, then stir in the canola oil and buttermilk and stir together a few times with the fork. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient mixture and stir to combine. It should be fairly stiff. Spray a 9X9 inch dish with non-stick spray, then pour the batter in and pat down evenly with a rubber scraper. (I think an 8x8 inch cake pan would also work.) Cake is done when it's nicely browned, begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, and when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. For me, that was about 35 minutes. Low Sugar and Whole Wheat Apple Pear Cake with Pecans (Makes 6-8 servings, recipe adapted from Garden Harvest Cake.) Ingredients: 1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour 3/4 cup Stevia in the Raw or other sweetener (or use sugar if you prefer) 2 T brown sugar (or use 2 T more Stevia in the Raw or other sweetener) 2 tsp. ground cinnamon (I used Saigon Cassia cinnamon from The Spice House) 1 1/4 tsp. baking soda 1/4 tsp. salt (I used fine grind sea salt) 1 pear and 2 Granny Smith apples (or any combination of apples and pears to make 2 cups grated fruit, grating with food processor recommended) 3/4 cup pecans, chopped with chef's knife 2 eggs 1/4 cup canola oil 1/4 cup buttermilk (plus additional 1 T butter milk if needed) Instructions: Preheat oven to 350F/175C and spray a 9X9 inch pan with non-stick spray or oil (Or you can use an 8X8 inch pan and have the cake rise a bit above the top.) In a large mixing bowl, add white whole wheat flour, sweetener, brown sugar (or more sweetener), cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Mix together with large spoon until well-combined. Peel and grate apples and pear to make 2 cups grated fruit, then stir into dry ingredients, turning over several times until all the grated fruit is well-coated with the flour mixture. Measure 3/4 cup pecans and chop with chef's knife, then add chopped pecans to the bowl with the flour/fruit mixture. Use the spoon to toss ingredients together. In a smaller bowl, add eggs, and beat with a fork about 30 seconds. Add canola oil and buttermilk, and stir together with the fork. Pour egg mixture into the other bowl with the flour mixture and stir until just combined. (Mixture will be fairly stiff, but if it's not wet enough to incorporate all the dry ingredients, add 1 T more buttermilk.) Pour cake into oiled pan. Bake at 350F/175C for about 35 minutes, or until cake is nicely browned, is beginning to spring away from the sides of pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out completely clean. (For me, that was exactly 35 minutes.) Cool cake in the pan placed on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before cutting. This lasted several days in the refrigerator, but I did find it very hard to resist eating it for breakfast! Click Here for Printer Friendly Recipe South Beach Diet Suggestions: Obviously this cake can't ever be sugar free, because there's natural sugar in the fruit, but even if you use the 2 T of brown sugar I felt gave the best flavor, it's still pretty low in sugar for a dessert. I'd consider this a "once in a while treat" for the South Beach Diet if you're on phase two, or you could eat it more often for phase three.

I like the tip about grated the apples and pears in the processor.ReplyDelete AnonymousOctober 21, 2009 at 8:52 AM Why not try some lowfat greek yogurt as a topping, as something a bit more real but still not too unhealthy?ReplyDelete KalynOctober 21, 2009 at 9:58 AM Joanne, Chriesi, and Linda, thanks! I really liked it. I'm not much of a sweets person, and this was just sweet enough. Dara, this was one of those things you learn by accident. The food process gave me nice long shreds of grated fruit, but when I grated it by hand it turned to mush! Anonymous, love the idea of topping it with Greek yogurt! Will edit to add that suggestion, thanks!ReplyDelete MariaOctober 21, 2009 at 10:20 AM Apples and pears are so good right now. I bet your kitchen smelled amazing while this cake was baking. I love it!ReplyDelete JessicaOctober 21, 2009 at 10:24 AM This looks delish! Love the recipe. So healthy. :)ReplyDelete ChristineOctober 21, 2009 at 10:46 AM This is quite a lovely looking cake, Kalyn. I'm eating no wheat these days so may try to play with your great recipe (nut flours?). I'll let you know how/if it turns out. Thanks, as always, for the link!ReplyDelete WinnieOctober 21, 2009 at 11:13 AM Kalyn, Cool whip or not, the topping does make the cake look fabulous...I like the Greek yogurt idea much better though! Looks great...ReplyDelete KalynOctober 21, 2009 at 11:26 AM Maria, yes indeed, it did smell fantastic! Jessica, thanks! Christine, would love to see a version of this with almond flour or some other type of nut flour. Do share if you come up with one. Winnie, that's what I decided. I took a couple of photos without any topping, but it did indeed look "blah." I'm thinking Greek yogurt with a bit of agave drizzled over might be the best option of all!ReplyDelete AnonymousOctober 21, 2009 at 11:27 AM I wish the nutritional values were listed for this. I have Ginger Gold apples and plenty of pears.ReplyDelete KalynOctober 21, 2009 at 11:51 AM Anonymous, the reason I chose the South Beach Diet is because I didn't want to have to figure out calories, carbs, etc. for everything I eat. I think there are some easy places online where you can enter the amounts and calculate it yourself though if you want to know.ReplyDelete Coffee and VanillaOctober 21, 2009 at 2:03 PM Awesome, not only low in sugar, whole wheat but has cinnamon and pecans! I must try this :)ReplyDelete THE AUTHORSOctober 21, 2009 at 6:12 PM Kalyn, I was wondering...for those trying to avoid artificial sweeteners, could you subsistute Splenda with only Agave? Do you know what the conversion would be? Thanks!ReplyDelete KalynOctober 21, 2009 at 6:53 PM You could probably make a cake like this with agave, but I don't know what the adjustments would be. I think it would take some definite tinkering with the recipe, since Splenda is a dry ingredient and agave is a wet ingredient.ReplyDelete SophieOctober 22, 2009 at 12:39 AM What a delicious & good for you cake this is!!! I love cakes as yummie as this!! MMMMMMMMMMMMM,...ReplyDelete healthylifeOctober 22, 2009 at 2:13 AM it look tasty....ReplyDelete neilOctober 22, 2009 at 4:23 AM My wife loves apples and pears so this will be perfect for her. Just thinking out aloud, I wonder if some stiffly beaten egg white added to whipped cream might reduce the calorie load. Don't think it would keep too well though.ReplyDelete AnonymousOctober 22, 2009 at 6:37 AM I live in Tenerife , CXanary Islands , what is Splenda ?ReplyDelete KalynOctober 22, 2009 at 6:54 AM Anonymous, always wanted to go to the Canary Islands!! Anyway, sorry for getting off the topic. Splenda is an artificial sweetener sold in the U.S. that can be used just like sugar in baking. Here is some information about Splenda if you want to read about it. Thanks for the reminder, I should be linking to it in my posts I guess.ReplyDelete KatrinaOctober 22, 2009 at 12:19 PM This looks and sounds great!ReplyDelete ashycatsOctober 22, 2009 at 2:14 PM Hi all - is this the Splenda Sugar Blend or just plain old Splenda? Can't wait to make this over the weekend!ReplyDelete ElenkaOctober 22, 2009 at 2:38 PM What a photo! I can smell it! Perfect recipe for a fall treat.ReplyDelete KalynOctober 22, 2009 at 3:25 PM Sophie, Healthy Life, Neil, Katrina, thanks! I'm slowly learning a little about baking (but I do mean "little.") Ashycats, the 3/4 cup Splenda is the white granular Splenda, not brown sugar blend. (You could use Splenda brown sugar blend for the 2 T brown sugar if you wanted to reduce the sugar a tiny bit more.) Elenka, thanks! I got a new camera and am trying to learn how to use it.ReplyDelete Susan from Food BloggaOctober 22, 2009 at 7:15 PM This is a lovely recipe, Kalyn. My dad's a diabetic but loves his desserts, so my mom is always on the lookout for low-sugar desserts. What did diabetics do before Splenda?ReplyDelete KalynOctober 22, 2009 at 7:26 PM Susan, I'm not sure what they did, but I'm guessing life is a lot easier for diabetics with a little Splenda once in a while!ReplyDelete AnnaOctober 23, 2009 at 9:12 AM This recipe looks AMAZING! I can not wait to make it myself! :) I love that it has cinnamon and pecans in it!ReplyDelete lovemomNovember 6, 2009 at 8:55 AM Kalyn, do you have a carb count for this cake? Also - what is white whole wheat flour? Is it the same as whole wheat pastry flour? Thanks, DanielleReplyDelete KalynNovember 6, 2009 at 9:05 AM Anna, thanks. Lovemom, I chose the South Beach Diet because I didn't want to have to count carbs, so people who want that information will have to calculate it themselves. There is a link in the post for White Whole Wheat flour which will take you to a post I wrote about it.ReplyDelete LauraMarch 18, 2010 at 10:01 PM What a great recipe! I was searching for a way to use up excess pears and apples when I found it. I substituted almond meal for the flour, and added an extra cup of it instead of the pecans (because I didn't have any) and it turned out a bit wet, but very delicious! I made it in muffin tins, and froze all but a few to keep from eating them all at once!ReplyDelete KalynMarch 19, 2010 at 6:59 AM Laura, fun to hear that you made this work with almond meal, thanks for the feedback. It might help to use almond flour which is a little more finely ground than almond meal (and seems to absorb a little more liquid.) Glad you liked it.ReplyDelete NadineDecember 30, 2012 at 5:10 PM Made this today. Moist, delicious and smelled great while in the oven!ReplyDelete Add comment Load more...

Similar stories National: End routine tax avoidance by large corporations The rotten Apple in the tax barrel Apple tax dodging highlights need for reform National: A corporate tax structure in need of urgent reform Permalink Email to a friend Your name Your email address Recipients’ email addresses (Up to ten, separated by commas.) European regulators’ recent finding that Apple avoided billions of dollars in taxes by stashing its profits in Ireland, a known tax haven, put the tech giant in an unwelcome spotlight. But Apple’s tax dodging is just the tip of a huge iceberg of offshore corporate tax avoidance. According to a new report, Offshore Shell Games 2016, by CTJ, ITEP & USPIRG, American firms are avoiding up to $718 billion in U.S. taxes on $2.5 trillion in profits held offshore. These jaw-dropping numbers will keep getting bigger until we fix the corporate tax system. The report found that nearly three-quarters of America’s biggest companies avoid U.S. taxes by setting up subsidiaries in tax haven nations — countries where corporate tax rates are minimal or nonexistent, financial transparency murky and tax-law enforcement lax. The use of tax haven subsidiaries to avoid U.S. taxes is highly concentrated among a small group of mega-corporations: just 30 firms are responsible for two-thirds of all that offshore loot. Apple is the leader, holding nearly $215 billion offshore, on which it owes more than $65 billion in U.S. taxes. Drug giant Pfizer isn’t far behind, with nearly $200 billion spread among a dizzying array of 181 tax-haven subsidiaries. This might explain why Pfizer claims it hasn’t turned a profit in the U.S. in almost a decade. The United States taxes all the worldwide profits of American corporations every year. But a loophole called “deferral” allows firms to indefinitely delay paying taxes on earnings booked offshore. If they book these profits to subsidiaries in tax haven countries, they pay little or nothing to any country. The report estimates that big American corporations have paid worldwide taxes on their trillions of dollars of offshore profits at a rate of just 6.2 percent — less than the rate that average middle-class families pay in U.S. taxes each year. Much of the corporate profit booked in offshore tax havens isn’t earned there. Corporations use accounting tricks to artificially shift earnings from the U.S. (and other large nations with big markets and effective tax systems) to small-nation tax havens. For instance, a pharmaceutical firm can assign a drug patent to a subsidiary in a tax haven, then pay steep royalties to the subsidiary to manufacture and sell the drug in this country. The result? U.S. expenses are artificially inflated, depressing domestic profits and therefore taxes, while profits stack up in offshore havens where they’re taxed little if at all. Pretty much the only business tax-dodging American corporations are doing in tax havens is the business of tax avoidance. One way we know this is that they claim to generate profits at levels that dwarf local economies. The $104 billion in profits U.S. companies say they’ve earned in Bermuda, for instance, is 19 times the entire economic output of that island nation. Another phony angle on corporate-profit offshoring is that a lot of those earnings officially booked overseas are really right here in America. A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that found 93 percent of Microsoft’s supposedly “offshore” profits (now totaling $124 billion) are really invested domestically. When multinational corporations avoid taxes by using offshore havens, the rest of us pick up the tab through higher taxes on working people and domestic businesses, reduced public services or higher public debt. Ending deferral — demanding corporations pay all their taxes every year like everyone else — is the best way to end offshore tax dodging. This simple reform should apply both to future profits and the $2.5 trillion now sitting overseas. Unfortunately, some politicians want to richly reward big corporations for effectively hiding their profits in offshore tax havens with a steep cut in the U.S. taxes they owe on that existing earnings pile. Donald Trump would tax these profits at just 10 percent, handing tax-dodging corporations a half-trillion-dollar tax cut. Some in Congress want to reduce the rate even more. Whether to give such massive and unwarranted tax discounts to some of the nation’s most profitable corporations is sure to be the centerpiece of a Congressional struggle over corporate tax reform expected next year. Big companies and their wealthy investors don’t need another handout. Corporations with profits stashed in offshore tax havens should pay what they owe, now and in the future.

Click here for this report: http://sa-link.cc/1h4 Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 According to this Strategy Analytics research report Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek and Samsung LSI captured the top-five revenue share rankings in the tablet AP market in 1H 2016. Apple led the tablet AP market with 35 percent revenue share, followed by Qualcomm with 18 percent and Intel with 13 percent. Sravan Kundojjala, Associate Director, commented, "The tablet AP market continues to decline and all major tablet AP vendors suffered in 1H 2016. We estimate that ARM-based tablet APs increased their share to 89 percent in 1H 2016 from 83 percent in the same period last year. Intel's tablet AP shipments halved in 1H 2016 as the company shifted its focus away from Atom-based low-end Android tablets and towards Core-based tablets.  Windows-based tablets accounted for the majority of Intel's tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016." Stuart Robinson, Executive Director of the Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service, added, "Our calculations show that baseband-integrated APs accounted for one-third of total tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016. Qualcomm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum represented over 80 percent of total baseband-integrated tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016 and Intel's recent decision to de-emphasize integrated APs will benefit these three vendors in the next few quarters."

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Games Games Accessories Handheld Mobile Games Nintendo PC Gaming More PlayStation Toys VR Xbox Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / VR News / Google Daydream "huge" but Apple VR reveal is coming, says industry expert Google Daydream "huge" but Apple VR reveal is coming, says industry expert by James Laird 20 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Google may be leading the way in virtual reality thanks to its Daydream platform, but an Apple VR reveal is coming, according to one industry expert. Speaking exclusively to TrustedReviews at Apps World 2016 in London, BaDoinkVR CEO Todd Glider hinted that Apple's less than inspiring 2016 product line-up – headlined by the same-y iPhone 7 – could belie its larger ambitions to make a splash in the world of virtual reality. Google, however, he added, enjoyed a clear advantage in the space at the moment. Glider told us: "The Daydream thing is huge. You’re going to see many more people taking the plunge into VR for the first time...[and] in the short term, Google will take the lead because of Daydream. "Apple has to have a trick up its sleeve, because its been a quite while since Apple's done anything interesting. "People are like: 'What’s going on?' The Apple Watch is under impressive and there’s [nothing] exciting about the iPhone. If you look at the iPhone 7 and compare it to any Samsung phone? No, I don’t think there’s anything interesting going on at Apple right now. "[But] I do think they’re going to plan something. They still believe in their mojo...and they’re going to do something with VR and AR. They have to." Glider isn't the first insider to speculate about Apple's potential plans for virtual reality hardware or a VR platform. The company's own co-founder, Steve Wozniak, has previously spoken out on the matter, while current Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked up the possibilities around augmented reality. Apple also has a number of patents that point to the development of an HMD (head-mounted display), and the rumour mill is rife with gossip that the iPhone 8's 'killer feature' could actually be a VR headset.

Home News Computer Systems Apple teases 'hello again' for its media event on Oct 27 Apple is hosting another press event on October 27, teasing 'Hello Again' for a new Mac event By: Anthony Garreffa | Computer Systems News | Posted: Oct 20, 2016 11:17 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Apple has sent out media events to the press for an upcoming event on October 27 at Apple's campus in Cupertino, where it teases "Hello Again" for its upcoming Mac-focused event.     What should we expect? Apple should tease its new MacBook products, including the purported MacBook Pro with its fancy new OLED touchbar, and more. Apple will most likely push for its removal of ports on its devices, with a new MacBook Pro featuring just USB-C, and no traditional USB ports on it, which really would change everything - but will it be for the better?   Apple will also most likely unveil a new MacBook Air, which should see it sans USB-A ports and shift into the arms of USB-C, while inside we're sure to see improved hardware. Lastly, the desktop side of things should see a new Mac Pro unveiling that could be a surprise, and with Microsoft rumored to be preparing an all-in-one desktop PC with a new Surface, Apple could trump them with a new AIO Mac desktop next week.

(Kathy Willens/AP) Though there have been internal updates, the aesthetics of the MacBook Pro haven’t been changed since 2012. Whether the rest of the Mac line-up will be touched upon remains open for debate, while there are also rumours Apple may introduce a new desktop iMac and a new 5K resolution display.

Sami Khan   October 20, 2016 16:16 IST 5 Shares 5 Shares Beware: 90 percent Apple accessories sold on Amazon, Groupon are fakeReuters A multi-million dollar lawsuit has been filed by Apple against US-based Mobile Star LLC for selling counterfeit accessories for iPhones and iPads on Amazon and Groupon. The suit targets 5-watt USB power adaptors and Lighting-to-USB cables sold as genuine products on two major e-commerce platforms. According to Apple, 90 percent of Apple-branded products purchased by the iPhone maker over the last nine months on Amazon were fake. Surprisingly, these products were a part of Amazon's "Fulfillment by Amazon" program, which is a sign of trust consumers look for while buying products on the platform. Why advertise with us? Related Apple tipped to launch new line MacBook Pro next week Apple releases iOS 10.0.3 update to iPhone 7 series to fix cellular connectivity bug "Consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine. Consumers are likewise unaware that the counterfeit Apple products that Amazon.com sourced from Mobile Star have not been safety certified or properly constructed... and pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock," according to the lawsuit documents obtained by Patently Apple. Apple managed to revoke Mobile Star's selling privileges revoked on Amazon, but the American company continued to sell products to Apple through Groupon last December. Recently, an Apple investigator bought fake EarPods and Lightning cables despite a warning was issued to Mobile Star about its activities. Using counterfeit products not only pose a risk of damaging the device, in this case the iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices, but also strike immense danger to the safety of the users. In addition, Apple's trusted infringed trademark on these counterfeits tarnish the tech giant's image in the eyes of its customers. Through this lawsuit, Apple is seeking up to $150,000 per copyright violation and $2 million (around Rs. 13 crore) per trademark infringement, according to the court documents from the US District Court for the Northern District of California. In response to the ongoing case, Amazon told Apple Insider: "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." Post Comment IBT TV Close Russia: Police detain robot for attending political rally Why advertise with us?

October 20 AAPL: 117.06 -0.06 Trademark filing suggests MacBook Pro OLED touch panel will be called the Magic Toolbar Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple may not have officially stated that it’s launching new Macs this month, but the date is at least official and everyone is expecting it to be all about the Macs. Star of the show looks set to be a major revamp of the MacBook Pro line-up, with an OLED touch-bar replacing physical function keys as the headline new feature. Trademark agent Brian Conroy (aka The Trademark Ninja) thinks he knows the name of the feature: the Magic Toolbar … He reports that the name was registered back in February in the computer hardware category by a dummy corporation. The company which filed the application, Presto Apps America LLC, was incorporated just two weeks earlier. Conroy says there are two reasons to believe that Apple is behind the filing. First, simple logic suggests that as Apple already owns the trademarks for Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard, it wouldn’t make sense for anyone else to spend money registering a trademark that Apple could easily contest on that basis. Another company would have to be 100% certified insane to spend €16,000 ($17,500) in outlay for a trademark application that someone with the clout of Apple was almost certain to be able to object to and defeat. And that’s the main reason that I’m putting my neck on the line and saying that ‘Presto Apps America LLC’ is actually Apple. But he also believes there’s a ‘smoking gun’: the lawyers listed on the Magic Toolbar application are the same ones which applied for the AirPod trademark. He also notes what seems to be less than coincidental timing. We recently described the legal manoeuvre Apple uses to quietly register trademarks overseas in order to claim them globally six months later. Conroy says the date the trademark was granted in Benelux countries means the latest date on which Apple can claim the trademark in the U.S. and elsewhere is … the day before the Mac launch. Seems a pretty persuasive case – though it’s of course possible that Apple simply wants to stop other companies attempting to use the name. Let us know in the comments whether you buy it. Via TNW.

Londoner's Diary: Deck Claridge’s halls with tinsel and technology Evening Standard 20/10/2016 FIRST there was the iPhone, then the iPad, and now the iTree? Claridge’s has announced that the British creative duo Jony Ive and Marc Newson, leading designers for Apple, are the latest to create the hotel’s iconic Christmas tree, to be unveiled next month. Chingford-born Ive is responsible for the prevailing aesthetic of contemporary technology, and Newson joined him in 2014, bringing his visionary eye to the presumably touch-screen table. “Their innovative spirit and ground-breaking approach will make this year’s annual tradition one to remember,” said Paul Jackson, general manager of the famed Mayfair hotel. Previously, Claridge’s has collaborated with fashion designers on its festive foliage, including Dolce & Gabbana, John Galliano and Alber Elbaz. Ive, chief designer at Apple, and Newson, the mind behind the watch, have flirted with fashion before — their Apple Watch is worn by Anna Wintour, who sports an Hermès leather version and a 24-carat gold iPhone 6. Last year, Burberry’s Christopher Bailey designed the hotel lobby’s gargantuan centrepiece, a pyramid of gold and silver umbrellas and 77,000 lights. It’s no surprise that Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s former CEO who became Apple’s senior vice- president, is keen to outshine her alma mater. The Apple tree is yet to be revealed, so The Londoner can only speculate as to what it might look like. Will lit-up iPhone 7s be turned into baubles, inspiring an orchard of upgradable décor around the world? Will streams of festive phone-chargers and red, green and gold wires be transformed into tinsel? Or will it all be white cables? And what — or rather who — will be the shining star on top? Surely Steve Jobs is the tech world’s guardian angel. -- An interesting read from Daniel Korski, former aide to David Cameron, in today’s Politico EU, on why Remain lost the Brexit battle but also glimpses into the then-PM’s life. “In contrast to his image as a chillaxing leader, I never found him anything other than extraordinarily dedicated and extremely hardworking,” Korski writes. “Only when he had worked his way through his piles of notes would he don his red Dr Dre headphones and catch up on his sleep.” And we had him pegged as a plain pyjama man. Model mix-up for erotic bard bio writer WILLOWY author Daisy Dunn is basking in the glory of the success of her first book, Catullus’ Bedspread, about the Roman poet. Dunn has been talking at literary festivals but she has a way to go before becoming a recognisable face. “This guy on stage introduced me as Dr Daisy Lowe,” she told The Londoner at a party in Piccadilly. “I didn’t have the heart to correct him so I thought ‘I’m going to be Dr Daisy Lowe’.” Dunn is also learning of her unlikely fan bases. “It’s really strange,” she said. “There’s a Gay Men’s Wine and Dine Book Club in California who are reading Catullus. It looks like a highbrow gay society but there’s not much gay sex in Catullus.” A new kind of flower power ... It was cocktails till dawn, or rather 4am, for the launch of new late-night Dover Street restaurant MNKY HSE (it’s an abbreviation of Monkey House, don’t ya know?). Socialite Henry Conway, was with new mum India Rose James, enjoyed the blend of London style and Latin American spirit as he sipped cocktails. Meanwhile, sampling the tasters was model Kara Rose Marshall as French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez- Versini the ex-husband of Cheryl (née Tweedy), checked out the competition: he is due to open his own London restaurant next month. What will it be called? “I will tell you the name of the restaurant if you bring me flowers,” he told The Londoner. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Now you too can have Trump behind you © Provided by Independent Print Limited STRUGGLING for Halloween costume ideas? Take a leaf out of Jemima Khan’s book, and an ensemble straight out of her wardrobe. Last week the writer and socialite hit the current-affairs nail on the head at the Unicef ball, showing up in a flawless Melania Trump costume, complete with a form-fitting white dress, lashings of jewellery, a steely squint and sharpened nails. But the perfect accessory was a faux-Donald mannequin, groping her from behind with a lecherous leer. And now those hoping to make an impression on All Hallow’s Eve can acquire it for themselves. This week Khan put the costume up on eBay. Bids are currently up to an impressive £3,500 and proceeds “will go towards Muslim Syrian refugees via Unicef” because, Khan says, “that is what The Donald would want”. It’s described as the Original Trump Groper costume and, the description reads, “straps on either side like a backpack”. The diamonds aren’t included but the icy glare can be yours for free. -- ART imitated life last night in Battersea Park at the opening of the Affordable Art Fair. One oil painting of a jar of Marmite drew attention, its cost of £595 set to be matched on the shelves at Tesco. But the most enterprising piece was Poundland by Orson Kartt: a £50 note painted over in Union Jack colours. It’s selling for £125 at the Panter & Hall gallery. That’s inflation for you. D-day for Bernie’s bro The parliamentary seat vacated by David Cameron is up for grabs in Witney today. It’s being billed as the biggest by-election in UK betting history by Ladbrokes but who will be victorious? Actor sir Patrick Stewart tweets that he is backing Labour’s Duncan Enright, and both Cameron and Theresa May drove down to back Tory candidate Robert Courts. So did Green Party candidate Larry Sanders consider breaking out the big guns by flying over an American politician, his brother Bernie? We checked in with Larry’s progress on the eve of the by-election. “I am both fine and exhausted,” he said. “I would have loved to have Bernard over here but he seems to be busy making sure Trump doesn’t get elected, which is a reasonable excuse.” -- Poster boy of the day: after Kumbuka the gorilla escaped his London Zoo enclosure to neck five litres of undiluted squash, could Robinsons have found a new ambassador?

Not so much. Except, every Pixel review did call Google out for this. Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization - not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well - stereo speakers, and water resistance - things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? Turns out, not deal-breakers either. Except, every Pixel review did call Google out for this. Here's a quick cut/paste image job I did yesterday, highlighting how Pixel reviews did, in fact, call out Google and the Pixel for the things Ritchie claims they are not calling them out for. It's almost like the Pixel is being graded on a curve. When you're as deeply enveloped in the Apple bubble as people like Rene Ritchie and John Gruber, reality inside the bubble starts folding in on itself. You sit deep inside your bubble, and when you look outwards, the curves and bends of the bubble's surface twist and turn reality outside of the bubble into ever more grotesque and malformed versions of it. Ever since the unveiling of the Pixel up to and including the reviews published yesterday, everybody in the technology media has been pointing out the exact same things Ritchie claims are not being pointed out. The amount of mental gymnastics and selective perception one must undertake - one could call such exercises flat-out lies - to claim that the major technology media is "against Apple" or "grading [the Pixel] on a curve" is so humongous that I honestly didn't think it was realistically and humanly possible. And I say this as someone who once got a flood of really nasty and angry emails because OSNews had not yet separated the FreeBSD category and its icon from the generic BSD category, so FreeBSD and Dragonfly BSD people alike were furious at me for putting a Dragonfly BSD story in the generic BSD category because it had a FreeBSD icon. I've been around the block when it comes to the kind of reality-warping, deeply idiotic bullshit the technology world can conjure up over absolutely nothing. When I was 17, I went on a trip to Rome, the most beautiful city in the world. As I stood atop the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking down upon the countless tourists swarming St. Peter's Square, I realised how easy it would be to lose touch with the people down there if you spent most of your time up here. The bubble is no different.
