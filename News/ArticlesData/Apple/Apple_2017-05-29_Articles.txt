Music Buckle Up: ‘Carpool Karaoke: The Series’ Just Got An Air Date … By Arron Hirst 30th May 17 11:13 pm Share Tweet Yep, it’s still happening … Those that thought Apple had permanently parked its decision to release a serial spin-off to Cordon’s widely popular primetime Carpool segment, when the firm notably and seemingly without reason cancelled its planned L.A. launch event – last month, may be surprised to learn that the anticipated reality series just got an actual air date. “The show will feature many of today’s biggest names in music, television, film, sports and pop culture buckling up and belting out their favorite songs for a road trip filled with comedy, conversation and music,” Apple said in its release on Tuesday. The announcement came just hours after Eddy Cue tweeted to confirm the show was still on track for an August release. Full press release follows. Carpool Karaoke: The Series debuts August 8 on Apple Music Apple today announced Carpool Karaoke: The Series will be available to Apple Music subscribers starting Tuesday, August 8. The show will feature many of today’s biggest names in music, television, film, sports and pop culture buckling up and belting out their favorite songs for a road trip filled with comedy, conversation and music. Carpool Karaoke: The Series for Apple Music will welcome a different group of superstars every Tuesday, with new episodes available exclusively to Apple Music subscribers in more than 100 countries. Celebrity pairings include Will Smith and James Corden; Miley, Noah, Billy Ray and the entire Cyrus family; Shakira and Trevor Noah; Game of Thrones stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams; Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith; John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson; LeBron James and James Corden; and many more. Based on the segment that has become a global, viral video sensation from the Emmy-winning The Late Late Show with James Corden, Carpool Karaoke: The Series is produced for Apple Music by CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73. James Corden and Ben Winston are the creators and executive producers, along with executive producer Eric Pankowski. The popular Carpool Karaoke will continue to be a recurring segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden, which is broadcast Monday through Friday on the CBS Television Network. / Newsroom Continue Reading You may also like...

Singapore's official ranking as the greenest city in Asia informed the design of Apple Orchard Road, the first Apple flagship in the city. Like Foster + Partners' other recent Apple Stores, particularly the ones in London and Dubai, the building's most prominent feature is its trees. There are eight mature trees at the entrance and a further 12 ficus trees inside. The building also integrates an array of sustainable technologies – meaning all of its energy comes from renewable sources. "This is one of our greenest Apple spaces yet," said architect Stefan Behling, who is head of studio at Foster + Partners. "It breaks down the boundaries between the inside and outside, with the greenery cascading through the store from the mezzanine to the ground floor and out onto Orchard Road, creating the most welcoming civic gesture." Related story Foster + Partners completes Dubai Apple Store with carbon-fibre "solar wings" In line with the now-familiar Apple Store aesthetic, the store features a minimal glass facade measuring 36.5 metres wide. This is sheltered beneath a slender cantilevered canopy, offering protection from Singapore's notorious tropical showers. The eight mature trees stand in front of this facade, framing a public square at the entrance. The aim was to create a green orchard that pays tribute to the fruit and nutmeg trees that once occupied the area. Inside, the two-storey space is framed by walls of Italian Castagna stone, which integrate the two hand-carved spiral staircases. The architects describe these as "warm and beautifully sculpted bookends" that offer "an homage to craftsmanship and materiality". The ficus trees are located on both levels, planted in the same donut-shaped pots seen in previous stores, but the majority can be found up on the mezzanine. Called the Genius Grove, rather than the Genius Bar, this space is the largest of its kind in any Apple Store worldwide. It is slightly set back from the facade behind a simple glass balustrade, creating a double-height atrium below. The store's other features include Apple's widest video screen in the world, housed in a space called The Forum. The aim is for this to become a meeting place for the city's creative community. Norman Foster's firm has established itself as the architect of choice for technology giant Apple. Although the company wasn't involved in Apple's original store designs, it came up with the range of new interior features that were first showcased at the Apple Union Square store in San Francisco. It is also behind the design of Apple Park, the brand's new ring-shaped headquarters in Cupertino, California. Both Apple and Norman Foster ranked highly on the inaugural Dezeen Hot List – a countdown of last year's most newsworthy names in architecture and design. Apple did best, coming in at 11, but Foster was just behind at 13. Related story Apple unveils tree-filled Regent Street store by Foster + Partners Photography is by Nigel Young/Foster + Partners.

The iPhone maker has been found guilty of using VirnetX’s internet security technology in features like FaceTime. The verdict is a let-down for Apple for a case that has been going on since 2010. At first the jury ruled that Apple owed more than $600m to VirnetX, but in August 2016 an appeals court threw the ruling out, saying jurors may have been confused. The latest verdict was handed out by the Eastern District of Texas court, which has gained a reputation for favouring plaintiffs that allege infringement in patent cases, reports say. Both Apple and VirnetX have not issued any statement post the order but Bloomberg reports that Apple is likely to face another round of court proceedings. The court will try to determine whether Apple wilfully infringed the patents and if found guilty, the company could face much higher damages. VirnetX has also filed another patent infringement case against Apple over other security features that include the iMessage application. VirnetX was founded by former employees of government contractor SAIC Inc, and most of its developed technology stems from work done for the CIA for developing secure communications. In fact, the company has been unsuccessful in marketing its own software and mostly relies on patent licensing for revenue. It has only about 20 employees, both part-time and full-time, and got its last payout from Microsoft Corp amounting to $23m. – IBTimes Share this: Related Posts Nokia sues Apple for infringing technology patents ‘Facebook ‘most secure’ for instant messaging services, says Amnesty Facebook gives peek inside unit studying brain-to-text technology Cyber Bill to be enacted before elections Apple criticizes British plans to extend online surveillance Sexually explicit Nust exam sparks public outcry Apple to delay live TV service to next year: Bloomberg Mobile, Internet payments breach $1 billion mark U.S. Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple U.S. tech companies unite behind Apple ahead of iPhone encryption ruling Share this on WhatsApp Arts & Entertainment Arts & Entertainment ‘All I felt was rage’ – Trevor Noah recounts the day his stepfather shot his mom 4th June 2017 Staff Reporter 0 SA-born comedian and TV host Trevor Noah has reflected on the rage he felt after discovering that his stepfather had shot his mother in the head.

Roston - May 30, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has announced that its customers will soon have access to Carpool Karaoke: The Series, a show that revolves around celebrities getting in a car and having fun with others over topics that include music, comedy, and more. According to Apple, the series will be available to Apple Music subscribers starting on August 8, bringing them new episodes every Tuesday in more than one hundred countries around the globe. Carpool Karaoke: The Series is Apple’s own original content, one of many original shows made by companies that are increasingly augmenting traditional television programming with their own content targeted at millennial-and-younger audiences. This particular series is made for Apple Music in particular by CBS Television Studios, according to Apple, as well as Fulwell 73. The show has tapped Eric Pankowski as executive producer, and both Ben Winston and James Corden serve as the show’s creators and executive producers. The series has many well-known celebrities on board as guests, including Queen Latifah, Shakira, Sophie Turner, Trevor Noah, Alicia Keys, Jada Pinkett Smith, LeBron James, and more. The series is based on the hit segment played on The Late Late Show with James Corden, which Apple says will continue to feature the carpool segment. Not familiar with Apple Music? The company is offering new customers a free three month trial of the service, which if started today will still be active when the new Carpool series arrives in early August. Once the trial ends, subscribers will pay $9.99/month for an individual plan, $4.99/month for the student membership, or $14.99/month for the family plan (for up to six people).

By Tiernan Ray May 30, 2017 6:46 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Among Apple (AAPL ) tidbits today was a report by Fortune’s Aaron Pressman saying that the company as hired away an engineer from Qualcomm (QCOM) who had been running the chip designer’s communications parts, meaning, its bread-and-butter baseband business, citing a LinkedIn posting. The baseband is the modem that manages the upload and download connections in a device. Some analysts already predicted Qualcomm might see its dominant share of baseband eroded by Intel (INTC), which last year started selling modems to Apple for the first time. Esin Terzioglu, the Qualcomm engineer, wrote that he feels “privileged for the opportunity to continue my career” at Apple, writes Pressman, citing the post. In response, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt this evening writes that it should now be clear, if it wasn’t before, that Apple will continue to “internalize” chip resources. It already has an “A” series microprocessor line that has powered most of its iOS-based device such as the iPhone. That includes graphics circuitry. And now, McCourt sees Apple continuing to add to its efforts with baseband circuitry. "The data point is the latest in a list of instances suggesting that Apple has plans to develop full SoCs in house for future mobile devices,” writes McCourt. "The current A series processors lack a baseband modem and Terzioglu’s move seems to suggest that Apple is acquiring the necessary expertise to develop such technology." Qualcomm, you’ll recall, was sued by Apple back in January for what it said was an abuse of Qualcomm’s dominant role in making baseband parts for mobile devices. Qualcomm responded by seeking a dismissal of a simultaneous complaint brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, alleging that it was a victim of Apple’s behavior. It has also sued Apple’s contract manufacturers, such as Hon Hai Precision, and last week requested a preliminary injunction against them because of royalties Qualcomm says it’s owed that Apple has instructed those manufacturers to withhold. Qualcomm stock today declined 18 cents to close at $57.34.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Entertainment Image Source: The Late Late Show ‘Carpool Karaoke’ series no one asked for debuts on Apple Music August 8th Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 30th, 2017 at 5:17 PM Share Tweet Carpool Karaoke, Apple’s first original series, now has a release date. Apple’s Senior VP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue tweeted out on Tuesday afternoon that the show will make its Apple Music debut on Tuesday, August 8th. Subsequent episodes will premiere every Tuesday, exclusively available to active Apple Music subscribers. Don't Miss: Side-by-side image claims the iPhone 8 will be bigger than the iPhone 7 Spun off from the popular segment on James Corden’s The Late Late Show, Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke will feature a revolving door of guest hosts, including the likes of Will Smith, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, John Cena and Shaquille O’Neal. Carpool Karaoke: The Series was originally scheduled to begin airing in April, but was pushed back without explanation. There was some speculation that Apple was adjusting the launch to coincide with WWDC 2017, which kicks of on June 5th, but that clearly didn’t end up being the case. Still, we wouldn’t be surprised if Apple had a teaser lined up for the keynote in San Jose next month.

Climate Deal Decision Watch These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel North Korea's Latest Tablet Computer Has A Catchy Name: iPad Adam Clark Estes May 31, 2017, 8:30am ⋅ Filed to:  apple great artists steal iPad north korea Share Ryonghung, a North Korean technology company, recently announced a new tablet. It looks a lot like the weird, firewalled computers the country has produced in the past, with the addition of one curious new feature: The name. It's called... the iPad. Image: Ryonghung / NK News The new Ryonghung iPad comes with a "a quadcore 1.2 GHZ CPU, 1GB of RAM, an 8GB hard disk, an HDMI cable connection and comes with a keyboard and 'network connection' capabilities," NK News reports. Those aren't amazing specs, and they're nowhere close to the latest iPad that Apple sells. But the new Ryonghung iPad does sound nearly identical to the neutered Android tablet spotted in North Korean electronics stores back in 2013. Except for the blatant violation of Apple's trademark. Frankly, you have to give the North Koreans credit for having the gall to rip off the world's richest company, seemingly while giving zero damns. But North Korea has actually made a habit out of stealing Apple's ideas, although this appears to be the first time one of the country's tech companies has straight up lifted a trademarked name. A couple of years ago, a desktop computer that looked virtually identical to an Apple iMac showed up at a trade fair in Pyongyong. Image: KCTV Around the same time, North Korea also created a carbon copy of Apple's OS X. The so-called "Red Star 3.0" operating system could even run a version of Windows, complete with pre-installed military-themed wallpapers. (You can technically download this software, but you probably shouldn't.) Kim Jong Un has also been photographed with what appears to be a real Apple iMac on his desk. It's unclear what kind of software the new Ryonghung iPad runs, but it runs something. "Ryonghung iPad is now popular among customers," reads an advertisement for the new tablet. "It can perform a range of functions such as reading different sources of digital information, office work and documentation. And it also has more than 40 apps." The marketing materials suggest that separate apps come on SD cards, including a farming program and something called "Good Doctor 3.0". So is Apple going to send its army of lawyers to Pyongyang to defend its trademark? Who knows. We've reached out to Apple and asked as much, but hadn't heard back at time of writing. [NK News] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Almost Guest May 31, 2017, 8:51am I doubt that Apple has trademarked "iPad" in North Korea and I doubt that North Korea is part of a trade pact with the US that protects each others IP. So saying they are blatantly violating Apple's trademark would be a misnomer unless, of course, North Korea starts directly selling their iPad in countries where Apple does hold the trademark.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Excel In Augmented And Virtual Reality Augmented & Virtual Reality Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members Abhinav Girdhar, CEO of Appy Pie, looks at how the tech giants are developing technology to compete for market dominance in AR and VR products PSFK Op-Eds 30 may 2017 Augmented reality and virtual reality have taken the world by storm. One recent report predicts that AR and VR headset sales will ring up around $36 billion in annual revenue by 2027, nearly 10 times the expected annual revenue rate for AR and VR devices for 2017. It’s been a long time coming, though. While AR and VR were introduced in the 90s by video game manufacturers like Nintendo and Sega, the technology and adoption of the technology didn’t really start to take off until 2012 and 2014, when Oculus VR came out with the Oculus Rift and Facebook bought the company, respectively. With the increasing innovation and Facebook’s stamp of approval, a.k.a. its acquisition of Oculus VR, a slew of hi-tech companies showed interest and presented some cool demos, providing users with a thrilling experience that blends the real with the virtual. This included startups like Magic Leap, to tech giants like Google, Apple and Microsoft. At this point, it’s safe to say there is no question: AR and VR are the wave of the future. What is in question, however, is which company will end up winning the AR and VR war, which seemed to be on everyone’s minds after Google CEO Sundar Pichai introduced Google Lens at its Developers Conference last week. With the help of its Google Assistant, it can now make use of the smartphone camera to display relevant content by analyzing one’s surroundings. This is compared with Apple, which is also not so far. Apple CEO Tim Cook is excited and serious about augmented and virtual reality, and has considered it as a game-changer that is going to become a part of daily life. As rumormongering continues, it is quite clear that both Apple and Google are working to bring the most out of this innovative technology, which will surely cause a huge clash in the future. To help understand who will be the future leader of AR and VR, I’ve shared some thoughts below. Virtual Assistant Though Apple’s virtual assistant Siri is a crowd pleaser, Google’s voice search tool is more accurate and provides better response than Siri.  While Apple is working on making Siri more accurate and smarter, it is still way behind in the race compared to Google. So, with the next-gen Google Assistant, which identifies real-world objects with Google Lens, it is clear that Google has an upper hand over Apple for now. Second Quarter: Uniquely Designed AR Smartphones   The future of Apple depends on AR and VR technology; therefore they are putting in extra time and effort to create unique AR-optimized smartphones and wearables that enable persistent and smooth augmentation of the real world. Though others, including Google, Microsoft and Facebook, are giving Apple a run for its money in the AR world, when it comes to developing impressive smartphones and wearables, Apple is the leader. Virtual Reality Google is all set to dominate the AR and VR world with VR headsets, VR-ready phones and two AR phones, while it is rumored that Apple is ready to launch virtual reality in its upcoming iPhones. Whatever the final outcome, it’s certain that users will get to experience amazing AR- and VR-enabled smartphones and wearables in the future. As of today, Google beats Apple in virtual reality, but with AR iPhones in the future, a tough competition is sure to emerge in the AR and VR world. Augmented Reality Tim Cook considers augmented reality as big an idea as smartphones and according to him, Apple is set to launch AR featured smartphones in the market very soon. After the iPhones, AR glasses are further down the road, which will be backed with the ability to capture objects and provide contextual information based on the real world. As of now, Apple is still working on its AR and VR products, while Google is far ahead and planning to go big with its Google Assistant, Google Lens and Google Home. A multitude of AR and VR gadgets have been introduced in the market. Some of them were big hits, while others weren’t able to keep up with the pace of this evolving technology in order meet users’ expectations. Although the above points put Google at the forefront of AR and VR technology, one never knows what Apple has in store. With multiple future plans, it looks like Apple and Google will surely dominate the market—but to what extent, no one knows. Abhinav “Abs” Girdhar is CEO of Appy Pie.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 04, 11:56 PM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology James Corden Carpool Karaoke Apple Music Spinoff Debuts In August By Denisse Moreno On 05/30/17 AT 5:58 PM Close After multiple delays, Apple announced Tuesday “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” will finally premiere Aug. 8 on Apple Music. The show will be Apple’s first original video series, inspired by CBS’ "The Late Late Show with James Corden" segment. Apple reportedly bought rights to the segment last year. Apple had planned to launch the show in April, but then pushed the date back without giving a reason. Read: Apple Original Content: Doc On 'Harry Styles: Behind the Album' The company released a trailer for the series in February that featured celebrities including John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Alicia Keys and John Legend. Apple said Tuesday the show will feature musicians, television, film, sports and pop culture personalities. The celebrities will be “buckling up and belting out their favorite songs for a road trip filled with comedy, conversation and music,” Apple said. The show will feature a different set of superstars every Tuesday. “Celebrity pairings include Will Smith and James Corden; Miley, Noah, Billy Ray and the entire Cyrus family; Shakira and Trevor Noah; Game of Thrones stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams; Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith; John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson; LeBron James and James Corden; and many more,” Apple said in a post. New episodes will be available exclusively to Apple Music subscribers in more than 100 countries. The show is just another example of Apple’s push for video content. The company recently released its exclusive documentary on former One Direction singer Harry Styles on Apple Music. The movie “Harry Styles: Behind the Album” goes behind the scenes of the singer's first solo album. Last week, Apple Music released the trailer for the documentary about Bad Boy Records, the label founded by Sean Combs. The movie, called "Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story," is to be released June 25 on Apple Music. Read: iOS 11 Features: Update Will Push Original Video Content With Revamped Music App Apple is expected to release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of this year, including will.i.am’s "Planet of the Apps" and documentaries about hip-hop label Cash Money Records and music impresario Clive Davis. Apple’s new content is an effort to push Apple Music above other rival streaming services, including Spotify, Tidal and Pandora. Apple’s upcoming iOS 11, which is rumored to roll out this September alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, will reportedly include an update that better showcases Apple original video content. Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine said in an interview with Bloomberg last month he is focused on music-related video, including a possible sequel to R. Kelly’s "Trapped in the Closet," a rap opera. Iovine said he has discussed possible ideas with Brian Grazer, the producer of Fox’s "Empire" and "Genius," and with director J.J. Abrams. The Apple executive has also met with Warner Bros. Television about creating a show based on the life of Dr. Dre. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

WWDC 6.0 features a number of significant improvements, including the ability to use almost all of the features in the app without signing in with an Apple ID. The app now provides curated video playlists based on featured themes, a new “Venue” tab that provides information on the venue, and interactive venue and street maps for the local area. The update also adds an iMessage app that provides some exclusive stickers for WWDC attendees to share. Apple TV support, introduced last year in in version 5.0, also allows users to view and stream both live videos from this year’s event and archived videos from past years’ conferences on the big screen, and the app will preserve playback position across devices, allowing users to begin watching a video on one device, such as an iPad, and then pick up where they left off on another device such as an Apple TV. Push notifications in the app help keep attendees up to date on important information for various events during the conference, and indoor location support will help navigate around the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. Attendees can also add their conference pass to Wallet for faster check-in.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 30, 2017 2:43 PM PT Credit: Apple More like this Apple's first original series, Carpool Karaoke, delayed to later this year Apple’s original TV shows are almost ready for prime time Apple Music in iOS 11 could put video front and center Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions Apple’s Carpool Karaoke now has a new premiere date. Apple senior V.P. of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, tweeted that Carpool Karaoke will stream on Apple Music starting Tuesday, August 8. The series is a full-length version of the popular segments on The Late Late Show with James Corden. It was originally scheduled to debut in April but was mysteriously postponed. Apple has not given an explanation as to why the series had to be pushed back. In February, the company released a promo featuring segments with A-list celebs, including Will Smith, Alicia Keys, and Ariana Grande. [ Further reading: The best media streaming devices ] Carpool Karaoke will be Apple’s first original series to stream exclusively on Apple Music. Along with the reality competition series Planet of the Apps, it marks Apple’s star-studded move into original programming intended to make Apple Music somewhat of a hybrid between Spotify and Netflix. Planet of the Apps was originally slated for a spring release date, as well, but it seems that show has also been pushed back. There is no word on when the Shark Tank-meets-The Voice competition will premiere. The story behind the story: Up until now, Apple has relied on bringing big stars to Apple Music in order to remain competitive in streaming media. Shortly after it launched, Apple Music scored exclusives from Taylor Swift and Drake (who have also appeared in ads for the music service). In a similar fashion, Apple’s original programming has been banking on celebrities. Planet of the Apps features Gwyneth Paltrow. The fact that both of these shows were pushed back could signal a shift towards something more ambitious, or at least more original. Earlier this year, Apple reportedly met with former HBO executive Michael Lombardo to re-assess its video strategy. As HBO’s head of programming, Lombardo was responsible for green-lighting Game of Thrones, True Blood, and Silicon Valley.

Elyse Betters30 May 2017Laptops Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Want more proof that Apple might launch new MacBook Pros in June? Well, if you check out Apple's online store, the free shipping times for the 15-inch MacBook Pro are now estimated for between 6 June to 8 June in the US, rather than the usual same-day shipping. Keep in mind Apple's WWDC 2017 keynote is scheduled for 5 June. Apple typically uses its mostly-annual developers conference to announce new software updates to existing products, giving developers a chance to become acquainted with the changes and maybe get their third-party integrations, tie-ins, services, and apps ready. However, this year, Apple may announce hardware updates, according to Bloomberg, which has said we can expect new laptops at WWDC. Apple likely wants to keep its MacBook laptop line fresh for customers, especially due to recent hardware pushes from rivals, such as Microsoft, as well as declining iPad sales. It is reportedly planning three new laptops: the MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip, and the 13-inch MacBook Air will get a new processor.  Apple's Siri speaker: What's the story so far? iPad Pro 10.5-inch could be launched in June following case leak The new MacBook Pro delivery estimates on Apple's site seems to give more weight to Bloomberg's report about Apple planning to launch new MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook models on 5 June at WWDC. However, the 13-inch MacBook Pro models remain in stock for delivery as early as tomorrow. It's not clear whether that's due to more supply, or maybe Apple has no planned updates for that model. The updated MacBook Pro laptops will apparently still look the same; they're only getting different internal architecture. In other words, none of the updates are major changes. The MacBook and MacBook Air are definitely due for an update, though, considering they were last updated in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Bumped to version 6.0, the app lets you watch curated video playlists focused on featured themes, as well as view interactive venue and street maps of San Jose McEnery Convention Center and access other important venue information through the new Venue tab. Unlike before, you can now use all app features without signing in. Lastly, Apple has given the app an Apple Music-like facelift with bold headings, larger images and simplified navigation, as evidenced by the screenshots. The WWDC app supports all form-factor iOS devices natively and includes a sticker pack for iMessage and an Apple Watch component. You can download it free on App Store. The keynote will be live-streamed through the Apple Developer website and on the WWDC app. The Cupertino giant could unveil its own Siri speaker at WWDC and potentially unveil hardware updates to the iPad Pro lineup and a next-generation Apple TV with 4K video support. Check out our WWDC 2017-themed wallpapers for your Apple hardware.

The show was originally supposed to air on Apple Music beginning April 2017, but the iPhone maker was forced to postpone its arrival due to tight production schedule. All sixteen episodes will debut on Tuesdays, available only to Apple Music members. Featuring a different host every episode, Apple’s version of “Carpool Karaoke” replaces the show’s regular host James Corden with actors, comedians, athletes and other celebrities, who will be seen riding along in a car together as they’re singing different tunes. Some of the confirmed celebrities that will appear on the show include Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena and Shaquille O’Neal. “Planet of the Apps,” Apple’s show about apps and their creators, is coming this year. Apple wrapped up filming of that one back in February 2017, but it’s unclear when exactly the company might release it on Apple Music.

Usman Published 12:32 PM, May 30, 2017 Updated 12:59 PM, May 30, 2017 TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwanese firm Asus unveiled on Monday, May 29, their 2017 lineup of laptops, including what Asus chairman Jonney Shih described as "the world's thinnest convertible" and "the world's most prestigious laptop." Shih was referring to the ZenBook Flip S (UX30), a 2-in-1 convertible laptop and the ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490), respectively. Asus dubbed its product presentation "The Edge of Beyond" held at the HNBK International Convention Center at Computex 2017, which runs until June 3, Saturday. Also part of the company's revelations are the ZenBook Pro (UX550), which Shih described as "super powerful with compact design"; the VivoBook S15, trumpeted as a unit with a "thinner and lighter design"; and the VivoBook Pro 15, with its "unprecedented performance." The Asus chairman beamed pridefully as he called their new products as representative of "the new age of innovation." Shih took aim at Apple's MacBook Air, declaring that the ZenBook Flip S is thinner and lighter than the Apple product. On the software side, Shih boasted of the new products' support for new Windows 10 features, among them Windows Link, Windows Hello, Cortana and Modern Standby. "Today is all about our relentless effort in striving toward perfection. Our brand new ZenBook and VivoBook lineup truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops," Shih said. Asus also highlighted its long partnership with Intel, calling onto the stage, Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's client computing group. "Asus has been at the forefront of delivering new technology and experiences for many years. Its stunning lineup of new ZenBook and VivoBook PCs, all powered by 7th-generation Intel Core processors, give people a choice of thin-and-light PCs that merge high performance with style," said Bryant. Below are photos and specs of the 5 laptops unveiled. 1) Asus ZenBook Flip S (UX370) Photo by Edd K. Usman/Rappler The Asus ZenBook Flip S – among the winners of a Computex 2017 d&i award – is the world’s thinnest convertible laptop, the company claims. The convertible is 10.9-mm thing and weighs 1.1 kilograms, making it among the lightest in the laptop market today. It features a 360°-flippable display, designed with an "ErgoLift" hinge that lifts and tilts the keyboard to an angled typing position when the display is opened beyond 135°. The Flip S features Windows 10 S and has a 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor, a 1TB PCIe SSD, a new cooling system, a 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen that supports an active stylus such as the Asus Pen, slim bezels called "NanoEdge," and a compact fingerprint sensor. Price starts at $1,099, and is expected to start arriving in September 2017. 2) Asus ZenBook Pro (UX550) Photo by Edd K. Usman/Rappler Asus ZenBook Pro is designed with power in mind. It won the "Computing and System" category at the Computex 2017 Best Choice Awards. Last year, Asus also won the category with its Zenbook 3 laptops. This year's Pro is the thinnest and lightest ever for the line while still packing powerful specs: up to a 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ chip for notebooks, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 Ti graphics, a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. Asus claims it has a 14-hour battery life. It is equipped with a 15.6-inch 4K touchscreen display with NanoEdge bezels, and a quad-speaker setup that utilizes Harman Kardon surround-sound audio. ZenBook Pro launches with either Windows 10 Pro or Home. The Pro has an all-aluminum unibody that’s 18.9mm thin and 1.8 kg light. It's among the most portable in the high-spec'd class of laptops. It is expected to start arriving in July in some markets with a starting price of $1,299. 3) Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490) Photo by Edd K. Usman/Rappler The Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe is also one of the winners of a Computex 2017 d&i award. It's 12.9mm-thin and weighs 1.1 kg. It has the chassis of a 13-incher but packs a 14-inch display, also with NanoEdge bezels. Asus says it's the world’s thinnest 14-inch laptop. The ZenBook 3 Deluxe is among the most powerful in the popular Zenbook 3 line. It will be offered with an Intel Core i7-7500U processor, up to 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM, and a 1TB PCI-Express SSD. It has two USB Type-C ports that are Thunderbolt 3-enabled. Thunderbolt 3 allows for fast 40Gbps data transfers, and the ability to connect to dual 4K UHD external displays. ZenBook 3 Deluxe comes with Windows 10 Pro or Home, with prices starting at $1,199. No word on expected availability yet. 4) ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 (N580) Photo provided by Asus The ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 is a 15.6-inch Windows 10 laptop powered by a 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics. VivoBook Pro 15 features hybrid storage, offered with up to a 2TB HDD and a 512GB SSD. It has a 4K display and a 100% sRGB color gamut – a useful feature for designers, artists. It features Harman Kardon-certified audio, including a set of twin speakers, that Asus says makes for louder sound. It also has a fingerprint sensor for one-touch login via Windows Hello, and support for ASUS Pen. Prices start at $799. No word on availability yet. 5) ASUS VivoBook S15 (S510) Photo by Edd K. Usman/Rappler This 15.6-inch Windows 10 laptop is 17.9mm thin and weighs 1.5 kg. It also has the aforementioned NanoEdge bezels. It's also powered by a 7th-generation Intel Core chip – up to a i7-7500U processor. Rounding up its specs are 16GB of DDR4 memory and NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics.

Just search for “Apple Park” in Maps and do a two-finger swipe up to switch to 3D view. Now you can swipe and twist around to see the structures and landmarks, including the giant ring-shaped main building. It’s not quite the same as actually going there, but it’s still cool to see the campus from the perspective you want.

May 30, 2017 at 6:40 EDT PM Hagen May 30, 2017 Maps offers up the same info to both Mac OS and iOS, so you should get the same view across all of your devices. If it’s still flat, try zooming in a bit more. Unfortunately, the update is for the drawn “map” and “transit” views only. The satellite view is still working with mid-construction photos from around June 2016. I presume they’re waiting for the final completion before photographing it again. Also interesting to note that the new buildings across the street at the Cupertino Village shopping center haven’t been added. So I guess there’s still some work to do.

There's a new iPad launching (but it's not what you think it is...) By Cella Lao Rousseau Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 12:13 pm EDT 6 Comments WTF is copyright? North Korean company Ryonghung is launching their own version of the iPad called (you guessed it) the iPad. If you've heard rumors of a new iPad launching, I guess you're not technically mistaken. Yes, there is a new iPad coming out, but no, it will not be from Apple. If at this point you're scratching your head and wondering WTF I'm talking about, I'll just refer you to the image below: Okay seriously, what the hell is going on? Apple Insider: A North Korean firm, Ryonghung, has reportedly launched a tablet called the "iPad," seemingly exploiting international trademarks in the knowledge that Apple is unlikely to come knocking. … Wait, this is for real? Yup. How does it work? This low-powered machine comes with a quad-core, 1.2GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and a measly 8GB of storage. The product claims to have over 40 apps available (including a farming app called Good Doctor 3.0…), though some may have to be loaded via SD card. You can also apparently connect to the internet, though North Korean users will obviously have extremely limited access to the online world. So is this copyright infringement? GIZMODO: Frankly, you've got to give the North Koreans credit for having the gall to rip off the world's richest company, seemingly while giving zero shits. But North Korea has actually made a habit out of stealing Apple's ideas, although this appears to be the first time one of the country's tech companies has straight up lifted a trademarked name… So is Apple going to send its army of lawyers to Pyongyang to defend its trademark? Who knows. Wait, what else has North Korea ripped off from Apple? Well there's Red Star 3.0 which is a blatant OS X ripoff, and then there's their desktop computers and other devices that are essentially iMac knockoffs. Can I buy one of these North Koren iPads anywhere? It's not 100% clear how you'll be able to get your hands on this knockoff version of the iPad, but there will probably be a few that find their way online and into the hands of others eventually. What do you think of Ryonghung's iPad? Is this the funniest thing you've seen in awhile, or do you think this is a blatant breach of copyright and should be taken more seriously? Are you pumped to play Good Doctor 3.0? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

Carpool Karaoke will debut August 8th on Apple Music, iTunes leader Eddy Cue tweeted out this afternoon. New episodes will debut on Tuesdays and will only be available to Apple Music subscribers. The Apple Music incarnation of Carpool Karaoke will replace regular host James Corden with a series of guest stars, including actors, comedians, and athletes, giving the show an excuse to get even more famous names in the mix. There are going to be 16 episodes, and stars include Will Smith, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, and Metallica, among many others. Corden will make an appearance, too. Carpool Karaoke was supposed to launch in April but was delayed at the last minute for undisclosed reasons. It’s still not clear what happened; nor is it entirely clear yet what Apple’s broader plans are for original content. Rather than go after Netflix, so far Apple seems more interested in augmenting Apple Music with related content to help it stand out from Spotify. Carpool Karaoke is a natural fit, but we’re about to find out whether its viral appeal holds up when stretched out to TV-show length and locked inside a single service.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of internet software and services, announced the date in a tweet Tuesday. The series will be available to subscribers of Apple Music, the tech giant’s music subscription service regularly priced at $9.99 per month. “Carpool Karaoke: The Series,” produced by CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73, will feature a unique pairing of celebrities in each episode, such as John Legend with Alicia Keys and Billy Eichner with Metallica. Corden appears in at least two episodes, alongside Will Smith and LeBron James. The trailer for the show shows Corden and Smith in a helicopter for a singalong to R. Kelly’s “I Believe I Can Fly.” Apple Music will debut a new installment of the 16-episode series each Tuesday. Other celebrity pairings will include Miley, Noah, Billy Ray and the entire Cyrus family; Shakira and Trevor Noah; Shaquille O’Neal and WWE star John Cena; “Game of Thrones” stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams; Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith; and John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson. James Corden and Ben Winston are the creators and executive producers of “Carpool Karaoke: The Series,” along with executive producer Eric Pankowski. “Carpool Karaoke” will continue to be a recurring segment on “The Late Late Show” on CBS. Other original productions set to land on Apple Music include “Planet of the Apps,” a reality-competition series designed to highlight Apple’s App Store business that is being produced by Propagate’s Ben Silverman and Howard Owens. Apple hasn’t yet announced a premiere date for “Planet of the Apps.” Will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk serve as executive producers and mentors on the show, in which aspiring app developers vie for a chance to win venture-capital funding.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About News Image Source: Sessions/Future/REX/Shutterstock Woz thinks the next big innovation will come from Tesla, not Apple Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 30th, 2017 at 1:47 PM Share Tweet Over the past few decades, Apple has been at the forefront of a number of technological revolutions. From the Apple II and the original Mac to the iPod and the iPhone, there’s no denying that Apple’s long history of innovative products have fundamentally changed the way the world uses and interacts with technology. As a result of Apple’s illustrious track-record, the expectation for Apple to deliver the next big thing tends to be greater than it is for any other company on the planet. Indeed, calls for Apple to magically release a product capable of eclipsing the iPhone have been persistent for years now. Interestingly enough, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that Apple’s time as an innovative company may be coming to an end. As Woz explains it, this isn’t to say that Apple won’t continue to deliver exciting new products, but rather that the next great leap forward in the tech space will likely emanate from a completely different company: Tesla. Don't Miss: Google Search just got a lot more personal During a recent interview with Bloomberg, Woz said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will be at the vanguard of the next tech revolution. “I think Tesla is on the best direction right now,” Woz explained. “They’ve put an awful lot of effort into very risky things.” Woz also intimated that Apple, not to mention other tech giants like Google and Microsoft, may simply be too big for its own good. “Look at the companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft that changed the world, and Tesla included,” Woz added. “They usually came from young people. They didn’t spring out of big businesses.” It’s an interesting point, but Apple — more so than the companies referenced above — has shown a penchant for changing the world even as an established “big business.” Indeed, the iPhone release came hot on the heels of the iPod. Nonetheless, it’s important to remember that innovation is not necessarily a zero sum game, which is to say that there’s enough room for the tech world to enjoy innovative new products and services from more than just one company. Woz’s full interview can be viewed below: Tags: Apple, Steve Wozniak, Tesla View Comments Trending 1 Tech People are going to pay $880 for this ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ Galaxy S8, sadly 2 Tech Rumor claims Apple’s MacBook Air line is dead 3 Tech Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more 4 Tech New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project 5 Entertainment NBA Finals 2017 live stream: How to watch Warriors vs. Cavaliers Game 2 online Picked For You New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project By Yoni Heisler 11 hours ago The Galaxy Note 8 might launch sooner than we thought By Chris Smith 2 days ago Why would you even own a Nintendo Switch without these 5 must-have accessories?

Apple launched the “Life is easier on iPhone” campaign earlier this month with similar ads focusing on music, privacy and photos. The company also updated its apple.com/switch page to urge Android users to jump ship, something that has become a focus for Apple amid some disappointing sales results for the iPhone. In another ad from the latest batch, Apple boasts of better performance: Apple also makes the case for how easy it is to make the switch. Convinced? Apple is sure hoping these ads do the trick, seeing as the number of people moving over from rival mobile operating systems is expected to slow down in the coming year, according to a recent survey by Morgan Stanley.

According to authorities, Wicker was involved in an argument with several people in the parking lot when he produced a small-caliber handgun and fired several shots at the victim, striking him in the head once.

At the California company's World Wide Developer's Conference (WWDC), Apple is expected to confirm the new operating system, as well as a host of other updates such as a rumoured 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a Siri-powered speaker and reboots for the Macbook range. The keynote speech will take place on Monday 5 June in San Jose, and the address is expected to include the announcement of iOS 11. Apple iOS through the ages: in pictures The upcoming iPhone 8 is thought to be undergoing a major redesign, fueling talk of major changes to come with iOS 11. Here are some of the features that could be in iOS 11.  Best features Siri updates Rumours that Siri is about to become a lot more intelligent have been dominating talk ahead of Apple's launch of iOS 11. The voice assistant could be fitted with more artificial intelligence that can learn from users' actions, according to The Verifier. The update could mean that Siri is tied to users rather than devices. Another reported update could see Siri interjecting in group chats and conversations. In a patent filing in the US, Apple says: "One or more of the participant users can select to utilise a virtual assistant to assist the participant users with tasks during the communication session." This would be similar to Google's Assistant, which can be called upon in conversations in the Allo app.  Apple Music Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine has suggested that Apple will start developing original video for future updates. It comes after Apple last year purchased James Corden's "Carpool Karaoke" as a standalone series. The iPhone giant is reportedly looking to expand its content, following the lead of other tech giants that are moving into original video. The company is working on 10 original series, according to Bloomberg. Mr Iovine said: "I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans." Apple Music Video sharing Apple launched a new video editing app earlier this year called Clips that lets users add filters and effects to users' films. The app could be included as standard in iOS 11 and may feature new sharing abilities.  Apple's Clips video editing app Credit: Apple Sleep monitoring Earlier this month, Apple acquired sleep start-up Beddit. The Finnish company makes monitoring device that sits between the bed and mattress and tracks sleep quality, heart rate and snoring. There is no support for such sleep monitoring on iOS 10 or on the Apple Watch, and while Apple only completed the deal in May it could be planned for iOS 11, or one of its later updates. Peer-to-peer Apple Pay Apple Pay has reached a tipping point in the UK, with the majority of UK tills now accepting cardless payments. The company could add a new way to send money digitally between iPhones in iOS 11, Recode reports. According to Recode the service isn't quite ready, though, and the announcement may be some time away. Dark mode Apple enabled its "Night Shift" mode on devices last year, which can cut back on glaring blue light if you use your phone at night. However, with rumours that Apple is planning an OLED (Organic LED) screen for its high-end iPhone 8, which will allow the screen to show deeper blacks, there are reports that a new dark mode may be on the way. Apple already has a dark mode for its TVs and Macbooks but this has not been replicated for iPhones. There are plenty of mock ups for Apple's dark mode, but this rumours is definitely "what we want" rather than "what we know". iOS 10 key features When can I download iOS 11? There will likely be some form of developers beta version released at the conference next week, followed by a public beta in July.  A final release date has not been confirmed, but by past example the most likely month is September. New features for macOS Last year, Apple updated its OS X system to macOS, now its its current 10.12.5 iteration. Apple may introduce a new update, speculatively named macOS 10.13, although there are no hard details yet. Meanwhile, we will likely see further developments for Apple's WatchOS operating system and its TVOS.

By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/30/17 AT 2:04 PM Close The Nintendo Switch has been difficult to find since its March launch, but the console’s supply chain problems might be due to an unlikely culprit: Apple. High demand for individual components for hardware and devices have made it difficult for Nintendo to get the supplies it needs for Switch manufacturing, the Wall Street Journal reported. As the Journal noted, companies in product sectors ranging from smartphones to servers are requesting an increasing number of components used in these devices and manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand. These components include NAND flash memory and the motors used for vibration feedback in devices like the Switch’s controllers. Read: Nintendo Wants To Sell 10 Million Switch Consoles This Year A Toshiba spokesperson told the Journal that flash memory demand has been “overwhelmingly greater than supply” and the situation is expected to continue through the end of the year. The problem for Nintendo has come down to its competitiveness versus increased demand. Generally, other companies have been able to offer larger orders or better agreements with manufacturers than what Nintendo can offer. Data server manufacturers also require newer and more profitable parts for companies than Nintendo’s Switch. In particular, Apple has also been a major contributor to this increased demand. With the current production of the iPhone 7 and the upcoming rumored iPhone 8, Apple has taken up a substantial amount of manufacturers’ available schedules. As MacRumors previously noted, Apple also reportedly has looked into buying a major share of Toshiba’s flash memory business.   For Nintendo, the continued supply chain difficulties are the company’s biggest hurdles in maintaining the Switch’s current hot streak. Since its launch, the Switch has been a major factor in improving the company’s fortunes, especially after the sputtering launch of its predecessor, the Wii U. The console sold 2.74 million units during its March launch, buoyed by equally strong sales of flagship titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo saw similar sales successes in April, as the console was the highest selling hardware device for the month in North America. Read: New Pokémon Nintendo Switch Game Hinted At Via Job Postings With the Switch’s steady numbers, Nintendo wants to remain aggressive with the new console’s sales. The company said the console can have a Wii-like lifespan for the market and wants to sell an additional 10 million units this fiscal year. This goal is fueled, in part, by the console’s portability and Nintendo considering it a Game Boy-like option where families buy multiple units for family members. The Switch also is to see high-profile titles like a new Monster Hunter title and Splatoon 2 later this year. However, the console’s continued success will come down Nintendo solving its supply chain problems. As the Journal noted, Nintendo is cautious about ramping up its manufacturing orders, because it potentially could cause the Switch to be sold above its retail price. At the same time, Switch remains hard to find in retail stores months after launch Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Did Apple just drop the subtlest hint about the MacBook Pro’s future? by Chris Smith 30 May 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple is seemingly telling potential MacBook Pro buyers to adopt a wait and see attitude before splashing the cash; suggesting new models might be on the way next week. The company has altered the shipping estimates for the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro models from same-day shipping, to 3-5 business days (via Engadget) That would put free delivery in the US right around June 6-8, which is immediately following Apple’s WWDC keynote on June 5. Apple has also adjusted the estimates in Europe, Australia, Canada and in the far east, MacRumors points out Recent rumours have suggested Apple will boost the entire line-up with Intel’s 7th generation core processors. Most of the updates are expected to be iterative, internal improvements (meaning no design changes), but it’ll certainly be advantageous for customers to pick up the 2017 model, should it arrive next week. Related: Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Should Apple decide to refresh the line up (perhaps with an additional 32GB RAM configuration), it would represent just a 220 day turnaround between new models. Given Apple took its sweet time in overhauling the MacBook Pro last year, this could be seen as a sign the company is reaffirming its commitment to its computing platform. Elsewhere at WWDC, we’re likely to see the latest version of macOS, plus iOS 11 and new developments for watchOS and TV OS. We may also see the company’s Siri-powered Amazon Echo rival make an appearance, although such talk has quietened down of late. Are you in the market for a new MacBook Pro?

Apple announced the iPhone SE and a 9.7" version of the iPad Pro. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)    Apple Targets Google In New Ad Campaign Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 1:27 PM 05/30/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple reportedly released three new advertisements Thursday indirectly calling out other smartphone operating systems, like Google’s Android. The new videos are part of a larger initiative from the tech conglomerate called “Life is easier on iPhone” campaign, reports 9to5Mac, a blog primarily focused on Apple-related news. The campaign aims to have people convert from being an Android user to an iPhone customer. As evidenced by the marketing content, Apple not only tries to trumpet how easy it is to transfer from one service provider to another, but also the purportedly superior security and fluidity of its phones’ operations. The most recent advertisements are reminiscent of other Apple promotional videos in the past, specifically the ones with actor Justin Long, in which Apple tries to personify and portray its computer product as more reliable and less awkward. When the campaign was officially launched earlier this month, the company updated its “apple.com/switch” sub-site, according to 9to5Mac. While the ads do not bluntly address Google, this section of the company’s website directly references its competitor and its operating system. “Will it be easy to switch to iPhone?” the website asks. “Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the ‘Move to iOS’ app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you.” Apple apparently thinks that maximizing its market share by shepherding current Android users to its own services is one of the best ways to increase its profits. (RELATED: Potentially Leaked iPhone 8 Images Appear To Show Touch Sensor On Back Of Device) How easily Apple will be able to snag consumers from its competition may prove to be a difficult task. A report published in November shows that Android users were less likely to switch to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in comparison to previous iPhones.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 04, 11:56 PM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology WWDC 2017: 15-Inch MacBook Pro Shipping Dates Shift Before Rumored New Lineup By Denisse Moreno On 05/30/17 AT 12:43 PM Close Apple recently updated online availability of 15-inch MacBook Pro on its website to June 6-8 to coincide with the Worldwide Developers Conference next week, MacRumors first spotted. The move comes after a Bloomberg report said Apple plans to announce its new laptop lineup at WWDC. Apple will reportedly announce new versions of the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro at the event. The company is also said to be considering updating the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been upgraded in years. Read: Apple Will Introduce New MacBook Lineup At WWDC, Could Debut Revamped MacBook Air In-store pickup of the 15-inch MacBook Pro is available for June 8. The availability update did not apply to the 13-inch MacBook Pro version, with delivery dates as soon as May 31. The 15-inch MacBook Pro delivery dates are also pushed back by a few days in the U.K., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and other countries. It’s not clear whether Apple’s availability date change is because it plans to reveal only the 15-inch MacBook Pro at WWDC, or if Apple has higher supply of the 13-inch laptops ahead of WWDC. MacBook Lineup WWDC Apple will reportedly add a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel to the new MacBook Pro, which is rumored to be announced at WWDC. The laptop will look like the previous version, with mostly internal changes. Apple is said to be revamping the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The Cupertino company could also update the MacBook Air with a new processor. Read: iPad Pro 2 Launching At WWDC, Expected Features Include Bezel-less display, 10nm processor, Reports Apple has been also reportedly working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro that manages the laptops low-power mode, although it’s not clear whether that feature will be included in the upcoming lineup. The rumored laptop lineup comes after the Touch Bar MacBook Pro’s release last fall. The new computers could help Apple excite fans and compete with Microsoft, which recently introduced the Surface Laptop. What Apple Will Announce At WWDC Besides the MacBook products, Apple could also announce the iPad Pro 2, which is rumored to come with an edge-to-edge display and a new accessory: the Apple Pencil 2. Apple could also announce its Siri speaker, which will compete with Amazon’s Alexa Echo devices and Google Home. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said earlier this month there is an "over 50 percent chance” the device will be revealed at WWDC. Amazon recently launched the Echo Show, which comes with a built-in display, and the Echo Look. It is unclear whether Apple’s Siri gadget will come with a screen. Apple could also announce updates to macOS, tvOS, watchOS and Apple Pay. The company could also give the public a glimpse of the upcoming iOS 11 update for iPads and iPhones, which is expected to launch in September alongside the much-anticipated iPhone 8.   Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

No significant features or notable bug fixes were found in the first macOS Sierra 10.12.6 beta, and because Apple does not provide beta release notes, we may not know what’s included in the update until it sees a public release. macOS Sierra 10.12.6 is likely to be one of the final updates to the Sierra operating system as Apple transitions to macOS 10.13, which will be introduced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Update: Apple has also seeded a second macOS Sierra 10.12.6 public beta for its public beta testers.

Apple only provides watchOS betas to developers because there's no way to downgrade software on an Apple Watch. Non-developers will need to wait for the public release to get the update. No notable features or bug fixes were discovered in the first beta of watchOS 3.2.3, suggesting the update focuses primarily on under-the-hood improvements. watchOS 3.2.3 is likely to be one of the last updates to the watchOS 3 operating system, as Apple is expected to introduce a new version of watchOS at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.

Whenever I read these stories about new betas for the OS, I must admit my first thought is always "okay, just don't screw up the battery life". :D Rating: 6 Votes Thai 5 days ago at 11:00 am Ugh, again?! Then opt out of Beta program! I don't get people sometimes...signed up for beta and then moan about getting updates! Rating: 5 Votes Thai 5 days ago at 01:24 pm Perhaps I should have been clearer. My issue is not with improvements or beta releases. My objection is to MacRumors once again pointlessly bulking out their article with the meaningless phrase "under-the-hood improvements", when what they mean is "improvements". After I last offered this observation, the phrase was thankfully notable by its absence from some subsequent articles. It is now back again. Hence "ugh". But who cares?! Would you prefer them not making any announcements? When such articles come up (and, like you, especially if i know what it will say), then i just scan quickly the article and go to download the update. I also read the comments just in case it is a bad update. Rating: 2 Votes rturner2 5 days ago at 03:50 pm Multiple playlists synced to the watch?!

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Technology News Android creator unveils new phone, home assistant device Shares0 Tue, 30 May 2017-11:34pm , Reuters The price pits it against high-end smartphones including Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S8. Andy Rubin, the co-creator of the Android mobile phone operating system, has launched a new company called Essential Products to sell a high-end smartphone and a home assistant device. Palo Alto-based Essential said the new Essential Phone features an edge-to-edge screen, a titanium-and-ceramic case and dual cameras. The phone sells for $699 and will run the Android operating system. The price pits it against high-end smartphones including Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S8. Essential also launched a household assistant called Home that looks like an angled hockey puck with a screen. The device will compete against the Amazon.com Echo and Alphabet's Google Home speaker, which are powered by the Alexa and the Google Assistant voice services respectively. Essential confirmed the Home device will let the user choose between Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri. It was not immediately clear how Siri would be available on Essential. While Amazon and Google have released the software needed to embed their assistants on devices they do not make, Apple has not done so. Essential declined to elaborate on how it plans to embed Siri on the device, and Apple declined to comment. The Essential Home takes a page from Apple's privacy play book. Like an iPhone, the Home will do much of the processing for voice and image recognition on the device itself rather than sending data to remote servers. Essential also said the Home device will communicate with home appliances like lights and thermostats directly over the home network, rather than sending data to remote servers. Apple's HomeKit system takes similar approach. Rubin, Essential's CEO, co-founded Android and sold it to Google in 2005. He ran Google's mobile efforts until 2013 before a brief stint running the firm's robotics division. He left Google in 2014 to focus on starting hardware companies. Investors in Essential include Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings, iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn , Redpoint Ventures and Altimeter Capital. Essential plans to announce a ship date for the devices in the next few weeks. The company did not say whether it planned to sell the phone directly to customers online or in physical stores. Essential for the first time revealed its staff on its website, listing Wolfgang Muller as head of channel sales. Muller previously ran North American retail operations for phone maker HTC, according to his LinkedIn profile, suggesting that Essential plans to sell phones through retail stores, carriers or both.

News & Analysis Apple, Intel Attack Rivals SoC hire, new CPUs hit Qcomm, AMD Rick Merritt 5/30/2017 02:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple and Intel got an edge on rivals in separate moves that came to light Tuesday (May 30), showing heated competition in semiconductors. Apple hired a top Qualcomm engineering manager expected to lead its SoC efforts while Intel announced a new high-end PC processor family, leapfrogging renewed competition from Advanced Micro Devices. Apple hired Esin Terzioglu, a vice president of engineering who led the central engineering group at Qualcomm’s semiconductor division for the last eight years. For its part, Intel announced its Core i9 Extreme Edition family, including an 18 core, 36 thread chip that leapfrogs AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper, a 16 core, 32 thread chip announced in mid-May. Terzioglu announced his move in a LinkedIn post made public in a tweet by Neil Shah, an analyst for Counterpoint Research. Terzioglu has not updated his LinkedIn page to provide his new title at Apple, but given his experience observers expect he will lead Apple’s semiconductor efforts, perhaps launching a foray into creating the company’s own baseband processor. The move comes at a time when Apple is locked in a major legal battle with Qualcomm over as much as $2 billion in annual royalties it charges for its cellular communications patents. Last year, Apple started using baseband chips from Intel. Apple filed suit against Qualcomm in January, claiming that Qualcomm’s royalties were exorbitant and the chip vendor pressured it to remain silent. In a countersuit filed in April , Qualcomm said that it paid Apple to refrain from asserting patents and revealed that it got royalty payments for iPhones and iPads through Apple’s contract manufacturers including Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron. Before joining Qualcomm, Terzioglu was CTO and CFO of startup Novelics, acquired by Mentor Graphics. Previously he served six years as a principal scientist in the office of the CTO at Broadcom. He holds a doctorate and masters in electrical engineering from Stanford. “It does seem Apple increasingly wants to design almost everything in the iPhone,” said Mike Demler, an analyst with the Linley Group. “If you look at its patent filings its obvious Apple has been doing a lot of work in baseband radios for the past few years and they might even try to design their whole RF signal chain,” he said. In addition, Apple recently informed Imagination Technologies it intends to design its own mobile GPUs.

Around AOTF × News Reviews Articles Videos Guides Rumors Platforms Xbox PlayStation PC/MAC Nintendo Mobile More Contact Us Ethics Privacy Attack of the Fanboy News WSJ: Apple Could Mean Trouble for Nintendo Switch Production Share Tweet by Jose Belmonte | @JoseBelmonte | on May 30, 2017 Nintendo has recently commented that it’s trying solve the current supply shortage of Nintendo Switch by increasing its production, in order to achieve 20 million consoles manufactured in the fiscal year ending March 2018. However, The Wall Street Journal reports in a new article that the Japanese company could find some fierce competition from Apple and other internet-based companies for the components necessary to build the hybrid console. The massive production of smartphones, flash memories, and other electronic devices has made component makers feel overwhelmed by the demand of NAND flash-memory chips that store data, liquid-crystal displays, and the motors that make the new HD rumble work. A spokeswoman at Toshiba says: “Demand for our NAND flash memory has been overwhelmingly greater than supply, and the situation is likely to stay for the rest of this year.” She also cited Apple and other Chinese companies as the ones making the bigger demand for their components. Apple is currently developing its 10th anniversary iPhone set to release in September, while data centers need flash memories to keep up with the growth of the digital market. According to the Wall Street Journal, the problem comes when both groups are in a better position than Nintendo to make a deal with manufacturers. Apple and other smartphone designers usually make bigger and more lucrative orders, while the data centers are willing to pay more for the latest technology in flash memory. Paying more for the components doesn’t seem like a good solution for Nintendo either, since that would make the price of the console to rise beyond the current $299 retail price. However, Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima has spoken publicly about his will to avoid selling the console at a loss. Nintendo Switch is officially estimated to sell 10 million consoles in the current fiscal year. We will see if the company manages to increase the production and beat its expectations.

Right now Apple’s online store is showing the laptop as shipping no earlier than June 5, which is the first day of the event. Shipping delays may mean new Touch Bar MacBook Pro models coming at WWDC WWDC is Apple’s annual event where Mac, iOS, Apple Watch, and Apple TV developers meet with the company’s own engineers and learn more about coding for the platforms. Apple kicks off the multi-day conference with a keynote presentation showing off features from the next OS releases, and occasionally uses the event to unveil new hardware, too. Rumors have been saying Apple will refresh the Touch Bar MacBook Pro at WWDC. The new model is expected to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chipset and support more than 16 GB RAM. The Touch Bar models were introduced in October 2016, so this will be a faster than usual refresh cycle. Other rumors claim Apple will introduce its Siri-based countertop voice assistant appliance to compete with Amazon’s Echo. A brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, along with updates for the MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook are reportedly coming, too. That’s a lot to introduce, especially since Apple also needs time to show off macOS 10.13, iOS 11, watchOS 4, and tvOS 11. Either Apple isn’t introducing all of the rumored hardware products, or Monday’s keynote will be really long. The Mac Observer will be on location in San Jose for this year’s WWDC and the keynote event. Be sure to stick around for our keynote and conference coverage throughout the week.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « While IDC sees little to no Growth for iPhones over the Next Five Years, they may be missing the obvious | Main | AMD Introduces Threadripper at Computex » May 30, 2017 Andy Rubin's 'Phone' was Unveiled today and he'll be talking about it Tonight with Mossberg at the Code Conference     In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "A Next-Gen Smartphone Designed by Ex-Apple and Google Engineers will Launch Later this Year." Our report covered Foxconn's investment in Essential Products Inc., as well as the trademark and patent filings by Essential.   The new smartphone by Essential was rumored to be launching on May 30 and indeed it has in the form of officially unveiling it. The new smartphone called the "Phone" will launch later this summer for US$700.   Andy Rubin, the man behind the new smartphone and creator of Android, will be interviewed by Mossberg tonight at the Code conference at 6 p.m. PT to talk-up the new smartphone. You could watch it live tonight as noted below.     Essential Phone has an impressive screen which extends almost to the bottom of the phone where it does meet a thin bezel. The display oddly wraps around their selfie cam which sits at top-center of the phone. There are two camera lenses on the back, a 13-megapixel color lens and a second monochrome lens and they're flush with the back panel, something I wish Apple could reproduce.   The display measures 5.7 inches and has a 2560 x 1312 pixel resolution, with a 19:10 aspect ratio which differs from both the Samsung S8 and LG G6 smartphones which provide an 18:9 aspect ratio. The 'Phone' uses a Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM powers the device, and 128GB internal storage is on hand for media.   The 'Phone' offers a backside fingerprint sensor that looks like the iPhone 8's back side images that we've seen to date. The 'Phone's is made of titanium and ceramic material, something that Apple has recently shown an interest in, according to a recent patent filing..   The power button and volume controls are on the right hand side of the new Essential 'Phone which also uses a 3040mAh battery with fast-charging keeping the phone powered up. Other specifications include Bluetooth 5.0, a USB Type-C port, and a wide range of international 4G LTE band support.   World's smallest 360-Degree Camera Accessory   One of the cool accessories for the Essential 'Phone' is their inexpensive 360-Degree camera as noted below. It's something you'd think Apple would have done. While we'll have to wait for a review of this new accessory for the 'Phone' – on the surface it's a great idea to bring to market.   The camera reportedly attaches to the back side of the 'Phone' using magnets. The camera has two 12-megapixel lenses that can shoot 4K resolution, 30fps video and four microphones capture sound in 3D. Support for live streaming will be included, too.   The camera, if ordered with the phone only costs $50 but $200 if purchased separately. If it really works, that's a sweet deal for a 360-Degree camera for the phone. Then again, it's awfully bulky (see photo below) and not as slick as they make it out to be in the previous photo above.   Essential also got their message out before Apple's WWDC that they'll offer another accessory called the 'Essential Home' which is a speaker with a voice assistant for the home that offers a round display on the top surface.   In a Wired article today, Jason Keats, the company's head of product architecture said that if Essential took off and sells 50 million units in its first quarter on the market that they'd be totally screwed. Essential simply cannot produce that many phones. That's the point. Keats added that "We've gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren't designed to support 50 million devices." Keaton wants Essential to think like a high-end watchmaker, not a commodity gadget builder.   The Wired article provides those that are interested in Essential Products with a little company background and overview.   One More Thing   Another product that will launch later this summer is the company's Phone dock as illustrated below. Their new dock Features a pair of magnetic pins on the back of the device, this so-called Click cordless connector will hook up to Essential's 360-degree camera and its Essential Phone Dock (pictured below). The same magnetic connector used for the phone is used in securing the 'Phone' to the new dock.   The concept sound like the smart connectivity idea that was rumored for the iPhone 8 as noted below.   Of course we're months away from a head to toe review of the new Essential 'Phone' but in the end it's just another Android Phone yet one that could hurt Samsung, LG and others in the U.S. market. Between Google's Pixel phone and now the Essential 'Phone' it's bound to hurt foreign Android brands. One thing for sure, it's not going to ding the iPhone in any way, so we can cheer on Rubin's new phone if it weakens Samsung, the company that most Apple fans despise.   Lastly, if you have the time, remember to tune into the Mossberg interview tonight either on our site or on YouTube that may reveal another twist or two about the 'Phone' or other plans that Essential Products may have up their sleeve.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Posted:05/30/17 By:Benzinga Comments(1) | Add a comment Research  these Stocks on Kapitall’s Playground Now   research now by: Brett Hershman, Benzinga Staff Writer   Maybe the Occupy Wall Street movement was looking to the wrong coast all along. A recent Bank of America Corp BAC/Merrill Lynch report titled "Occupy Silicon Valley" shows that tech firms Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL valuations are higher than the GDP of every U.S. city besides Los Angeles and New York, and Apple is quickly gaining on L.A. While these figures do not mean these companies are actually worth more than those cities, it does present a relevant conversation about the sheer size and influence these firms have. Apple and Google essentially operate as their own countries, with massive power; their decisions have huge implications on the market and how citizens operate, communicate and conduct daily lives. Here at Benzinga, we wanted to take it a step further and see how these two tech giants stack up against countries worldwide, comparing Market Cap against GDP.     Apple And Google Vs. The World (Figures In Millions) Apple’s market cap is current just north of $796 billion, which would put it as the 17th most valuable country in the world, just ahead of the Netherlands, when compared to current World Bank data on global GDP. Google would rank as the 19th most valuable country in the world, ahead of international finance hub Switzerland, at a $672 billion valuation. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN would rank as the 25th biggest country in the world, just behind Poland, with a $467 billion market cap. While these are not apples-to-apples comparisons, it is the best way to gauge the sheer size the tech industry has amassed in the United States. With the presidency now hosting non-traditional and political amateur Donald Trump in the Oval Office, maybe Tim Cook — with his breadth of experience, financial prowess and general popularity — will capitalize and run for president in 2020.   © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Registered developers can download the update by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software using iTunes. Due to the installation requirements, tvOS betas are only available for developers, so tvOS 10.2.2 will not be publicly available until the final version of the software is released. No major feature changes or bug fixes were discovered in the first beta of tvOS 10.2.2, and it appears to focus on minor under-the-hood improvements. tvOS 10 will soon be followed by a new version of tvOS, which Apple is expected to introduce at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5.

Right now even though Netflix and Hulu have individually user accounts. All the stuff my kids watch gets jumbled into the TV app. Annoying. One iTunes account. 1 app authentication. Multiple watch lists. Unless I am misunderstanding, I agree with you. Although, I think there are other things that having multiple user profiles could help, one being there should be a way to toggle multiple Game Center accounts without having to logout of one. Interesting. It's hard to draw the line as to what is user vs device specific. I agree. I know that a lot of people would like a multiple user accounts on a particular device, similar to working on a Mac, and maybe I would like that too, but I think it wouldn't be needed on a device like the ATV.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation WKRP in DC: Live Turkeys Fire Bombing the Economy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter WKRP in DC: Live Turkeys Fire Bombing the Economy Posted at 11:41 am on May 30, 2017 by Seton Motley Share on Facebook Share on Twitter “WKRP in Cincinnati” is a fantastic legacy television show – about a 1970s rock-and-roll radio station. And perhaps its most famous episode – is “Turkeys Away.” (God bless the Internet – here is a thirty-second clipped summary thereof.) WKRP general manager Arthur Carlson decides as a Thanksgiving promotion to drop live turkeys from a helicopter on a strip mall. Because he is somehow unaware that these particular fowl – are flightless. So basically he – as disc jockey Johnny Fever described it – “firebombed with live turkeys” the mall and everyone there. Newsman Les Nessman returns from the debacle – and describes what subsequently happened: “Then Mr. Carlson had the helicopter land in the middle of the parking lot. I guess he thought he could save the day by turning the rest of the turkeys loose. It gets pretty strange after that….I really don’t know how to describe it. It was like the turkeys mounted a counter-attack. It was almost as if they were… organized.” In Washington, D.C. – the Turkeys are most certainly organized. And have been for s VERY long time. And the American free market economy – is under constant arial assault therefrom. You’re a DC Turkey – if you can’t get by without government. Or can – but don’t want to, because it’s just easier to have government place its giant thumb on your side of the scale. And many such corporate Turkeys – are willing to bribe the government Turkeys to get them to apply the digit. Behold – Cronyism. Add up the elected officials, the bureaucrats and the very many Cronies – and DC is one giant Turkey coop. And a $4-trillion-a-year federal government budget – funds a LOT of bird feed. We’ve certainly seen much evidence of DC Turkey-Crony Organization since the presidential election of Donald Trump. Trump pledged to “Drain the Swamp” – i.e. Empty the Coop – and ever since the Birds have been striking back. And Les Nessman thought what he saw was horrific. It’s like a terrible, very boring remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s flick. But this nonsense way predates November. We just barely escaped from eight years of the pronounced Turkey-Crony Organization of the Barack Obama Administration. Obama, Inc. spent the entirety of its existence – on the auction block to the highest Leftist bidders. This was the Google Administration. This administration was a Pez Dispenser of awful, crony, anti-capitalism government actions – all to benefit their Crony Turkeys. Trending Is Steve Bannon the White House Leaker? streiff One of the other biggest Turkey-Crony beneficiaries – was Apple. You know, that tiny little $800 billion company – that really needs as much government assistance as they can muster. (Note: that was sarcasm.) A couple of years ago, Apple declared war on Qualcomm – and enlisted the Obama Administration to aid in the assault. Qualcomm had the audacity to invent the fundamental components of what makes an iPhone an iPhone – and then charge Apple to use them. To which Apple strenuously objects. Without Qualcomm’s inventions, Apple’s iPhone – is just a very shiny, very skinny telephone. No Internet connection. No email. No apps. No videos. None of any and everything that makes the iPhone – worth the at least $750 per Apple charges us. For making that $750 minimum charge possible, Qualcomm charges Apple…less than $20 per phone. Get that? For all of the essential intelligent guts combined – Qualcomm charges Apple less than 3% of what Apple charges us. Apple charges us that much – for one USB power adaptor. And Apple doesn’t want to pay even that. Even though they signed contracts – agreeing to pay that. So now Apple has sued Qualcomm. And has unilaterally, preemptively declared that they won’t pay Qualcomm the tiny fraction of what they charge us. They’ll keep making the iPhones. They’ll keep charging us nearly $1,000 per for them. They just won’t pay Qualcomm for making the whole process possible. And all along the way – the Obama Administration Turkeys were helping Apple destroy the next generation of all things iPhone. And by extension – all things economy. And on their way out the door – they took two even worse, more damaging steps. Obama Administration Antitrust Enforcers Take Last-Minute IP Licensing Actions: “(A) lawsuit brought by the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) against Qualcomm, reveals the views of at least the Obama Administration’s FTC about the licensing of standard-essential patents (SEPs)….IP (Intellectual Property) owners should be aware of the limits – revealed in these two recent actions and other enforcement activities – that antitrust law can place on IP licensing.” Please forgive this site’s legalese. It’s a law firm. Translation: This is a bunch of Obama Turkeys using government – to aid Crony Turkey Apple. By suing Qualcomm – just like Apple. Because too many lawyers – is never enough. But “two recent actions” were cited. The second – is worse still: “The DOJ (Department of Justice) and FTC on Jan. 13, 2017 released the new Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property, updating the Guidelines’ original version issued by the agencies in 1995. The Guidelines articulate general enforcement policies of the agencies with respect to the licensing of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how “’to assist those who need to predict whether the [a]gencies will challenge a practice as anticompetitive.’” Again, the legalese. What these Obama changes do – is declare a brand new government war on IP. Via antitrust law. Which is a novel, totally terrible idea. Here – and all over the rest of the global market planet. We will explore the entirety of that international awfulness at a slightly later date. The point to be made now is this: If Qualcomm – if anyone who invents anything – can’t get paid for their inventions today, there won’t be any inventions tomorrow. At all. Anymore. Ever. Because the money for invention – will have been government-ed away. So the incentive to invent – will also have been government-ed away. Because humans are humans – and humans generally do not like to work for free. So we’ll very quickly end up looking like Cuba (because today’s technology ages so much more rapidly). Using ancient things that were once really cool – but that are now barely functional, and held together with chewing gum and baling wire. The key component of the Information Economy – is the information. If gigantic governments team with gigantic companies to end payment to the Information creators – the creators stop creating, and the entire economy collapses. These Turkeys firebombing the marketplace – will very quickly destroy the marketplace. That’s an inconceivably shortsighted way for $800-billion-Apple – to try to save $20. To paraphrase WKRP’s Arthur Carlson: “As God as my witness – I knew these Turkeys couldn’t fly.” Apple certainly should. So should we all.

Naturally, I assumed that the battery might be going bad. After checking the battery cycle count, I learned that I was probably wrong about the battery being bad, as the cycle count was still well within the normal life span of my MacBook. Here’s how I was able to verify that everything was okay with my MacBook’s battery. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? How to check your MacBook battery’s cycle count Step 1: Hold the Option (⌥) key and click the Apple () logo in the upper left-hand corner. Step 2: Click System Information. Step 3: Under Hardware on the left side of the System Information page, click Power. Step 4: Under the Battery Information header, find Health Information and check the Cycle Count. As you can see from the screenshot below, my battery cycle count is resting at 466. How to verify if your MacBook’s battery is still within its normal lifespan Under Cycle Count below the Health Information section, you should see a Condition section. There, you can learn the current condition of your MacBook’s battery. In the screenshot above, you’ll see that my battery’s current condition is normal. More importantly, you’ll want to visit Apple’s support document regarding battery life and battery cycle counts. It is here that you can learn about the actual battery count cycle figures that allow you to determine if your battery is still good. For instance, my Late 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina Display can go 1,000 battery cycles before it is deemed to be consumed. Even then, it might still be possible to use the MacBook like normal, you’ll just need to expect degraded battery performance. I’m pretty impressed that my MacBook’s battery can last 1,000 cycles. That might not seem like a lot on paper, but I’ve had this MacBook for several years, and I feel like I’ve charged it a million times. Still, this particular unit is sitting at only 466 cycles, which is less than half of the maximum life expectancy of its battery. How battery cycle counts are determined A battery cycle is the time it takes for a battery to go from 100% to 0%. That process could span multiple days. The important thing to keep in mind is that a battery cycle happens when you use all of the battery’s power. As Apple explains, it could span multiple days before a battery cycle elapses. This is why you may have powered and charged your MacBook a thousand times, while your MacBook’s battery only has a few hundred cycles to its name. If it turns out that your MacBook’s battery cycle count is past its maximum capacity, then a quick appointment with the Genius bar at the Apple Store can get you a replacement battery if necessary. And if you’re having battery issues but not at the max cycle count, you might be able to get the problem diagnosed and fixed under warranty.

Mr. T (@t87) - 1 year ago Reply Not really, since that basically means you are keeping your MacBook on charge (plugged in) too often. This is bad for the Li-ion battery because the electrons in it need to move more frequently. Ryan Coleman - 1 year ago Also not really because the computers have amazingly intelligent charging circuits and that’s not a major concern anymore. applegetridofsimandjack - 1 year ago Reply I checked that a month ago and it was at 1423 for a 4.5 year old 17 inch Macbook Pro. Battery lasts 4 hours on normal usage, 1.5 hours with heavy usage such. Jim Becker - 1 year ago Reply I believe it only counts full cycles which doesn’t tell the whole story. There are lots of apps which will give you more information including battery capacity which is much more diagnostic than cycles. Also, it’s pretty easy to replace your battery yourself. I did it for my MacBook Air and believe me I am no technical whiz kid. Jim tonywmd23 - 1 year ago Reply My 3-year-old retina pro 15″ counts in at 130 cycles.. It’s unbelievable regarding how intensely I use it! I practically use it plugged in all the time though. Compared to my last laptop, which was a SONY Vaio with an almost completely dead battery after 2-3 years, I’d say kudos Macintosh. applegetridofsimandjack - 1 year ago Reply I had a Vaio from 2009 to 2011 and in 2011 the battery lasted for 25mins. tops. I swear this is true. Just ridiculous. Joe Smithee - 6 days ago My favorite old Vaio was so worn out the battery would not last long enough for the machine to boot it. Chase - 1 year ago Reply you can also download battery monitor to easily access the various battery information. Christopher Armenia - 1 year ago Reply I use an app called Coconut Battery. It pulls all that data and shows % of design capacity the battery is still charging up to. You can also plug iOS devices in and run the same report on those devices and save all the tests in history to track them over time. francoborgo - 1 year ago Reply from https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204054 If the cycle count on a battery exceeds its expected limit, the battery is considered consumed. and from http://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/ Your battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 1000 complete charge cycles. so after 1000 cycle on MacBook, the battery is considered consumed but still hold 80% of it’s original capacity Doug Aalseth - 1 year ago Reply 923 cycles on my 2012 MacBook Pro. Still working fine. Of course I’ve always made a point to not leave it plugged in all the time. I charge it, use it down to less than 10% and then charge it. I still get ~3-3.5 hours per charge. Howie Isaacks - 1 year ago Reply Have you guys ever thought about taking a can of compressed air and blowing out the dust and particles before taking a photo of the innards of a Mac? Good post though. Ilko Sarafski - 1 year ago Reply What if we don’t have Apple Store within 500km or so? (And it’s not even in our country) As others noted, there are many 3rd party apps that show much more. This article sounds more like for someone who is not a tech savvy or whatever. But anyway! P.s. Cycles don’t mean shit usually! shareef777 - 1 year ago Reply I call BS on the 1000 cycle count. I’m at 750 cycles on my 2012 rMBP and don’t get 50% the time I used to be able to get when the machine was new. pdixon1986 - 1 year ago Reply That’s not useful — you also need to maintain a healthy battery which means periodically going through a cycle to ‘exercise’ the battery – otherwise it will lose efficiency regardless of the count and status. Matthew Fox - 1 year ago Reply Diagnosing at the Apple Store is always free. It’s just the service that needs a warranty or AppleCare to be free! Oh my rmbp I got a p004 error on Apple diagnostics but it passes on OS X and their official genus bar test The article should of mentioned you shouid also run Apple hardware test , with the power adapter plugged in to check the battery condition Matthew Fox - 1 year ago Reply There are sometimes where OS X won’t detect a battey error and sometimes where hardware test will detect an error. Anthony Forchielli - 1 year ago Reply 897 cycles and it says needs service. I guess i have to look into how much this costs. i have a mid 2012 rMBP 15″ that i use pretty non stop. The computer won’t wake if the battery is under 30 percent. still get okay life out of it, but i’m betting i’m just used to it. darwiniandude - 1 year ago Reply These machines are fast. They can drain the battery super quick under load, even when new. The secret to long battery life is allowing more idle (or close to idle) time. Do not use Chrome. Use Safari. Normally a couple of extra hours there. But check other apps too, activity monitor, energy or CPU tabs. darwiniandude - 1 year ago Reply Eg on the Retina MacBook, 3.5 hours more battery when using Safari over Chrome http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/10/8381447/chrome-macbook-battery-life modeyabsolom - 1 year ago Reply I’ve had my 13″ rMBP since late 2013 and I’ve only used 25 cycles. Which actually seems a lot to me because apart from a handful of times (and that’s pushing it!) I’ve never use my laptop on battery power, its always plugged into the mains…oh yes there was that time I took it abroad for a couple of weeks and a few others when I’m out of the house for a few days and hide it away…but then its turned off. Liam Deckham - 1 year ago Reply Great article! For whatever reason, I always plug in my MB Pro 2014 – so my cycle count is 2 – Wonder if that is a good thing? mytawalbeh - 1 year ago Reply For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. Liam Deckham - 1 year ago @mytawalbeh – Thank you! Frank Levy - 1 year ago Reply I learned a useful point from the Genius Bar: My 2013 Macbook Air was rapidly loosing charge (despite a battery in good condition) because my large Dropbox folder was constantly syncing and the syncing was drawing a large amount of power. To preserve operating time, sync the Dropbox periodically, leaving sync off the rest of the time. davmendmar - 1 year ago Reply My MacBook Pro is supposed to be able to undergo 1000 battery cycles but it’s been asking for a battery repair at least since it arrived 300 cycles. It’s currently sitting at 550 cycles and has 60% of its design capacity. Still an impressive battery life for a 2010 laptop, being able to easily resist 4 hours of light use on a single charge when most computers of the time weren’t able to survive for 3 hours when new, but far from the 1000 cycles promise I read when I bought it. And I know I’m not the only one. Nowadays it may be better, but I don’t know a single person who bought a MacBook Pro like mine whose battery resisted the 1000 cycle mark. pankaj garg (@gargpankaj) - 1 year ago Reply My Experience with “Genus” Bar: Our “genius” takes 3 days to replace the battery. All your data may get lost in the process so please take the backup. Went to http://www.theapplerepairs.in/, they replace with original parts (which even apple store doesnt – read more about it on their site) and handed the air back to me in under 10 mins. Its idiot bar i think.. Rick Park (@rickpark000) - 11 months ago Reply If my battery count is 18, does that mean its good? Is it the lower the better or the higher the better? Someone please explain. Jillian Liu - 4 months ago Reply I am wondering whether it’s possible for the charge cycle count to be wrong. I had my Macbook Pro battery replaced by a local laptop repair company, and upon return the charge cycle on the “new” battery is 164! Now, I realize that I made a bad move, because this particular repair shop is not Apple Certified, but I have a sinking suspicion that I’ve been duped. Any advice?

The class-action lawsuit was filed by Kentucky-based law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason on behalf of plaintiffs Zachary Book, Donald Cowart, and John Manners, a trio of individuals that accuse Apple of failing to rectify the graphical issues that have affected both 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models released in 2011. The lawsuit covers California and Florida residents that purchased an affected MacBook Pro model between approximately February 2011 and May 2012. According to court documents, the issue stems from a defective AMD GPU that did not function correctly because of lead-free soldering that caused short circuiting among other problems. MacBook Pro models that were affected by this problem would often have visual banding or malfunctions on the screen, especially when users were performing highly intensive tasks like watching high-resolution videos or using multimedia programs like the Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro and similar software. Apple did offer a free video card replacement on some mid-2011 iMacs exhibiting similar symptoms, though the cards in the MacBook Pro are different, and recalls as a whole are rare. The most recent was in August, when Apple offered free battery replacements for some iPhone 5 models that were deemed to have defective batteries. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has failed to reimburse customers that were forced to pay for out-of-warranty repairs that could cost between $350 to $600 to fix the GPU issues. The legal filing also accuses Apple of largely ignoring customers that have complained, even those that attempted to reach out directly to CEO Tim Cook. Apple has yet to comment on this lawsuit and, given that it generally remains tight lipped on matters such as these, it might not ever provide any official word regarding the case. Nevertheless, we’ve reached out to Apple for comment and we will update this post if we hear anything back. Whitfield Bryson & Mason is examining this issue further and there is a possibility that legal action could extend beyond the jurisdictions of California and Florida.

When my Macbook first died of premature death, roughly a month before the end of my extended AppleCare. Luckily, Apple Repaired it, but it died again, of exactly the same problem, about 3 weeks ago. What caused me to wonder at first was the fact that all my other Macbooks before that one have lasted more than 5 years, and in fact, that’s why I used to be happy to pay a premium to buy Apple gear. Although, I feel it might not be worth it anymore. And then, just last week, one of my friend also lost a similar macbook from exactly the same problem. And since, like me, he’s now out of waranty, we both had to buy new computers. How can we get in this class action ? Can we do so, even if we live in Canada?

I really need your advises about what should i do now? will it happen again? can i live with that? like it happens times to times but wont destroy my macbook? what if i install mavericks again? i’m scared i don’t want to lose my macbook and i don’t have access to any AppleStore cause i live in IRAN-tehran now. Please kindly guid me if anyone know about this. thank you Arman Safaei email : thefinag @ gmail .com Roni Aharon - 2 years ago Reply Unbelievable, I had no idea, it cost me $534 to fix my macbook and downtime of one week. Now after repairing it in August I have similar issue since I switched to Yosemite. I was sure my Mac graphic card failed gain. Victor DeejayRid Gutierrez - 2 years ago Reply I have that same problem and it started when my Macbook automatically updated from 10.9.2 to 10.9.5. Omg my Macbook was working flawlessly before that update. Now I have to turn off automatic graphic switching as a temporary fix but just recently even with that my screen will turn black and freeze and restart. Sometimes it completely shutsdown. And it overheats so much that it is unbearable. I can’t wait until we get all the needed signatures. I hope we win this case because this is not fair that we receive a product that doesn’t function as advertised or “fails” as soon as the 3 year applecare runs out. Victor DeejayRid Gutierrez - 2 years ago Reply A temporary fix for this problem is going to the top left corner and clicking on the Apple sign, click on System Preferences. Then click on Energy Saver. Then uncheck the option for Automatic Graphic Switching. Basically the major issue has been when switching from the on board graphics card to the Nvida Graphics card. Doing this will use your Nvidia card full time but it will over heat your Macbook and that is the down side at least when you are on photoshop or something graphic intensive. Even watching Youtube makes it get hot. Anyways, I hope this helps and I hope you can get some work done with this temporary fix. Denise Joyce - 2 years ago Reply If i do this ..it will only be worse i assume my nvidia card on my late 2011 17inch MBP is bad……what shall i do? carriet22 - 2 years ago Reply Hey guys-this is long so let me sum: TALK TO THE MANAGER AND MENTION THIS SUIT. I did and they fixed my graphic card for FREE. I had the issue pictured above happen yesterday- i had just loaded and started using final draft- doing some light editing. i got a skype call and BAM bars everywhere… it was a mess. it worked haltingly after i restarted it, then wouldn’t start up at all. I took it in today and they said 500$ to fix on site, 350$ and several days wait to ship it out. i had a think. went on my cell and searched about the graphics card (that’s what they told me was the problem after about 2 seconds) and i found this lawsuit. i went back in and spoke to the manager. i was complaing also that i had to replace the top case, the hard drive, AND the battery in the 3 years i had the thing and now this? i was like seriously, forget this. go get me the print out on all my repairs. i know about this class action lawsuit, i know that mac is at fault, so if you want to feel happy about selling me a piece of garbage i have to make a major repair on every 8 months, then thank you very much. the manager went into the back for a long time and came back without my paperwork, and without the number he said i should call about the lawsuit… and tried to make some sort of deal. dude seemed very unhappy when i mentioned this case- APPLE MUST KNOW THEY ARE TO BLAME because i played hardball with the guy and they are FIXING MY LAPTOP FOR FREE. ahaha. that’s right. i got those evil trolls who never want to help to pay my 320$ (as it turned out) bill. don’t worry if you’ve already payed… i’m sure the company is paying you back one way or another. i am SO unhappy with my mac and iphone… maybe it was bad luck but i’m running away from apple. PS if anyone knows a better smallish machine for editing that isn’t 2000 bucks let me know! Aaron Vorbau - 2 years ago Reply what store did you go to?

I have follow all steps in next page for send my information to apple….http://www.mbp2011.com I recommend, every people do the same…. maybe in next year… one replacemente program start. One thing i m sure… this is a problem on 2011 MBP models… but is a born problem about GPU… if you fix that… the problem will occur again… in next week, month or year. If some people not have the problem jet, i m sure… they are lucky for now… but take care about this situation… because they GPU in some moment, when they give hard work on display graphics… the problem start, without any software fix…. is about hardware! Tessy Fuller - 2 years ago Reply Yep, SAME ISSUE. Probably would of happened earlier then it did but I reformatted my hard drive and reset PRAM and it bought me a bit of a time. Looks like a logic board is just a temporary fix. Go support the lawsuit, sign the petition, report your problems to apple. http://mbp2011.org/ latin4everyone - 2 years ago Reply Yep.

I live in Brussels and I paid over 600 euro for fixing the problem in October 2014. It just came back again. It will be my last Apple product if they don’t solve it. Enue COD (@bongggblue) - 2 years ago Reply Dealing with this now. Graphical glitches then eventually the computer won’t boot. Just had a crash after playing a youtube video. In the 2 months, it has happened twice. Just spent this weekend dealing with this headache. Søren Ellemann Hansen - 2 years ago Reply A rotten apple. After updating 2011 late 17″ with Intel HD Graphics 3000 macbook pro to os 10.10 seams to act up and kernel errors flying left and right. A quick shift all the way back to lion saved it for a while. But it looks like the error is a hardware issue by whats written. Not software. So my next computer would not be a mac in the near future since they seam to ignore, there costumers. I guess this computer together with a lot others will be repaired by apple. Sold on 2 hand and we will move on from this lemon of a fruit company. Monica Krausse - 2 years ago Reply Yes. First in October 2014 — I didn’t have AppleCare, so the Apple Store replaced the logic board for a price. The new board failed in November and was replaced for free, since it was still under their three-month warranty. I’m still waiting to see how long the third board holds out. jjohart - 2 years ago Reply Yes, I had periods that the screen would freeze, appear like zebra stripe bands and or weird color striping (sometimes it almost looked like a US flag)! It seemed to occur if I had several programs open when I attempted to ‘switch users’. I made several calls to Apple support and they were tight and counter-accustory, particularly as I made the way up the chain of support “command”. They started by complaining I had programs from as old as eight or nine years (transferred by apple store/data transfer when I migrated stuff from the ol’ Powerbook G4… They also started inisting I send my entire OS to an external drive, and kept harping on me for the fact it didn’t happen all the time. They were particularly snooty when I started making noise about how they should replace the computer. Absolute human firewalls against that issue! I finally worked around it by changing the “automatic” switching from high intensity graphics to just the continual high intensity. Even though it said it might use more “power”, I have rarely had freeze ups since, so I guess I was lucky. Thing is, mine is the 17″, and I’ve had failed logic boards from a2008 Macbook..for whatever reason. I can’t tell if these machines are any better these days, but it really annoys me there’s no mirroring available on an early 2011, except by 3rd party like AirParrot. richardmak - 2 years ago Reply My MBP has been fine up to the last update, however, like all the others with same issue you can’t ignore the pink lines over a 17″ white screen. I have 10.10.1 installed and a AMD video card; it’s the late 2011 model MBP. Not a happy camper at the moment on how to proceed? I restart and perhaps get a short lived relief, but regardless it always returns. Not ready to drop another $2,700. CA Quintella - 2 years ago Reply I had de issue for the first time more than a year ago. I had to replace my mainboard for $353 at an apple store. Almost a year later the problem returned. The computer just freezes in a gray screen during boot. I will not buy anything Apple until they fix this. It is serious manufacturing problem that put Apple brand at stake. They sell a very expensive laptop because they are supposed to be good quality and long standing. Why should I pay $1999,00 for a $500 hardware only for running OS X?

A 3 year old computer of €2000 shouldn’t crap out randomly and in need of a €500 repair.

My computer has had the Gray Screen Freeze 4 times, and each time they have a new reason why it’s happening. First I paid to replace the Logic Board, then (because all of the following occurred within 90 days of the previous issue, the costs we absorbed by Apple’s “90 days of complimentary support” policy) they said it was a video card error, then a wiring glitch causing the keyboard to be unresponsive, now it’s a gray screen again, and again they said they had to send it to the production factory, who again would disassemble it and re-check everything to find the issue. Nomi Isak Kleinmuntz - 2 years ago Reply I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro (bought in California) that was fine until an Apple “Genius” offered me an upgrade to Yosemite on February 18, 2015. (I was at the Genius Bar to clean up some stuff that was causing a slower performance than usual.) After the Yosemite install I started getting these crazy bars across my display, once a day or so at first, then twice, then a complete freeze to white, unable to start up my computer. Luckily I still have AppleCare (just barely), so my MacBook Pro is in the “hospital” without cost to me for a new video card (or so says Genius #2). Not sure what I’ll do if it happens again after my AppleCare runs out. In the meantime, I’ve lost time and hundreds of dollars of income since my business has come to a crashing halt. (By the way, when I expressed my dismay at having no computer for up to a week, I was told I could pay $500 to join “Joint Ventures” for the year so I could get a “free” loaner. Thanks, Apple, but no thanks!) How do I sign up for the class-action lawsuit? Will report back if problems persist after I get my computer back. Oh, and any feedback on whether I should roll back to Lion OS from Yosemit when I go to get my computer? Dani Barker - 2 years ago Reply Hey everyone, here’s the latest updates on these specific models. Apple is now issuing refunds!! I called and got mine, so if you fit the description, definitely follow up and see if they’ll do the same!! very happy with how Apple took care of it, took some time, but it all worked out in the end. http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ Nomi Isak Kleinmuntz - 2 years ago Thank you, Dani! I actually have AppleCare coverage for another month and a half, so didn’t pay anything . . . this time. Hope it doesn’t happen again, but if it does before the cutoff date, I can rest easy. Glad they’re finally acknowledging the problem. (Would have been nice if someone at the Apple Store had acknowledged it and seen fit to loan me a computer until the repair was done. Instead they wanted me to pay $500 (for the year) for a loaner. Makes a dent in one’s business to lose computer access for a few days!)

Roger Owen Wetherholt - 2 years ago Reply mine has crashed three times the first year!! I’ll never buy another one. Mart Farkinez (@MartFarkinez) - 2 years ago Reply I just got my 15′ early-2011 Mac Book Pro fixed for free by the Apple Store in Cerritos California. I just got it back about an hour ago. They were very helpful. I took it in for run of diagnostic tests 4 days ago, and found out that it was experiencing a video chip issue which qualified the machine for “extended warranty coverage”. I thought it was just a fancy way of taking care of the issue without naming the problem a “recall.” However, I was wrong, Apple not only replaced the logic board, but they also replaced the whole keyboard assembly, the right speaker, the Magsafe charging board, and the Clutch barrel joint, which holds the screen and body together. I guess when Apple decides to extend coverage (even for a specific issue) it qualifies the machine for the same coverage that fully warrantied computers receive. Big thanks to the Cerritos Apple Store for its fine/fast work. Without this coverage, I would not have been able to fix this machine at this time. And maybe I would not have.

DeWayne Christopher Golightly - 2 years ago Reply Yes, I was refunded for my repair earlier this month… the issue persisted and they fixed the computer for free this time around. The consultants that I dealt with on behalf of Apple were pretty rude and spoke to me as if I were an idiot (which I could be in some folks opinions, but I spotted the GPU issue before the “brainiacs” ever admitted to it). I hope that it runs the way it is expected considering my power PC original mac mini blows it out the water as far as reliability goes. Peace.

If you are having trouble getting a restart to reset the preferences try 1) clearing the NVRAM/PRAM (restart > Hold CMD+P+R) or 2) start in safe mode (restart > Hold shift key) or 3) Start using the Restore Image (restart > Hold option key then select restore image or 4) Restart using Single User Mode (restart > CMD S) or Restart using CMD R. If you end up reinstalling your OS be sure to recheck your Energy Saver preferences to disable the hard disk sleep modes. Not a fix but it may get you to a happier place.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Cobalt Surges 150% as Tesla and Tech Giants Fight for Supply LONDON, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — OilPrice.com News Commentary   This super-metal is the hottest commodity on the market right now-and it’s NOT lithium. Instead…  It’s a metal that early investors are eyeing as a massive opportunity. Supply is already in deficit – and that’s before the anticipated 500 percent increase in demand. It’s a metal that is critical to the future stock price of everything from General Electric (NYSE: GE), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS) and many more. Welcome to the supply crisis that is all about Cobalt Cobalt is a metal that few investors know much about – it is critical to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution because it makes up some 35% of the lithium-ion battery mix. That’s 30% of batteries that are the backbone of EVs, EVs that are now mainstream. To meet demand for EVs, billion-dollar battery gigafactories have been built and continue to be built. Consumer electronics are contributing to the demand and resulting shortage of supply. And, unlike lithium, which is a fairly common commodity… we can’t source enough of cobalt as things stand today – and demand is increasing quickly. Soon this story will get out. Analysts at Macquarie Research project deficits of 885 tons of this resource next year, 3,205 in 2019 and 5,340 in 2020. That’s a deficit increase of 503 percent. As a first principle of investing, where there is a supply problem, there is a massive opportunity for early investors. In the perfect storm that is the cobalt market, there are additional challenges. Currently, more than half of the world’s supply of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Use of child workers in appalling conditions in the DRC means that difficult supply chain questions are starting to be asked. Apple and Tesla will not be able to ignore the awkward questions they are being asked about their supply chains. Is their cobalt ethically sourced? Generally speaking, no. This is a huge and growing problem. What’s the answer? Where possible, cobalt sourced from America. For early investors, now is the time to act. This is where US Cobalt (previously Scientific Metals) (USCO.V; SCTFF) enters the picture with a pure play cobalt project that could put the U.S. on the cobalt map in a meaningful way, for the first time in history. As the cobalt supply problem grows, and EV giants and gigafactories continue to increase demand, a home-grown solution is at hand. US Cobalt is in an ideal position to answer the call and create shareholder value. Here are 5 reasons to keep a close eye on US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF): #1 In the Cobalt Surge, All-American Supply is Key   The math on this one is simple: We don’t have enough cobalt. We will have run out by the end of this year, according to Macquarie Research analysts. Beyond that, we’re looking at 500-percent demand growth between now and 2020. The battery industry already uses 42 percent of global cobalt production, while the rest is used in industrial and military applications-all competing for supply. Tesla-now with a $50-billion market cap-launched a $5-billion battery gigafactory in Nevada in January. By the end of 2017, it will have doubled the entire global battery production capacity. By next year, it will be producing more batteries than the rest of the world combined. Tesla’s run on cobalt alone will be phenomenal, and that ignores all those competing for the super metal. Small-cap explorers like US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF): which offers up new North American supply could be among the biggest winners. But it’s much bigger than Tesla. The EV market has grown over 15 times, with an amazing compound annual growth rate of over 72 percent from 2011-2016. This year, analysts expect it to gain another 25-26 percent. Last year, global EV production grew 41 percent, and sales are up more than 60 percent year on year. In the midst of all this EV growth alone, there is a „complete vacuum” in cobalt supply, according to traders interviewed by the Financial Times as early as 23 February. Because so much of it comes from the DRC, and because Western buyers are under pressure to find more ethical sources, new sources must be found-with America being the most appealing-especially since it’s in Tesla’s back yard. #2 Watch What Hedge Funds are Doing with Cobalt  The run on physical cobalt started in February in the least expected corner: Major hedge funds started buying up physical cobalt and hoarding it in order to gain exposure to the major supply shortage. Swiss-based Pala Investments and China’s Shanghai Chaos have already hoarded 17 percent of last year’s global production. At today’s prices that’s worth around $280 million. At tomorrow’s prices, it will be worth a lot more. When hedge funds start stockpiling physical cobalt, it sends its traditional buyers into a panic to secure new shipments. Since November, cobalt prices have rallied more than 50 percent, and this is only the beginning. #3 In the Heart of the #1 Cobalt Trend in America In September, US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF) entered into an agreement to acquire an amazing cobalt property, Iron Creek, right in the heart of the Idaho Cobalt Belt, one of the most prolific cobalt mineralization trends in the U.S. This isn’t new exploration: this is property that’s already seen major historic exploratory work, including 30,000 feet of diamond drilling. And when it comes to cobalt, Iron Creek has historic (non 43-101 compliant) indications of 1.3 million tons grading 0.59 percent of cobalt with encouraging indications of up to 10 million tons. The ‚closeology’ is also brilliant. US Cobalt’s project is right next door to the ONLY advanced cobalt project in the U.S. with an estimated 3 million-plus tons of cobalt. Right now, the most important thing on the cobalt scene is homegrown exploration, and US Cobalt is a first-mover on this. As one of only two pure play cobalt companies in the U.S., US Cobalt could be among the first to put America definitively on the cobalt production map just as EVs and batteries hit feverish demand. The clients will be lining up to get at homegrown cobalt because major buyers like Samsung are all under pressure over unethical cobalt sourced from the DRC. The bottom line: The EV revolution is already in full force. And it needs cobalt it doesn’t have. #4 The Dream Team Behind the Bet on Cobalt  The CEO of US Cobalt, Wayne Tisdale, is a legend in spotting emerging trends with impeccable timing and creating outstanding shareholder value. He’s already done it with uranium, gold and oil and gas, and his most recent homerun was in lithium, with Pure Energy. When it launched in 2012, lithium was selling for about $5,000 per tonne. Just a short time later, it had increased 450 percent. His next bet is on cobalt. Tisdale and his team at Intrepid Financial have in recent years created $2.7 billion in value by building and financing 5 companies in completely different industries: • Rainy River (gold) was worth $1.2 billion at its peak • Xemplar (uranium) hit $1 billion at its peak • Ryland Oil (oil and gas) sold for $114 million • Webtech Wireless (tech) was worth $300 million at peak • Pure Energy (lithium) is worth $65 million (and counting) #5 Proving Up 10 Million Tons of Cobalt  Not only is US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF) fully financed to develop its Idaho Cobalt Belt project, but it hopes to prove up 10 million tonnes of cobalt resource. That’s worth a potential $1 billion at today’s prices with a grading of 0.59 percent. And as Tisdale and the team set out to become the largest pure play cobalt company, advance projects towards production and sell to a major, they have shareholder value in mind. After all, the team are major stakeholders in US Cobalt, with 35 percent ownership. As global consumption for refined cobalt is set to reach 100,000 tonnes in 2017, US Cobalt is forging an Idaho future that will truly make America great again. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Tesla has said cobalt supply is an even bigger problem than lithium; still, it’s hoping to source it all from America. Tesla overtook giant GM this year in market cap! And it looks like this isn’t just a fluke. Tesla’s going to maintain its momentum because they are the future. Apply Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) Apple has stopped buying cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)–the main supply venue now–because of child labor. Apple is already the most widely followed stock because it’s got a rock-solid balance sheet and fantastic returns on invested capital. But look to the services business for future growth. General Electric (NYSE: GE) GE is developing jet engines, for which is needs cobalt. And one of the biggest headlining catalysts may be the potential for GE to take on billionaire Robert Bass’s dream to build a private supersonic jet through Aerion Corp. This would be the first non-military plane to fly faster than the speed of sound since the failed Concorde. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon needs it for Kindle; and UPS will need it for its fuel cell tech investments. Right now, Amazon is on the edge of joining Wall Street’s exclusive „$1,000 Stock Club” as huge tech companies drive the U.S. market higher. UPS (NYSE: UPS) UPS hasn’t had a great year, but there is room for future growth, and investors are eyeing its fuel-cell transportation investments. The company did, however, beat revenue and earnings expectations for the first quarter of this year.

And, unlike lithium, which is a fairly common commodity... we can't source enough of cobalt as things stand today - and demand is increasing quickly. Soon this story will get out. Analysts at Macquarie Research project deficits of 885 tons of this resource next year, 3,205 in 2019 and 5,340 in 2020. That's a deficit increase of 503 percent. As a first principle of investing, where there is a supply problem, there is a massive opportunity for early investors. In the perfect storm that is the cobalt market, there are additional challenges. Currently, more than half of the world's supply of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Use of child workers in appalling conditions in the DRC means that difficult supply chain questions are starting to be asked. Apple and Tesla will not be able to ignore the awkward questions they are being asked about their supply chains. Is their cobalt ethically sourced? Generally speaking, no. This is a huge and growing problem. What's the answer? Where possible, cobalt sourced from America. For early investors, now is the time to act. This is where US Cobalt (previously Scientific Metals) (USCO.V; SCTFF) enters the picture with a pure play cobalt project that could put the U.S. on the cobalt map in a meaningful way, for the first time in history. As the cobalt supply problem grows, and EV giants and gigafactories continue to increase demand, a home-grown solution is at hand. US Cobalt is in an ideal position to answer the call and create shareholder value. Here are 5 reasons to keep a close eye on US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF): #1 In the Cobalt Surge, All-American Supply is Key   The math on this one is simple: We don't have enough cobalt. We will have run out by the end of this year, according to Macquarie Research analysts. Beyond that, we're looking at 500-percent demand growth between now and 2020. The battery industry already uses 42 percent of global cobalt production, while the rest is used in industrial and military applications-all competing for supply. Tesla-now with a $50-billion market cap-launched a $5-billion battery gigafactory in Nevada in January. By the end of 2017, it will have doubled the entire global battery production capacity. By next year, it will be producing more batteries than the rest of the world combined. Tesla's run on cobalt alone will be phenomenal, and that ignores all those competing for the super metal. Small-cap explorers like US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF): which offers up new North American supply could be among the biggest winners. But it's much bigger than Tesla. The EV market has grown over 15 times, with an amazing compound annual growth rate of over 72 percent from 2011-2016. This year, analysts expect it to gain another 25-26 percent. Last year, global EV production grew 41 percent, and sales are up more than 60 percent year on year. In the midst of all this EV growth alone, there is a "complete vacuum" in cobalt supply, according to traders interviewed by the Financial Times as early as 23 February. Because so much of it comes from the DRC, and because Western buyers are under pressure to find more ethical sources, new sources must be found-with America being the most appealing-especially since it's in Tesla's back yard. #2 Watch What Hedge Funds are Doing with Cobalt  The run on physical cobalt started in February in the least expected corner: Major hedge funds started buying up physical cobalt and hoarding it in order to gain exposure to the major supply shortage. Swiss-based Pala Investments and China's Shanghai Chaos have already hoarded 17 percent of last year's global production. At today's prices that's worth around $280 million. At tomorrow's prices, it will be worth a lot more. When hedge funds start stockpiling physical cobalt, it sends its traditional buyers into a panic to secure new shipments. Since November, cobalt prices have rallied more than 50 percent, and this is only the beginning. #3 In the Heart of the #1 Cobalt Trend in America In September, US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF) entered into an agreement to acquire an amazing cobalt property, Iron Creek, right in the heart of the Idaho Cobalt Belt, one of the most prolific cobalt mineralization trends in the U.S. This isn't new exploration: this is property that's already seen major historic exploratory work, including 30,000 feet of diamond drilling. And when it comes to cobalt, Iron Creek has historic (non 43-101 compliant) indications of 1.3 million tons grading 0.59 percent of cobalt with encouraging indications of up to 10 million tons. The 'closeology' is also brilliant. US Cobalt's project is right next door to the ONLY advanced cobalt project in the U.S. with an estimated 3 million-plus tons of cobalt. Right now, the most important thing on the cobalt scene is homegrown exploration, and US Cobalt is a first-mover on this. As one of only two pure play cobalt companies in the U.S., US Cobalt could be among the first to put America definitively on the cobalt production map just as EVs and batteries hit feverish demand. The clients will be lining up to get at homegrown cobalt because major buyers like Samsung are all under pressure over unethical cobalt sourced from the DRC. The bottom line: The EV revolution is already in full force. And it needs cobalt it doesn't have. #4 The Dream Team Behind the Bet on Cobalt  The CEO of US Cobalt, Wayne Tisdale, is a legend in spotting emerging trends with impeccable timing and creating outstanding shareholder value. He's already done it with uranium, gold and oil and gas, and his most recent homerun was in lithium, with Pure Energy. When it launched in 2012, lithium was selling for about $5,000 per tonne. Just a short time later, it had increased 450 percent. His next bet is on cobalt. Tisdale and his team at Intrepid Financial have in recent years created $2.7 billion in value by building and financing 5 companies in completely different industries: • Rainy River (gold) was worth $1.2 billion at its peak • Xemplar (uranium) hit $1 billion at its peak • Ryland Oil (oil and gas) sold for $114 million • Webtech Wireless (tech) was worth $300 million at peak • Pure Energy (lithium) is worth $65 million (and counting) #5 Proving Up 10 Million Tons of Cobalt  Not only is US Cobalt (USCO.V; SCTFF) fully financed to develop its Idaho Cobalt Belt project, but it hopes to prove up 10 million tonnes of cobalt resource. That's worth a potential $1 billion at today's prices with a grading of 0.59 percent. And as Tisdale and the team set out to become the largest pure play cobalt company, advance projects towards production and sell to a major, they have shareholder value in mind. After all, the team are major stakeholders in US Cobalt, with 35 percent ownership. As global consumption for refined cobalt is set to reach 100,000 tonnes in 2017, US Cobalt is forging an Idaho future that will truly make America great again. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Tesla has said cobalt supply is an even bigger problem than lithium; still, it's hoping to source it all from America. Tesla overtook giant GM this year in market cap! And it looks like this isn't just a fluke. Tesla's going to maintain its momentum because they are the future. Apply Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) Apple has stopped buying cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)--the main supply venue now--because of child labor. Apple is already the most widely followed stock because it's got a rock-solid balance sheet and fantastic returns on invested capital. But look to the services business for future growth. General Electric (NYSE: GE) GE is developing jet engines, for which is needs cobalt. And one of the biggest headlining catalysts may be the potential for GE to take on billionaire Robert Bass's dream to build a private supersonic jet through Aerion Corp. This would be the first non-military plane to fly faster than the speed of sound since the failed Concorde. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon needs it for Kindle; and UPS will need it for its fuel cell tech investments. Right now, Amazon is on the edge of joining Wall Street's exclusive "$1,000 Stock Club" as huge tech companies drive the U.S. market higher. UPS (NYSE: UPS) UPS hasn't had a great year, but there is room for future growth, and investors are eyeing its fuel-cell transportation investments. The company did, however, beat revenue and earnings expectations for the first quarter of this year.

Deliveries have been conveniently pushed to June 6 or later in the United States, just a day after Apple’s WWDC keynote, indicating refreshed models might be unveiled during the keynote. Delivery estimates for the 15-inch MacBook Pro models have slipped to June 6 or later in other markets, too, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore and Spain. Shipping times for the 13-inch MacBook Pro models have not changed, MacRumors reports. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple could upgrade its Mac notebook lineup at WWDC next month with faster Intel chips and updated internal architecture. Intel in January unveiled new Kaby Lake processors that could be appropriate for the 13-inch MacBook Pro models. Earlier today at Computex in Taipei, the chip giant announced a new Core X chip brand, including a new Core i9 desktop processor line with up to 18 cores and 36 threads of power.

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic PointCloud Apple Just Poached Top Talent From Qualcomm Amid a Legal Dispute Aaron Pressman May 30, 2017 Apple has hired one of Qualcomm's top communications chip engineers amid a legal battle over wireless modem royalties. Esin Terzioglu, who oversaw the engineering organization of Qualcomm's core communications chip business, announced the move on his LinkedIn page, where it was highlighted by analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. "It has been my honor and privilege to have worked with so many talented and dedicated individuals at Qualcomm where we accomplished great feats as a team (10nm bring up was a doozy and the team did an amazing job bringing the first product to market!!!)," Terzioglu wrote. "I feel privileged for the opportunity to continue my career at Apple. Stay in touch." Qualcomm last year began introducing chips at the cutting-edge 10-nanometer scale made in Samsung's semiconductor factories. The smaller scale, a step down from 14 nm, allows chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 for smartphones to do more calculations using less power. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Fortune contacted Apple for comment and will update this story with any response. Qualcomm declined to comment. Apple has used Qualcomm wireless modem chips in the iPhone and connected models of the iPad, but the relationship between the two giants of the mobile phone industry has soured over the past year. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, claiming the chip maker was was unfairly using patents and market dominance to charge excessive royalties. Qualcomm denied it had done anything improper and counter-sued Apple last month for interfering with its business and violating deals between the two companies. The dispute has led to speculation that Apple (aapl) will increasingly turn to Intel (intc) for wireless modems. But Intel's products, so far, lag the capabilities and speed of Qualcomm's (qcom) cutting-edge products. The hire may be a sign that Apple wants to integrate the wireless modem capability more deeply into its own custom-designed system on a chip, or SoC, that runs the iPhone, according to Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt. "The data point is the latest in a list of instances suggesting that Apple has plans to develop full SoCs in house for future mobile devices,” McCourt wrote in a note on Tuesday. "The current A series processors lack a baseband modem and Terzioglu’s move seems to suggest that Apple is acquiring the necessary expertise to develop such technology." Terzioglu, who has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford, previously worked at communications chipmaker Broadcom (brcm) and a memory chip startup called Novelics that was acquired by Mentor Graphics.

 The exodus of Tidal executives is continuing — here's what could be next for Jay Z's music streaming service James Cook May 30, 2017, 11:00 AM 5,398 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jay Z. Getty Images North America Jay Z's music streaming service Tidal has lost another CEO — the third CEO to leave the company since Jay Z acquired it in January 2015. Billboard reported on May 26 that Tidal CEO Jeff Toig had left the company, and that Tidal plans to name a new CEO in the coming weeks. "As part of TIDAL’s continued expansion this year we will be announcing a new CEO in the coming weeks," Tidal said in a statement. "We wish former CEO, Jeffrey Toig, all the best in his future endeavors." A company losing a CEO is never a good sign. But a company losing three CEOs in just over two years is a particularly bad sign. The list of departed Tidal executives shows the upheaval that the company has gone through since its January 2015 acquisition. CEO Andy Chen left Tidal in April 2015. Then CEO Peter Tonstad left the company in June 2015. US sales and marketing manager David Solomon left Tidal after just 10 months in July 2015. Tidal's senior vice president of label and artist relations, Zena Burns, left in August 2015, two months after she joined. It was reported in November 2015 that chief investment officer Vania Schlogel had left Tidal. Tidal announced in March 2016 that it had fired CFO Chris Hart and COO Nils Juell. And now Tidal's latest CEO, Jeff Toig has left the company. So, what's going to happen to Tidal? There are two routes the company can go down: Scale back expenses and operate as a niche streaming service It costs money to compete with Apple and Spotify, and Tidal can't fight a losing battle forever. And yes, Tidal is losing. The most recent paying subscriber number we have for Tidal is just 3 million (although it was reported that internal numbers show 1.2 million subscribers.) Contrast that with Apple's 20 million subscribers, and Spotify's 50 million, and it's clear that Tidal is barely moving the needle. Data released by the BPI (British Phonographic Institute) earlier this month showed that Tidal has managed to gain just 0.1% penetration in the UK in 2016, a tiny amount compared to Spotify's 11.6% (although Apple Music is on 2.5%.) BPI This could be sustainable if Tidal had a giant cash pile and low overheads, but it doesn't. Its losses doubled to $28 million (£21.7 million) in 2015, double what it lost before Jay Z bought the company.  It's worth pointing out, though, that Tidal's losses aren't as big as rival SoundCloud. SoundCloud's 2015 accounts show that it lost €51.22 million (£44 million) in 2015. Tidal has the option of scaling back its overheads, potentially cutting staff, and operating as a lean and niche music streaming service. That's what it did for years before being acquired by Jay Z, after all. Sell to another company But maybe Jay Z doesn't want to scale back his ambitions. Maybe he's bored of Tidal altogether. He did forget he owns the company in a court case, after all. Apple doesn't need Tidal. It already bought its own relatively niche music streaming service, Beats, and turned that into Apple Music. Apple Music dealmaker Jimmy Iovine also shut down rumours of a Tidal acquisition in a September 2016 interview with BuzzFeed News. "We're really running our own race," Iovine said. "We're not looking to acquire any streaming services." OK, so Apple won't buy Tidal. How about Spotify, another European music streaming service? Well, that deal doesn't look too likely, either. Spotify chairman Martin Lorentzon joked about Tidal during an on-stage interview in Stockholm in May 2015. "I've got 99 problems — and Jay Z ain't one," he reportedly said. But there are two companies that do make sense here: Samsung and SoftBank. Jay Z was photographed leaving Samsung's US head office in Silicon Valley in October 2015. Jay-Z leaving Samsung corp. in Silicon Valley right now pic.twitter.com/AQAJWzL6lq — Damian Trujillo (@newsdamian) October 15, 2015 Samsung shuttered its Milk music streaming service in August 2016, potentially leaving a gap in its business for Tidal. There's one small problem with this theory, though: Samsung previously denied a rumour that it's planning to buy Tidal. But maybe it would change its tune if Tidal offered itself for a knockdown price. How about SoftBank? The Japanese company already owns a third of Tidal through its carrier company Sprint. SoftBank has bought tech companies before: In 2016 it announced that it had paid £24 billion to acquire British chip designer ARM Holdings.

Christina Jeter 6 days ago Share Tweet +1s Reddit Pin Comments Apple products may not be selling like they use to, but it will always be the #1 brand to me. As an owner of a Red iPhone 7 Plus, the purchase was truly more than just a mere collection of another expensive electronic, I now contribute to a remarkable opportunity to make a difference and contribute to the Global Fund through the purchase of this new beautiful (PRODUCT)RED iPhone. “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. It has a digital fingerprint recognition system that will only allow me to use my phone, a tracking device that can find all my Apple electronics and sync them together along with commonly used apps so I can choose which product I like to listen to Spotify. So when I am on my iPhone I can switch it to play the music on my laptop even though it is not an Apple, but because I have the application on my electronic. “Combining the global reach of the world’s most loved smartphone with our efforts to provide access to life-saving ARV medication in sub-Saharan Africa, customers now have a remarkable opportunity to make a difference and contribute to the Global Fund through the purchase of this new beautiful (PRODUCT)RED iPhone.” The iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT) RED color is synonymous with its color because the phone features and contributions are literally on FIRE! I purchased mine under the Verizon Wireless plan because I feel they have the best service & they know it, that is why they charge for it. I find myself treating my new phone like a brand new car. I am always detailing it, buying accessories for it and cleaning it off by detailing every part of it. “Every customer who buys iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition or iPhone SE from Apple will be offered free Personal Setup, in-store or online, to help them customize their iPhone by setting up email, showing them new apps from the App Store & more. Anyone who wants to learn the basics or go further with their new iPhone can register for a free workshop at every Apple Store.” apple iPhone Christina Jeter https://www.instagram.com/ruby_haiti/ Share This 0 0 0 1 Previous ArticleFly Free With Jet Blue Next ArticleJamie Foxx’s 'Disrespectful' and 'Gibberish' Sign Language on 'Fallon' Gets Called Out Recommended For You Don't miss a thing.

In 2016, year-over-year growth was 2.5%, marking the lowest growth the industry has ever experienced. With several major devices entering the market this year, IDC anticipates shipment volumes will grow to 1.52 billion in 2017. And IDC expects this momentum to carry into 2018, when smartphone shipments are forecast to grow 4.5% year over year, fueled by improved economic conditions in many emerging markets and a full year of new iPhone shipments from Apple.   Coming off the first year in which iPhone shipments declined, expectations are that 2017 volumes will grow 3.8%. IDC slightly lowered its 2017 projections for Apple in this forecast to 223.6 million, while increasing its 2018 volumes to 240.4 million. All signs point to late 2017 and certainly 2018 being very strong for Apple as much of its installed base seems ready for a refresh and the next round of iPhones is not likely to disappoint its fans.   On the other hand IDC's forecast for the next five years see's the iPhone's iOS remaining the same or slightly loosing a little ground. It's possible that Apple could introduce a new Pro model that uses Apple Pencil over the next few years while strengthening their mid-market iPhone SE to be more competitive. Such moves would likely move the iOS needle for smartphone statistics.   However, the biggest increase for iOS could come from emerging markets like India. Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo and others are already in and lead that market whereas Apple is practically invisible statistically speaking. Any real breakthrough in that market due to a manufacturing deal with the Indian government along with new Apple Stores opening would would benefit Apple's iOS statistically over Android in terms of market share growth by 2021.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Asus has announced a slew of new products at Taiwan's Computex showcase, including the world's thinnest 2-in-1 and series of rivals for Apple's MacBook and MacBook Pro devices. The company's new flagship convertible, the Asus Zenbook Flip S, is a lightweight offering that weighs in at just 1.1kg, with a 10.9mm thickness. It features 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7 CPU - although this will doubtless be one of the Y-series models, so don't expect particularly chart-topping performance. The ZenBook Flip S is fitted with a 13in 4K screen, and features support for Windows Hello thanks to a built-in fingerprint reader. Cooling is taken care of by aerospace-grade aluminium and a 'vapour-chamber' cooling system; based on our previous experience with ultrathin convertibles, thermal efficiency is likely to be a key concern. Picture: ZenBook Flip S, courtesy of Asus Also announced was a new ZenBook Pro. Outfitted with a quad-core Core i7 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti and a 15.6in 4K display, the new machine boasts some serious business-grade specifications. To further tempt customers away from Apple, the ZenBook Pro can be upgraded to feature a 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB of DDR4 RAM - all of which is backed up with an impressive 14hr battery life. Picture: ZenBook Pro, courtesy of Asus Similarly, the ZenBook 3 Deluxe seems calculated to undercut Apple's MacBook, with a svelte 12.9mm frame and a weight of 1.1kg, twinned with a 1TB PCIe SSD, a Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM. Rounding out the announcements is a new VivoBook S, a fairly unremarkable entry aside from the fact that it manages to pack a Core i7 CPU, GeForce 940MX graphics card and 4K screen into a device that costs just $US799. It's also got expansion options including a 2TB HDD and 16GB of RAM. With such a strong lineup, Asus could provide an increasingly attractive alternative to Apple for price-conscious CIOs.

The chip, called the Apple Neural Engine, will bring new capabilities to mobile devices that will revolutionise how we use our phones, inside sources suggest. The AI-enabled processor will handle tasks normally only managed by humans such as facial and speech recognition and could even alert us if it thinks we are getting ill. Scroll down for video The new chip, called the Apple Neural Engine, would bring new capabilities to mobile devices that will revolutionise how we use our phones, inside sources suggest. Pictured are leaked images of what the iPhone 8 might look like WHAT COULD THIS MEAN? The chip will handle tasks are normally only managed by humans such as facial and speech recognition. An AI-enabled processor would help Apple get more advanced capabilities into their devices such as cars that self-drive and gadgets that have augmented reality. In the future they could be used to monitor body readings and alert our phone when if we have an abnormal reading that needs acting on. For example they could pick up early signs of conditions such as dementia, Parkinson's or diabetes. This could be ascertained from limitless data on our every move - such as how we walk or talk. The introduction of chips into phones will greatly speed up how fast machines can learn which will make AI more sophisticated than ever.   Apple engineers are trying to keep up with Google and Qualcomm, according to the report by Bloomberg. Although Apple has got voice recognition assistant Siri, Amazon Echo and Google Home assistants have given other companies an advantage.   An AI-enabled processor would help Apple get more advanced capabilities into their devices such as cars that self-drive and gadgets that have augmented reality. 'Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,' said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst. 'At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.' Although AI is used to power assistants such as Siri these rely on computer servers processing data rather than processing data themselves.  The inclusion of AI software in phones will further increase how much we depend on them. For example they could pick up early signs of conditions such as dementia, Parkinson's or diabetes. This could be ascertained from limitless data on our every move - such as how we walk or talk.

The new chip would mean these tasks would be carried out a single chip which would work even when the device is not connected to the internet.  The introduction of chips into phones will greatly speed up how fast machines can learn which will make AI more sophisticated than ever. Google's hardware, the Tensor Processing Unit, is 15 to 30 times faster than the processors that power today's computers and is the company's first chip, announced in 2016.  Google's hardware, the Tensor Processing Unit (pictured),  is 15 to 30 times faster than the processes that power today's computers This unit connects Google services such as Google Search, Google Street View, Google Photos and Google Translate.  WHAT IS A TPU? Google's hardware, the Tensor Processing Unit, is 15 to 30 times faster than the processors that power today's computers and is the company's first chip, announced in 2016.  TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed specifically for machine learning. TPUs are designed for a higher volume of reduced precision computation than other types of processing units. The chip was specifically designed for Google's TensorFlow framework, but Google still uses other chips for different types of machine learning.  At the I/O conference this year Google announced an updated version would soon be available to users of its cloud business and sources suggest it will soon be integrated into many devices.  AI on a phone is also likely to be useful in helping to keep the device secure and protected from external threats. They could be used as a way to uniquely identify the wearer of a device.  Phones could be part of a broader network of machines which are dependent on AI - including cars. Last month the UK government handed £12.8 million ($16.4 million) to an AI firm to develop a driverless car system. The report suggests Apple may choose to discuss its latest AI work in its developers conference in June.  Read more: Apple Is Working on a Dedicated Chip to Power AI on Devices - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 57 shares Most watched News videos Caravan dangerously sways and blocks dual carriageway Heart-stopping moment van driver pushes motorist into fast lane Man boots scooter rider while being arrested by the police Heart-stopping moment lorry pushes car across motorway John Noakes attempts to climb the mast of HMS Ganges in 1967 Dramatic footage shows huge brawl at drinking spot in Newcastle Stunning footage of old cargo ship sunk in the 1940s Dashcam captures moment 'confused' driver causes three way smash Fallon disagrees with Boris quote he mistakes for Corbyn's Moment Jeremy Corbyn fails to provide figures during interview Police officer grills Theresa May on police recruitment policy Topless man frogmarched down street at gunpoint by police in Marbella French police seize almost £1million worth of Ferraris...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Blame the hippies The California: Designing Freedom exhibition in London explores how 60s counterculture has influenced tech from smartphones to search engines By James Temperton 5 days ago By James Temperton Tuesday 30 May 2017 Mark Weaver If you want to understand where the iPhone came from, head to the rolling hills of Northern California's Mendocino County and the home of Hog Farm - one of the US's oldest, and most successful, hippy communes. "Hippies were setting up communes and dropping out of mainstream society to build their own communities," says Justin McGuirk, lead curator at London's Design Museum. McGuirk, 41, has spent more than a year studying the recent history of Silicon Valley design for a major exhibition. "That was one of the key factors in 60s counterculture. You can trace that through everything we're seeing today in Silicon Valley, which is about individual and personal  liberation. The iPhone is a quintessential example of that." ADVERTISEMENT Subscribe to WIRED Covering 900 square metres of the museum's new home in South Kensington, the California: Designing Freedom exhibition brings together key objects from the past six decades to explain how and why the iPhone is the way it is. Take Susan Kare's gridded notebook, which contains sketches of the Apple Macintosh's original desktop icons. "It's the first show to try and do justice to the influence of California in contemporary design culture," McGuirk explains. READ NEXT Google's driverless car just got pulled over for driving too slowly Google's driverless car just got pulled over for driving too slowly By Matt Burgess Apple's £249 book contains 450 photos of Apple products Apple's £249 book contains 450 photos of Apple products Apple 5 items 18 Nov 2016 From Apple to Facebook, the success of Silicon Valley firms doesn't just affect the technology we use, but also the way we behave and respond to design. In a world with 1.86 billion Facebook users, a billion iPhones sold and 40,000 Google searches every second, it's hard to avoid California's influence. A central theme to the exhibition is personal liberation, an idea that was championed in those early communes, and which has trickled down to the most powerful companies. "A key thing for us is the Whole Earth Catalog," McGuirk says. Released in 1968, the magazine became an essential text for California's self-sufficient, DIY culture. "The idea of personal liberation is intrinsic to a Californian attitude," McGuirk says. "And the entrepreneur is the pinnacle of Californian individualism." The exhibition, which runs until October 15, is both a celebration and a critique of Californian design and culture. For Brendan McGetrick, a curator who worked with McGuirk on the exhibition, Californian design is not just rooted in hippy communes, but also in the military. "Everything that at the time was associated with the military industrial complex could be personalised and democratised. That idea resonates through almost everything in the show," McGetrick says. The microchip is a prime example: until the 70s, they were used largely to guide missiles. Decades later, they are integral to billions of devices. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Who is Sam?

Daan Roosegaarde is designing healthier cities Smog-free towers. Bioluminescent roads. Daan Roosegaarde is designing healthier cities Architecture 30 Apr 2017 One of the exhibition's bolder claims is that, in some ways, we are all Californians. "The use of smartphones and social media is a global phenomenon coming from Silicon Valley that has affected the way billions of people behave," McGuirk says. "Taking a selfie and posting it on Facebook is a quintessential Californian behaviour." Liberation, in Californian terms, also has a downside. The exhibition features adverts for the Apple PowerBook and Newton, devices that gave people freedom to work in their own way. "It's a freedom that also imprisons you," McGuirk says. "You never escape work any more. These assumptions are built into all of these things and they're coming from a specific ideology." He argues that these elements create friction in the story of California's design success. Apple and Google are understandable fixations, but the exhibition takes a broader view. "Trying to make it about California, rather than doing a tech show, creates surprises," McGuirk says. The differences between Southern and Northern Californian design reveal the clash between the neo-modernist graphic design of San Franciscan smartphones and the idiosyncratic approach of LA-based creatives. "Northern California makes the tools and Southern California has the freedom to be roguishly individualistic," McGuirk says. ADVERTISEMENT This to and fro between design cultures has even changed the way we speak. Corita Kent's 1965 screenprint "Powerup" is a political artwork that evolved into a description for turning on a computer. From the Black Panthers to the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, 60s political movements are also an influence on modern Californian design. One example is a booklet, given out at a 60s gay-rights protest to defend against police harassment, which is echoed today in an American Civil Liberties Union app to report police abuse. Ultimately, the exhibition celebrates the success of Californian design. "So many companies have studios in LA and San Francisco because they feel that's where they need to be," McGuirk adds. "'Designed in California' is not just a Californian thing any more." California: Designing Freedom runs until October 15 at London's Design Museum.

Unlike Apple’s in-house designed chips, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors  and Samsung’s own Exynos chips integrate the CPU, GPU and the LTE modem on the same chip package. iPhone 7, for instance, uses dedicated LTE modems from both Intel and Qualcomm. “After an amazing eight years at Qualcomm, it is time for me to move on to my next adventure,” Terzioglu shared the news via his LinkedIn account. “I feel privileged for the opportunity to continue my career at Apple,” he added. He is credit as an inventor of many Qualcomm patents. After joining Qualcomm in August 2009, Terzioglu lead the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Central Engineering organization. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a Ph.D. minor in Computer Science, both completed at Stanford University. Apple and Qualcomm are currently embroiled in a $1 billion licensing dispute related to the royalty fees the iPhone maker and other companies pay to Qualcomm for its cellular chips. According to Axios, the chip maker has asked a US court to force iPhone suppliers to keep paying it royalty fees, while it continues its legal battle with the Cupertino giant.

The company's new flagship convertible, the Asus Zenbook Flip S, is a lightweight offering that weighs in at just 1.1kg, with a 10.9mm thickness. It features 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7 CPU - although this will doubtless be one of the Y-series models, so don't expect particularly chart-topping performance. The ZenBook Flip S is fitted with a 13in 4K screen, and features support for Windows Hello thanks to a built-in fingerprint reader. Cooling is taken care of by aerospace-grade aluminium and a 'vapour-chamber' cooling system; based on our previous experience with ultrathin convertibles, thermal efficiency is likely to be a key concern. Picture: ZenBook Flip S, courtesy of Asus Also announced was a new ZenBook Pro. Outfitted with a quad-core Core i7 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti and a 15.6in 4K display, the new machine boasts some serious business-grade specifications. To further tempt customers away from Apple, the ZenBook Pro can be upgraded to feature a 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB of DDR4 RAM - all of which is backed up with an impressive 14hr battery life. Picture: ZenBook Pro, courtesy of Asus Similarly, the ZenBook 3 Deluxe seems calculated to undercut Apple's MacBook, with a svelte 12.9mm frame and a weight of 1.1kg, twinned with a 1TB PCIe SSD, a Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM. Rounding out the announcements is a new VivoBook S, a fairly unremarkable entry aside from the fact that it manages to pack a Core i7 CPU, GeForce 940MX graphics card and 4K screen into a device that costs just $799. It's also got expansion options including a 2TB HDD and 16GB of RAM. With such a strong lineup, Asus could provide an increasingly attractive alternative to Apple for price-conscious CIOs.

Digitally designed images of the highly anticipated smartphone have found their way onto Twitter, thanks to the well-known designer, and leakster Benjamin Geskin. Screenshot Source: VenyaGeskin1/Twitter.com iPhone 8 Render Leaks As for what the renders reveal, that’s a handset which for the most part, supports many wide-spread rumors. One of which is that it will feature an edge-to-edge display, with the only remaining bezel being at the top. A place for which Apple will set the front-facing camera. Another rumor of note, which looks to be supported, relates to the iPhone 8 not having a Home Button. This render clearly shows that it is gone, it could mean that Apple has managed to embed Touch ID into the display, as rumors suggest. #iPhone8 CAD pic.twitter.com/sZknEva03A — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 28, 2017 CAD Drawings While Geskin, has been sharing beautiful looking renders, he has also taken to posting computer-assisted design drawings too. The image above shows the front and back of what he thinks is the iPhone 8. As for what this CAD drawing reveals, there’s clearly a vertically aligned dual-camera setup, with the flash nestled in between the sensors. However, on the front of the device, there’s a surprising feature missing, and that’s the much talked about Selfie-camera. Returning to its rear, the round shaped ring, according to Geskin is where the Apple Logo will be placed. In a recent tweet, he made it clear, that he didn’t think it was where the Touch ID would be stamped. Insider Sources Over the weekend, we reported that Geskin had received details from a source inside of Apple. These details suggested the iPhone 8’s announcement date, and a later on sale date. It was this information, which apparently, spurred Geskin, and others such as Slashleaks to begin revealing what the handset will look like. However, while these renders, mockups, and CAD designs may be somewhat revealing, they are not official. Apple is yet to reveal anything, although its WWDC developers conference does begin next week. So, there is the chance that we may finally at least hear some confirmation of the handset’s existence. Returning to the insider sources, Geskin, managed to get his hands on an internal Apple memo. A document which was meant specifically for the Apple Care team. Apparently, this memo informed members that all leave had been canceled. And additionally, no holiday’s would be granted between September 17 and November 4. This lead, to the tweeting of the iPhone 8 announcement happening on Sunday, September 17, and going on sale on September 25. The Note itself, read, as follows: “As you know, there are new product announcements and launches in September,’ the memo says. ‘We will be imposing Black Out Days in all AppleCare programs for Advisors and Leaders. ‘The upcoming Black Out Days will be September 17 through November 4’. It ends ‘absences are unacceptable’.” The above-leaked memo was shared by Geskin, just a couple of day’s after a video claimed to show what the iPhone 8 would look like. The 10-second video, which you can see below, seems to show a dummy device with many of the features being rumored. What Does The Video Reveal? To start with, it was Benjamin Geskin himself, who uploaded the short video to YouTube. On the matter, he said it shows a dummy device/display model of the iPhone 8 possibly from China. Does this reveal more than iPhone 8 renders? To be clear, it looks to stick to schematics and rumors we’ve seen previously. And that means, it sticks to the expected features, which include an edge-to-edge display, and its quite thin, and sleek. Additionally, maybe Apple has managed to solve for the iPhone 8, what Samsung could not for the Galaxy S8. As the absence of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor from the rear and front does seem to indicate it’s embedded under the display. That being said, some rumors have suggested that if Apple could not solve the embedding problem. It could do something as drastic, as the removal of Touch ID altogether. Moving to the rear of the device, we can see, what could be the housing for a dual-lens-3D camera. Again it’s a heavily rumored feature, which along with an OLED display could be the headline feature. Latest Rumor So, what do these iPhone 8 renders, dummy’s, and the latest rumors tell us about Apple’s next device? We already know/assume, that because this year marks the 10th-anniversarry of the iconic handset line, it will be different. And by that we don’t mean just in design, it will offer Apple fans, and those looking to switch, some real incentive to do so. Along with the images, a new rumor has emerged, apparently via one of Apple’s own partners. This leak/rumor, reveals one reason why the iPhone 8 will be different, and that’s shape. It will not be the same as previous handsets, according to China’s Economic Daily News, the chip maker TSMC has revealed the iPhone 8’s display will be longer with an aspect ratio of 18:5:9. This will be the same as is found on the LG G6 and the Galaxy S8. However, the reason behind this move is to increase the size of the handset display. But, also keep it narrow enough to enable it to be used in one hand.

With saturated, developed markets moving onto the upgrade chain, the company has indeed been winning its crusade on switchers. If you have any reservations about it, the company has been crafting 15-second ad spots for you to watch while you’re on some sort of streaming service or on television or basically, you’re a captive audience. All of these implicitly promote the Move to iOS app that makes all the data transfers a user would need pretty darn easy. The more obvious ploys? iOS is smooth, more secure and easier to deal with for the long run. By the way, the Security spot, last on this showcase below, is currently #5 on YouTube’s Trending list.

Processors purposed for AI would help Apple run autonomous cars, improve graphics processing on computers and serve up services with ease and proprietary hardware, just for example — facial recognition and speech recognition are the big call-outs, but would be featured not as part of the base OS, but in applications. The chips would also take away workload for the main processor. ARM announced new processor cores during Computex this weekend that will pose as other chipmakers’ entry into AI-integrated chips coming soon. Amazon and Google are also working on their own micro-hardware. Share This Post Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Intel announced new Core CPUs at Computex 2017 including their Monster i9 X-Series with 18 Cores & 36 Threads | Main | While IDC sees little to no Growth for iPhones over the Next Five Years, they may be missing the obvious » May 30, 2017 LG Display to open a new Flexible OLED Plant for Smartphones with either Apple or Google as its main Customer   Last month Patently Apple posted a report noting that a senior official at LG Display had told the Korean press that they received a request to take part in a bid for receiving an order for small and medium-sized OLEDs from Apple. LG is to decide in June on the matter. Ten days earlier we had reported that Google was in negotiations with LG Display for a new OLED plant and joint venture regarding foldable smartphones. Today we're learning that LG plans to invest US$3.5 billion into its new production plant called the P10 to beef up its production of OLED panels for smartphones. The report specially added that the OLED displays would be aimed for the iPhone and beyond.   The Korean report published today specifically states that "Although it was planning to make investments mostly on large OLEDs for TVs initially, it is currently thinking about making investments on OLEDs for Smartphones first. It seems that LG Display is planning to secure its position as the second supplier for Apple iPhone by quickly increasing its production capability of OLED for Smartphone." That would be wise considering that Foxconn/Sharp are going full tilt trying to win orders from Apple as well.   LG Display is going to start bringing in equipment corresponding to first stage of investment in March of 2018. It is going to bring equipment in March and September and secure production capability for 30,000 OLED panels first. Equipment corresponding to second stage of investment will be brought in November of 2018 and January of 2019.   When investments into P10, E5, and E6 are finished by 2019, LG Display will then have production capability to produce 120,000 flexible OLED panels per month based on 6th generation panel. This amount corresponds to half of Samsung Display's current production capability.   The Korean report basically covered LG's new OLED plant. However, because they note that "it seems" that LG Display is planning to secure its position as the second supplier for the iPhone, it's not conclusive.   In light of LG's negotiations with Google specifically relating to "flexible OLED" (FOLED), the plant could end up being for other partners other than Apple, such as Google. So while it's likely a plant designed to supply Apple with OLED panels for future iPhones, until LG makes it official at a future meeting with analysts like they've done in the past, the partner LG Display is aiming the OLED plant for will remain a mystery.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

YouTube/Apple Apple has conspicuously changed the delivery schedule for the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 for US customers. The Cupertino company has pushed the delivery date for buyers of the 2016 model with the fastest delivery option set for June 5 and the free delivery option on June 6 at the earliest. Apple has been known to alter the delivery dates, though most have somehow associated it with the potential release of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models. As mentioned in a previous post, the Cupertino company may introduce upgraded models of the variant which would be armed with an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, Mac Rumors reports. It is possible that Apple may be trying to control stocks and opt to produce 2016 MacBook Pro models in safer volumes. That version drew its share of criticism, mostly hitting on Apple’s decision to use an Intel Skylake chipset. As most know, Apple was backed into a wall before eventually deciding to release the MacBook Pro refresh. Availability of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset was unstable last year before eventually normalizing in early 2017. The reason behind the release of the MacBook Pro 2016 was seen as a way for Apple to maintain its regular schedule of releasing new models for its laptop line. But now, it seems the Cupertino company will break that anyway with a suggested revelation of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models at WWDC 2017. Another point worth noting is that it is only the 15-inch model that got a pushed back delivery date. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is in stock and can be delivered as early as the next day. It remains to be seen if there will be an upgraded 13-inch MacBook Pro models, something that could be announced at the upcoming Apple event. In other regions, it seems that 15-inch MacBook Pro delivery estimates have also hit a snag. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and several other countries are reportedly experiencing long waits, hinting that Apple may have other plans ahead. The Cupertino company may have toned down production, as they expect demand for the anticipated MacBook Pro 2017 to run like crazy if it is introduced at the WWDC 2017. Apple normally allows 320 days before a new model is released. If a MacBook Pro 2017 does come out on June 5, the 2016 model would be below that average with only 220 days passed.

But that may be about to change. In other health IT news, Molina Healthcare is investigating a potential data breach. Stat: Two Years In, What Has Apple ResearchKit Accomplished? In March 2015, Apple promised to change the way medical research could be done. It launched ResearchKit, which could turn millions of iPhones around the world into a “powerful tool for medical research,” the company said at the time. Since then, ResearchKit — software that gives would-be app developers a library of coding to create health apps on the iPhone and Apple Watch — has spawned a number of studies: One team has used it to create an app to track Parkinson’s symptoms; another is trying out a screening protocol for autism. A third helps people inventory the moles on their skin and evaluate how they have changed over time. (Sheridan, 5/26) California Healthline: Molina Healthcare, A Top Obamacare Insurer, Investigates Breach Of Patients’ Data Molina Healthcare, a major insurer in Medicaid and state exchanges across the country, has shut down its online patient portal as it investigates a potential data breach that may have exposed sensitive medical information. The company said Friday that it closed the online portal for medical claims and other customer information while it examined a “security vulnerability.” It’s not clear how many patient records might have been exposed and for how long. The company has more than 4.8 million customers in 12 states and Puerto Rico. (Terhune, 5/26) Meanwhile, not everything is moving toward the technology of the future — NPR: In The Age Of Digital Medicine, The Humble Reflex Hammer Hangs On Receiving a diagnosis in 2017 — at least one made at a medical center outfitted with the latest clinical gadgetry — might include a scan that divides your body into a bread loaf of high-resolution digital slices. Your DNA might be fed through a gene sequencer that spits out your mortal code in a matter of hours. Even your smartphone might soon be used to uncover health problems. Yet nearly 130 years since its inception — after decades of science has mapped out our neuronal pathways — a simple knob of rubber with a metal handle remains one of medicine's most essential tools. I'm referring to the cheap, portable, easy-to-use reflex hammer. (Stetka, 5/28) This is part of the KHN Morning Briefing, a summary of health policy coverage from major news organizations.

Photograph: Essential Smartphones Android co-founder reveals new smartphone to take on Apple and Samsung The Essential Phone features a bezel-free screen, dual 13mp cameras and a 360˚ video plugin using a new port Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Alex Hern @alexhern Tuesday 30 May 2017 08.58 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 30 May 2017 12.08 EDT The co-founder of the Android operating system, Andy Rubin, has revealed his first new creation since leaving Google in 2014: a $699 Android phone that aims to take on Apple and Samsung for the high end of the mobile market. The phone, created by Rubin’s new firm, Essential, comes with the standard top-of-the-line setup in many areas: a 5.7in QHD display, a pair of 13MP rear cameras and an 8MP front-facing one, a 7.8mm thick body and USB-C connector at the base (although, taking a cue from Apple, there’s no headphone jack on the device). But the featureEssential hopes will make the phone stand out is hidden in two metallic dots on the back of the phone, to the right of the twin cameras. Those make up a new expansion port that allows accessories to be magnetically clipped straight into the device - providing structural stability as well as leaving the USB-C port free. At launch, there will be only one such accessory, a $199, 360˚ camera that peers over the edge of the phone and allows for video and photos to be taken and shared on the move. According to the Verge, others will follow, including a charging dock and the possibility of audio accessories to make up for the absent headphone jack. Aside from the new port, Essential also plans to jump into the lead in a few selected fields. The most eye-catching aspect of the device is its screen, which puts even the Galaxy S8 to shame: not only is it almost entirely bezel-free at the sides, it also extends the screen up to the very top of the device, past the selfie camera (which leaves a small black notch in the middle of the picture as a result). The Essential Phone also implements a trick previously seen in the Huawei P9 and P10 - the second rear camera contains a monochrome sensor, which responds better in low-light conditions, and can be used in conjunction with the main camera to handle extremely dark environments. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Also being launched by the company is the Google Home and Amazon Echo rival, the Essential Home. Photograph: Essential One thing we don’t know about the phone is when shoppers will be able to get their hands on it. No release date has been announced yet, and the device is currently only available for pre-order in the US. Alongside a phone, Essential also lifted the lid on a second product, which it calls Home. It shares similarities with its namesake, the Google Home: a small device designed to be left in the corner of a room, connected to the internet and used as a personal assistant for life admin tasks. But unlike the Google Home, or the Amazon Echo, Essential’s Home contains a large round touchscreen, and runs its own customised operating system called Ambient OS. Users can control their smart home devices, set timers and play music with the Essential Home, just like they can with its competitors, but they can also ask for directions and see them displayed on screen, or simply navigate the device manually rather than verbally. “The idea behind Essential Home is that technology is there, supportive, and proactive enough to be helpful, without forcing you to ask or type a question,” says Mara Segal, head of product for Essential’s parent company, Playground. “It’s in your environment; you can tap or glance at it, but it never intrudes or takes you away from the things that are important to you.” The Home has neither a price, nor a release date as yet.

In 2016, year-over-year growth was 2.5%, marking the lowest growth the industry has ever experienced. With several major devices entering the market this year, IDC anticipates shipment volumes will grow to 1.52 billion in 2017. And IDC expects this momentum to carry into 2018, when smartphone shipments are forecast to grow 4.5% year over year, fueled by improved economic conditions in many emerging markets and a full year of new iPhone shipments from Apple. "2016 was an interesting year for smartphones with some high-growth markets down and other mature markets like the U.S. and China outpacing global growth rates," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "Looking ahead, we continue to believe several factors will enable the smartphone market to regain some of its momentum. First and foremost is that less than half the world's population is currently using a smartphone, and markets like the Middle East & Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia still have plenty of room to grow. In addition, as consumers continue to demand more from their smartphones we expect to see a large portion of the installed base that is currently using low-end devices begin to seek a more robust experience on more capable devices. Media consumption, gaming, augmented and virtual reality, and constant connectivity are drivers of this trend." The other big topic in the smartphone industry is the intense fight for the high end of the market. Samsung has made a lot of noise with its recent Galaxy S8 and S8+ device launches, further proving that last year's Note 7 debacle is not going to alter the company's plans for remaining number one. And all signs point to late 2017 being one of Apple's biggest, if not the biggest, product announcements with the highly anticipated next round of iPhones. Despite the massive growth of the low-end smartphone market in the past few years, IDC still fully expects the high-end market will continue to hold its place in the industry. Advancements in computing, display technology, cameras, and storage will continue to create the need for high-end users to refresh their devices. "With the ongoing fight at the high end, vendors will need to find a way to innovate ahead of the curve to attract new users and increase shipments while driving profits," said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "The display looks like it could be the next battlefield for the smartphone over the next couple years. We have seen both Samsung and LG opt for new borderless 18:9 displays and Apple could be set to join the party later this year. As smartphone owners continue to consume media on their devices, the screen (bigger, brighter, and bolder) will be an integral part of the overall design language for each vendor. From flexible to foldable and everything between, 18:9 displays look to be just the beginning of what's to come." Platform Highlights Android: The discussion around Android's share of the smartphone market became irrelevant a few years back when it became clear that devices running Google's OS would continue to capture roughly 85% of the worldwide smartphone volume. What is interesting is to look at the many micro-trends going on within the platform. Despite a slew of very attractive high-end Android products, IDC continues to see Android average selling prices (ASPs) decline and expectations are that the 1.5 billion Android phones that ship in 2021 will have a collective ASP of $198. Looking closer at 2018, the Middle East & Africa region for Android devices is expected to be the fastest growing at 10% year over year, which will well outpace the forecast for worldwide growth of 4.1%. iOS: Coming off the first year in which iPhone shipments declined, expectations are that 2017 volumes will grow 3.8%. IDC slightly lowered its 2017 projections for Apple in this forecast to 223.6 million, while increasing its 2018 volumes to 240.4 million. All signs point to late 2017 and certainly 2018 being very strong for Apple as much of its installed base seems ready for a refresh and the next round of iPhones is not likely to disappoint its fans. Windows Phone: Windows Phone shipments continue to fall as the lack of new hardware partners, developer support, and overall enthusiasm for the platform show no immediate signs of recovery. IDC expects 2017 volumes to decline 80.9% to just 1.1 million units. Microsoft has yet to fully commit to any "Surface"-style attack for smartphones or to push new vendors to embrace the platform, leaving little hope of mounting a full scaled comeback in the years to come.   Worldwide Smartphone Platform Shipments, Market Share, Year-Over-Year Growth, and 5-Year CAGR, 2017 and 2021 (shipments in millions) Platform   2017 Shipment Volume*     2017 Market Share*     2017 Annual Growth*     2021 Shipment Volume*     2021 Market Share*     2021 Annual Growth*     2016-2021 CAGR* Android   1,290.7     85.1%     3.5%     1,491.1     85.5%     3.1%     3.6% iOS   223.6     14.7%     3.8%     252.1     14.5%     1.4%     3.2% Windows Phone   1.1     0.1%     -80.9%     0.3     0.0%     -18.0%     -44.8% Others   1.6     0.1%     -64.4%     1.0     0.1%     -5.3%       Total   1,517.0     100.0%     3.0%     1,744.6     100.0%     2.9%     3.4% Source: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, May 30, 2017 * Table Note: All figures are forecast projections.

Tech Apple Science Cars Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 WWDC 2017 E3 2017 Prime Day 2017     MacBook Delivery Dates Lengthen Ahead Of Rumored Refresh Posted: May 30 2017, 5:47am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, Updated: May 30 2017, 11:23pm CDT, in News | Apple     Only 15-inch MacBook Pro delivery times are slipping. There are a few sure fire ways to tell if Apple has plans for new products to be launched. One of the best is to watch the delivery dates of products. Apple tends to stop production of existing versions in the build up to the launch of new versions of the devices, which means delivery dates on the current generation of whatever product it is start to lengthen. Download: The Tracker App Notifies You when a Hot Product is in Stock This is exactly what is happening right now with the MacBook Pro notebooks. Delivery dates have slipped to between June 6-8 for free delivery a June 5-7 for the fastest delivery. Rumors continue to suggest that an update for the MacBook range will be landing at WWDC kicking off next month. The long ignored MacBook Air is tipped for a refresh as well. The update for the range is expected to include Kaby Lake processors and if you are hoping for a refresh to the external design, sorry to say only internal upgrades are expected. Something of note is that only the 15-inch MacBook Pro model ship dates have slipped. This has led to some speculation that perhaps only the larger MacBook Pro models will be updated at WWDC. Or perhaps Apple was simply sitting on a larger stockpile of the smaller machines. That said, Apple has chosen in the past to launch refreshed 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks at different times. This happened in 2012 when the Retina MacBooks first landed, the 15-inch version launched in June and the 13-inch flavor didn't land until October reports MacRumors. Delivery dates for 15-inch MacBook Pros of current generation are similarly long in most other markets as well. The last update for the MacBook line came in October 2016 and if the macs get an update next month it will be the fastest refresh for the MacBook Pro line in a while.

Tech Apple Science Cars Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 WWDC 2017 E3 2017 Prime Day 2017     Nintendo Switch Success Causes Fight Between Nintendo And Apple Posted: May 30 2017, 6:55am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple and Nintendo reportedly fight over parts in the supply chain. The success of the Nintendo Switch has Nintendo scramble for electronic parts in the Asian supply chain. Nintendo has changed the production goal for the Nintendo Switch from 10 to 18 million units for the fiscal year ending April, 2018. Now the target is even 20 million according to a new report. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock "Nintendo has told suppliers and assemblers it hopes to make nearly 20 million units of the Switch device in the year ending March 2018, people involved in the discussions said. Though the company’s official sales target for the year is 10 million, strong demand suggests it can sell many more—if it can make them," said Takashi Mochizuki in a new Wall Street Journal report. This ramp up requires the procuration of essential components such as NAND chips and vibration actuators. In the electronic component market Nintendo is now clashing with companies like Apple. The Cupertino giant is preparing the new iPhones for the fall release. Apple is designing more and more components themselves, but they still rely on lots of standard components as well for the iPhone. Especially NAND is in short supply according to the report. The component shortage is likely keeping Nintendo from reaching the 20 million unit goal. The supply of the Nintendo Switch has dried up again ahead of E3. A new major shipment is expected in time for the E3 2017 and the ARMS release on June 16. This Summer brings already two blockbuster Nintendo Switch games. Besides Arms in June, Splatoon 2 will be released on July 21. Amazon offers ARMS on sale for $50.99 for everyone and Prime members pay $47.99. At the moment there is no way to buy a Nintendo Switch console online. GameStop has sold out of its $399.99 Nintendo Switch bundles. Select Walmart stores received the Switch on Memorial Day. There is no sign of fresh inventory on Tuesday yet. Nintendo is expected to supply retailer with substantial Switch stock in time for the ARMS release on June 16. The once again high-riding Japanese video game maker has done the same with the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

Roberts' Apple Park coverage dates back to March 2016, and fellow drone pilot Duncan Sinfield has been providing aerial footage for Apple's new workspace since 2015. In the new video, a closer glimpse at the Steve Jobs Theater is provided, with some of the window coverings having been removed since the last update. The auditorium is still one of the areas of the campus that's under heavy construction, as it isn't expected to officially open until sometime later this year. Roberts also captured one of the first glimpses of the historic Glendenning Barn that Apple has finished reconstructing and placed at Apple Park. Built in 1916, the historic Cupertino barn has deep ties to the city's agricultural past and was located at the planned site for Apple Campus 2. During preparation for the construction of Apple Park, Apple carefully deconstructed the building plank by plank and made notes on how to rebuild it exactly the same. Now, the company has done just that and remade the Glendenning Barn at Apple Park, residing next to the employee fitness center and in the middle of what will eventually be a larger collection of fruit trees once landscaping on the campus is finished. Other spots at Apple Park highlighted in Roberts' new video include the parking garage, R&D facility, and the Spaceship building itself. Yesterday, Apple quietly updated Apple Maps to include 3D models of these buildings in the mapping app, as well as access roads around Apple Park. Apple recently gave Wired a behind-the-scenes look into Apple Park, including tidbits about Steve Jobs' connection to the campus, a look into the "Ring" building's original design, and detailed images of the campus' construction and interiors.

Forget iOS. Forget Tim Cook. Don’t fall for the marketing ploys. Don’t listen to the fanboy platitudes. In 2017, there’s only one mobile operating system that’s innovating, growing, and developing: Android. This assertion isn’t based on personal preferences or online rumors. It’s not borne out of a dislike for Apple or a loathing of iOS. It’s grounded in cold, hard facts. Don’t believe me? Keep reading to find out why 2017 is the year of Android. App Stores Projections Technology lives or dies by its popularity. There’s a reason VHS beat Betamax in the first battle for your living room, and Internet Explorer smashed Netscape Navigator into the trashcan of history: user numbers. And right now, the various projections don’t make happy reading for Apple and iOS. In late-2016, App Annie released its annual report. It found that over the course of the previous 12 months, global app downloads had risen by 15 percent, time spent using apps had increased by 25 percent, and money paid to developers had grown by 40 percent. The report suggested users in China and other emerging markets fueled a significant part of the growth. And which operating system is most popular in China? It’s Android, by miles. The most recent figures from Statista show Android boasts a mammoth 74.44 percent market share, compared to iOS’s 24.74 percent. Worryingly for Apple, the percentages have barely moved in the last four years. If anything, Android is the operating system that’s been slowly stealing users away from Windows Mobile and other defunct platforms. It’s the same story in countries like Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Indonesia. They’re the places that’ll be driving app store growth in the next decade — markets in Europe and the United States have almost reached saturation point. The Future So what does the future look like? App Annie says the number of handsets will grow from 2.6 billion in 2015 to 6.2 billion in 2020, and the Play Store will be the clear beneficiary.

That means all users get access to the Google Play Store, have access to native Chromecast technology, and can use Google Assistant. It’s yet another avenue in which Android will be picking up users, often without them even being aware. Of course, Apple offers Apple TV devices. But a report from eMarketer provides yet more worrying news for the company. It says the devices now control just 11.9 percent of the connected TV market, down from 13.5 percent 12 months ago. Chromecast boasts 19.9 percent (up 1.5 percent) and Roku has 18.2 (up 3 percent). Fuchsia Right now, Google’s various operating systems are still fragmented: Android, Android TV, Chromecast, ChromeOS, and so on. It’s a problem Microsoft has also struggled with as it’s attempted to expand Windows for the 21st century. In this regard, Apple has been the winner in the last decade. The company’s marketing team have religiously stuck to “i[Device]” branding, and the OSX and iOS platforms have been clearly designated as “for desktop” and “for mobile.” But the tide is turning. We’re at a crossroads. It’s no longer only about desktop and mobile — it’s about everything. Once again, Google appears to be one step ahead of the game. It’s developing an entirely new operating system: Project Fuchsia. We don’t know much about the system at the moment. All we’ve seen is some code on GitHub from August 2016. However, clues in the code suggest something grand is coming. Some experts have said it looks like the OS will be able to run on everything from self-driving cars to traffic lights — with smartphones, tablets, and PCs very much included. Is Google going to replace Android? Is Fuchsia the operating system for life I referred to earlier? It’s very possible. If the rumors are true, you need to get onto the Android operating system now. When you’re eventually upgraded to Fuchsia, you’ll realize it was one of the smartest tech decisions you ever made. The End of Android’s Childhood? Android has been part of our lives since September 2008. At the time, it was hard to imagine quite what a juggernaut the operating system would become. To many, it’s already grown up. It’s fast, fluid, sleek, professional, and millions of user around the world love it. But I don’t think it has grown up. If anything, it’s only just starting to embark on its teenage years. Over the next few years, you’ll see it grow a beard, start university, and get married. It might even change its name. 2017 is more than the year of Android. It’s the start of the decade of Android. Disagree? Can Apple respond to the ever-increasing threat of Android domination? Or is it happy to consign itself to being a luxury brand for the few?

Reply Andy S. May 30, 2017 at 2:32 pm Your comparisons in the second section only make sense if you're being willfully ignorant of the salient details. VHS beat Betamax in terms of user numbers, sure. And Betamax disappeared as a result. But that's because lower user numbers also meant that Betamax as a technology ceased to be profitable. As it stands, the iOS ecosystem remains profitable. iOS isn't going away any time soon. It's also an unfortunate comparison, considering that Betamax is still considered to have been technologically superior to VHS. Using the VHS vs. Betamax analogy as your evidence of how high user numbers are the important factor in a platform war isn't exactly complimentary of Android. IE had greater user numbers than Netscape, but only because it was pre-installed on every Windows PC, and Windows PCs were the dominant computing platform. Did IE really "smash" Netscape Navigator, though? Not really. After Netscape was bought by AOL, the technology behind Navigator eventually grew into what we know today as Mozilla Firefox. Now, ask yourself: how many people do you know who use IE as their primary browser? You're more likely to find out that someone is a Firefox user than an IE user these days.

First victim of London Bridge attack named as Chrissy Archibald New leaks by Apple expert Benjamin Geskin – based on leaks from within Apple’s supply chain – seem to confirm the new ‘all screen’ look. There will be no Home button on the gadget – and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner will be embedded within the display. #iPhone8 CAD pic.twitter.com/sZknEva03A — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 28, 2017 #iPhone8 CAD (now with back) pic.twitter.com/2X7roohQRn — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 29, 2017 #iPhone8 visualization (original https://t.co/8gDzWR4GIs) pic.twitter.com/O1OaTGCyt6 — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 29, 2017 A report in China’s Economic Daily News, based on a leak from iPhone chipset maker TSMC, suggests that the phone may also change shape. The report suggests that the phone could shift to an 18.5:9 aspect ratio – similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and LG’s G6. Here's what to expect from iPhone 8 It’s ten years since Steve Jobs stood up on a stage and said, ‘Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along and changes everything.’ But this year’s iPhone looks set to rip up the rule book once again – with the latest rumour confirming BIG changes to the screen. Earlier this year, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED screens from Samsung – an all-new screen technology with deeper blacks and brighter colours. The screen is also expected to be curved at the edges, like on Samsung’s flagship S8 handset, according to previous analyst reports. ‘Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,’ David Hsieh of HSI Markit. The device could also be absolutely huge, according to an earlier report. Rumours from sources speaking to Nikkei Asian Review suggests that this year will see a third, 5.8-inch iPhone model – with a higher price tag.

In einem offenen Brief wenden sich viele europäische Verlage, auch DER SPIEGEL und SPIEGEL ONLINE, gegen den Entwurf. DPA Gebäude der EU-Kommission in Brüssel Dienstag, 30.05.2017   14:03 Uhr Drucken Nutzungsrechte Feedback Kommentieren Mit ihrer geplanten Neufassung der sogenannten ePrivacy-Richtlinie will die EU-Kommission es Nutzern leichter machen, mit Cookies umzugehen. Viele europäische Verlage glauben aber, dass die Kommission mit ihrem Vorschlag über dieses Ziel hinausschießt. Die Unternehmen sehen ihre Geschäftsmodelle in Gefahr. Gleichzeitig begünstige der Plan die Konzepte von Internetkonzernen wie Google, Facebook, Apple und Microsoft. Derzeit muss jede Webseite ihre Nutzer darüber aufklären, wenn sie Cookies nutzt und dafür die Zustimmung des Nutzers einholen. Man kennt das von vielen Webseiten, auf denen man so lange einen entsprechenden Hinweis angezeigt bekommt, bis man ihn wegklickt oder eben zustimmt. Die kleinen Dateien sammeln Informationen über das Surfverhalten der Nutzer. Die EU-Kommission will das Zustimmungsverfahren nun ändern. Ihr Plan sieht vor, dass man künftig nur noch ein Mal dem Setzen von Cookies zustimmen soll, nämlich wenn man den Browser öffnet. Diese Zustimmung würde dann aber nur für die Betreiber der Webseiten gelten, Cookies von Drittanbietern würden blockiert. Betroffen davon wären auch die Cookies, die Betreiber von Werbenetzwerken setzen. Diese Praxis wäre aus Sicht der Verlage problematisch. Sie verdienen unter anderem damit Geld, ihren Lesern personalisierte Inhalte und Werbung auszuspielen. Dafür braucht man auch Cookies von Drittanbietern. Zudem werden Cookies von den Verlagen verwendet, um Werbetreibenden gegenüber nachweisen zu können, wie viele Leser man hat. Ohne solche Cookies könnte eine Nachrichtenseite wie SPIEGEL ONLINE dem Leser nicht kostenlos angeboten werden. Die Verlage fürchten nun, dass es mit der neuen Regelung "unglaublich schwierig wird, Leser davon zu überzeugen, ihre Browsereinstellungen so zu ändern, dass diese die Nutzung von Drittanbieter-Cookies zulassen", heißt es in dem offenen Brief. Auch DER SPIEGEL und SPIEGEL ONLINE haben ihn mit unterzeichnet. Im Ergebnis fürchtet man gegenüber den "dominierenden digitalen Plattformen" Nachteile beim Wettbewerb um Werbegelder, heißt es weiter. Diese würden "letztlich unsere Möglichkeiten untergraben, in Europa in hochklassigen Journalismus zu investieren." Im Folgenden geben wir den offenen Brief im Wortlaut wieder: Open letter to the European Parliament / Council Trust, privacy and news - the need to rethink ePrivacy proposals We support the objective of the Commission's draft "ePrivacy" regulation, which has the potential to clean up the digital economy, and to restore citizen trust in how their data is used online. Citizens are rightly concerned about the use of their personal data by third party companies of whom they have never heard, and have no idea about the role that they play in their digital lives online. News organisations depend on the trust of our readers, and we support a system of regulation that restores trust, and cleans up the digital environment. But news organisations also use data generated by readers to improve their products and services by offering readers journalism that is relevant to them, and serving display digital advertising that is relevant to readers. As a result of digital distribution, more digital citizens are accessing high quality news and quality information than ever before. But the increasing trend towards consumers accessing news content via third party gateways such as Google News, Facebook, Yahoo, Apple News, MSN (Microsoft) and Amazon Alexa is changing the way that European citizens consume news[1], making publishers ever more reliant on a small number of global platforms as a consequence. Through the current ePrivacy proposals, the Commission proposes that digital citizens must consent to non-strictly necessary tracking on a global basis when they connect to the Internet via a browser interface. Given that 90 per cent of usage across Europe is concentrated in the hands of just four companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla[2], this focus on obtaining user permission via the browser interface has the potential to exacerbate the asymmetry of power between individual publishers and these global digital gateways. The ePrivacy proposals contrast with the implication of the Commission's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - due to come into force in May 2018 - which aims to empower user privacy by forcing sites themselves to make sure that users understand and are empowered to control the gathering of data about their browsing behaviour in context of each site that they visit. By creating a single global permission within the browser interface, the Commission's ePrivacy proposals will make it more difficult to ensure transparency and meaningful user empowerment in practice, and remove any distinction between publishers who place a high value on the trust of their users, and those who do not. While the explanatory memorandum accompanying the ePrivacy proposals does not place an outright ban on publishers communicating with readers in order to seek consent for the use of 3rd party cookies, in practice, publishers are concerned that it will be incredibly difficult to persuade readers to change their browser settings to allow 3rd party cookies. As a consequence, individual news organisations would be unable to provide readers with personalised content and marketing, or serve relevant digital advertising within their environments. The practice of serving relevant advertising to readers is now an established norm in the advertising industry, and is essential to ensure that publishers can compete with Google and Facebook who already control 20% of total global advertising spend in 2017[3]. If as a result of these proposals, news publishers were unable to serve relevant advertising to our readers, this would reduce our ability to compete with the capabilities of dominant digital platforms for digital advertising revenues, ultimately undermining our ability to invest in high quality journalism across Europe. The current ePrivacy proposals will result in the data of European digital citizens being concentrated in the hands of a few global companies, as a result of which, digital citizens will become less protected. It will give those global companies: a tighter grip on the personal data of European digital citizens; further strengthen their dominance in the European digital economy, and; introduce further complexity for individual publishers, despite the European Commission acknowledging these issues are already covered by the regulation that will enter into force in 2018. By shifting consent to the collection of data from each individual news site that they visit, to providing a global consent via a small number of powerful gateways, the Commission's proposals threaten to prevent news organisations from delivering basic functionality such as the marketing of products and services, the tailoring of news products to the needs and desires of news consumers, and relevant and acceptable advertising. The impact on news organisations would be to reduce their ability to deliver high quality products and services, and undermine their ability to generate advertising revenues to reinvest in journalism. Therefore it is essential that in implementing the objectives of the "ePrivacy" proposals, the European Parliament / Council must work with the news industry to ensure that the directive provides flexibility of implementation to encourage a direct relationship between each internet user and the trusted news organisations that they visit, not further undermine it. [1] 1 The latest Reuters News Report - which surveyed citizens across the world - found that " half (51%) say they use social media as a source of news each week. More than a quarter of 18-24s say social media (28%) are their main source of news - more than television (24%) for the first time." As a result of these changes, the Reuters survey found that the "growth of news accessed and increasingly consumed via social networks, portals and mobile apps means that the originating news brand gets clearly noticed less than half the time in the UK, and Canada. In countries like Japan and South Korea, where aggregated and distributed news is already more widespread, the brand only gets noticed around a quarter of the time when accessed through news portals."

Ist also kein Schaden, höchstens für die Content-Anbieter - denen kann man dann ja Kompensation anbieten für Leser, die ohne Werbung trotzdem Sachen kaufen.

In this particular report we cover one of Apple's original head mounted display patents and another patent for advanced features for Apple TV with Siri that have yet to fully be implemented. Apple was also granted a design patent for their iPad Air. We wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.   Granted Patent: Enhanced Image Display in Head-Mounted Displays   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to processing and displaying images in a head-mounted display. According to one embodiment, the invention provides methods and apparatus for providing a wider field of view and creating a more natural viewing situation for a user of a head mounted display, which results in improved comfort and usability for head mounted displays. By using larger displays inside the HMDs and recreating each image displayed on each display as each eye would typically see it, a wider field of view and increased viewing comfort is achieved. Various embodiments of the invention allow users to customize different viewing parameters of the head mounted displays to accommodate for individual user variation in the users' eyes.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 shows us a schematic view of the placement of the displays relative to the user's eyes in a HMD with two displays.   Apple's granted patent 9,667,954 was originally filed in Q4 2006 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Granted Patent: Intelligent Automated Assistant for TV User Interactions   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to controlling television user interactions and, more specifically, to processing speech for a virtual assistant to control television user interactions.   Today's granted patent covers Siri for TV and illustrates aspects of Apple TV yet to come as noted below in the patent figures.

Patent history shows that Apple was granted their first patent for this invention in 2014. Today's granted patent presents much greater patent claim details than the original patent.   Some of the new points in this patent's claims include the use of a television program listing; analyzing the speech input using voice recognition; showing status of a live sporting event and more while watching other content.   Apple Granted a Design Patent for their iPad Air   Apple was granted design patent D788, 014 for their iPad Air.   Apple was also granted a design patent of their lighting connector under number D788,041   The Remaining Patents granted to Apple Today   Note: In order to see a clearer image of the list above, simply click on the image above to enlarge it.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Setting the stage for iPhone 8? Apple releases 'Switch To iPhone' ads flaunting security and smoothness Releasing the 'Switch To iPhone' ads is a timely move by Apple as the hype for iPhone 8 is gaining momentum. Kukil Bora   May 30, 2017 17:15 IST Months before the iPhone 8 release, Apple tries to persuade Android users to switch to iPhones.Apple Apple knows how to cash in on the excitement among people before the launch of a new iPhone. Although the company's next flagship phone, dubbed iPhone 8, is still months away, people have already started talking about it and the Apple's bid to proselytise Android users to iPhone is hitting the right buttons. On Monday, the Cupertino tech giant released three new videos as part of its "Switch to iPhone" campaign, highlighting key differences between iPhone and Android phones while also telling consumers that making the switch to iPhone is easier than it seems. "Life is easier on the iPhone. And that starts as soon as you turn it on," Apple said on its website. Unlike previously released videos that emphasised the iPhone's capabilities across music, privacy, and photos, the three new videos focus on the handset's security, contacts and performance. In the video related to "Security", Apple claims iPhones are less vulnerable to data theft compared to Android devices. The "Smooth" video, on the other hand, shows how better an iPhone can perform over other phones, regardless of device specifications. The "Contacts" video is the only one of the three videos where Apple is not attacking rivals but simply suggests that migrating contacts to iOS is easy peasy. Take a look at the videos: Security Smooth Contacts Setting the stage of iPhone 8? The release of the new "Switch To iPhone" videos is a timely move by Apple to set off a domino effect leading to the release of iPhone 8. Being the company's tenth anniversary model, the 2017 iPhone 8 is expected to have exciting new features to take on the likes of recently launched Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. One of the much-hyped features of the iPhone 8 is an edge-to-edge OLED screen without the physical home button. The revamped design also suggests that the new iPhone will carry an optical fingerprint recognition sensor embedded to its display. #iPhone8 visualization (original https://t.co/8gDzWR4GIs) pic.twitter.com/O1OaTGCyt6 — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 29, 2017 The iPhone 8 could also come with a bigger 18.5:9 screen ratio, along with new augmented reality features which, if turns out to be true, guarantee a stiff fight between Apple and Samsung in the premium segment. In addition to a bezel-less display, the iPhone 8 could also feature two vertically placed rear cameras-- a drastic change from the existing iPhone 7 Plus camera setup. According to some experts, the repositioning of rear cameras will add more detail and depth of field to the images. Other features expected to be included in the new iPhone are 128GB and 256GB storage options, wireless charging and 3D face-recognition. If ongoing rumours are to believed, Apple might host a product launch event on September 17 to unveil the iPhone 8, as well as the iPhone 7s and the 7s Plus, followed by their release on September 25. However, it's too early to go by these reports as there is no official word from Apple regarding the same. Stay tuned for more updates on Apple and the iPhone 8.

Designed by Foster + Partners and Apple, this long-awaited flagship store—called Apple Orchard Road—takes cues from Singapore’s lush environment and features mature trees inside and outside the shop. Home to the world’s largest Genius Grove, Apple Orchard Road is considered one of Foster + Partners’ “greenest Apple spaces yet” and is entirely powered by renewable energy. Welcomed with extreme fanfare and a ten-hour-long, 2,000-person queue, Apple Orchard Road is the first official Apple Store in Southeast Asia. The two-story building is located in the heart of the Singapore, known as the garden city, along tree-lined Orchard Road. Inspired by the city’s garden themes, the designers crafted the building with a strong focus on community and connection to nature. Eight mature trees were planted in front of the store to create a shaded “green orchard” that serves as a new public gathering space. The 120-foot wide glazed storefront blurs the boundaries between inside and outside, an illusion strengthened by the installation of mature trees within the shop. A thin, white canopy cantilevers out 25 feet to provide solar shading.

The world’s largest Genius Grove on the mezzanine contains twelve Ficus Ali trees.

He certainly could have: After an illustrious career developing some of the most innovative products in tech, he had all the wealth and accolades anyone could want. As an engineer at the Apple spinoff General Magic, he built some of the world’s first internet-connected portable devices. As CEO at Danger, he created the Sidekick, a smartphone that defined the category before anyone had invented the term. And then, of course, Rubin created Android, the operating system found in more than two billion phones, televisions, cars, and watches. But Rubin wasn’t done. More to the point, he couldn’t be done. Ask around, and everyone says the same thing: Andy Rubin sees the future, and can’t sit around waiting for it to arrive. He’s spent the past few years watching Apple and Google and everyone else try to rule the world from walled gardens, and he considers that a dead end. Rubin has always believed that the open platform is the one that wins. Most people complain that there’s no innovation in smartphones. Andy Rubin disagrees. Vehemently. And so he’s back, as the CEO of Essential Products, his first company since Android. He wants to make Essential the first great gadget maker since Apple, one that builds and distributes the open platform that will power the billions of phones, watches, light bulbs, and toaster ovens about to come online. That wasn’t always the plan. Rubin likes telling a story from just after he left Google, where he spent a decade running Android and a few years leading its robotics projects. Over dinner and wine, he and his wife, Rie, discussed his next move. “How do I top Android?” Rubin asked. “What could I possibly do that would be bigger than that?” “Don’t do one thing,” Rie replied. “Do 10.” And so Rubin launched Playground, a venture capital firm where a few dozen engineers and designers at Playground Studios help startups build stuff. Read More Jason Tanz Andy Rubin Unleashed Android on the World. Now Watch Him Do the Same With AI Wired Staff Andy Rubin, Crispr, and Amazon Star at WIRED Business Conference 2017 Daniel Roth Google’s Open Source Android OS Will Free the Wireless Web Ryan Tate Andy Rubin and the Great Narrowing of Google Rubin and his partners sought out a wide range of investments. “You meet a ton of people, thousands of people,” he says. “Some really crazy ideas, some pretty good ideas, some teams that are great, some teams that are not that great.” As he speaks, Rubin curls his lanky body into a comfortable chair at the head of a long table in the same room where he met many of those people. He fidgets as he talks and touches his stubbled face as he thinks. Now and then, he walks over to the whiteboard to diagram his points. “We thought that people weren’t swinging for the fences and doing big-vision things in consumer products,” he says. All of which is to say, there hasn’t been an Apple since Apple, and Rubin figures it’s time. Essential launches publicly today with the announcement of two products expected later this summer: a $699 smartphone called Phone and a smart-home hub called Home that Rubin hopes will bring order to the endless standards, protocols, and systems wrought by the Internet of Things. To understand what Essential hopes to achieve in the long term, look at the hub. Rubin wants to build an open source, infinitely extensible platform, called Ambient OS, that powers all the smart stuff in your home. Android for everything. But even Rubin concedes that it will take a while. If you want to know how he plans on getting there, we need to talk about the Phone. Carlos Chavarría for WIRED Take a Bite Most people look at smartphones and see one of the largest and most competitive markets in history, one with no room (or profits) for anyone but Apple or Samsung. And most people complain that there’s no innovation. Rubin disagrees. Vehemently. He sees loads of innovation, but believes companies don’t take advantage of it because they’re simply too big. “When Apple finds some new technology, they’re like, ‘Great, can I have 50 million next quarter?’ Manufacturers are like, ‘No, you can’t. We just invented it,'” he says. Meanwhile, companies design by committee—with too much input from supply chain experts and accountants—and everything moves slowly. If Essential sells 50 million phones this quarter, Jason Keats, the company’s head of product architecture, is totally screwed. Essential simply cannot produce that many phones. That’s the point. “We’ve gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren’t designed to support 50 million devices,” he says. He wants Essential to think like a high-end watchmaker, not a commodity gadget builder. (Granted, everyone says this, even the commodity gadget builders.) From the start, Essential’s designers and engineers met with countless manufacturers in search of the most interesting technology and materials, especially stuff no one could produce at scale. “We’re not for everybody,” Keats says. “You know it’s going to be a little exclusive.” Gadgets used to say something about their buyers, communicating fashion sense or nerd cred. Now that everyone has an iPhone or a Galaxy, neither say anything. Everybody at Essential hates the idea that you, your grandma, and your accountant all carry the same phone. Gadgets once said something about the people who carried them. They communicated fashion sense or nerd cred. Now they’re as personal as refrigerators. Rubin wants the Essential phone to clearly and emphatically state that the person carrying it isn’t won over by marketing, isn’t a fanboy, isn’t driven by trends. Jason Keats, Essential’s head of hardware architecture and noted prototyping enthusiast.Carlos Chavarria for WIRED People who buy an Essential phone, he says, want technology that works for them, not the other way around. The team knew from the beginning that it wanted to build a titanium phone. The material offers far greater durability and, perhaps equally important, sounds so damn cool. But machining titanium is expensive and wasteful. “So we literally traveled around the world to find somebody who could process in a different way,” Keats says. Essential eventually found a small German company that injection-molds the material, which involves pouring molten titanium into a mold rather than milling it from a block. Injection molding typically results in greater porosity than milling, but this company (which Keats won’t name) figured out how to, in Keats’ words, make it “super, super dense.” More than one Essential employee told me, with more than a little glee, that Apple tried to make the next iPhone from titanium, but couldn’t make it work. Dave Evans, Essential’s head of design, came from Playground Global to help make a new kind of gadget.Carlos Chavarría for WIRED Shaping the Future The Essential team wanted to make something unique, something fresh and exciting. But everyone knew people weren’t ready for a wild new form factor or radical technology. The team spent hours cutting plexiglass into every conceivable shape, just so people could see how it felt in their hands. Dave Evans, the company’s head of design, especially liked a subtle hourglass shape. “It would cradle your hand really, really gracefully,” he says. “The grip was fantastic.” Essential’s goal is to become the first great gadget maker since Apple. Still, Essential went with a rectangle and an off-the-shelf camera, because why reinvent the wheel? Look for the weird, wild stuff later. For now, Essential is focused on finally getting the smartphone right. “Product design for me isn’t more complicated than just building a product for myself,” Rubin says. He buys every phone—they cover virtually every surface of his office—and they all leave him wanting. “It could be something as simple as bad battery life, or a user interface that was unusable, or a bunch of fluff and bloatware that I didn’t need.” The Phone, Rubin says, is the phone he always wanted. It has no branding whatsoever. It doesn’t even have a name beyond Essential Phone, because it’s not Essential’s phone, it’s yours. (As long as you can afford the blistering sticker price.) It runs Android, pure as the driven snow, with no bloatware or customized interface. Aside from a small notch for the front-facing 8-megapixel camera, the 5.7-inch screen has no bezel. It runs the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, along with 4 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage. Internally, at least, Essential didn’t try to change the game—it just tried to win. On paper, this thing looks great, even if it isn’t waterproof. Let’s Connect The most important feature is a pair of tiny dots on the back, up there on the right. It’s a magnetic dock for attaching accessories. Essential created a modular handset, but not in the build-a-phone sense of the Moto Z or Project Ara. Rubin calls it “a new notion of what an accessory is, and trying to make the accessory as future-proof as possible.” Ultimately, Essential’s success or failure hinges on what comes after the smartphone. As other manufacturers ditch headphone jacks and connectors, they render entire accessory lines obsolete. Rubin loves to mention the iPod docks with 30-pin connectors you still see in hotel rooms. He wants to make sure your Essential add-ons never go out of style. “Let’s say I come up with a new phone in the future,” Rubin says. “And let’s say it looks nothing like this. I don’t want the person who bought an accessory to have to throw it out and buy the new accessory for the new form factor.” Accessories for the phone will work on the smart-home hub, through the same connector, and will work with whatever Essential makes next. Rubin believes consumers want a beautiful, usable phone and the flexibility to decide what it does and how it works. The Essential’s first accessory isn’t, strictly speaking, an accessory. It’ll ship in the box with the phone as part of the device: a 360-degree camera, barely larger than your thumb. There’s no companion app or Bluetooth pairing; the phone simply treats it like an internal camera. It’s the smallest, simplest 360 camera you’ll find anywhere. Other accessories are coming later, and Essential plans to open source the docking system so others can build cool stuff for it. The 360 camera offers a compelling glimpse of where Rubin sees this going. Most of the 360 cameras on the market are cumbersome and complicated and not very good. Essential believes something seamless and integrated will push the technology into the mainstream. That approach helped Apple become the biggest company on the planet—MP3 players existed before the iPod, and smartphones existed before the iPhone, but Apple seemed like the first company to nail those two ideas. Essential exists in no small part because Rubin believes Apple can’t do that anymore. He wants to pick up where Apple left off. This Time, It’s Personal Ultimately, Essential’s success or failure hinges on what comes after the Phone. Rubin’s interest lies in artificial intelligence and robots. He hopes Ambient OS, and the smart gadgets it will control, is his true spiritual successor to Android. It’s the open source Internet of Things platform he’s surprised no one has built. The Home, coming a little later this year, is designed to choreograph all the smart devices in your home, finally making them all work together. The team built a system that combines SmartThings, HomeKit, Nest, and the rest, futzing in the background with the public APIs in order to make everything work seamlessly together. It works with Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant, has a touchscreen and voice control. Rubin hopes it’ll feel like you’re interacting with your home, not a gizmo in your living room. The Essential Phone has no branding, no logos, and no bezels. It’s supposed to be all pixels.Carlos Chavarría for WIRED All the smart home stuff is still coming into focus, though. Essential started with a phone because it is your most important and most intimate device, and one you already understand. And so the revolution must start there. “You have to slipstream into the ways society works,” Rubin says. He mentions Google Glass, which failed not because the tech was bad but because the world wasn’t ready to wear them. Still, the Phone feels personal to Rubin. Near the end of our time together, he walks over to a large shelf in his office and starts picking up devices he created in his previous jobs. He shows me an early Sidekick prototype, made to test the opening and closing of the complex hinge. One shelf up sits a Sony MagicLink, the proto-PDA he helped create in the ’90s at General Magic. You could argue that only Steve Jobs played a bigger role in the mobile revolution. And yet Rubin can’t stop trying to build the phone he’s always wanted. Go Back to Top.

The June 2017 Apple Park aerial update shows a historic barn finally taking its place at the new headquarters while offering a closer look at the auditorium as some of the window coverings have been removed. Check out the video below to see the latest progress from Apple Park. Apple’s new headquarters will include a spot for the 1916 Glendenning Ranch barn, a historic site left from a time when the city was still a sprawling orchard. When Apple acquiered the aging Hewlett-Packard campus, it dismantled the barn and numbered it piece by piece—every plank, nail and crossbeam—so that it could be reassembled just as it was and placed so that it’s adjacent to the employee fitness center. The company even stockpiled redwood salvaged from an old grove to replace any damaged planks. The Mercury News reported that the barn will be used as a storage facility used by Apple to store sports equipment, landscaping supplies and so forth—becoming a working barn for the first time in decade. Apple says its new headquarters will be the most energy-efficient office building of its kind.

See related  iPhone 7 vs 6S: Should you upgrade or wait for the iPhone 8? The Week Unwrapped podcast 20: Babymaking apps and bad-taste jokes Can Microsoft's Surface Studio challenge Apple's iMac? Dubbed the "Apple Neural Engine", the website says the processor could "improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence".  The company's latest smartphone, the iPhone 7, currently runs some of its AI tasks using the image signal processor and the graphics processing unit integrated on its A10 Fusion chip, says Forbes. "By having a more dedicated processor to more efficiently run those algorithms, Apple could speed up the image recognition as well as reduce drain on the iPhone's battery", the site adds.   While the Cupertino-based company has bundled its Siri AI assistant on its smartphones since 2011, Bloomberg says that the firm's "early advantage in voice-recognition" has since been overtaken by the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home.  But a dedicated AI processor could be integrated into devices such as driverless cars and "gadgets that run augmented reality (AR)", adds the site, helping the company regain its advantage in consumer AI.  A processor designed solely for AI tasks would not be the first chip dedicated to iPhone functions, says MacRumors, as all Apple smartphones since 2013's iPhone 5S "have included a motion coprocessor used to collect and store sensor data".  The motion coprocessor can continually track movement and other sensor data "without using significant battery" on iPhones and iPads, which the site says can also run functions such as the "Hey Siri" voice command system.  It's not yet known whether the "Neural Engine" will appear on Apple's rumoured iPhone 8 later this year, but AppleInsider suggests that the AI processor could be announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, which runs from 5 to 9 June.

Businesses across the country saw the rates they pay to the Government go up after properties were revalued last year for the first time in seven years. Business rates are a tax based on the rental value of a property.  In March’s budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond unveiled a series of measures to cushion the blow after some businesses complained that they faced rates going up by many multiples. Read more Philip Hammond's firm got business rates cut in Budget, figures show Mr Hammond promised that those who lost small business rate relief, which applies to firms with property worth less than a certain threshold, would not be handed rate rises of more than £50 per month. However, several small businesses have told the BBC they have received no help. Jane Antoniades, who runs a florist in Whitstable said she faced a rates increase of more than three times during a five year period. She has yet to receive any relief on her current bill, almost three months after Mr Hammond’s announcement. “So far I've had to pay £437.08 per month, instead of just over £200. It's a huge difference,” she told the BBC. ”We haven't got the capacity to pay this extra money. It's going to have a real impact on our business if we can't claw this money back soon and start paying the right amount,“ Ms Antoniades said. Business picture of the day 29 show all Business picture of the day 1/29 UK car production slumps by nearly a fifth in April as timing of Easter bites - Thursday May 24 UK car manufacturing plummeted by almost a fifth in April, as the timing of Easter ate into the number of production days in the month. Reuters 2/29 Marks and Spencer reports slump in profit hurt by clothing sales and cost of new food stores - Wednesday 24 May High street stalwart Marks and Spencer has reported a more than 60 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the year to the end of March, hurt by a decline in clothing sales and higher costs from opening new food stores. Pre-tax profit came in at £176.4m for the year, while sales were broadly steady at £10.6bn. Food revenue was up 4.2 per cent. Reuters 3/29 Apple named world’s most value company in tech-dominated Forbes ranking - Tuesday 23 May Tech behemoth Apple has been named the most valuable brand in the world for a seventh consecutive year. The highly-regarded ranking, compiled by Forbes magazine, puts the iPhone makers’ brand value at $170bn, a 10 per cent increase on figure for 2016 and well ahead of second-placed Google, whose brand value has risen $19.3bn from last year to just under $102bn, according to Forbes. Tech peer Microsoft nabbed third spot, with a value of $87bn, followed by Facebook at $73.5bn. Consumer goods giant Coca-Cola rounds out the top five with a value of $56.4bn. Reuters 4/29 Diamond ring bought for £10 at car boot sale expected to fetch £350,000 at auction - Monday 22 May A large, diamond ring is expected to fetch £350,000 at auction 30 years after its owner paid £10 for it at a car boot sale, thinking it was a costume jewel.

Nestlé argues that the KitKat’s shape is “iconic” and should be protected by law but Cadbury objects. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Cadbury, dismissing the claim. iStock 9/29 Yorkshire is the best region in the UK for workplace happiness - Tuesday 16 May The best region in Britain for workplace happiness and satisfaction is Yorkshire and the Humber, according to new research.

The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded.

AP 29/29 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. Getty The Government had said that there would be a delay in processing the rate relief because of the snap general election. But last month, communities secretary Sajid Javid announced a u-turn on that decision. The current delay is understood to be partly due to the fact that new bills had already been printed before the u-turn was announced. Councils are also uncertain as to whether they will receive the money back from Whitehall if they process payments to businesses that include the relief. London Borough of Tower Hamlets said the council was waiting for the government to confirm the funding regulations for the scheme. "When they do, we will be able to allocate funds to eligible businesses," a spokesperson said. A spokesman for Darlington Borough Council said further guidance as well as a systems upgrade were needed, which will not happen until after the general election. The Department for Communities and Local Government said: "We have published guidance on the additional relief available to support small businesses and have encouraged local authorities to inform businesses that are eligible as soon as possible." Mark Rigby, chief executive of business rates specialists CVS, said: "A common sense approach here is needed. The money to help those most in need is coming from Government and there is no reason why revised tax demands shouldn't have been sent out by local Councils by now. These delays are simply causing panic, confusion and alarm for small firms." CVS said the Government has now written to councils with the necessary paperwork meaning that relief should finally begin to flow.

Apart from being a not very subtle attempt at consumer brainwashing, the purpose of this campaign is to drive people to a new part of the Apple site designed to encourage and facilitate switching to Apple from other mobile platforms. Since the mobile market is now essentially an OS duopoly, that means Android. The first lot of videos were released on YouTube a week ago to coincide with the launch of the switching site. Without any substantiation they infer processing speed, privacy, photos and music are somehow superior on the iPhone and the most recent ones reiterate claimed advantages in performance and security. You can see them all below. This campaign is reminiscent of the Mac vs Windows ones that ran back when that dichotomy seemed to matter. In case you forgot they featured a fat, dorky, uncool bloke who was supposed to personify Windows and a slim, good-looking, cool one to personify Apple. Both campaigns reflect both how Apple perceives itself and the claimed ego benefits consumers get from being part of the Apple family. Leaving aside the petty superciliousness that so often characterises Apple marketing, the underlying strategy is sound. Such growth as Apple has been able to achieve for the iPhone from underlying market growth seems to have been exhausted, so the only remaining source of customers would appear to be Android users. Unfortunately for Apple the vast majority of them are buying devices far cheaper than the cheapest iPhone, so unless that issue is addressed it’s hard to see how this campaign providing a significant boost to iPhone shipments. At the same time the tone of the ads risks antagonising some consumers and making them hostile to the Apple brand – presumably the exact opposite of what Apple is hoping.   Tags: advertising, Android, Apple, iPhone 2 comments SteveS 30/05/2017 @ 6:15 pm Reply “Without any substantiation they infer processing speed, privacy, photos and music are somehow superior on the iPhone and the most recent ones reiterate claimed advantages in performance and security.” That’s the beauty of it. Apple’s focusing on strengths that are widely understood in the industry. Perhaps the author of this story doesn’t follow such things. Apple’s A series SoC have been the envy of the industry for years and continue to demonstrate performance. Storage I/O is considerably faster on iPhones due to the use of custom controllers. As for malware, given that over 90% of mobile malware exists on Android, there is no explanation necessary for that claim. Privacy? Given that Google’s business model is to mine your data and monetize it, is there really any comparison? etc, etc.. Scott Bicheno 31/05/2017 @ 9:06 am Reply As the quote you chose said, the ads don’t substantiate their claims. Many of them are highly contestable and not everyone is as inclined to give Apple the benefit of the doubt as you are.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 30, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this WWDC wish list: What we’d like from the Siri Speaker WWDC 2017 wish list: iOS 11 features that would take the iPhone and iPad to... WWDC 2017 Wish List: New features we want in macOS 10.13 Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions Apple made a lot of promises when it revamped the Apple TV experience with the launch of tvOS 9. Two years later, there’s still room for improvement. Obviously, we still don’t have that all-new ambitious TV service that Apple was fighting for, hence why I’m still being held hostage by Comcast (for you East Coasters, that’s our version of Time Warner Cable hell). But aside from these lofty dreams to revolutionize television, Apple still has a lot of low-hanging fruit when it comes to improving the fourth generation Apple TV powered by tvOS. Most of our dream features have been inspired by the best of iOS and rightfully so. A lot of the updates and improvements Apple has made to tvOS since its initial launch stem from features first found in iPhone and iPads. So, don’t be surprise during the tvOS portion of the WWDC keynote on June 5 when some of the updates seem familiar, and yet long overdue for the TV platform. ”Hey Siri” hands-free voice activation Rumor has it that Apple is going to unveil an all-new Siri Speaker at WWDC, but what if it’s instead an always-listening Siri remote for the Apple TV? All the Apple TV really needs to order to compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home is hands-free activation, and iPhones already have that in the form of “Hey Siri.” [ Further reading: The best DVRs for cord cutters ] Apple “Hey Siri, how many days has it been?” We’ve all been there. After some who-knows how many hours of binge-watching, Netflix rudely brings up that prompt asking if you’re still there. All of the sudden, you have to emerge from your binge-hole, find the Siri remote and confirm your existence. Now imagine if all that could be avoided by shouting, “Hey Siri, I’m still here!” One thing to consider if tvOS were better-equipped to handle voice requests is not for Siri on the nearby iPhone not to get confused. Maybe Siri could learn to differentiate when I’m too lazy to pick up up my iPhone and when I’m next-level lazy and can’t even pick up the remote. iPad-style Picture-in-Picture and Split View It’s weird that a feature called “Picture-in-Picture” is not originally part of tvOS. It already made it macOS Sierra. Picture-in-Picture and Split View (another iPad-exclusive productivity feature) seem tailor-made for the Apple TV experience. It may sound a little overwhelming to be able to watch two video streams at the same time, but an alternating mute option could make it more enjoyable experience. It beats having to switch back and forth between two channels. The Verifier Plus, Apple is encouraging people to use their Apple TV for more than just binge-watching movies and shows – so this type of multi-tasking would be very welcomed. For example, Trulia and Zillow both have a tvOS app that lets you browse through real estate listings and even tour some available homes. A Split View feature would make it easy to compare the listings. Meanwhile, Picture-in-Picture sounds like the perfect solution for ordering from the Grubhub tvOS app without having to close out of Netflix, or making the most out of a commercial break by swiping on Tinder. Netflix integration in the TV app One of the best things about tvOS 10 was the debut of the TV app. By bringing together all the content from my installed apps, it quickly became my go-to whenever I wanted to find something new to watch or catch up on new episodes of my favorite shows. There is one little problem: It doesn’t bring Netflix programming to the fold. Now that Amazon Video is rumored to be coming to Apple TV, however, I’m hopeful that Apple and Netflix can also settle their petty differences. If the TV app gets integrated with more of these services, I can see it potentially becoming the home screen on the Apple TV. That way I won’t have to navigate through a grid of logo apps that don’t reveal anything about which shows and series each channel has. Did you know that Project Runway is now on Lifetime and that America’s Next Top Model plays on VH1? Yeah, me neither... Support multi-users with switchable profiles I don’t know about you, but it’s likely that your household only has one Apple TV. Unlike an iPhone, the Apple TV is intended to be a shared device so it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t support multiple users. That way you could be able to switch to your profile and access all the content tied to your individual Apple ID, like your Apple Music playlists and your iCloud Photo Library. The Verifier There is even a rumor going around that Apple is gearing up to announce this exact feature in tvOS 11 during WWDC. According to The Verifier, an Israeli tech site, tvOS 11 would make switching between profiles as easy as going from one app to another. Dynamic screen savers with Today-like widgets Don’t get me wrong, I drool over those HD screen savers (especially the Dubai one), but there is no real use to them. And that’s not very Apple of them. I would love to see tvOS 11 to steal another gem from iOS and bring a Today-style screen saver that surfaces widgets with the weather and the news, along with personal information like calendar events and reminders. Weather TV Notifications that are not annoying It’s a fine line between getting an important reminder and being bombarded nonstop, so that’s why tvOS notifications should be implemented thoughtfully. I could see myself setting up notifications so that I know when important live events are coming on like a Giants game or a Giants game. In addition to live TV reminders, tvOS could also pop-up very limited iOS notifications, like emergency calls, texts from your VIP contacts, or critical updates from your HomeKit-connected devices.

The rumour mill surrounding the said laptop suggest that the announcement could happen during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. The said event will happen on June 5 and will feature other Apple products in addition to the rumored MacBook Pro 2017 announcement. While this may sound quite exciting for anyone attending the said event, consumers should note that Apple has already updated the shipping dates for the MacBook Pro, particularly the 15-inch version. According to the Mac Rumors, the shipping for the said version of the laptop now dates between Jun 6 to 8. This is just a few days after the WWDC 2017 event. This new shipping dates may mean that these MacBook Pros will be the 2017 version that everyone has been expecting. The MacBook Pro 2017 will not be very different from the previous model, at least in looks. It will retain the same thin design with the Touch Bar and four USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. However, on the inside, the laptop will receive its much needed upgrade. MacBook Pro (via apple.com) For the longest time, fans of the laptop have been asking Apple to release a version of it with the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Well, they will be happy to know that that time has finally arrived. The new MacBook Pro 2017 will sport the latest and fastest Kaby Lake processors for laptop applications. On top of that, it will also receive a few minor upgrades on the RAM and storage technology. Of course, consumers can expect that new MacBook Pro 2017 to have the latest and fastest NVMe storage from Apple. Along with the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple is also expected to unveil the updates for the original MacBook and the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air, in particular, will also get some internal upgrades just like the MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, there are no updates if Apple intends to change the overall design of the MacBook Air. It has been years since the company took notice of the said laptop and perhaps it is quite timely that a refresh is very much needed.

Thanks to ad-supported network websites and apps — supplemented by behemoth subscription streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon — cord-cutters have been able to see most of the TV that everyone's talking about, without having to pay the cable/satellite premium for channels they never watch. But the golden age of cord-cutting may be coming to an end, as more and more media companies look to move consumers away from the expectation that they can get anything for free. Rather than streaming new shows for nothing on their own sites — or licensing their catalogues to Netflix or its competitors — rights-holders to TV series and movies are inclined today to use what they own to anchor new video-on-demand outlets. If you're an action/adventure/fantasy TV fan, for example, you may have already subscribed to CBS All Access, a relatively new digital arm that carries a lot of the network's older shows and will soon will be the exclusive home of the much-anticipated Star Trek: Discovery. Meanwhile, the various divisions of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment keep spinning off new niche-marketed services. Like old movies? Pay a few bucks each month to Warner Archive. Like Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera? The cable channel Boomerang is now available to stream, for a fee. Like DC Comics superheroes? Next year, Warner's launching a DC-branded VOD channel featuring two new shows, Titans and Young Justice: Outsiders. The options for home entertainment are getting increasingly stark: Either shell out a lot of money for cable, or pay almost exactly as much to a dozen or so standalone streamers. Frankly, this seems unsustainable. Even beyond the cash outlay, it's inconvenient to juggle multiple passwords and recurring bills. Plus, it's a pain just to remember to keep checking for new content. By tradition, TV is a passive medium. Viewers plop down on the couch, push a button, and see what's on. They don't want to have to manage a spreadsheet to keep track of everything they're paying for. The question then is how creators, distributors, and technological innovators can work together to deliver that kind of simplified experience. The answer may lie in a return to the past, in two surprisingly durable concepts: the DVR and cable TV itself. The greatest gift to TV watchers in the 21st century has been the DVR — not because of its ability to zap commercials, but because it has made managing the vastness of cable content easier. You just program your box to find and record anything you might want to see, and then with just one or two button-presses, you can check out what's in your queue. Apple TV has recently tried to emulate the functionality of devices like TiVo by letting cord-cutters organize all of their subscriptions via an app just called "TV." But it doesn't quite work. Every time a new subscription service emerges, it doesn't automatically get added to Apple's "TV." New deals must be struck, and not every media entity is inclined to cooperate. In fact, two of the biggest VOD providers, Netflix and Amazon, can't be accessed via Apple's app. (Netflix's app is available separately on Apple TV; Amazon's isn't.) These disconnects aren't Apple's fault. Everybody who has a stake in the future of media would rather not help Apple deliver its next iPhone-level success ... or indeed allow anyone to become another industry-dominator like Google, Amazon, or Netflix. And yet the market seems ready for whomever will be the first to deliver an easy-to-use multi-subscription app — the kind where one button takes the user to a DVR-style queue where the latest episodes of Star Trek: Discovery, Titans, The Handmaid's Tale, Game of Thrones, Bosch, and Orange Is the New Black are all ready to watch. I have a TiVo, which comes close to that ideal. I program it to record my favorite shows off of cable (because I'm not a cord-cutter), and if I wanted to I could also let it keep track of my favorites from Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, and HBO Go. As it happens, I still use my Apple TV for most of my subscriptions, because the video and audio quality is better and the internet connection's more reliable. Also, TiVo doesn't link to everything. If I want to watch something from Acorn, FilmStruck, CBS All Access, or Warner Archive, I have to go to a different device. What I'd really like to see happen — and what is probably inevitable, as Vox's Todd VanDerWerff points out — is for streaming services to start working together and offering subscription "bundles." It would make sense, for example, for all the Warner-related outlets to be available as one big package. Even better would be if a company like FilmStruck partnered with the similar arthouse cinema sites Fandor and MUBI. I'm not talking about mergers, per se. But if instead of paying $11 a month to FilmStruck alone I could pay $15 and get Fandor and MUBI added on, or $20 and get Warner Archive too, then that's something I'd consider — especially if I could then manage all that content easily via my Apple TV or TiVo. There's more than a little irony then to this potential bundling future. One of the whole points of cord-cutting was that it was supposed to free TV viewers from the burden of having to pay for what they don't want. People who don't care one bit about sports have for decades now been sending money to cable companies who then hand over a hefty percentage of that revenue to ESPN. Meanwhile, sports fans gripe that they have to flip past Bravo, Lifetime, and Turner Classic Movies to find the game. It's an inefficient system. I'm fairly sure, though, that as soon as subscription streaming services start going the wholesale route, we'll once again be living in a media reality where, say, if you want Showtime's streaming option, you'll also have to take CBS All Access, CBS Sports, CW Seed, and the Smithsonian Channel. This is probably the only way that the increased fragmenting of VOD companies is going to work in the long term. Nobody wants to keep adding subscriptions to their bill. But if the CBS Corporation just makes the Showtime subscription more expensive and then throws in everything they've got into the package, then a lot of people will just shrug and click the "pay now" button. I disagree with VanDerWerff on the particulars of how this future will play out. He believes the big cable companies will manage these bundles, and that cord-cutters will come back into the fold of cable and satellite, paying one bill every month for regular TV plus all the streaming subscription bundles they want. Maybe it's because I live in a smallish city served by a regional cable company (instead of Comcast or Cox or its ilk), but I don't see that as a clear endpoint. Instead, I think if the bundles themselves become lucrative, then media conglomerates will be incentivized to work with an Apple or Roku or TiVo to make sure their packages are easily purchasable and accessible. And if that happens, then there won't be any one device or app that will destroy the competition. They'll all be similar portals to similar content — like different grocery stores that all carry the same brands of ketchup. That could ultimately make cord-cutting easier. Right now, several big networks like ESPN require a cable or satellite subscription to access their streaming services; but given that ESPN has been losing cable subscribers at an alarming rate, it may make sense for it to partner with its corporate siblings ABC and Disney on a streaming bundle. This could be what TV-watching is like five years from now. If you have a "smart TV" — or a set-top box — you'll go straight to a main screen that manages all your subscription bundles. You won't need to click on "NBC" or "Netflix." Instead you either click on a programming guide that shows you everything you could watch — in an old-fashioned TV Guide-like grid — or you click on the list of shows you've already told your device you want to see, and start watching the next episode. The actual companies who handle that content will become all but invisible, aside from the monthly charges on your credit card bill. This isn't the ideal future that was mapped out so many years ago when media analysts started touting the possibility of getting cable TV "a la carte." But then the path we're on now is to a future where we pay hundreds of dollars a month to two dozen separate subscription services — each with their own separate interface, and some with exclusive deals with particular devices. And that's not ideal either. It may be that cable had the right idea all along, selling 100 channels for the price of 20, to viewers who only ever watch 10. Functioning as a volume business allowed cable TV channels to innovate, and for the medium to develop more variety and sophistication. All this time, it turns out we were paying more to get more. Even as the technology improves, there's no reason to reject a principle so sound. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Home Apple News iPhone iPad Mac About Submit your content Mac MacOS Share on Facebook Are Macs Still as Safe as they Were? In the wake of the headline-grabbing cyber attack of May 2017, you’ve probably felt at least a little smug as a committed Apple user. It’s known that the WannaCry ransomware at the center of the attack specifically targeted Windows machines, leaving Macs unscathed. Furthermore, it was Microsoft Windows that made the news all over the UK. This was due to the fact that the attack’s significant impact on the country’s National Health Service was largely caused by many departments continuing to use unsupported copies of Windows XP, as the Guardian writes. What about Mac viruses? While it’s fair to say that Apple Macs have never been targeted by hackers as much as Windows machines, complacency is foolish when it comes to cybersecurity. People once thought that Apple users could manage quite safely without running an antivirus, but is this really still a sensible strategy? In actual fact, mainstream news sources such as Forbes have been reporting on Mac viruses for many years now. Despite the fact that the Unix-based Mac OS does some clever things to prevent against viruses, such as checking files against lists of known malware and running programs in a “sandboxed” way to limit any damage they can do, Macs do still fall victim to infection. If you keep an eye on technical news stories, you probably hear more and more about these infections nowadays too. IMAGE: Pixabay So, while Apple’s smaller market share may make producing Mac malware less of a priority to hackers, Macs are, by no means, off their radar. Anti-malware software is, therefore, at least worth serious consideration if you are a Mac user. Minimising other risks to Macs Having established that Apple Macs perhaps aren’t quite as safe as they once were, let’s consider what risks exist and how you can mitigate them. There are three things every Mac user can do make their systems as safe as possible. Thankfully these don’t take too much effort to implement. 1. Install updates promptly If you’re one of those people who tends to click “ask me tomorrow” whenever you’re prompted to carry out a system update on your Mac, it’s time to change your approach and start installing updates as soon as you see them. Usually, when a big threat to Macs is discovered, Apple is quick to roll out preventative fixes – but this won’t be much use to you if you don’t install them. A patch that protected Windows users from the WannaCry ransomware was made available by Microsoft many weeks before the large-scale cyber attack. Many of those affected could have avoided trouble by installing this patch on time. 2. Choose your applications and services carefully Most software nowadays has at least some online element – so no matter how secure your Mac is, you’re still at risk if a software vendor isn’t taking good care of security on their end. In 2016, Verizon revealed that the number one source of data breaches are “Web Application Attacks.” This means hackers are attacking the servers that host customer data. One hopes and assumes that large companies will have systems in place such as a web application firewall to protect against hackers, but can we make the same assumption about smaller software firms? A web application firewall can protect online systems from all kinds of online security risks, but only if you’re only surfing websites and making online purchases on sites that actually made the necessary investment in one. So, make sure you’re confident in the software you choose, asking about their security if need be. Otherwise, a company’s shortcuts can become your problem.   IMAGE: Pixabay 3. Always remember physical security Even if you have top-class antivirus and only use the safest of online services, your Mac isn’t safe if someone steals it! Unfortunately, Apple kit is desirable – and a real target for thieves, so the best thing you can do is make sure that if someone does steal your Mac, there’s nothing much they can do with it. First off, make sure you use FileVault to encrypt your storage drive. This will stop anyone accessing any of your data. Activate Find my Mac as well, to give yourself the best chance of tracking it down. Finally, don’t undermine all of your other security efforts by assigning a weak password to your computer!   Macs are still safer that Windows machines if you look at the statistics. However, they’re neither bullet-proof nor as (relatively) safe as they once were. It’s important to take the necessary steps to protect your data.

The adverts – which in the UK featured David Mitchell as a stuffy PC, and Robert Webb as a far cooler Mac – were pretty popular, even if Robert Webb himself later admitted he thought his character seemed smug and didn’t have any funny lines. See related  Apple releases the Cookie Monster advert outtakes... and they're fantastic Watch James Corden try to impress stony-faced Apple execs in two minutes of your life that you’re never getting back Cortana and Siri argue over what makes a computer in new Microsoft ad Eight years later and things are very different – the opposition has changed, and the stadium has moved. Mobile internet browsing overtook the desktop for the first time last year, and that’s a crossover point to which there’s no coming back from. In the mobile space, there’s only one rival worth worrying about, and it sure as hell isn’t Microsoft. The full statistics from quarter four last year are hidden behind that link, but to save you a click, Android had 81.7% of the market, followed by iOS on 17.9%. The remaining 0.4% was divided between Windows, “Other” and BlackBerry – the latter of which had a marketshare so small it could be rounded down to 0.0%. So it’s no surprise that Apple’s latest campaign is targeted at the rival with a marketshare worth eating away at. To that end, the company has launched a section of their site dedicated to switching to iPhone, which covers topics such as ease of use, the camera, sustainability, speed and customer satisfaction. Android is namechecked just twice in the page, though given the webpage’s title tag reads “Switch from Android to iPhone – Apple,” I think we can be pretty confident as to who they have in mind. Still, perhaps Apple’s marketing department regarded that as a bit too subtle, because they’ve now launched three new 16-second adverts on the company YouTube channel, and two of them take a pretty direct swipe at perceived weaknesses in the Android armour. First up: security. Video of iPhone — Security — Apple Next, Apple targets the kind of choppiness you can get on low-end Android phones (a little harsh, given that’s down to phone specifications rather than the OS itself, but that’s advertising for you): Video of iPhone — Smooth — Apple Finally, Apple provides a visual demonstration of how easy it can be to relocate all your contacts to their new home: Video of iPhone — Contacts — Apple If you’re thinking all of these are a touch underwhelming, I agree with you. This is absolutely not a call for Apple to bring back James Corden, but I wouldn’t be averse to Cookie Monster getting another spell in the limelight.

That's because each device requires a different app to control it. And even when all linked through a unifying smart home system, you might find you have to hunt for your smartphone, open it, open the app and activate products just to boil a kettle to make a cup of tea. It is the very definition of a first world problem. Pressing the on switch on a non-smart kettle is so much simpler. The Logitech Pop Smart Button might be the answer though. We first encountered the Pop Smart Button at the end of last year. But it's now been made compatible with Apple HomeKit, which is a big deal for iOS users. It is also about to be sold in Apple stores in the UK, from 13 June. Apple HomeKit and Home app: What are they and how do they work? Apple HomeKit tips and tricks with Apple TV Which Sonos speaker is best for you? Play:1, Play:3, Play:5, PlayBar or PlayBase What Philips Hue smart bulbs are there and which should you buy? It comprises one big button you can wall-mount or leave on a side table that, with one tap, can switch on the lights, draw the curtains, even start music on your Sonos system. And it comes with three different gesture options, so different interactions can be pre-programmed and controlled easily. You also get a bridge device in the Pop Smart Button Kit that links to your home network wirelessly and interacts with all the compatible smart home devices you own. It works with devices that are HomeKit-enabled, but also many that aren't. You can set compatible kit up through Apple Home or a dedicated Pop app for iOS or Android. The Logitech Pop Smart Button Kit is available for £119.99. Inside you get the bridge and one of the Pop Smart Buttons. You can also buy additional Pop Smart Buttons at £34.99 a, ahem, pop.

While Apple offers a uniform experience across its devices (and often a higher resale value) the Android phones are often cheaper. And as Google showed with its recent I/O conference, there's a lot of impressive features on Android devices like the Pixel phone. But ahead of its own developer conference - next week's WWDC - Apple has launched a new campaign dedicated to winning over Android users to iPhone.

Boldly claiming that "Life is easier on iPhone", the campaign has various questions and answers about why gadget fans might favour the fruit. There's also information on battery life, privacy and Apple's own commitment to environmental policies.

Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you," explains Apple. Why does Apple want users to switch? When it comes to owning the mobile market, Android far outstrips Apple's iOS. That's because Google allows any manufacturer to use its software on its devices. That means whether its the high-end Samsung Galaxy S8 or low-price Moto X it still runs the same software, and Google gets the credit.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 Changes By John Heffernan on May 30, 2017No Comment Share on Facebook Follow on Facebook Add to Google+ Connect on Linked in Subscribe by Email Print This Post Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 Changes Apple has been trying to convince Android users to switch to using an iPhone for a long time now, and last week the Cupertino firm upped the ante and launched its ‘Switch’ website, which aims to highlight an iPhone’s many virtues. The iPhone 8 display will transition to an elongated 18.5:9 aspect ratio just like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and LG’s G6. There are rumors of a new Siri-powered home speaker, along with updates to the MacBook, iMac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple Inc. (Apple) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App StoreSM, iBookstoreSM, and Mac App Store. The Company distributes its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In February 2012, the Company acquired app-search engine Chomp. Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 145.51. The projected upper bound is: 158.10. The projected lower bound is: 149.63. The projected closing price is: 153.87. APPLE INC closed down -0.260 at 153.610. Volume was 17% below average (neutral) and Bollinger Bands were 10% wider than normal.

Summary APPLE INC is currently 22.8% above its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is high as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect moderate flows of volume into AAPL.O (mildly bullish). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bullish on AAPL.O and have had this outlook for the last 21 periods. Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 53.0834. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 7 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 61.60. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 7 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -7. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 8 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 6 period(s) ago.   APPL, Apple, finance, heffx, NASDAQ, Phone, shayne heffernan, stock, trading, US Apple Inc.

Tech Apple Science Cars Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 WWDC 2017 E3 2017 Prime Day 2017     IPhone 8 Requires New Apps Posted: May 30 2017, 1:48am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple   Credit: @VenyaGeskin1   Apple reportedly changes the screen ratio in new iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 will require work for app developers, if a report out of China is any indication. In a recent Chinese-language Economic Daily News report, TSMC sources revealed that Apple changes the screen ratio from 16:9 to 18.5:9 in the first OLED iPhone. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock The iPhone 8 screen will be much longer than the one found on the iPhone 7. Apple is removing the physical home button to make room for the bigger screen. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have an optical fingerprint sensor integrated into the screen. The changed screen ratio will require some layout and even user interface design adjustments for apps. The top of the screen will not be reachable anymore for most iPhone 8 users. Apps with UI elements such as back button on top will become a nuisance to use. The required app updates could mean that the iPhone 8 will be unveiled earlier than usual before sales launch to give developers time to update their apps.  Another reason why we could see the iPhone 8 earlier than expected is the rumored AR functionality. The iPhone 8 is supposed to feature 3D front camera with a infra-red sensor system to enable augmented reality apps. Again developer need time to leverage this new capabilities in the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 design has leaked through CAD files and dummies out of the Asian supply chain. Leaker Benjamin Geskin is a major source of these iPhone 8 leaks showing the iPhone 8's signature vertical dual camera alignment on the rear.  There are no leaks that counter the design of the iPhone 8 as shown in a new render above. The iPhone 8 is expected to be released this fall.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Go beyond Quicktime by converting your MOV files… Go beyond Quicktime by converting your MOV files to MP4 By Will Nicol — Updated May 26, 2017 12:03 pm Subscribe Share Pixabay Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you’re a Mac user who deals with video, you’ve likely come across a MOV file at one point or another. This is the proprietary format Apple uses for Quicktime, the built-in media player that comes with nearly all iterations of MacOS. Much like MPEG-2 files, however, the MOV format never achieved widespread usage, rendering it a pain to use for users who opt for an operating system or device that doesn’t fall under Apple’s umbrella. If you watch or edit your videos on a Mac, you can probably stick with using MOV files, but if you’re looking for a format with greater support, you’ll likely want to convert them MP4. Here’s how to do so, using both desktop and web-based tools. How to convert MOV files using iMovie (MacOS) Step 1: First, launch iMovie, the proprietary video-editing software that came with your Mac. If the program isn’t already housed in your dock, click the Finder icon, select Applications in the left-hand pane, and select the program from the resulting list. Once open, click the File menu in the application toolbar and select New Movie from the drop-down menu. Step 2: When prompted to select a theme, just choose No Theme. Step 3: In iMovie, click the button labeled Import Media… Step 4: Find the MOV file you want to convert, select it, and click Import Selected button in the bottom-right corner. Step 5: Once done, iMovie will open the video as a new Project. Then, click the File menu in the application toolbar and select Share from the drop-down menu. Step 6: Select the File option in the resulting menu and edit your preferences — if you wish — before clicking Next in the bottom-right corner. Step 7: A window will open, asking you to choose a location on your hard drive to save the file. Do this, then click Save. Your movie file will be exported to that location as an MP4 file! How to convert MOV files using CloudConvert (web-based) If you’re using a device other than a Mac — such as a Windows-based PC — you can still easily convert MOV files to MP4 using an online application. As an example, we’ll use CloudConvert, a freemium piece of software designed to handle a wide range of file formats with little to no hassle. It’s been our go-to choice for years, but given you have to upload your video files to a remote server, keep in mind that the company that converts your video may have access to it. We sincerely doubt anything would come of it, but keep in mind if you wish to continue. Step 1: First, navigate to the CloudConvert website and click the Select Files button near the top of the page. Afterward, select the MOV file you wish to convert and click Open in the bottom-right corner of the pop-up window. Step 2: Click the down arrow beside the format type — in this case, MOV. Then, select video from the drop-down menu and click mp4 from the resulting list of options. Step 3: Once you’ve made your selection, click the red Start Conversion button in the bottom-right corner. The process may take a while, depending on the size of the file, but once done, click the green Download button near the top of the page. Then, choose a save location for the resulting video, click Save, and enjoy!

The company is always working at a greater speed to provide something new to the users. Its introduction of Clips (which is a new app) has enabled the users to make spectacular videos on their IOS devices. With a peculiar design of amalgamating music, photos and video clips into most memorable videos, this app is just the hot favourite among the Apple users. The feature Clips also provides Live Titles which is a splendid feature which enables the users to make animated title and captions with the help of their voice. In the midst of these new and new features being announced from Apple's side, the plight of the users has always been the same.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 04, 11:56 PM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology How To Watch Apple WWDC 2017 Event On Your Smartphone By Rishabh Jain On 05/30/17 AT 3:22 AM Close Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference 2017 (WWDC 2017) will take place in San Jose from June 5-9 at 1 p.m. EDT Monday. The company is expected to make many new announcements at the event including the new version of iOS – iOS11, a new MacOS version, a new WatchOS version and even some hardware offerings such as a Siri-based smart speaker and a premium iPad 2 tablet. Read: Apple Isn't Working On Amazon Echo-Like Speaker? At WWDC, Company Reportedly Making Siri Omnipresent AI Assistant Across Devices Live stream requirements: Unlike what happened in the past, you don’t need an Apple device to watch the event — you can live stream it on Microsoft Edge on any Windows PC. In case you want to live stream the event on an Apple device, you can do it on an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or a later version or on a Mac with Safari 6.0.5 or a later version and iOSX 10.8.5 or a later version.  You can also live stream the event through  Apple TV. How to live stream: You can live stream the event by clicking on this link when it goes live at 1 p.m. EDT Monday. WWDC 2017 is being eagerly anticipated mostly because of iOS 11. The new software update is expected to bring along features such as: Improved 3D Touch:  The operating system update is expected to let users make better use of Apple’s pressure-sensing technology. The functionality is currently used in a limited manner on iPhone 7 but is expected to have a wider application on Apple’s upcoming device the iPhone 8. The device is expected to have pressure sensitivity throughout its body and even have pressure-sensitive buttons instead of physical ones. Kinect-like augmented reality based functionality:  iOS 11 will prepare the ground for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 device. It is expected to have a 3D-sensing camera which will be used for both augmented reality-based gaming and facial recognition, similar to Microsoft’s Kinect technology, which detects motions and replicates the effects in virtual games. No 32-bit support: iOS 11 is expected to end support for 32-bit applications, which would entail that software support for iPhone 5 and lower version would be cut off.  Improved Maps:  Apple is expected to overhaul Apple Maps to keep competing with Google Maps. It could include improved navigation features such as inside views of buildings and improvements to car navigation. Improved Siri:  This is the biggest and the most awaited feature expected to be revealed at the event. Siri was the first conversational voice-assistant when it was unveiled back in 2011, but since last year, when artificial intelligence (AI) based voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa were unveiled, it has lagged behind in terms of functionality. Many other companies including Apple’s major rival Samsung have come out with their own AI-based voice assistant and Siri seems to be left behind. Read: Apple Siri 2.0 Might Have Machine Learning, Improved AI, Facial Recognition And More Apple is expected to come out with a new version of Siri to keep in step with the competition.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact All About The iPhone 8 – Bezelless OLED Display With Focus on AR [Leaks] Haamiz Ahmed 6 days ago Now that big name smartphone makers like Samsung, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo (the latter two being runaway successes in China) have released their flagships for the year, all eyes are on Apple and its upcoming iPhone 8 launch. Every year Apple launches a new iPhone around September. As the announcement closes in, leaks start popping up everywhere about the phone’s design, specifications, battery etc. This year will also mark the 10 year iPhone anniversary as well. Some believe that this year Apple will release an iPhone “X” to mark the occasion. However, nothing is confirmed so far. We’ve rounded up the major rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 and listed them below. Here’s what we know so far. Design and Display Leaked iPhone 8 design schematic This particular design blueprint showed up on the internet a while ago. If this is the design Apple has opted for it leads to some interesting speculations about the iPhone 8. For one, it might have an edge-to-edge display not unlike the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the LG G6. Is Apple following the industry for once? Following the trends instead of setting new ones? Another interesting change is the vertical alignment of the primary cameras. This may be a sign of Apple stepping into the AR realm. Company CEO Tim Cook has officially stated the AR will be a big focus area for Apple in the future. An iPhone with AR capabilities is the way Apple seems to be going in with this. Based on the schematic, folks on the internet have created CAD renders of the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 Concept Render (based on leaked schematic) As for the display the iPhone 8 is rumored to have a 5.8 inch OLED screen. Another rumor points towards a Touch ID home button integrated directly into the screen. This is like a mix of Samsung Galaxy S8’s on-screen home button and Xiaomi’s under-glass fingerprint sensor. It might also have a tap to wake feature like Android phones have according to Forbes. The rumor also says that the bottom of the display will feature an always-on functionality with varying options that change with the app you’re currently using. This would effectively reduce the actual screen size to 5.2 inches. It could look like this: Internals and Storage The current iPhone 7 is powered by an A10 fusion chip. If Apple follows their naming convention, then the iPhone 8 will use an A11 fusion chip this year. A leak by BGR points towards the iPhone 8 using 3 GB RAM, slightly higher than the iPhone 7’s 2 GB. As for the memory the base model is rumored to have 64 GB of internal storage going all the way up to 256 GB for the top-end model. The headphone jack is not coming back as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus recorded big sale numbers. Apple might stick with its decision and could include the wireless Airpods with the phone instead. Camera and Battery As seen earlier in the leaked schematics, the iPhone 8 might have a dual camera setup like the iPhone 7 Plus, in vertical orientation. The front camera is rumored to be able to take “3D selfies” and will be able to use facial recognition technology with the aid of an IR sensor on the front. Not much is known about the rear cameras aside from the fact that they’re vertically aligned and will use a similar telephoto+regular sensor like the last year’s iPhone 7 Plus. Apple could update the battery capacity to cover for the larger display. The exact capacity is still unknown. It can however hop on the fast charging bandwagon this year with a Tristar 3 Hydra chip. Wireless charging is also rumored with inductive charging capabilities instead of over-the-air charging. Pricing and Availability Apple seems to be on schedule for an iPhone 8 release some time later this year (presumably September). It could be called the iPhone X or the iPhone 8, both are unconfirmed at this point. This time around the Cupertino-based smartphone maker could go all out with the price and charge a hefty $1,000 for the phone. Better features usually equate to higher pricing but we’ve seen companies like Xiaomi and Oneplus prove that wrong time and time again. But then again, that’s Apple for you. For now we can only wait and see what Apple has waiting for us all this year.

Taylor Swift is “happily” allowing Apple Music to stream her album 1989. The 25-year-old singer penned an open letter on her Tumblr account to the music giant last week in which she slammed its decision not to pay musicians for songs streamed during the free three-month trial period the service offers to customers. After reading her note Apple Music changed their policy and in light of the company deciding to pay artists during the trial period, Taylor has allowed her LP 1989 to stream with them. “After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so,” she wrote on Twitter Thursday. “In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not. “This is simply the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album. Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart.” In her Tumblr letter, Taylor explained she was fighting more for up-and-coming artists than herself. Within 24 hours of the blog entry going viral, Apple’s senior vice president of internet services and software Eddy Cue announced a change in policy. "When I woke up and read Taylor's note, it solidified quickly that we needed a change," Eddy told Rolling Stone. "Music is a big part of our DNA and we always strive to make sure artists are paid for their work." Taylor was thrilled by the confirmation and immediately took to her own page on the social media site to express her joy. "I am elated and relieved. Thank you for your words of support today. They listened to us," she wrote last weekend. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Entertainment Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

(Representational image of iPhone 7 Plus. Source: AP) Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected Apple’s iPhone 8 will see a change in the shape, and support for augmented reality (AR) applications, according to reports based out of supply chain sources from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TMSC). The DigiTimes is reporting this based on China’s Economic Daily News, which has quoted sources from TMSC which is one of Apple’s supply chain companies. According to the report in Economic Daily News, Apple is changing the display aspect ratio to 18.5:9 from the earlier 16:9 as it adds a display with slimmer bezels on the sides, top and bottom. Also the report claims the fingerprint scanner will be an optical one, which is embedded within the display, and the home button will be removed from the iPhone. This is in contrast to earlier reports which have claimed Apple still trying to figure out how embed the TouchID inside the display. Finally, the report also adds that Apple iPhone 8 will add “invisible infrared image sensors” and the camera will be able to support Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Now in the past we’ve heard Apple CEO Tim Cook talk about how Augmented Reality is the next thing and the future, and that Cupertino really believes in this technology. Reports have also indicated that Apple has its own secret unit working on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. A report on Bloomberg had said Apple is working on on AR glasses, which could connect wirelessly to the iPhone and beam content to the user. Although we’ll have to wait and see if AR makes an appearance on the iPhone 8. Apple typically takes time to launch a new technology on its iPhones, spending years in research and development. Also read: Apple iPhone 8 could start at $870 predicts, UBS analyst in note The display ratio change shouldn’t come as a surprise. There have been several reports indicating Apple iPhone 8 will have a special 5.8-inch OLED display with reduced bezels on the side. This also means Apple can fit a bigger display in a smaller body size, and the iPhone 8 might actually be smaller in overall size compared to the iPhone 7s. Reports also indicate Apple is working on its own Neural engine for AI computing on smartphones, as well as its own GPU, but these won’t likely be part of iPhone 8. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 8 along with the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus in September.

Reuters/Jianan Yu If latest reports are to be believed, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 could be the largest flagship handset from the South Korean tech giant, with only 2013’s Galaxy Mega matching its size. A new leak has reportedly uncovered the first video of the smartphone’s front panel. The display shown is a massive 6.3 inches. It is 0.6 inch larger than the Note 7. However, the panel shown in the leaked video looks quite similar to Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. The leak shows an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, something the LG G6 has already adopted. Apple may replicate the same for its iPhone 8. As already stated in a previous article, the Note 8 will address two shortcomings in the S8 and S8 Plus smartphones. First, the fingerprint scanner won’t be beside the rear camera but will be embedded into the display. Also, the Note 8 will come with dual-cameras as various reports have mentioned. The dual-camera feature was dropped at the last moment from the S8 and S8 Plus handsets. It must, however, be mentioned that leaks must be taken with a pinch of salt. Samsung is definitely setting a design standard both Apple iPhone 8 and Google Pixel 2 smartphones will be happy to match, writes Forbes. The latest video leak was reported by SamMobile. Last week, a YouTuber shared a video showing a 3D-printed model of the upcoming smartphone. It allegedly showed the front glass panel. The phone will reportedly have the bezel-free Infinity Display. It may also have a 6.3-inch QHD Display and 12MP+13MP dual-camera setup on the rear. The fingerprint scanner, as already mentioned, could be integrated into the display. It was previously mentioned that the phone could have a body display ratio more than 83 percent of both Galaxy S8 smartphones. It is also rumoured that the US version will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and outside the US, it will have the Exynos 8895 chipset. Meanwhile, fans are eagerly waiting for a fix to the frustrating Galaxy S8 Bluetooth problem. The solution is reportedly on the way. As per numerous complaints on various forums, users are having a tough time maintaining a smooth Bluetooth connection to their headphones, head units and speakers. An update that fixes this problem has reportedly been rolled out in United Arab Emirates and may soon hit other countries. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and other handsets.

Many believed that this hole will be used for the Touch ID sensor of the iPhone 8. The leak, at some point, squashed earlier rumours of in-display fingerprint sensor for Apple’s tenth anniversary iPhone. However, new information just came out contradicting the leaks from the previous week. Leak aggregator Slashleaks clearly shows the alleged drawings and 3D renderings of the iPhone 8. In the said drawings, one can see that there not an extra hole that may hold the Touch ID sensor at the back. Most of the comments thus far claim that the circular hole at the back will hold the Apple logo instead of the said sensor. Another thing worth mentioning about the images is the vertical arrangement of the camera sensors at the back. It seems like the extra hole between the camera sensors will hold the LED flash of the iPhone 8. Alleged iPhone 8 schematic drawing (via slashleaks.com) Finally, the images also show the outline of the front sensors at the top of the phone. These drawings further corroborate earlier reports of dual front cameras and some extra hole that might be used for depth sensing. It is quite difficult to verify the veracity of the said leaks. However, most people who have seen the images seem to think that they are quite legitimate. Nevertheless, these images should be taken with a grain of salt. The iPhone 8 is expected to be released later this year. Although there are numerous reports saying Apple is currently having issues with component assembly. On the other hand, a handful of market watchers and analysts still believe that Apple will be able to pull through with the iPhone 8 production. They are still quite optimistic that consumers will get a glimpse of the phone before the year ends. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Shutterstock Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Apple is reportedly working on a chip called the Apple Neural Engine, which would be dedicated to carrying out artificial intelligence (AI) processing on its mobile devices. The addition of this type of capability would catalyse the use of AI on mobile devices. Although it is already being used extensively to power digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, these technologies rely on computer servers to process data sent to them rather than the processing happening on the mobile device itself. Augmented reality and digital assistants are not the only applications of AI that will become important on mobile devices. Once the capability is made available to all mobile application developers, it will bring new types of capabilities to mobile devices. Health applications, for example, will be able to tell when body readings from sensors on the phone or associated wearable devices are abnormal and need acting on. But the uses are potentially limitless and will bring about a new phase in how we rely on applications and our mobile devices in everyday life. And they will work, even when the device is not connected to the internet. Strictly speaking, a specific processor is not an essential requirement for using AI on a mobile phone. Chip-maker Qualcomm for example has provided a software-based approach, called the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine, to allow developers using their chips to incorporate AI into their software. An example of this is a car that monitors the driver using a camera and warns when they are using their smartphone or driving erratically. Specific AI hardware however greatly speeds up the process called “machine learning” and allows for more sophisticated types of AI to be used. Google’s AI hardware, called the Tensor Processing Unit, is 15 to 30 times faster than the fastest computer processors (CPUs) and graphic processors (GPUs) that power computers today. These TPUs were what gave Google’s DeepMind its ability to beat the world champions of the Chinese game of Go. These TPUs also have vastly improved Google’s automated language translation software, Google Translate. The inclusion of AI in mobile software is going to massively increase the potential usefulness of that software and through that, how much we come to depend on the mobile phone. Our state of health, for example, is really about how we are doing relative to how we normally feel. Changes in behaviour can signal changes in mental health, including conditions like dementia and Parkinson’s. They can also be precursors of illnesses such as diabetes as well as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Our phones could monitor patterns of activity and even how we walk. This ability would be based on the software learning our normal patterns and once having detected a change, decide what to do about it. The phone would be part of a self-directed ecosystem of intelligent and autonomous machines, including cars. Not only is the driving of autonomous cars completely dependent on AI to function, it is likely that people will eventually share the use of these cars when needed, rather than owning one themselves. AI will again be essential for managing how this sharing functions to manage the most efficient distribution of cars, directing which cars need to pick up which clients. To do this, the scheduling AI service will need to liaise with AI software on everyone’s phones to determine where and when they will be at a given location and where they need to get to. AI on a mobile device will also increasingly be used to keep the device protected, checking if applications and communications are secure or likely to be a threat. This technology is already being implemented in smart home appliances, but as software. The addition of special AI chips will allow them to be much faster and to do more. Researchers are also looking at analysing the way we move as a means of uniquely identifying the wearer of a device. AI will essentially be able to fill in and apply the understanding and knowledge that not everyone possesses. Even if they do, remembering to do something, even when it is in your own best interest, is sometimes hard. There is a counter argument to the benefits of increasing the intelligence of mobile devices however. This is the fear that as we come to rely on devices to do things, we will lose the ability to maintain that skill and that this will eventually impact on a person’s overall cognitive ability, or at least on their ability to operate without the AI. The successful outcome of having an AI assisting depends on the user following its advice, and this is something that people may not be that good at doing.

A purported sketch of the iPhone 8 has been leaked online, giving away the possible design of the flagship device. Raymond Ronamai   May 30, 2017 08:26 IST Apple iPhone 8 schematics seen on Benjamin Geskin's Twitter pageBenjamin Geskin A lot has been said about Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 8 although it's still a few months away from launch. After a few details, including specifications and release date, surfaced, it has now emerged that the device will come with a significant makeover in terms of design. A purported sketch of the iPhone 8 has been leaked by Benjamin Geskin on his Twitter page, and it is in sync with the chassis design released last month. In the pictures, Apple's upcoming flagship is seen with a vertical dual-camera, sans the physical home button, and bazel-less except the top edge, and with an elongated power button and orange line at the back. It is very different from its predecessor iPhone 7 as far as the design is concerned.

It was earlier reported that the release of the device could be postponed to October and even November because of the company's plan to introduce new features. The iPhone 8 is expected to come in three variants — a 4.7-inch, a 5.5-inch and a 5.8-inch version. All the variants are expected to be powered by an A11 chipset, run on iOS 11 operating system and don an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen for the first time. The device is also reportedly coming with several new features like virtual home button, 3D depth-sensing front camera, wireless charger, and new fingerprint ID solution. The device is expected to come with a price tag of around $1,000.  Related Apple iPhone 8, 7s series release date details revealed Apple developing dedicated AI processor chip codenamed 'Apple Neural Engine' IPhone 8 hands-on video leaked: No home button, dual rear camera, bezel-less screen & more Post Comment IBT TV Close Macron-Trump handshake under scrutiny as pair meet for first time Why advertise with us?

By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | Updated: June 1, 2017 12:06 PM Some fear allowing Apple to bring in such iPhones could pose environmental risks. The government has toughened its stance against Apple’s proposal to use its facility in India to export “certified pre-owned iPhones” — one of the pre-conditions the company had set to establish a larger manufacturing base in the country. Official sources told FE that a section of the government fears allowing Apple to bring in such second-hand iPhones from all over the world to service or upgrade here for subsequent exports could pose environmental risks. “Apple wants to refurbish iPhones in India and export them. But there are serious questions regarding the issue of e-waste. The environment ministry has reservations about the issue, so has MeitY (ministry of electronics and information technology). Until a concrete strategy is firmed up on how to deal with e-waste effectively, it’s very difficult to approve such a proposal,” said one of the sources. What also seems to have gone against Apple is the fact that while it was quick to hand over a list of pre-conditions—from tax concessions to permission to export refurbished phones—to set up a large manufacturing unit in India, it didn’t share with the central government any details on the quantum of investment it is planning to make or specific employment opportunities it will create here. Sources had earlier told FE that the iPhone maker would set up only a “pilot project” near Bengaluru (to produce around 3-5 lakh phones), and the likelihood of a larger manufacturing unit in India hinged on the kind of concessions the central government would offer to the tech giant. Apple had sought the government’s permission to export “certified pre-owned iPhones”, without selling them here, after its earlier proposal to sell such refurbished iPhones in India was rejected by the ministries of environment and industry on grounds it could result in India becoming a dumping ground of second-hand phones. For its part, Apple has maintained that the sale of its “certified pre-owned phones” is widely prevalent across nations, including the US. An Apple spokesperson was approached for this story, but he hasn’t offered any comment till the time of going to press. Sources said Apple officials have told the government that the process of servicing or upgrading the pre-owned phones in a manufacturing unit and their subsequent sale don’t involve any environmental risks. They have said every i-Phone that passes the certified pre-owned programme of Apple gets a new IMEI, which is basically a new signature for identification on cellular networks. An independent, third party monitors if all the proper, laid-down processes have been followed at the manufacturing facility. Usually, these devices also offer the same warranty and commitment given for new iPhones. You might also want to see this: The hardening of stance on e-waste could force Apple to review its plans for servicing and then shipping out refurbished iPhones. Earlier this year, MeitY had also endorsed the revenue department’s stance that Apple’s demand for an import duty exemption for certain components for making i-Phones in India couldn’t be met. MeitY secretary Aruna Sundararajan told FE that the government has shared with Apple a road map for Indianisation, aimed at driving up value addition here. It asked the company to align its plans with the government’s road map (meant for all foreign companies interested in investing in this segment) in which case no special concessions would be given to the tech giant. “So they said okay. They will examine it and get back to us,” the secretary said. Apple has turned to India, the world’s fastest-growing smart phone market, to reverse slowing global sales, according to analysts. Also, with cost of production in China rising due to soaring wages, among others, the company is perhaps looking at diversifying its manufacturing base out of China, they said. The company doesn’t make its own products; rather it does it through contract manufacturers, including Foxconn and Pegatron. So, if Apple sets up a base here, the contract manufacturers may also establish units here to cater for the tech major’s demands, they said. Currently, Apple sells its products in India through a network of local distributors and retailers. Most of the company’s items are assembled in China, usually by Foxconn Technology. –Rishi Ranjan Kala and Banikinkar Pattanayak J Jemjem Jun 1, 2017 at 4:58 pm The government has taken the right stance as many components of mobile phones are considered toxins like nic, lithium, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury and zinc. The production of mobile phones contributes to climate change by using up energy and virgin materials which release greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Even, the production of new mobile phones contributes to climate change by using up energy and virgin materials which release greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. However, refurbished iphones and other smart phones are more cheaper as compare to the original piece and even people can buy such phones who have low budget.

This ability would be based on the software learning our normal patterns and once having detected a change, decide what to do about it. The phone would be part of a self-directed ecosystem of intelligent and autonomous machines, including cars. Not only is the driving of autonomous cars completely dependent on AI to function, it is likely that people will eventually share the use of these cars when needed, rather than owning one themselves. AI will again be essential for managing how this sharing functions to manage the most efficient distribution of cars, directing which cars need to pick up which clients. To do this, the scheduling AI service will need to liaise with AI software on everyone’s phones to determine where and when they will be at a given location and where they need to get to. AI on a mobile device will also increasingly be used to keep the device protected, checking if applications and communications are secure or likely to be a threat. This technology is already being implemented in smart home appliances, but as software. The addition of special AI chips will allow them to be much faster and to do more. Researchers are also looking at analysing the way we move as a means of uniquely identifying the wearer of a device. AI will essentially be able to fill in for activities and the application of understanding and knowledge that not everyone possesses. Even if they do, remembering to do something, even when it is in your own best interest, is sometimes hard. There is a counter argument to the benefits of increasing the intelligence of mobile devices however. This is the fear that as we come to rely on devices to do things, we will lose the ability to maintain that skill and that this will eventually impact on a person’s overall cognitive ability, or at least on their ability to operate without the AI. The entire successful outcome of having an AI assisting depends on the user following the advice, and this is something that people may not be that good at doing.

Bystanders in the Rancho Cucamonga Apple on Sunday afternoon store videotaped and some tried to stop the brazen thieves as they snatched laptops and iPhones that were on display and dashed out the door with what they could get. Video of the robbery posted by witness Vanessa Duarte on Facebook showed what appeared to be four young men in dark hoodies gathering up electronics and hustling from the store in Victoria Gardens. Scroll down for video  One unidentified suspect runs towards the door after apparently grabbing or trying to grab Apple products on display in the Rancho Cucamonga A few people by the door appear to try to stop the thieves to no avail One brazen suspect ran out the door with a pile of merchandise and what appears to be at least two laptops Several witnesses appear to try to block the store's door but the men push past them. The last man taking up the rear is seen running out with at least two laptops clutched in his hands. But Duarte said the men didn't get away with as much loot as they'd hoped to get. 'They dropped almost all the s**t they wanted to take cause everything is attached to the tables,' she wrote, adding laughing emojis. The suspects, wearing dark clothing and hoodies, ran out the door while being videotaped One of the suspects appears to look straight into a video camera as he runs away RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Man is awarded $1.2MILLION after losing three TOES when an...

Share this article Share Duarte said she was standing in the store when she saw the men grabbing goods and videotaped them as they made their getaway and that she 'almost got hit.' She said she'd shared her video with the store. The group then took off in a black four-door vehicle without license plates, said the sheriff's office, according to ABC7.  Several others on social media said that demo electronics in stores are easily traceable.    Read more: VIDEO: 4 thieves strike Rancho Cucamonga Apple store in broad daylight | abc7news.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 311 shares Most watched News videos Graphic footage of London attack victim with serious neck injury Shocking dashcam footage shows people fleeing scene of terror attack Hero Londoners try to save victims of city's latest terror attack Bloodied man led to safety through a cordon of armed police Moment gunshots are heard outside a restaurant in London Bridge Police tell drinkers to 'get down immediately' in London bar Exclusive: Armed police order people to the floor in Barking Horrific moment man randomly hits 90-year-old with cane in NYC Shocking moment woman blocks young boy from brutal crash This cat wants out!

However this year could change as we are hearing that Apple could be launching new hardware, such as new laptops, new iPads, and so on. In fact to support this speculation, it has been noticed that the shipping estimates for Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Pros have been slipping. According to Apple’s website and noted by MacRumors, the laptops are now said to ship between June 5-June 7 for the faster option, or June 6-8 for the free shipping option. Given that there hasn’t been a surge in purchases, it does seem odd and it would suggest that Apple is running low on stock in anticipation that they will be replacing the existing models with newer ones. We doubt that it will be too big of a hardware refresh, so most likely we’ll be looking at newer processors and some minor improvements. We haven’t really heard anything about the 12-inch MacBook but it is also rumored to be one of the laptops that Apple plans on refreshing. In any case maybe we’re reading too much into this so take it with a grain of salt, but with WWDC kicking off next Monday we should have the official details soon. Filed in Apple >Computers >Rumors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Raising the bar: Apple’s 11th annual Supplier Responsibility progress report released Apple’s responsible sourcing efforts expanded beyond conflict minerals to include cobalt for the first time. For the second year in a row, 100% of Apple’s tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters and refiners are participating in independent third-party audits. Apple has also partnered with numerous NGOs to drive positive change on the ground, including Pact, who are working to provide essential health and safety training to artisanal mining and building programs to help children stay in school. In 2016, Apple trained more than 2.4 million workers on their rights as employees. Since 2008, over 2 million people have participated in Apple’s Supplier Employee Education and Development (SEED) program. It offers opportunities to earn higher education degrees, attend vocational training, and take classes in arts, finance and language skills.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Record-Breaking Holiday Season for the App Store CUPERTINO, California — January 6, 2016 — Apple® today announced that customers around the world made this holiday season the biggest ever for the App Store®, setting new records during the weeks of Christmas and New Year’s.  In the two weeks ending January 3, customers spent over $1.1 billion on apps and in-app purchases, setting back-to-back weekly records for traffic and purchases. January 1, 2016 marked the biggest day in App Store history with customers spending over $144 million. It broke the previous single-day record set just a week earlier on Christmas Day. “The App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending over $20 billion on the App Store last year alone,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We’re grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can’t wait for what’s to come in 2016.” Worldwide, the App Store has brought in nearly $40 billion for developers since 2008, with over one-third generated in the last year alone. Largely as a result of the App Store’s success, Apple is now responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Nearly three-quarters of those jobs — over 1.4 million — are attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* Apple has previously reported that the iOS app economy has created 1.2 million jobs in Europe and 1.4 million jobs in China. Gaming, Social Networking and Entertainment were among the year’s most popular App Store categories across Apple products, with customers challenging themselves to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Trivia Crack and Heads Up!, and staying in touch with friends and family using Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Snapchat. Games and subscription apps dominated this year’s top grossing titles including Clash of Clans, Monster Strike, Game of War – Fire Age and Fantasy Westward Journey, as well as Netflix, Hulu and Match. The launch of the all-new Apple TV® and Apple Watch® have paved the way for entirely new app experiences, changing how people consume content through their television and providing useful information at a glance on Apple’s most personal device yet. Since its launch in October, the new Apple TV’s most popular apps include Rayman Adventures, Beat Sports and HBO NOW. Chart-topping apps for Apple Watch owners include fitness apps Nike+ Running and Lifesum, and iTranslate and Citymapper in the Travel category. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in the United States,” January 6, 2016 Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

The iOS App Development Center, to be located at a partner institution in Naples, will support teachers and provide a specialized curriculum preparing thousands of future developers to be part of Apple’s thriving developer community. In addition, Apple will work with partners around Italy who deliver developer training to complement this curriculum and create additional opportunities for students. Apple expects to expand this program to other countries around the world. “Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent.” Apple is a powerful engine of growth across Europe and the company’s ecosystem now supports more than 1.4 million jobs, including 1.2 million attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* The unprecedented growth of the App Store® has helped developers in Europe earn over €10.2 billion from selling their apps around the world. In Italy, over 75,000 jobs are attributable to the App Store and the developer community is vibrant. IK Multimedia launched its first app in 2009 and since then has had over 25 million downloads. Musement, launched in 2013, is now available in seven languages and 300 cities across 50 countries, making it easy for people to book travel and excursions on the go. Roberto Macina, CEO and founder of Qurami, said: “Apple’s continued innovation inspires us to create the best mobile experiences and make our customers’ lives just a little bit easier. Apple’s app ecosystem is the anchor for our business, and developing across Apple’s operating systems has enabled us to easily and quickly bring the Qurami experience to iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users.” Thousands of companies are expanding because of their work with Apple, which supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in communities large and small across Europe. Milan-based Laboratorio Elettrofisico makes some of the most sophisticated magnetization equipment in the world and their technology enables some of the industry-leading magnetic features found in Apple products. Apple also works with Europe’s leading manufacturers of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, which create tiny components that power some of the incredible sensor and audio technologies found in iOS devices. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in Europe,” January 21, 2016.

We are thrilled Apple will have a local presence which will amplify our efforts to develop more high-quality apps for our digital commerce ecosystem.” “Apple’s investment in Bengaluru through its iOS Development Accelerator will have far-reaching effects for the area’s rapidly growing and highly talented developer community,” said NASSCOM President R Chandrashekhar. “The skills and training they gain through this effort will significantly improve their app design and help them reach a broader market. Initiatives like these move the country forward in our efforts to advance a growth-led and sustainable technology sector.” The iOS App Design and Development Accelerator is expected to open in early 2017.

It wasn't that long ago that having a CD stacker in your car was considered high-tech, when the thought of switching seamlessly from Eminem to Green Day, with U2 and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers thrown in to the mix, had you jumping into the driver's seat at even the sniff of an opportunity. Rapidly changing technology has brought with it shining new toys which is reflected in the homes in which we live, the jobs we do and the cars we choose to drive. And of course in our mobile phones, which have quickly become an extension of how we communicate in all aspects of our lives. Such is our dependence on our phones that we can't be parted from them, even whilst driving. And being distracted by a text while in control of a three tonne vehicle can never be a good thing. Enter Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, designed to allow you to stay connected with your world with your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. That's great, but what exactly is it? Put simply, they are third-party apps that mimic the functions of your phone and run on your car's computer interface. The idea is to access your favourite music, make calls and answer texts by using voice commands instead of your hands. The Android Auto home screen. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have been around since the end of 2014 but it is only in the last year, with most manufacturers integrating them into new cars, that they have truly come into their own. The Apple CarPlay home screen. What do you need? Well, cars need to be able to support the systems in the first place. As mentioned above, most cars that are less than two years old either have capacity or can have their software upgraded to be compatible. There are after-market systems that will allow some older cars to also run with the cool kids. You need an iPhone (5 and up) to access CarPlay and an Android device for Android Auto. Pretty self explanatory, but you just never know... How do you get started? For CarPlay, you plug your iPhone into the car using a USB cable, and viola, there it is - the face of your phone on your car's multimedia screen but with a select few apps. You will recognise the icons for Phone, Music, Maps, Messages, Now Playing, Podcasts and Audio. They are big and bright and hard to miss. None of these icons can be removed but you can add a small number of apps like Spotify and Pandora. Android Auto takes a couple more steps. You need to download the app first, then sync your phone with the car, but that is usually not a tricky process. Rather than icons, the screen is a list of the activities in play at the time of use, so the music you are listening to, recent calls and messages and perhaps the place you are navigating to. There is a tab bar at the bottom which features Navigation, Calls and Messages, Home Screen, Music and Audio and Exit. Do they work on telepathy? Yes, if the voices in your head count.  Both interfaces encourage voice commands with CarPlay using 'Siri' to do your bidding and Android Auto using 'Google Now'. You have to press the voice command button or microphone on your steering wheel to offer up your wishes, although in CarPlay you can just say "Hey Siri" to get her going. Of course, you can use manual commands but the systems do prompt you to verbalise your needs instead.  What can they do for you? Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can replicate in the car the functions you most use on your phone when you are not driving. You can use them to make calls, listen to messages, read, answer and send texts and to listen to your favourite music and playlists. Apple CarPlay map screen. You can also use Apple maps (CarPlay) or Google maps for directions which is handy in cars that don't have built-in sat nav or to find the nearest service station or shopping centre. Android Auto map screen.  Are there any major differences? Aside from the home screen it is a case of trying to achieve the same goal in different ways. Both will lower the sound of the music when giving navigation instructions and pop the command on the top of the screen if you are in a music app for example. Both are adept at making calls and reading texts although Siri and I do tend to have differing views on pronunciation. Android Auto uses Google Maps which gets a tick from me as I find those maps more reliable and user friendly. It will highlight changing traffic conditions ahead and offer alternate routes and you can also use the pinch function to easily zoom in and out.  Android Auto's music screen. But Apple CarPlay does better with giving you access to your music than Google does with Android Auto. You can call up your full music collection and browse by song, artist, playlist, etc, while in Android Auto, although you can play and pause music from the home screen, you can't browse your collection and are restricted to playlists and the queue.  Apple CarPlay's music screen. Both interfaces have sporadic problems with Spotify, but that's the fault of the app itself.  Which one is better? Neither is perfect and in the end both accomplish the same thing. It simply comes down to whether you are an Apple or Android user. I like the functionality and ordered approach of Apple products whilst you may prefer the delights of Android. Whatever they may be. Do you think Apple CarPlay is better than Android Auto? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

That's the portal that's meant for people looking to switch to an iPhone, as the name implies. And with the new page came a new ad campaign as well, which debuted on the same day. A few different ads were released then, and three more have been outed today. These are all short, 15-second clips. Two of them (titled "smooth" and "security", respectively) focus on features that Apple thinks its smartphones have that the competition doesn't offer on the same level. "Your iPhone just works", Apple says with regard to 'smoothness', because it's the one designing both the hardware and the software. iPhones are more secure than their competitors because they get access to the latest updates for much longer - that's the idea pushed by the ad above. The third ad is called "contacts" and wants to assure people looking to switch that it's not going to be a hassle to take their address book with them when they come from Android. Apple's Move to iOS app can be found in the Google Play Store and its purpose is exactly to help people make the transition without any issues.

Madrigal Sep 6, 2012 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Behind every Google Map, there is a much more complex map that's the key to your queries but hidden from your view. The deep map contains the logic of places: their no-left-turns and freeway on-ramps, speed limits and traffic conditions. This is the data that you're drawing from when you ask Google to navigate you from point A to point B -- and last week, Google showed me the internal map and demonstrated how it was built. It's the first time the company has let anyone watch how the project it calls GT, or "Ground Truth," actually works. Google opened up at a key moment in its evolution. The company began as an online search company that made money almost exclusively from selling ads based on what you were querying for. But then the mobile world exploded. Where you're searching from has become almost as important as what you're searching for. Google responded by creating an operating system, brand, and ecosystem in Android that has become the only significant rival to Apple's iOS. And for good reason. If Google's mission is to organize all the world's information, the most important challenge -- far larger than indexing the web -- is to take the world's physical information and make it accessible and useful. "If you look at the offline world, the real world in which we live, that information is not entirely online," Manik Gupta, the senior product manager for Google Maps, told me. "Increasingly as we go about our lives, we are trying to bridge that gap between what we see in the real world and [the online world], and Maps really plays that part." This is not just a theoretical concern. Mapping systems matter on phones precisely because they are the interface between the offline and online worlds. If you're at all like me, you use mapping more than any other application except for the communications suite (phone, email, social networks, and text messaging). Google is locked in a battle with the world's largest company, Apple, about who will control the future of mobile phones. Whereas Apple's strengths are in product design, supply chain management, and retail marketing, Google's most obvious realm of competitive advantage is in information. Geo data -- and the apps built to use it -- are where Google can win just by being Google. That didn't matter on previous generations of iPhones because they used Google Maps, but now Apple's created its own service. How the two operating systems incorporate geo data and present it to users could become a key battleground in the phone wars. But that would entail actually building a better map. *** The office where Google has been building the best representation of the world is not a remarkable place. It has all the free food, ping pong, and Google Maps-inspired Christoph Niemann cartoons that you'd expect, but it's still a low-slung office building just off the 101 in Mountain View in the burbs. I was slated to meet with Gupta and the engineering ringleader on his team, former NASA engineer Michael Weiss-Malik, who'd spent his 20 percent time working on Google Mars, and Nick Volmar, an "operator" who actually massages map data. "So you want to make a map," Weiss-Malik tells me as we sit down in front of a massive monitor. "There are a couple of steps. You acquire data through partners. You do a bunch of engineering on that data to get it into the right format and conflate it with other sources of data, and then you do a bunch of operations, which is what this tool is about, to hand massage the data. And out the other end pops something that is higher quality than the sum of its parts." This is what they started out with, the TIGER data from the US Census Bureau (though the base layer could and does come from a variety of sources in different countries). On first inspection, this data looks great. The roads look like they are all there and you've got the freeways differentiated. This is a good map to the untrained eye. But let's look closer. There are issues where the digital data does not match the physical world. I've circled a few obvious ones below. And that's just from comparing the map to the satellite imagery. But there are also a variety of other tools at Google's disposal. One is bringing in data from other sources, say the US Geological Survey. But Google's Ground Truthers can also bring another exclusive asset to bear on the maps problem: the Street View cars' tracks and imagery. In keeping with Google's more-data-is-better-data mantra, the maps team, largely driven by Street View, is publishing more imagery data every two weeks than Google possessed total in 2006.* Let's step back a tiny bit to recall with wonderment the idea that a single company decided to drive cars with custom cameras over every road they could access. Google is up to five million miles driven now. Each drive generates two kinds of really useful data for mapping. One is the actual tracks the cars have taken; these are proof-positive that certain routes can be taken. The other are all the photos. And what's significant about the photographs in Street View is that Google can run algorithms that extract the traffic signs and can even paste them onto the deep map within their Atlas tool. So, for a particularly complicated intersection like this one in downtown San Francisco, that could look like this: Google Street View wasn't built to create maps like this, but the geo team quickly realized that computer vision could get them incredible data for ground truthing their maps. Not to detour too much, but what you see above is just the beginning of how Google is going to use Street View imagery. Think of them as the early web crawlers (remember those?) going out in the world, looking for the words on pages. That's what Street View is doing. One of its first uses is finding street signs (and addresses) so that Google's maps can better understand the logic of human transportation systems. But as computer vision and OCR improve, any word that is visible from a road will become a part of Google's index of the physical world. Later in the day, Google Maps VP Brian McClendon put it like this: "We can actually organize the world's physical written information if we can OCR it and place it," McClendon said. "We use that to create our maps right now by extracting street names and addresses, but there is a lot more there."    More like what? "We already have what we call 'view codes' for 6 million businesses and 20 million addresses, where we know exactly what we're looking at," McClendon continued. "We're able to use logo matching and find out where are the Kentucky Fried Chicken signs ... We're able to identify and make a semantic understanding of all the pixels we've acquired. That's fundamental to what we do." For now, though, computer vision transforming Street View images directly into geo-understanding remains in the future. The best way to figure out if you can make a left turn at a particular intersection is still to have a person look at a sign -- whether that's a human driving or a human looking at an image generated by a Street View car. There is an analogy to be made to one of Google's other impressive projects: Google Translate. What looks like machine intelligence is actually only a recombination of human intelligence. Translate relies on massive bodies of text that have been translated into different languages by humans; it then is able to extract words and phrases that match up. The algorithms are not actually that complex, but they work because of the massive amounts of data (i.e. human intelligence) that go into the task on the front end. Google Maps has executed a similar operation. Humans are coding every bit of the logic of the road onto a representation of the world so that computers can simply duplicate (infinitely, instantly) the judgments that a person already made. This reality is incarnated in Nick Volmar, the operator who has been showing off Atlas while Weiss-Malik and Gupta explain it. He probably uses twenty-five keyboard shortcuts switching between types of data on the map and he shows the kind of twitchy speed that I associate with long-time designers working with Adobe products or professional Starcraft players. Volmar has clearly spent thousands of hours working with this data. Weiss-Malik told me that it takes hundreds of operators to map a country. (Rumor has it many of these people work in the Bangalore office, out of which Gupta was promoted.) The sheer amount of human effort that goes into Google's maps is just mind-boggling. Every road that you see slightly askew in the top image has been hand-massaged by a human. The most telling moment for me came when we looked at couple of the several thousand user reports of problems with Google Maps that come in every day. The Geo team tries to address the majority of fixable problems within minutes. One complaint reported that Google did not show a new roundabout that had been built in a rural part of the country. The satellite imagery did not show the change, but a Street View car had recently driven down the street and its tracks showed the new road perfectly. Volmar began to fix the map, quickly drawing the new road and connecting it to the existing infrastructure. In his haste (and perhaps with the added pressure of three people watching his every move), he did not draw a perfect circle of points. Weiss-Malik and I detoured into another conversation for a couple of minutes. By the time I looked back at the screen, Volmar had redrawn the circle with perfect precision and upgraded a few other things while he was at it. The actions were impressively automatic. This is an operation that promotes perfectionism. And that's how you get your maps to look this this: Some details are worth pointing out. In the top at the center, trails have been mapped out and coded as places for walking. All the parking lots have been mapped out. All the little roads, say, to the left of the small dirt patch on the right, have also been coded. Several of the actual buildings have been outlined. Down at the bottom left, a road has been marked as a no-go. At each and every intersection, there are arrows that delineate precisely where cars can and cannot turn. Now imagine doing this for every tile on Google's map in the United States and 30 other countries over the last four years. Every roundabout perfectly circular, every intersection with the correct logic. Every new development. Every one-way street. This is a task of a nearly unimaginable scale. This is not something you can put together with a few dozen smart engineers. I came away convinced that the geographic data Google has assembled is not likely to be matched by any other company. The secret to this success isn't, as you might expect, Google's facility with data, but rather its willingness to commit humans to combining and cleaning data about the physical world. Google's map offerings build in the human intelligence on the front end, and that's what allows its computers to tell you the best route from San Francisco to Boston. *** It's probably better not to think of Google Maps as a thing like a paper map. Geographic information systems represent a jump from paper maps like the abacus to the computer. "I honestly think we're seeing a more profound change, for map-making, than the switch from manuscript to print in the Renaissance," University of London cartographic historian Jerry Brotton told the Sydney Morning Herald. "That was huge. But this is bigger." The maps we used to keep folded in our glove compartments were a collection of lines and shapes that we overlaid with human intelligence. Now, as we've seen, a map is a collection of lines and shapes with Nick Volmar's (and hundreds of others') intelligence encoded within. It's common when we discuss the future of maps to reference the Borgesian dream of a 1:1 map of the entire world. It seems like a ridiculous notion that we would need a complete representation of the world when we already have the world itself. But to take scholar Nathan Jurgenson's conception of augmented reality seriously, we would have to believe that every physical space is, in his words, "interpenetrated" with information. All physical spaces already are also informational spaces. We humans all hold a Borgesian map in our heads of the places we know and we use it to navigate and compute physical space. Google's strategy is to bring all our mental maps together and process them into accessible, useful forms. Their MapMaker product makes that ambition clear. Project managed by Gupta during his time in India, it's the "bottom up" version of Ground Truth. It's a publicly accessible way to edit Google Maps by adding landmarks and data about your piece of the world. It's a way of sucking data out of human brains and onto the Internet. And it's a lot like Google's open competitor, Open Street Map, which has proven that it, too, can harness the crowd's intelligence. As we slip and slide into a world where our augmented reality is increasingly visible to us off and online, Google's geographic data may become its most valuable asset. Not solely because of this data alone, but because location data makes everything else Google does and knows more valuable. Or as my friend and sci-fi novelist Robin Sloan put it to me, "I maintain that this is Google's core asset. In 50 years, Google will be the self-driving car company (powered by this deep map of the world) and, oh, P.S. they still have a search engine somewhere." Of course, they will always need one more piece of geographic information to make all this effort worthwhile: You. Where you are, that is. Your location is the current that makes Google's giant geodata machine run. They've built this whole playground as an elaborate lure for you. As good and smart and useful as it is, good luck resisting taking the bait. * Due to a transcription error, an earlier version of this story stated that Google published 20PB of imagery data every two weeks. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video Trump's Most Drastic Statement Yet The U.S. abandons the Paris Accord—and the global community it helped build. Uri Friedman, Daniel Lombroso, and Leah Varjacques Jun 1, 2017 About the Author Alexis C. Madrigal is a staff writer at The Atlantic. He's the author of Powering the Dream: The History and Promise of Green Technology. Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by Jonathan Bachman / Reuters The Myth of the Kindly General Lee Adam Serwer The legend of the Confederate leader’s heroism and decency is based in the fiction of a person who never existed. The strangest part about the continued personality cult of Robert E. Lee is how few of the qualities his admirers profess to see in him he actually possessed. Memorial Day has the tendency to conjure up old arguments about the Civil War. That’s understandable; it was created to mourn the dead of a war in which the Union was nearly destroyed, when half the country rose up in rebellion in defense of slavery. This year, the removal of Lee’s statue in New Orleans has inspired a new round of commentary about Lee, not to mention protests on his behalf by white supremacists. The myth of Lee goes something like this: He was a brilliant strategist and devoted Christian man who abhorred slavery and labored tirelessly after the war to bring the country back together. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Panic President David A. Graham Rarely does a leader in a liberal democracy embrace, let alone foment, fear. But that’s exactly what Donald Trump did in response to attacks in London, as he has often done before. After a terrorist attack, there are two steps nearly every leader takes: first, condemn the violence; second, appeal for calm. London Mayor Sadiq Khan followed that familiar playbook in the wake of Saturday night’s attacks. Speaking to the BBC, Khan said: There aren’t words to describe the grief and anger that our city is feeling today. I’m appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners and bystanders enjoying their Saturday night. There can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists, and I’m quite clear that we will never let them win, nor will we allow to cower our city. Then Khan went on reassure the public: Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed. One of the things, the police, all of us need to do, is make sure we’re as safe as we possibly can be. I’m reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as safe as we possibly can. Continue Reading Neil Hall / Reuters What Trump Doesn't Understand About Gun Control in Great Britain David Frum British policies have proved remarkably effective—a fact that Saturday’s attack underscores, rather than undermines. Amid a flurry of other comments after the London attack, the president of the United States tweeted the following: Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017 OK, so let’s talk about guns. Here’s a picture of London’s Borough Market on a more typical day in 2011. Here’s a scene of foot traffic on London Bridge leading to Borough Market. On a pleasant summer evening, tens of thousands of Londoners walk through or enjoy themselves in the neighborhood the terrorists attacked. Three men armed with high-capacity firearms would not have killed seven and wounded 48: They would have killed hundreds or even more. British police could use their firepower advantage to kill the three terrorists in eight minutes. Had the terrorists been equally armed, who knows what the outcome of the gun battle might have been? Continue Reading HBO The Leftovers: A Nicer Story Spencer Kornhaber and Sophie Gilbert In “The Book of Nora,” a brilliant and continually surprising television show came to an end. Each week following episodes of the third and final season of The Leftovers, Sophie Gilbert and Spencer Kornhaber will discuss HBO’s drama about the aftermath of 2 percent of the world’s population suddenly vanishing. Spencer Kornhaber: By the time of its series finale, The Leftovers had already proven itself as a powerful statement about humanity. Its very last episode added in a powerful statement about goats. In this extremely weird, extremely emotional closing chapter, Nora’s Shawshank Redemption-esque assumption of an ensnared beast’s beads may have been the most weirdly emotional moment of all—one last mysterious encounter between human intelligence and nature’s randomness. With doves, dogs, deer, lions, and goats, The Leftovers has shown how to look into an animal’s eyes is to realize something about yourself. It has also shown that a jammed door can be the source of an epiphany, and the human search for meaning can result in unthinkable betrayal and incredible forgiveness. Continue Reading All photos courtesy of Alex Tizon and his family My Family’s Slave Alex Tizon  She lived with us for 56 years. She raised me and my siblings without pay. I was 11, a typical American kid, before I realized who she was. The ashes filled a black plastic box about the size of a toaster. It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family’s household. Continue Reading Peter Nicholls / Reuters Why Trump Criticized a London Under Attack Peter Beinart The president believes that globalism costs jobs and lives—and that what makes America exceptional is its resistance to global integration. The narcissism generally comes first. Early Saturday evening, an hour after first retweeting a Drudge Report alert about the London terrorist attack, Donald Trump declared that, “We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!” In other words, London proves him right. Everything does. When Omar Mateen murdered 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last June, Trump tweeted, “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.” That same month, when The Wall Street Journal reported that NATO was considering creating a new intelligence coordinator to assist in the fight against terrorism, Trump—who wasn’t even yet the Republican presidential nominee—explained, “It’s all because of me.” Continue Reading mynameisharsha/flickr Life as a Nonviolent Psychopath Judith Ohikuare Neuroscientist James Fallon discovered through his work that he has the brain of a psychopath, and subsequently learned a lot about the role of genes in personality and how his brain affects his life. In 2005, James Fallon's life started to resemble the plot of a well-honed joke or big-screen thriller: A neuroscientist is working in his laboratory one day when he thinks he has stumbled upon a big mistake. He is researching Alzheimer's and using his healthy family members' brain scans as a control, while simultaneously reviewing the fMRIs of murderous psychopaths for a side project. It appears, though, that one of the killers' scans has been shuffled into the wrong batch. The scans are anonymously labeled, so the researcher has a technician break the code to identify the individual in his family, and place his or her scan in its proper place. When he sees the results, however, Fallon immediately orders the technician to double check the code. But no mistake has been made: The brain scan that mirrors those of the psychopaths is his own. Continue Reading Miraflores Palace / Reuters How Populism Helped Wreck Venezuela Uri Friedman The story of how the country went from cheap fridges to no food is about more than socialism and corruption. What’s the problem with populism? Why, in some circles, has the term acquired such a negative connotation? After all, you could argue that populism is simply the promotion of popular ideas with which elites disagree. You could think of it as a movement to uproot a political establishment that has become unresponsive to the public. But populism can also be described as a political logic by which politicians claim to exclusively represent the righteous people in a struggle against the corrupt elite. And the hazards of adhering to that logic are on display right now in Venezuela. Hugo Chavez, the late leader of Venezuela’s socialist revolution, once provided his people with subsidized refrigerators from China, appearing on television in a mock kitchen to personally cross out the “capitalist” price tag on a fridge and write in a “Chavez discount.” Now his successor’s people have little to refrigerate. Three-fourths of Venezuelans reported involuntarily losing an average of 19 pounds in 2016 because of rampant food shortages and runaway inflation, which is making basic goods unaffordable. A third of Venezuelans reported eating two or fewer meals a day last year—triple the number recorded a year earlier. Child malnutrition has reached crisis levels. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors. Continue Reading Joshua Roberts / Reuters The Republican Dilemma Jay Caruso GOP leaders are stuck trying to rein in Trump’s excesses without alienating their own primary voters, who are largely standing by their president. CARTERSVILLE, Ga.—Several miles off Route 41 in Bartow County, Georgia, is the downtown area of Cartersville. It's a throwback place with brick-face storefronts, independently owned businesses, and railroad tracks that bring freight trains straight through the center of the town every 30 minutes. Here, the firing of James Comey arouses not support or opposition, but rather, indifference. Nobody I spoke with cared either way; it doesn't affect them or their families. People shrugged when asked about Trump's tweetstorms. Most agreed that press treatment of Trump is too harsh. Overall, the focus for Trump voters here is the big picture: the economy, jobs, and border security. Bartow County is 885 miles from Manhattan, but this is Donald Trump country. He took 46 percent of the vote here during the primary, trailed by Ted Cruz at 25 percent and Marco Rubio at 18 percent. In the general election, Trump trounced Hillary Clinton, winning 75 percent of the vote to Clinton's 21 percent.

Published on Apple’s official YouTube channel, the new mini-ads, running sixteen seconds each, promote the company’s ability to roll out important security fixes fast via iOS software updates. Apple is also praising the smartphone’s smooth, stutter-free performance while highlighting easy contact transfer via the Move to iOS app for those who would gladly switch to an iPhone. Smooth “We design the hardware and the software so your iPhone just works,” says Apple. Security “Access to the latest updates keeps your iPhone secure,” reads the description. Contacts “Switch to iPhone,” reads the video’s description. “The Move to iOS app makes it simple to move your contacts, photos, and more to iPhone.” The new ads use the tagline “Life’s easier when you switch to iPhone” and direct viewers to the recently revamped ”Switch to iPhone” webpage at apple.com/switch. Apple’s mini-website for switchers now includes useful new sections covering topics like in-house designed iPhone chips, powerful cameras, easy of use, customer support and more.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Google Assistant began life as an exclusive feature for Google Pixel phones. But now it’s slowly starting to spread its wings. First, modern Android devices running Marshmallow and Nougat got it, Google Assistant Is Coming to More Smartphones Google Assistant Is Coming to More Smartphones Google is beginning to roll Google Assistant out to more smartphones. Unfortunately, the majority of Android handsets are not included in this initial rollout thanks to fragmentation. Read More  and now it’s available as a standalone app for the iPhone You Can Now Use Google Assistant on Your iPhone You Can Now Use Google Assistant on Your iPhone Google has done the unthinkable and brought Google Assistant to the iPhone. Google Assistant is Google's answer to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Amazon's Alexa. Read More (in the U.S.). It’s no secret that when it comes to online services, Google is much better at it than Apple. And when MKBHD compared Siri on iOS vs Google Assistant on Android, Google Assistant threw quite a lot of punches. But how does Google Assistant work on the iPhone? What exactly does it do? And is it worth your time? Setting Up and Using Google Assistant on iPhone Setting up Google Assistant on iPhone is really easy. If you already use a Google app on your iPhone and you’re logged in, you’ll see an option to continue with the same account. You’re then taken to Google Assistant’s conversational interface. This is similar to Siri, only with less of a The Dark Knight feel and more of a daytime talk show vibe. There’s a microphone button at the bottom. Tap it and start talking to your assistant. As the speech recognition engine is backed by Google it’s actually really good at picking up what you say (although as it’s U.S. only right now, there’s no option to change the language). That’s mostly what Google wants you to do with this app: talk, explore, get answers, do things. Google Assistant has another party trick up its sleeve. Tap on the faded keyboard button in the bottom-right and up pops the keyboard Did Google Make the Best iPhone Keyboard Yet? Meet Gboard Did Google Make the Best iPhone Keyboard Yet? Meet Gboard Google recently launched a new keyboard for iPhones called Gboard, and it's exclusively available on iOS right now. It's also probably the best mobile keyboard you have ever used. Read More . You can now type to Google Assistant and ask for help when you can’t summon it with your voice (something you can’t do with Siri). You’ll see a floating Assistant icon in the top right. Once you tap it you’ll find the Explore and My Stuff tabs. Explore tab lists things you can ask Assistant to do for you and My Stuff lets you view your reminders, agenda, shopping list and shortcuts all in one page. To go to Settings or Account, tap on the three-dot menu in the top-right. The Flash Briefing feature is also present but you need to enable new sources from Settings first. Google has also made it easy (well, as easy as it can be) to start talking to Google Assistant. If you have an iPhone 6s or above, you can just 3D Touch Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone 3D touch is really just a fancy name for a pressure-sensitive screen, but adds a whole array of extra input options to iOS.

Here's how to use them. Read More to start talking to it directly from the Lock screen. Siri Has Home Field Advantage Siri is integrated into iOS. It has system level access to your data, it can perform system level tasks and is accessible from anywhere. Google Assistant has none of those privileges.

If you’re using iPhone 6s or above, you can even set up “Hey Siri” functionality Make the Most of Hands-Free "Hey Siri" on Your iPhone or iPad Make the Most of Hands-Free "Hey Siri" on Your iPhone or iPad Here's how Apple's hands-free "Hey Siri" command can make your life easier.

To talk to Google Assistant, you have to unlock your iPhone and at least tap once (even if it is to 3D Touch the app icon from your Home screen). And once you start talking to Assistant, Siri’s home field advantage just grows.

Read More , and so on. It’s these system-level tasks where Google Assistant doesn’t do so well or outright fails. When you ask Assistant to call someone for you, it will throw up a popup that you need to tap before it can connect the call for you. Sending an iMessage isn’t possible. Neither is setting an alarm, changing settings or controlling HomeKit accessories. You can ask Assistant to remind you about something but it won’t add it to the Reminders app — it will be stored in your Google account instead. Google Assistant Is Great for All Things Google Then what is Google Assistant actually good for? Searching for one This Cool Website Will Teach You Hundreds of Google Search Tips This Cool Website Will Teach You Hundreds of Google Search Tips Anyone can use Google search to a satisfactory degree, but if you really want to get fast and accurate results, you'll want to learn these simple but amazing tips. Read More . And because Siri integrates with Bing search, these are exactly the things Siri isn’t so good at. Whether it’s asking difficult time zone conversion questions, looking for a restaurant nearby, doing complex math, looking up trivia, or just looking at pictures of cats, Assistant does it right, almost every time. Google is also better at follow up questions and remembering the context. You can ask Google how far a city is and what’s the temperature there without repeating its name. Then there’s the extended Google apps and services family. If you’re one of those people who use Google’s suite of products on iPhone (Google Maps, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc.) you’ll find that Google Assistant is actually helpful. You can ask Google for directions to a place and they’ll open directly in Google Maps Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Will Navigate Home Faster Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Will Navigate Home Faster Waze and Google Maps are both solid navigation apps, but which one is the best? Read More . And then there are some things you don’t even need to open the specific apps for. Just tell Assistant to send a mail to one of your contacts and it’ll be drafted right there. You can also directly add events to your Google calendar from here. The same goes for adding things to your shopping list. But there are also some weird outliers. When I asked Assistant to play YouTube videos, it opened YouTube website in Safari instead of the YouTube app. I also wasn’t able to get it to play songs in Play Music 7 Cool Things You Can Do With Google Play Music 7 Cool Things You Can Do With Google Play Music In this article, we'll introduce you to some cool things you can do with Google Play Music that both beginners and veterans alike may not be aware of, but should make use of. Read More . A Note About Privacy Google Assistant records your voice and sends it to its servers. If you give it permission, it also records the location where you interacted with it. Plus, some functionality requires you to give it access to your contacts. Of course, Apple also does all of that but Apple’s privacy policy is better than Google’s. Google is known to use user’s information like their preferences and location to serve them ads. Apple encrypts the data that’s sent to their servers. If you’re all in on Google’s ecosystem, you might have accepted it as the price to pay for the convenience of the service What Does Google Know About You? Find Out and Manage Your Privacy and Security What Does Google Know About You? Find Out and Manage Your Privacy and Security For the first time, search giant Google is offering a way for you to check the information it has about you, how it is gathering that data, and new tools to start reclaiming your privacy. Read More . Or you trust Google’s privacy policy (they do encrypt your data). Rest assured that as Assistant is an app, it can’t access any of your personal details stored in the device or specific features that you don’t give it access to. If you’re not comfortable with Google accessing your location, recording your voice and the conversation data, you should stay away from the Assistant app. Should You Be Using Google Assistant on iPhone? Google Assistant isn’t a replacement for Siri on the iPhone. Overall, Google Assistant might be a better voice assistant. But on the iPhone, it can’t hold a candle to Siri. Because Siri is a default, it’s not a fair comparison. If you’re a prolific user of Google’s services, it might be worth looking into Google Assistant. Right now the iPhone app can only perform a subset of tasks compared to its Android counterpart 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do Android's version of Siri -- Google Assistant -- is more powerful than most people realize.

Read More , Google Assistant might not be that useful for you. The Future of Google Assistant Google Assistant just made its way to the iPhone and it’s only available in the U.S. right now. Broadly speaking, Assistant is still new. Until a couple of months ago, it was exclusive to Pixel devices, Google Home and Google Allo app. Google is good at making small and consistent improvements to its software (a skill Apple should learn). And Google Assistant is at the beginning of that process. In the next few months, Google Assistant will get a lot more interesting, and a lot more useful — even for iPhone users.

Apple goes on the offensive in bid to lure Android users iPhone > Your Phone? Apple goes on the offensive in bid to lure Android users by Chris Smith 29 May 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple has released a series of new ‘Switch’ commercials it hopes will convince Android users to slide over to a new life on iOS with the iPhone. In the first video entitled Security, Apple attacks Android’s inability to keep out the bad guys, while Smooth hits out at perceived Android glitches. The final video, called Contacts, simply outlines how easy it is for Android users to migrate their contacts to the iPhone. Each of the ads presents a simple, short message Apple hopes will catch on as we move towards the business end of the year for the iPhone and iOS. The campaign is a definite step-up in Apple’s attempts to lure people to ‘Move to iOS’ from the rival platform. There’s even a hint of the old Mac vs PC ads in there. The company also has a well-functioning app that makes it easy to shift data from the Android platform over to a brand new iPhone. Move to iOS will transfer contacts, photos, message history, web bookmarks, mail accounts, calendars and some free apps (providing they’re available on both stores). While today’s commercials represent a more aggressive pitch from Apple, the firm failed to go for the jugular. With iOS 11 set to arrive for the vast majority of iDevice owners this year, Android Nougat is only running on around 7% of Android devices, despite its release last autumn. Are you an Android user considering the leap into enemy territory? Or are you Android for life? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Watch the three new commercials below. Apple has released two ads a week ago in the same style about music and photos. The ads wants viewers to visit the apple.com/switch site. The site answers questions like " Will it be easy to switch to iPhone?" and "Is the camera as good as they say?" and "Why is iPhone so fast?" The next iPhone will be marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Without the iPhone, Apple would not in any way as big as the company is today. Apple is rumored to release the iPhone 8 this fall along with the iPhone 7S. The iPhone 8 is has begun to leak. The edge-to-edge design with vertical dual camera setup is making the rounds as CAD files and dummies. This story may contain affiliate links.

The museum, open Wednesday through Sunday, is always free. Tumblr If you know where to look, you can find some pretty amazing things to do for free in Houston. Any day of the week you can watch the bat colony takeoff at sunset at the Waugh Drive Bridge or explore the 7,800 acres of George Bush Park in west Houston. Get a run in along Buffalo Bayou (with killer city photo ops) and let the kids press the big red button to make the bayou burp. You can spend your afternoon soaking up the sun at one of the many free public beaches in Galveston or escape the heat and get lost in a good read at Becker's Books, Murder By The Book, or any of Houston's other independent bookstores. Wander past the uber cool Beer Can House or stroll down the Kemah Boardwalk for Instagram-worthy views of Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. And for cultural excitement, check out the hidden murals throughout the city on a self-guided tour (with the help of this map). The city is bursting with things to do. Here are 18 free things you should check out in H-Town this summer, from unique date night ideas to yoga and fitness classes, and even ways to keep your kids learning during their summer break. 1. Send Your Kid to Apple Camp Yes, really. The Apple Store actually has a camp for kids, ages 8-12, where they can get creative with hands-on digital projects with the help of Apple experts. These three-day, 90-minute Apple Camps tend to fill up quickly so register early. 2. Play Bar Trivia with Geeks Who Drink With a name like Geeks Who Drink, you know their trivia game is legit. This Denver-based group has actual "quizmasters" who create their unique bar trivia questions. Games are hosted at different bars and breweries like the Barking Pig, Little Woodrow’s, and Town and City Brewing Company, among dozens of others and played in fun-loving, smack-talking kind of way. And of course there’s competition, so bring your friends, preferably your quick-thinking friends. 3. Tour a Local Brewery Aspiring brew masters and hopheads, head to your nearest brewery in town to get schooled on things like how to incorporate new ingredients into your brew and why some styles have more alcohol content over others. Of the 20 or so breweries in Houston, you can find a handful that offer free brewery tours like these: 8th Wonder Brewery Karbach Brewing Co Platypus Brewing 4. Splash Away at Schlitterbahn Waterpark In celebration of American Heroes Week, 5/29 – 6/4, all Military, Police, Firefighters and EMT’s will have free admission to Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Galveston. And yes, Schlitterbahn is for adults as much as it is for kids.  5. Explore the Unusual Underground Cistern From an underground drinking water reservoir (built in 1926) to an underground public space that hosts changing art installations, the Cistern is a highly unusual space that gets a lot of attention. Spanning 87,500-square-feet underground including 25-foot tall, slender concrete columns set row upon row, hovering over two inches of water on the reservoir’s floor. It’s absolutely stunning and the changing art installations use the space as part of their exhibit. It’s free on Thursdays but you still need to reserve a ticket, as space is limited. 6. Watch Movies Under the Stars Well it’s not a drive-in theater but it’s kind of the same idea minus the cars. Grab a blanket, pack your snacks and relax under the stars while watching some of your favorite stars on the big screen. These pop-movie movie spots are appearing all of over Houston. Alamo Drafthouse Rolling Roadshow presents movies under the stars at the historic Market Square on select Wednesday’s this summer showing movies like Dirty Dancing and Almost Famous. For family-friendly movies, head to the Discovery Green on select Saturday nights for movies like Secret Life of Pets, Ghostbusters and “Finding Dory.” Or check out movies at Sugar Land Town Square, also on Saturday nights featuring Pete’s Dragon and Moana. 7. Go for a Sunday Ride with Bayou Bikers The first Sunday of every month, Bayou Bikers meet up at Market Square and go for a 25-to-40 mile bike ride. Leave your road bike or cruiser at home as these bayou-exploring rides are best for mountain bikes and fat tire bikes. 8. Experience an Epic Sunset Light Show  Head to the campus of Rice University at sunrise or sunset to check out the largest sky space created by world-renowned artist James Turrell. By staring up through a 14-by-14-foot opening to the sky, you are surrounded by colors being projected via lights onto the building's ceiling. As the sky changes, so do the gradients of color on the ceiling, making you feel as though you are in a dream. With music that changes based on the sky patterns, the experience is always unique, integrating nature and technology. Free to view but reservations are required. 9. Learn the Circus Art A fitness style that is becoming all the rage, Circus Arts focuses on ground arts and acrobatics such as, low tight wire, partner acrobatics, contortion/flexibility, juggling and hand balancing. These Tuesday night classes are taught on the Hess Patio at Discovery Green and run through the end of June. The instructors are from Cique le Vie, a Houston Contemporary Circus company and you must be 13 and up to participate. 10. Cruise Around the City With Hundreds of Other Bicyclists Critical Mass takes places on the last Friday of every month, where bicyclists around the world meet up to pedal through their city. Houston’s Critical Mass meets up at the historic Market Square and rolls off sometime around 7:15 pm. It’s an absolute blast and a great way to meet new people. 11. Free Yoga but BYOM From sunrise to sunset on Labor Day, participating yoga studios across Houston and the nation offer free yoga classes for the Free Day of Yoga. This is a great time to try yoga for the first time or even just a new class and instructor.  If you don't want to wait until the end of the summer, here’s a list of a few additional places to choose from now: Athleta in Rice Village (there are other locations but this locations offers the most options) Discovery Green on Saturday mornings from 9 – 10 Lululemon in The Galleria and Highland Village Sugar Land Town Square 12. Spot Dolphins from the Galveston Island Ferry There’s no need to pay for a dolphin-watching tour when you can spot these adorable mammals from the Galveston Island Ferry on its way to Port Bolivar Peninsula. Seems like a random thing to do, but it’s free and the beaches on the peninsula are less crowded than on Galveston Island. Bring your car or walk on the ferry. 13. Writer’s Workshop for Kids Limited to 25 students on a first-come, first-served basis, this is Houston’s only free writing workshop for kids. On every Saturday in the summer at the Houston Public Library’s HPL Express, kids can learn how to express their thoughts and develop their language skills. 14.  Free Day at the Museum You’ll be happy to learn that some museums are actually free every day in Houston and others are free on specific days like first Thursday.  Here's a detailed list of the free museums. Bank of America card holders get free admission to over 100 museums in the nation as part of the "Museums on Us" program on the first full weekend of every month. In Houston, those museums are the Children's Museum of Houston and the Museum of Fine Arts Houston.  15. Skip the Gym and  Get Fit Outside Why buy an expensive gym membership when you can sample workout classes all around town? We’re not talking about a class pass either as there are tons of free workout classes throughout the city everyday.  And while it might get pretty toasty outside during the summer in Houston, look at it this way: You’ll be sweating more and burning more calories. Among the classes: Athleta Stores: Three locations and various classes throughout the week City Centre Running Club every Monday night Discovery Green: Hoop Dance - Sundays at 10:30 am Bumba Toning - Mondays at 6:30 pm Circus Arts - Tuesdays at 5:30 pm Yoga - Tuesdays at 6:30 pm Zumba - Wednesdays at 6:30 pm Parkour - Thursdays at 6:30 pm Yoga - Saturday at 9 am 16. Shake Things Up For Date Night Remix your Friday night date plans with a little dancing under the stars in the Plaza at Sugar Land Town Square. Dance instructors from the Fred Astaire Dance Studio will be there to show you a few new dance moves if you’re feeling adventurous. 17. Houston LGBT Pride Celebration The Houston LGBT Pride Festival and Pride Parade are at the center of the celebration with an attendance of over 700,000 people from all over the world. Taking place in downtown Houston on June 24 at noon, this festival is free and open to the public. No tickets are necessary unless you want to access the VIP areas. The parade kicks off that night when temperatures have cooled off a bit. 18. Boat Tour of the Port of Houston Set sail on a free 90-minute boat tour of the Port of Houston. You’ll learn about the history of the seaport and see massive ocean freighters and barges navigate the 50-mile channel. The MV Sam Houston has been giving tours of Port Houston since its inaugural voyage on July 30, 1958 and has welcomed over 2 million visitors. The tour is free but reservations are required.

According to Wozniak, Tesla is now the company that’s moving in the ‘best direction,’ as they continue to ‘put an awful lot of effort into very risky things.’ The tech giant says the firm’s ‘off the wall’ approach is paving the way for products that optimize both performance and elegance.

According to Wozniak, Tesla is now the company that’s moving in the ‘best direction’ ROBOTS WILL MAKE TESLA AS BIG AS APPLE, MUSK SAYS  Musk said his company's success in the coming decade would 'heavily involve Tesla going at the machine that builds the machine'. Musk is referring to automated manufacturing technologies that will produce the Tesla 3 model. The company will be rolling out three more production lines including one in the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc (NUMMI) factory in Fremont in California is projected to build 100,000 more cars every year. The Tesla boss believes this mechanised production will be more profitable than the overseas contact that Apple uses to manufacture goods.  In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Wozniak explained that self-driving cars are ‘probably the biggest, most obvious moonshot,’ at the moment. The technology, he said, could ‘hugely’ change our lives. And, when asked who might bring about the next breakthrough technology, Wozniak says his bet is on Tesla. ‘I don’t know, I think Tesla is on the best direction right now,’ Wozniak said. ‘They put an awful lot of effort into very risky things,’ he said, pointing to electric cars and self-driving cars as example. ‘Everybody needs transportation in our human life,’ Wozniak said. ‘So ideas of boring holes underground to get around traffic problems in big cities, ideas of the Hyperloop to accelerate traffic without having to take airplane flights. ‘So I’m going to bet on Tesla – so many of these off the wall different directions, and they start with a car.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Scientists spot 'potentially habitable' super-Earth planet...

But, Musk has hit back, publishing a FAQ on the company website outlining how the ‘Boring Company’ plans to achieve his vision. 'The key to making this work is increasing tunneling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more – this is the goal of the Boring Company,' it says. 'Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won't fall on your head,' it explains. 'I think Tesla is on the best direction right now,’ Wozniak said.

It came just six months after Musk first revealed his radical plan to beat LA's notorious gridlock.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

(05/29) May 29, 2017 Short Relief And Now Some Words On Our Sponsors by BP Staff Printer-friendly In-season holidays are a little weird, because while everyone is off spending time with their loved ones, the baseball players are technically still working their normal schedule. We understand this weird little contradiction, and so the BP staff are offering you a compromise: analysis, and baseball, but not actually baseball analysis. Instead, we've decided to pen a few words about baseball commercials: the ones we love, the ones we despise, the ones we cannot fathom, but at any rate the ones that have stuck with us. Grab a cup of coffee, some headphones, and join us on a little adventure. This commercial hits all sorts of classic comedy beats: we get to laugh at a man’s (Alec Baldwin’s) inflated sense of self-worth, an unexpected situation takes another unexpected twist, and there are one or two remarkably well-delivered punchlines. But there’s also a second level, perhaps unintended by writers Mike Schur and Charlie Grandy. At the nine-second mark, John Krasinski opens the door, but as he does he is laughing and saying “yeah” as if there is another human being offscreen. Baldwin delivers a punch, but notice that this person–if they even exist–says or does nothing. This indicates one of two things: either Krasinski was speaking to a sociopath incapable of displaying concern, or that there was no one else in the room at all. Krasinski, lonely, was talking to a figment of his own imagination. Then there’s Baldwin. At the 39-second mark, Krasinski remarks “Wow. Your commitment level is so high,” while rubbing his aching, angled jaw. Anyone who would run across town to punch a “friend” in the face after a hard-fought loss must be committed to their team, right? But earlier, Baldwin admits to leaving the game in the sixth inning, hardly indicative of his commitment to the Yankees, but rather indicative of his commitment to punching John Krasinski in the face. Each man appears to be using baseball to create a human connection, and there are hints that this is something they long for. Krasinski is so desperate for someone to talk to, he invented one, and remains upbeat despite being assaulted. Baldwin made a flimsy excuse–really, a close game in the sixth inning?–to dart across New York and stop in on a friend, leaving a bruise and tens of thousands of dollars in his wake. It is a bit of the joke about Pagliacci the Clown, humor hiding pain. It is the façade we build in order to protect our weaknesses, our loneliness, our hearts. It is baseball. -Bryan Grosnick The year is 1986, or perhaps the not too distant future. Earth is a dystopian wasteland where the only form of entertainment pits children against each other (perhaps to the death?) in baseball-esque feats of athleticism, complete with lasers, glowing orbs, and electric guitars. A mysterious crusader in red chillingly recruits a ringer (played by future Hall of Famer Pete Rose, in a star making turn as, um, Pete Rose, or a lifelike synthetic equivalent) to join the battle and lead the kids’ revolution in an attempt to break from the shackles of their sugary beverage overlords. It’s Thunderdome meets Space Jam (well, minus the Looney Toons). Directed by The Wachowskis. - Mark Barry This commercial was created in 1974 by copywriter James Hartzell of Campbell-Ewald/Detroit and it answers four very important questions: What’s America’s favorite sport? Favorite sandwich? Favorite Pie? And favorite car? Why it's Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Chevrolet, of course! Curly-haired Ed Labunski is the first image you see in the ad and that’s because he composed the music for the song, which is both joyous and celebratory. Back then, the sport of baseball brought everyone together and so did hot dogs, apple pie, and apparently, Chevrolet cars of all makes and models. Everyone from kids to adults are shown playing baseball. They even show some still shots of players and umpires from MLB games. It’s a patriotic ad in the sense that it takes us on a nearly one-minute journey and shows us a tapestry of America’s citizens enjoying four seemingly disparate concepts. The ad also shows us shots of landmarks like the Empire State Building and Golden Gate Bridge but it isn’t jingoistic or overtly patriotic in the way modern commercials tend to be. The closest thing to an American flag is a vanity plate that reads, “USA-1” which briefly flashes on the screen near the end of the ad. The commercial also settles a years-long debate as to whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. (Spoiler alert: People in the 1970s say the hot dog is a sandwich but people in the 1970s also thought leisure suits were cool, so can we really trust them?) -Stacey Gotsulias A series of questions and comments: What decade is this guy from? How did they get Cheech Marin for this commercial? Who? No defining moment has ever included Wil Nieves. No, really. Who? Stop saying Wil Nieves. Can we blame Wil Nieves for Wil Myers or nah? That second pitch is 100% not a fastball Wil Nieves had a career 61 OPS+ The Nationals won 59 games the year of this commercial, before you ask. And the year before. Wil Nieves was not in the majors for 12 years at the time of this commercial. He had appeared in 2002 (six years before this homer) and then went back to the minors until 2005. The commercial recorded in 2009, but was about a game in 2008. So again I ask, who the hell is this guy talking about. Do not say Wil Nieves. -Craig Goldstein The accordion’s optimistic lilt is too cheery, even when tempered by Moyer’s daddishly hokey “Oh la la!” This is what commercials do; they promise hyperbolic results with the ease of pulling back a café chair. But consider the fraud: Moyer’s metric radar gun came from France when imperial-eschewing Canada is a mere 188 kilometers from Safeco. And there is the kilometric measurement itself: “97,” the first pitch returns. “99,” blinks the second—60.2 and 61.5 miles per hour. Moyer’s tosses, at their most stultifying, settle in at the low 70s. The enormity of the lie, then, indicates not fraud, but fantasy. In the magical world of Mariners’ commercials, you can be as slow as you want to be. -Holly M. Wendt In 1980, Latinos made up just 6.5% of the US population, with a full 30% of that population living in California. The TV station KMEX first began airing Spanish-language programming back in 1962, pre-Univision, and was one of the first stations in the country to air spots created specifically for a Spanish-speaking market, like the one above. A family playing baseball and having breakfast in the park runs into Fernando Valenzuela at the peak of Fernandomania, and invites him to share in their Corn Flakes, which just happens to be Fernando Valenzuela’s favorite cereal. He sits down and the jingle kicks in, a Spanish version of the English tagline “When you sit down to America’s favorite cereal, the face on the package is you.” It reads slightly different in Spanish (you have a familiar face with you) but the marketing intent remains the same. Eat Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, and you too can be part of the American story, can see your face here. “Mexicans grabbed onto him with both hands to ride to the moon,” Vin Scully once noted about Valenzuela. For the thousands of Latinos in the LA area, Fernando Valenzuela made the face on the cereal box familiar. - Kate Preusser With how little Joey Votto is striking out and how much smack talk he is dishing out, it seems duly appropriate for me to dig back into the well of the widely adored This is Sportscenter commercials and unearth this gem. If you were ever wondering where Votto practices his insults, opportune moments to sarcastically wish Karl Ravech luck in a facial hair contest against the boldly mustachioed mascot, Mr. Red, have been instrumental in the development of his craft. Devotion to the art of budget acting is quietly displayed by Mr. Red’s commitment to actually wash his gloved hands. Whether that was intentional or a product of beautiful, unscripted acting gold, revealing the secrets on set only dismantle the purity of the 30 second spot. If only Roger Ebert were alive to give us his opinion on Votto’s chances to star in a remake of “The Natural,” we’d have a better bearing on one of the All-Star’s first Emmy-worthy performances. -Lance Brozdowski I struggle with this ad. In 1941, Orson Welles wrote, directed, and starred in Citizen Kane. By 1980 he was famous for two things: voice-over narration and advertisements like this, actually a clever parody of his work with the Paul Masson winery. It's also terrifyingly pathetic, a sell-out of a sell-out. Welles needed money; he always did. Fallen from grace in Hollywood, the man was always trying to finance another piece, a comeback; for years, it was The Other Side of the Wind, filmed over six years in the seventies, whenever he could afford the film. His final movie, F is for Fake, was so strange and its critics so little bent to charity that it was widely panned; no one was interested in giving him the benefit of the doubt. And so he read copy, fought with advertisers, drank and waited until he died. It's one thing I find comforting about baseball: that its victories aren't preyed upon by social relativism or fashion. One wins or loses. Welles himself stopped winning, in part, because people decided they didn't want him to. The Other Side of the Wind, through years of collation and crowdfunding, will be released in 2018, 23 years after his death. I hope we decide it's good. -Patrick Dubuque The year is 1980, and somewhere, the director at a marketing agency somewhere is entirely too pleased with himself. He’s taken his own beloved childhood memory, a cheeky baseball burlesque joke predicated on using interrogative pronouns, and turned it into yet another way to sell things to the masses. Will the kid he wants to buy candy bars care about the history behind the confusion about the name “Whatchamacallit?” Of course not. Maybe their parents will, though, which is good, because parents have the spending power. The kid - let’s say it’s you! - (if you’re an imaginary boy between the ages of eight and 12, because sexism was even more alive and well back in the 80s) doesn’t have to get the deeper layer within the casual banter. No, you don’t care about any of this. All that will happen for you is the next time you’re in a grocery store with mom, standing in the checkout lane, you’ll inexplicably want the candy with the funny name (and maybe some baseball cards, the ones with the bubblegum.) -Kate Morrison Judging by the cuts and staging of this commercial, Bo Knows Everything Except Cinematography. But hawking rad cross-trainers requires little production. Nike sensed this reality and developed a zen divergence from direct product placement, in favor of selling a feeling: Without getting into any issues about whether Bo can REALLY know, it is arguable that the multisport phenom has a better sense of humor than either football or baseball acumen. The busy pacing of the ad distracts the viewer from the sense of plot, but it must accurately portray the star juggling two professional sports schedules. Notice that Bo the golfer incepts Tiger Wood’s stacked demeanor and nails Wood’s signature wardrobe to the exact color. Or the questions that Football Bo asks Baseball Bo, “You ever been to LA?” It would have been hilarious if Baseball Bo said, “No, but I’ve been to Anaheim.” What is especially clear about this ad is that Nike Knows Branding, as the commercial does a great job selling his cross-trainers without more than a couple of cuts to the shoes. Bo Knows Bo is Selling Bo, an aura of phenomenal physicality that screams, “Wear these shoes and you too could train to become a 13 WARP ballplayer.” -Nicholas Zettel I spent 17 years of my life living in Rhode Island, a 15-minute drive from the Hurd Auto Mall in Johnston. Despite its proximity, I have never patronized the famed Chevrolet dealership depicted in this commercial. Yet as a frequent viewer of Red Sox games on the New England Sports Network, I am intimately familiar with the jingle of "baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, Hurd Chevrolet," a song that creates the unlikely association between three stereotypical pieces of American culture, and a car dealership in the country's smallest state. So famous is the Hurd tune that their advertising team uses this particular commercial to suggest that people are singing it while going about their daily activities, such as jogging in place in a parking lot, standing awkwardly in a park, or pointing at fish in an aquarium. As much as I do not relate to the hobbies on display here, I can most certainly vouch for the Hurd jingle being unsettlingly present in my life. In fact, if asked to sing to word "baseball" (which I usually do unprompted), I have no doubt that it would be to the tune of "baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, Hurd Chevrolet." They may may not be able to sync up a backing track to the actors singing in their ad, and they may never get a single dollar from me, but the people of Hurd Chevrolet have created a piece of culture - terrible, parasitic culture though it may be - that I carry with me everywhere I go. -Martin Nolan The Saturday before last was Jay Buhner Bobblehead Night at Safeco Field. The longtime Seattle right fielder, now 52 and still impressively bald and fit, was on hand for the occasion and threw out an impressive frozen rope for the first pitch that recalled his glory days. Then he sat on the sidelines as Yovani Gallardo was pummeled into some alternate state of matter by Avisail Garcia and the White Sox for 10 runs in 3 2/3 innings, then dined and maybe enjoyed a cocktail while would-be Sunday starter Dillon Overton was pounded for two more homers as he wore it for 4 1/3. Nary a glint of light was enabled to come to the aid of infielder Mike Freeman, who was forced to atone for his first inning error by pitching the ninth, before he was DFA’d after the game, a 16-1 loss for the Mariners. In these trying times, the cliché has never been more true: evil triumphs when good men--especially men whose ability to help has been well-documented--sit and do nothing. -James Fegan For those of you on the East Coast, ARCO is what BP calls itself out here. And when they’re not lubricating the Gulf of Mexico, or weaseling out of financial responsibility for cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico, they’re making some of the most awful damned commercials ever known to man. This year, because ARCO likes to bombard West Coast MLB.tv subscribers with ads at a mind-melting pace, they decided to do a baseball-themed commercial to fit that. Like most ARCO advertisements nowadays, it stars “Hanna,” a talking dashboard hula doll thingy who can be summed up as “basically The Travelocity Gnome if you paid approximately 20% of the wages for script writers who have 0% of the talent.” Hanna’s owner/boyfriend/father/human is saving so much money on gas thanks to ARCO that he takes her to her first baseball game. She buries herslef in peanuts, gets autographed, catches a ball, meets “a new friend” (a generic-looking bobblehead), and fails to land a single joke. Hey, ARCO, if you’re reading this? Since it’s already obvious that you’re trying to spend as little on marketing as possible, just… don’t. Zero baseball fans are filling up at ARCO because of Hanna. -Colin Anderle The signifiers here invoke the carefree and timeless: the bleachers on a lazy, sunny day; the Blues Brothers’ R&B syncretism; high-waisted shorts; cold ones. Hell, “Cub Fan, Bud Man” is an explicit “Soul Man” rip off, right down to the chord change that introduces the bridge. Harry Caray himself became a signifier of the Cubs’ “have a good time despite the miserable team” reputation, a lord over the boozy, sleazy fiefdom of Wrigley Field. And yet, Harry doesn’t quite get the Jake Blues schtick down. He’s a little too stiff, a little too idiosyncratic, whereas John Belushi oozed charisma and even a little sexiness with his dancing. No, I think Harry is getting at something else entirely. Wait a second… Harry Caray is a rude boy. -Zack Moser If a sport is known by the company it keeps, it may behoove baseball to start hanging out with another crowd. This ad has been aired, on and off, since George Brett’s rookie season. (Brett is 64.) It posits that baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet are inextricably linked. This is not good company. The jingle, even before getting to its “melody,” dives headfirst into controversy, offhandedly referring to hot dogs as a sandwich. Stick to sports! Let’s start with the hot dog. A Farmer John’s Dodger Dog has 240 calories, 200 from fat. You get 40 percent of the daily value of saturated fat and 57 percent of sodium in each dog. Adding a processed white flour bun brings the total to 410 calories of the 2,000 or so you should consume each day. Apple pie? It’s as American as England, Holland, France, Italy, and Germany, all of which had recipes for apple pie before the American colonies were established. And Chevrolet…It ranked 15th of 29 models ranked by Consumer Reports for reliability, and shares of its parent, General Motors have lost 5% of their value this year. Maybe Roger Goodell’s looking for new friends? - Rob Mains On an official brand YouTube account and from just seven years ago, the eternal blur of this commercial suggests that there are details they don't want us to see. And they're right. Because we're going to talk about Evan Longoria's relic of a shirt. It's puke-green, but of the type that would make you rush to the hospital instead of thinking you're just expelling some unwanted virus, with long cadet blue sleeves. Of the fashion trends that will cycle back in 2030, I desperately hope the baggy t-shirt with different colored long sleeves is not one of them. Then there's the matter of its graphic, a thin ring that's either red or orange - whatever it is, the intent is probably to suggest fire. As we say in 2017, however, the shirt is anything but lit. It's doubtless that the stylist on set chose the shirt to convey an everyman image to Longoria, despite the whole message being that this cap levels the playing field. So there's dissonance in the message, but even more dissonance in aesthetic sensibilities. What saves the commercial, though, is how it is recalls the iconic mid-2000s "We Takin' Over" music video; except, you know, the prize is an errant cap. -Brian Duricy Maybe you remember this one. Dick’s managed to show in one minute all the stuff that happens in baseball when ‘nothing is happening’. I got my PhD in baseball by sitting on my back porch on summer nights listening to the Phillies. Four houses down and around the corner, Mr. Matruder sat out on his porch as well. As the game unfolded, he explained to me everything that was going on behind the scenes. He told me how the players were repositioning themselves as the count changed, how the managers had options to bunt or hit-and-run and how the pitcher and catcher were working to try to set up the hitter. Given the same situation today, I’m sure my parents would have him arrested for spending three hours a night talking to an eight year old. For all the talk about baseball not having enough action, I've always wondered why they have not thought to hire ‘docents’ to take small groups of kids to games and point out the nuances to help them understand the game (and the game within the game). -Scott Delp When I started in on this assignment, I assumed I would just pick the one good Mike Schmidt commercial I could find. Turns out, the man was a golden god of weird ads, from early dish-era cable ads (PRISM!) and 7-Up All Star shorts, Schmiddy ran the gamut during his years in Philadelphia. But there’s something so deeply distressing about this Chevrolet ad from somewhere between 1979-1990. The thrumming techno underneath resembles the soundtrack complementing the more disturbing moments of a Cronenberg film. The premise of the commercial -- Mike Schmidt is going to whale on a pick-up truck with a baseball bat just to see what happens -- should have come out of a too-on-the-nose satirical magazine, not an actual advertising firm. And the moral of the commercial is obtuse at best: you can hit the exact center of the weird polymer grill of your Chevy with as much force as you want and not break it. The rest of the truck, well, use your best judgment. But the weirdest moment is Schmidt’s central line: “The lawyers told me I couldn’t hit a Ford like this. Know why?” Then a brief pause as he smiles fiendishly, points the bat at the camera and says “You know why!” If anyone’s darkest desire is to know what Mike Schmidt would look like just before he caves in your skull with a bat for not buying Chevy Strong? Well, here you go. -Trevor Strunk We hope you've enjoyed this little tour through, if not the lifeblood of baseball, some of its various spiritual lampreys.

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. The HomeKit-enabled Logitech POP Smart Button puts smart home control at your fingertips. I've been excited about Logitech's HomeKit-enabled POP Smart Button since the company's announcement back in April. See, Apple's HomeKit has offered support for programmable buttons for awhile but the POP is the first one available for purchase. Why's a button worth getting excited about? Here's a little of what I wrote in the announcement post: Put in physical terms, you hit the button and stuff happens in your house: You might have it set up to turn on all the lights in your kitchen, turn down the thermostat, or lock the front door — the possibilities are endless! I've been itching to add a programmable button to my HomeKit home because of those endless possibilities. There's something delightful about having a physical, dedicated button that can control my home. It's sort of like a light switch with extra super powers. Logitech sent me a HomeKit-enabled Logitech POP Smart Button Kit a couple weeks ago. I've since put the device through its paces and I'm happy to report it's just as handy as I was hoping! Unboxing the POP Smart Button Kit The Logitech POP Smart Button Kit comes in a small white box and contains both a POP Smart Button and the newly updated HomeKit-enabled POP bridge. The bridge connects to your Wi-Fi network and communicates with the POP Smart Button. You can connect multiple POP Smart Buttons to a POP bridge. The first thing you'll notice is how small the devices are — both the bridge and Smart Button are 6 cm x 6 cm squares. It actually took me a second to figure out which was the button and which was the bridge (hint: The bridge has a plug on the back). The POP Smart Button comes in four colors — white, coral, teal, and alloy — but the Smart Button Kit includes a white button and bridge. The POP is made of a lightweight plastic with a rubberized coating that feels really good in the hand. It's almost entirely button — the front of the device features a raised, über-clicky circle that's very forgiving of imprecise presses. It was easy for my hand to find and press the POP no matter the lighting conditions. The bridge is also made of a lightweight plastic, but while the front of the bridge (which is also a button) features the same rubberized coating, the sides are a glossy white that's reminiscent of Apple's accessories and peripherals. I'm quite fond of the POP bridge because, unlike the other two smart device bridges in my home (Philips Hue and Lutron Caséta) it's incredibly small and self-contained. You don't have to fiddle with external power supplies or ethernet cords; you just plug it in and get going. Along with the devices, the box contains all the necessary paperwork (a setup guide, safety warnings, warranty information, etc.) and a thick (reusable) piece of mounting tape for sticking the POP wherever your heart desires. Setting up the POP Smart Button There are two methods for setting up your POP Smart Button: Logitech POP app: If you choose to set up the POP Smart Button using the Logitech POP app, you can't take advantage of its HomeKit compatibility. The button will work with these compatible devices. Home app for iOS: If you choose to set up the Pop Smart Button using the Home app for iOS, you can take advantage of its HomeKit compatibility but it will only work with HomeKit (you won't be able to control your Sonos speakers, for example). Because I wanted to use this device with my HomeKit-enabled accessories, I set up the device using the Home app for iOS. Thanks to Apple's super-simple set up process, I had no trouble getting the POP ready and rolling. How to set up the POP Smart Button Choose a spot for your HomeKit-enabled POP bridge and plug it in. The bridge needs to be able to communicate with both your Wi-Fi router and any POP Smart Buttons you connect to it, so it's best to put it in a centrally located area (likely where your router is). Wait for the LED light on the POP bridge to flash. Launch the Home app for iOS. Tap Add in the top right corner of the app (looks like a plus sign). Tap Add Accessory. Tap to add the Logitech POP bridge. Tap Allow to add the POP bridge to your Wi-Fi network. Scan the HomeKit code to add the POP bridge. (You can find the code on the side of the POP bridge and on the plastic container in which the bridge was packed. If you'd like, you can name the POP bridge and specifty its location. Tap Next. If you'd like, you can name the POP Smart Button and specify its location. Tap Done. Note: I also set up the device using the Logitech POP app. The process was simple and the app makes it easy to switch between the two compatibility modes (HomeKit and non-HomeKit). I paired and reset the POP bridge and Smart Button a couple times to see if setup would prove finicky. On one occasion, I had trouble getting the POP bridge to appear in the HomeKit Accessories list; factory resetting the POP bridge fixed the problem. Logitech has a support article with a step-by-step guide for factory resetting the POP bridge and Smart Button: Factory Resetting Your POP Adding actions to the POP Smart Button The whole point of the POP is push-button smart home control and this button doesn't disappoint. The POP offers three gestures that can be used to trigger different actions: single press, double press, and long press. In a perfect world I'd also have a triple press, but my perfect world ignores the fact that too many gestures can get unnecessarily complicated. I knew I wanted to use the first POP (I plan to get more) in my office to quickly turn on and off all the lights in that room. The third Long Press gesture was a freebie that I decided to use for setting my Good Night Scene, which locks my front door, lowers the thermostat, dims a couple lights in my living room, and turns off all the rest of the lights in my home. I'll walk you through my process for setting up the following three actions: Single Press: Turn on all the lights in my office. Double Press: Turn off all the lights in my office. Long Press: Set my Good Night Scene. How to add actions Launch the Home app for iOS. Find the POP Smart Button Accessory and 3D Touch or long press on the icon. Tap Details. Next to Single Press tap Add. Choose the Accessories you want to control. Tap Next. Adjust the Accessories to your desired settings (I want Single Press to turn on all the lights). Tap Done. Next to Double Press tap Add. Choose the Accessories you want to control. Tap Next. Adjust the Accessories to your desired settings (I want Double Press to turn on all the lights). Tap Done. Next to Long Press tap Add. Choose the Accessories you want to control. Tap Next. Adjust the Accessories to your desired settings (I want Long Press to set my Good Night Scene). Tap Done. Give each of the actions a try to make sure the POP Smart Button's working how you'd hoped! Responsiveness of the POP Smart Button Once I got my actions loaded in, I spent some time testing the POP's responsiveness. I'm used to smart home automations taking a little bit too much time and I was prepared for the same from the POP (yikes, talk about pessimism!). I'd argue there's nothing more important for a smart home controller than its responsiveness — especially if that controller is a switch. Think about a regular ol' light switch connected to a regular ol' light bulb: As soon as you flip that switch your lights either turn on or turn off; any delay and you begin to wonder if something's wrong. While I would like to count on the same responsiveness from smart home devices, I'm a realist: Wi-Fi signals just don't travel as fast as electricity in a circuit. All that said, I was — and am — incredibly impressed with the POP's responsiveness. My pessimistic expectations were shattered a couple times over by the speed of the POP Smart Button and Apple's HomeKit. I press the button and my lights turn on — not always all at once, but they turn on. Save for the ultra-responsive Philips Hue Motion Sensor, this is the most dependable, reactive controller I've tested. Press on! I'm looking forward to adding more POP Smart Buttons throughout my home, giving each room a reliable way to control the various gadgets I've installed. As a smart home enthusiast, I'm still navigating the tricksy waters of smart home control for my guests. The POP — and any other programmable buttons and switches that come to market — is particularly valuable in helping solve for this problem. Here's what I wrote in response to the question, "How is this better than talking to Siri or Alexa or using the Home app?": I would argue none of the home-control methods you mentioned are better than any of the others. They're all different and they all make sense in different contexts and with different people. My partner loves using Alexa to control the smart devices in our home — I regularly hear him chatting with Alexa about dimming the lights and turning on the fan. I prefer to use the iOS Home app to do most of my smart home control most of the time! My guests almost never want to get an invite to use the iOS Home app during their visit, and many don't care to talk to Alexa or the Google Assistant. They prefer physical controls. The POP Smart Button is a physical control for guests and a multi-purpose device for me. Having that physical button with so much capability isn't only incredibly convenient, it's ideal. After using it for a couple weeks, I can confirm it truly is ideal. I've yet to use the mounting tape included in the Smart Button Kit, 'cause I've taken to carrying the POP around with me from room to room like it's my child. Where can you get a POP Smart Button? Logitech is currently sold out of the HomeKit-enabled POP Smart Button Kit on its own site, but you can find the kit in Apple retail stores. Logitech says the updated kit is set to hit Apple's online store "soon." Still have questions about the Logitech POP Smart Button? Check out our FAQ!

Reader comments Logitech POP: How a button changed the way I interact with my smart home 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating johnnygoodface Hi Mikah! Got one starter kit too and it works great with HomeKit. But I'm now stuck trying to add a second button... Just can't figure out how! How do you do that? I can see my logi:xx:xx and in "details" I see one accessories (my first button), but that's it, there's no way to add a new one from the HomeApp... Even tried a 20 sec reset on the new button, to no avail. Do you think we have to use a POP app for this (if that's the case I'm stuck since the app won't connect with my bridge since it's setup in HomeKit!) ? 0 3 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
