They can be fairly militant in their allegiance to one tech company or another. As you read readers' objections to a review you've written, you encounter one particular argument amazingly often: “[Name of disliked tech company] stole that idea from [name of preferred company]!” Absolutely right. The borrowing of tech ideas has become almost absurdly predictable. Apple introduced Siri, the voice assistant, in 2011 (after buying the company that developed it). Google's copycat, Google Now, arrived a year later, and Microsoft's Cortana followed in 2014. In the era of Steve Jobs, Apple was often the first to develop new product types. The iPod, for example, begat the Microsoft Zune. The iPhone spawned Google's Android phones. The iPad was the model for everyone else's look-alike tablets. These days, though, Apple is equally likely to be the follower as the leader. Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatches debuted in 2013; the Apple Watch arrived two years later. Spotify reached the U.S. in 2011; the nearly identical Apple Music launched in 2015. Microsoft's Surface tablet arrived in 2012, with a screen cover that opened to reveal a flat keyboard. The iPad Pro, with similar features, followed in 2015. It's not just product ideas. You can find the same cycle of mimicry in individual features. You could easily create a genealogy of, say, the right-click shortcut menu, or notifications that pop up in the upper-right corner of your screen, or precisely three autocomplete suggestions that appear above the keyboard on your phone. At the dawn of tech culture, all of this might have seemed like an outrageous theft of intellectual property. It certainly did to Apple, which famously sued Microsoft for duplicating the Mac's “look and feel” with Windows in 1988.* But Apple lost that lawsuit. The central premise of copyrights (for creative works) and patents (for inventions) is this: you can't protect an idea—only the execution of it. That, in the end, was the crux of the court's ruling in Microsoft's favor. (Never mind that the features Apple was proudest of—overlapping windows, commands in menus, and so on—were originally developed by Xerox and found their way into Apple's machines.) For a while, copycats paid at least lip service to differentiation. In Windows Vista, Microsoft added a universal-search icon like the one on the Mac—but placed it at the lower left of the screen, not the upper right. It created little floating windows showing stock, weather, notes, and so on—but called them “gadgets” rather than “widgets,” as Apple had. Today, though, nobody even bothers. Amazon's popular Echo, introduced widely in 2015, takes the form of a cylinder that sits on a shelf and does an enormous range of tech tasks, from streaming music to answering questions in response to spoken commands, like a home version of Siri. This year Google revealed its own Google Home—which works so similarly, it could almost pass for a clone. First problem: Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon and Google basically wind up with identical portfolios: similar phones, tablets, laptops, music services, e-mail services, payment systems, auto-dashboard software, etcetera. Bigger problem: This frenzy of idea stealing thwarts innovation. It's time-consuming and expensive to develop a new product. Copying, on the other hand, is cheap and easy. So why should a company bother to innovate? You don't reap much benefit from being first, except in the few months before the copycats come. Pharmaceutical companies enjoy 20 years of patent protection before generic drugs are permitted; the idea is to let them recoup the billions they've put into developing new medicines. Maybe we should adopt a similar structure for tech products—with a period of exclusivity of something like 20 months. That way we'd restore the incentive to keep inventing—and Mr. Jobs wouldn't be spinning quite so furiously in his grave. *Editor's Note (10/18/16): This sentence from the print article was edited after it was posted online. The original erroneously attributed the initiation of Apple's litigatory action against Microsoft to Steve Jobs.

Podesta also suggested billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as well as more conventional political choices, such as Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. Clinton ultimately settled on Virginia Senator Tim Kaine to campaign with her. Podesta has not publicly verified that the emails are authentic, but told reporters earlier this month that he believed that “Russian intelligence agencies” had hacked into his email account as part of efforts to favour Republican nominee Donald Trump. US officials have formally blamed state-sponsored Russian hackers for the exposure of internal emails from the Democratic party and other prominent people and institutions. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Ukraine in uproar over 24-year-old named minister Obama on farewell tour to Europe fearful of ‘Trump effect’ Trump ready to lead, says chief of staff Skygazers gawp at extra bright ‘supermoon’ After more than 50 years, Singapore to have second Malay president in 2017 Trump and his aides plan next moves as protests spread (VIDEO) Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Trump considers seeking Bill Clinton’s advice Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office, Obama says ECB warns of risks of protectionism after Trump win What will the Trump presidency mean for Asean? — Bilahari Kausikan What a Trump victory says about us When electoral system fails to reflect voter preference — Sin Chew Daily Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Mello Jr. Oct 18, 2016 3:04 PM PT Apple appears to be shifting its driverless car ambitions into a lower gear. Changes in the company's automotive strategy have resulted in hundreds of job cuts and the shelving of plans to build a car of its own, Bloomberg reported Monday. "Project Titan" -- Apple's internal name for the automotive initiative -- has a new focus, according to the report. It will develop an autonomous driving system that will give the company the option of partnering with an established auto maker or producing a robo car of its own. The Titan team has until the end of 2017 to prove the feasibility of its self-driving system and to decide on a final direction for the project, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the initiative. The shift in direction follows months of disagreements, leadership uncertainty, and supply chain problems within the project, they reportedly said. Tough to Fit In Rumors of Apple scaling back its driverless car program have been in the wind for some time, noted Roger C. Lanctot, associate director of the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics. "We've been hearing about it for awhile," he told TechNewsWorld. "The whole proposition seemed sketchy from the beginning. With so much innovation and development activity going on, it's difficult to perceive where the need for another car manufacturer like Apple exists," Lanctot said. It's a crowded field, observed Renee Stephens, vice president of automotive research at J.D. Power. Apple would have to face "some serious competitors with some serious experience in manufacturing," she told TechNewsWorld. "Companies like Ford and Mercedes are looking to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road by 2020." Margin Problems Besides being crowded, it's a field where making money can be challenging, too. "Apple is a company that traditionally likes to make very high-margin products," said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst with Navigant Research. "They don't like to make commodity products," he told TechNewsWorld. The Project Titan team has spent a significant amount of time over the last two years trying to create something distinctive that Apple can sell at a premium. "The car industry is a very tough place to make a profit," Abuelsamid said. "Most auto makers are lucky to hit 8 or 9 percent profit margins. Apple typically hits 35 to 40 percent on most of its products." Ford Needs to Feel Like a Ford Scaling down its auto making plans might not be enough. Apple might find it difficult to crack into the systems market for autos, too, Abuelsamid noted. "Auto makers have made it clear that they want to have their own unique user interface and look and feel in their vehicles," he said. "When you get into a Ford, Ford wants it to look and feel like a Ford," he explained. "They don't want an Apple or a Google look and feel." That doesn't seem to have prevented some of them from supporting CarPlay, though, which allows a car radio to act as a display and controller for an iPhone. "Apple has had much greater success with its CarPlay smartphone integration than Alphabet has had with Android auto," Strategy Analytics' Lanctot pointed out. Playing With Others Still, if Apple wants to create automation systems for vehicles, it's going to need to play nice with auto makers, which could be a problem for the company. "Partnering hasn't been something that Apple has been open to in the past," observed J.D. Power's Stephens. "They haven't been open to providing access to a lot of their coding," she said. "That's something manufacturers are looking for before they will integrate Apple capabilities into their vehicles." The Right Approach Apple's approach to the automotive market has been a good one, noted Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. "They've researched the idea from every angle and then brought in Bob Mansfield to manage it and pare it down to an offering that is feasible and makes sense for Apple," he told TechNewsWorld. Mansfield, who led the hardware engineering development of the MacBook Air, iMac and iPad, took Project Titan's helm this summer, The Wall Street Journal reported. Project Titan will play a significant role as Apple maps out its future. "It is important to their CarPlay strategy and would help them differentiate themselves within the next generation of smart automobiles," Bajarin said. "Autos are the ultimate mobile experience," he pointed out, "and tying them to Apple's products is key to their long-term strategy to boost their apps and services business."

The report says that the event will take place “at or near” Apple’s Cupertino campus, not in San Fransisco where most recent events have taken place. At this point, we’re just waiting on Apple to send out an invite to their press event as all sources point to new Macs being on their way very soon. We expect Apple to send out press invites later this week, or as early as tomorrow. The most anticipated Mac refresh would have to be the MacBook Pros as those are rumored to have an OLED Touch Bar replacing the function row, as well as have support for Touch ID, a first on the Mac. It’s also expected to dight MagSafe and USB-A in favor of an all USB-C notebook. In addition, we’re expecting Apple to discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air which could signal at a cheaper 12-inch Retina MacBook or 13-inch MacBook Air.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search What to expect at Apple’s October 27 MacBook event Brittany A. Roston - Oct 18, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has an event planned for later this month, and rumor has it we’ll be seeing a new MacBook Pro, as well as a high-resolution display to replace the Thunderbolt display the company discontinued in June, among other things. Speculation about when the event will take place has been somewhat varied. Though Apple hasn’t yet confirmed the date, it seems it’ll be happening on October 27, the day after Microsoft’s own event. MacBook 2016 Review – Still controversial Apple’s event will be taking place on October 27, Recode and TechCrunch report, which confirms what sources speaking to SlashGear have said. The 27th is a Thursday and slightly at odds with Apple’s usual course of things. Assuming what we’ve been hearing is true, Apple will likely launch the new 2016 MacBook Pro at this event, and it’ll come bearing the same USB-C port we saw on the controversial 12-inch MacBook. The connector type, though still somewhat uncommon, is quickly making its way into many devices, including other laptops, as well as smartphones and tablets. Just as notable as what we’ll see is what we won’t be seeing, which is likely the smaller of the two MacBook Airs, the 11-inch version. Dropping this model from the lineup would make sense in light of the 12-inch MacBook’s existence, and likely very few people if any will miss it. Apple will set its focus more heavily on the 13-inch MacBook Air in its absence. Rumor has it both the new MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro will sport USB-C and not offer any other USB types. However, rather than the single port on the MacBook (which is largely responsible for the controversy around it), the new MacBook Pro will have up to four of them, per sources. Both new laptop models will also support Thunderbolt 3. Given the inclusion of USB-C, you can bid farewell to the MagSafe power connector, as there’s no reason to keep it in light of the new USB variety. Likewise, all signs point toward users rightly anticipating a large design update, which may include a touch strip replacing the function keys on the MacBook Pro similar to what Lenovo did with its Carbon X1. Rumors have it we’ll also be seeing the arrival of Touch ID in the new Macs. And, of course, there’s that Thunderbolt display. Apple quietly discontinued it back in June, and that led to the logical assumption that we’ll probably be seeing a refreshed device — possibly with a 5k-resolution — arrive in its place later on in the year, assuming Apple does plan to replace it. Other details about that display aren’t forthcoming at this time, however.

In August 2016, prolific Apple tipster Mark Gurman of Bloomberg stated that the updated Mac line will include MacBook Airs with multi-functional USB-C technology, iMacs with an option for new graphics chips from AMD and a thinner MacBook Pro with a flatter keyboard. Another intriguing feature of the Pro, according to Gurman and KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, is a display touch bar above the keyboard that will replace the physical function keys. Foreshadowing the release, Apple released the newest iteration of its Mac operating system, MacOS Sierra, in September 2016. Anticipation for new Mac products is high, considering the only Mac debut this year was the minorly tweaked 12-inch 2016 MacBook. Related: MacOS Sierra is now available to download SourceRecode, Bloomberg Kven It’s not a “pro” computer if they get rid of all the ports. Phone_Addiction people will still buy them Mo Dabbas on the contrary. Mac sales have shown to drop by a higher rate (in Q2 of this year) compared to the overall drop in average laptop sales. There is a report by business insider. Overall PC shipments dropped by 4.5%, apple drop is 8.3%. Fshumayrqan It’s 7.2 not 8.3%, still top 5 brand in the world. Check your fact first. Mo Dabbas My facts are correct. But you don’t seem to understand English. Market share is different than drop in shipments. Think before you type next time. Fshumayrqan Apple took 7.2 percent of the worldwide PC market during the second quarter of 2016 on 4.9 million Mac shipments Mo Dabbas It’s 7.1 and it’s an 8.3 drop over last year Q2. I can’t believe you still don’t get it?? Fshumayrqan October 25th mark your Calendar, I can not tolerate jibber jabber. Fshumayrqan If compared it from last year actual sales of 5.7 million not shipments because Apple only release sales then 13 percent down. Mo Dabbas They’ll sell you the “Pro” dongles for 99 to 299 depending how pro you want your dongle to be. Captain Henry Morgan I hope they won’t get rid of the ports. I still like the MBP with three USB ports. I am just waiting for the new line up to come out and see if its worth buying. Kven It’s rumoured they are getting rid of all the ports except for USB-C.

According to Recode, Apple is planning an event for 27 October, when it will unveil a new MacBook Pro. The line hasn't been given a significant upgrade since 2012. It's only added a Retina display, Force Touch trackpad, and some improved specs. An entire overhaul has been rumoured for some time. The new MacBook Pro could be slimmer with a flatter keyboard featuring an OLED strip. This touchscreen strip, which will replace the standard function keys, is reportedly dubbed the "Dynamic Function Row". You can read more about this upcoming MacBook Pro update in Pocket-lint's rumour round-up here. Keep in mind there are two sizes of MacBook Pro: a 13-inch model that was last updated in March 2015, and a 15-inch model that was last updated in May 2015. So, a new MacBook Pro with all new specs is expected. Bloomberg also previously claimed that Apple's autumn hardware event will showcase new MacBook Pro laptops, as well as a new iMac desktop, new MacBook Air, and new standalone 5K display. The last event Apple held in October was back in 2014, when the company revealed the iPad Air 2, the latest version of the iMac, and shared details on the OS X Yosemite operating system.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Hires Former Time Warner Cable Exec for Cloud Services Team Apple Hires Former Time Warner Cable Exec for Cloud Services Team Wednesday, 14 September 2016 Former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern has joined Apple to work on the cloud services team, reports The Wall Street Journal. Stern will serve as a vice president, reporting to iTunes chief Eddy Cue. During his tenure at Time Warner Cable, Stern was involved in talks with Apple about a potential deal for a joint television service that would be offered on the Apple TV. No such deal was able to be established, however, as Apple has had ongoing negotiation difficulties with content providers. Stern left Time Warner Cable following its acquisition by Charter Communications earlier this year. He served in senior strategy and corporate development roles at the cable company as it maneuvered through multiple takeover attempts over the past few years. Most recently, as chief product, people and strategy officer, Mr. Stern helped implement a strategy focused on customer service that helped Time Warner Cable grow its cable TV subscribers last year after nearly a decade of losses. According to The Wall Street Journal, Stern is a vocal proponent for eliminating proprietary cable boxes provided by cable companies. He believes content providers should "be more open" to offering TV channels as apps across a wide range of devices. Given his expertise in the cable industry, Stern may help Eddy Cue negotiate deals with media companies for a future television service. Cloud services also encompasses Apple Music, iTunes, and other iCloud-based products, so his hiring does not necessarily suggest a renewed interest in television streaming.Tags: Eddy Cue, iCloud Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Entertainment - on September 14, 2016< > Embed CNN Will Post Record Profits in 2017, Time Warner CFO Promises 00:45 Time Warner CFO Howard M.

While that’s great news for tech evangelists, it’s a potential source of more confusion than excitement for your average consumer, whose knowledge of smart home “ecosystems” is often obscured by the increasing number of options out there. That’s where we come in. From price to compatibility and, of course, style, here are the details on the offerings from Apple, Amazon, and Google: how they differ, how much they cost, and all the basics you need to know. Want more info on how to make your home a smart one? Check out our guide to doing just that. Amazon Echo The Amazon Echo Photo via Amazon When Amazon entered the smart home ecosystem fray in November of 2014, it made quite an impression. For one, the Amazon Echo is a Bluetooth-connected speaker that also plays music from Spotify and Pandora. But Echo went beyond the usual automated-control-of-lights-and-HVAC home tech paradigm with a voice-activated virtual assistant, Alexa, that can turn on the news, set alarms, give users intel on the day’s weather, and answer simple questions like “How many ounces are in a cup?” The Echo hub—a cylindrical, nearly 9.5-inch-tall unit with a black case and blue indicator lights—has a darker, moodier aesthetic than most of the Wall-E-style, white-and-silver home tech products out there, which also helps set it apart. While many consumers want a device that fades into the background, the Echo offers a similarly unobtrusive unit with a different look. Amazon’s Echo Dot Photo via Flickr Amazon announced a more compact version of the Echo, the Echo Dot, last spring, and though the smaller device costs a bit less, it still plays music (at lower quality and volume) and can be given voice commands. Who’s it good for? The Echo is a good option for music fans who also want the smart home experience and are down with trying voice-activated smart home interfaces. The brass tacks: The Echo starts at $179.99, and consumers can purchase it online at Amazon.com or at retail stores like Best Buy. The Echo Dot, which is only available for purchase with an Alexa device like the original Echo or Amazon Tap, retails at half the price of its older sibling, for $89.99. There’s an Echo app for both iOS and Android devices. Apple HomeKit Apple’s Home app was a centerpiece of this year’s WWDC conference. Photo via The Verge When Apple HomeKit was announced in 2014, there simply weren’t many compatible products available—as our sister site The Verge pointed out. Now that the requisite thermostats, door locks, and lightbulbs are, in fact, on the market and available to consumers, the new Home app rolled out with iOS 10 is great as a one-stop shop for toggling said lights on and off, checking the temperature in your home, and operating heating and cooling systems—or your home’s security cameras—remotely. Unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, Apple HomeKit isn’t trying to sell consumers on a new, physical hub. There are some benefits there: Your existing, iOS 10-equipped iDevice (including iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, or Apple TVs) can serve as the nexus for your intelligent apartment through the Home app and with voice activation commands to Siri, the longtime virtual assistant available with Apple devices. This means you can stock up on all the HomeKit-compatible products you want and simply make sure your devices’ operating systems are up to date. Who’s it good for? Apple HomeKit is the choice for iPeople—folks who already have iOS 10-equipped or iOS 10-ready mobile devices (that’s a lot of us) or a new Apple TV from the company. If you primarily use an Android device, HomeKit likely isn’t the best option for you. The brass tacks: The Home app comes standard with iOS 10 on any Apple mobile device. You can purchase Apple devices capable of launching the Home app at the Apple website or at an Apple retail shop. Google Home Photo via Google You can already preorder Google Home, which ships to the public early next month (on November 4). Home is a direct competitor to Amazon Echo: Home, too, is voice activated (“OK Google”), can play music (from your Google Play, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, or TuneIn account), set alarms, spout dictionary definitions, and, of course, control lights and thermostats. For now, Google Home doesn’t work with nearly as many home tech products as Amazon Echo—which supports nearly 300 services—but expanded compatibility is likely to come with time. For now, Home works with some of the most prominent smart home companies, like Nest, IFTTT, Philips Hue, and anything SmartThings-branded. And, if you already use a Google Chromecast, you’re good to go there, too. Who’s it good for? Google Home is great for people trying to save 50 bucks (it will retail for $129.99, compared to Amazon Echo’s $179.99) and folks who dig the customizable, colorful speaker grilles available for each unit. It’s also fine for those who don’t mind the rather limited number of products it’s compatible with (at least for now). The brass tacks: Google Home is available for preorder now for $129.99 and will start shipping early next month.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Get Ready For Some Good Crime Blotter Items When SF Apple Stores Let Floor Models Roam Free by Eve Batey in News on Oct 18, 2016 11:30 am Getty Images Every urban dweller knows better then to leave their cell phone lying around in public, as to do so would invite not just theft but the inevitable post-theft shaming from friends, family, and SFist commenters should my colleagues or I opt to write about their momentary lapse is personal security. But Apple is unfazed in the face of the many threats menacing every expensive pocket-sized computer in the city, and will soon be allowing customers in their stores to pick up and walk around with iPhones, thieves be damned. It all started in Apple's newly refurbished London store, which opened earlier this month to predictable fanfare and with one unique feature: The iPhones in that store aren't locked to the display to prevent their theft, the way they are in every other of the company's stores. According to CNet, "Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket." But is an initiative that works in the land of Sherlock Holmes and the Krays something that will work here, in the land of people who will throw their beer (among other things) at you to get your smartphone? Apparently so, as KRON 4 reports that following a successful run in London, Apple will be unleashing their phones in stores "worldwide." (We contacted Apple to confirm that "worldwide" includes San Francsico, but haven't received a response as of publication time.) In an article entitled "It's super easy (and pointless) to steal an iPhone from the new Apple store," website Techradar writes: If you manage to wrench an iPhone 7 Plus from one of the many people also testing it out, you'll have to pocket it unnoticed by anyone and make your way to the door. At the door you'll probably set off the store's security alarm. If you’re not pounced on by a security guard before you feel the warmth of the sunlight and actually manage to get away with the phone, Apple will simply brick it from afar using the Find My iPhone feature, leaving you with a very expensive paperweight. But, seriously, will that actually deter thieves? Think about it: That same bricking function has been available to all iPhone users since 2013. According to a statement from District Attorney George Gascon in early 2015, that cut iPhone theft by around 40 percent, which is great! But still, every day, we see numerous cell phone thefts in the city, with some thieves even undeterred at the news that police will use the GPS on the phones to track and arrest them. Who knows, I could be wrong? Perhaps my decade-plus of reporting on big and small San Francisco crime has made me cynical. Maybe Apple's move will usher in a new era of smartphone freedom, in which thieves leave us and our phones alone on Muni, the street, and in coffee shops out of disdain for the "expensive paperweight" the stolen objects will become. Or maybe I will have a lot of new thefts to write about on the 300 block of Post Street? I guess we shall see.

The firm today announced an event at its Cupertino HQ on October 27th where it is expected to unveil a radical redesign of its MacBook laptop - and the traditional USB could be gone forever.  The firm announced the event in typically mysterious style, with an invite that read 'hello again'.  Scroll down for video  The event will take place at Apple's Cupertino HQ on October 27th, and is expected to see a range of new Macbook machines with a new 'smartkey' screen above the normal keyboard. WHAT ARE THE CLAIMS?  Macotakara claims Apple will debut a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month - and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether. The report suggests Apple is also eliminating the USB and its Megsafe connector, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The MacBook Pro could also have an OLED touch bar, which replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. Apple's dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro will feature a new 'thinner and lighter' design. A new report suggests the Cupertino company is set to eliminate the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro – and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether. However, it is also believed that Apple will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. The recent claims come from Macotakara, a Japanese publisher, which was one of the first sources to predict the death of the iPhone’s headphone jack. ‘According to information from a reliable Chinese supplier, Apple is planning to announce the new MacBook Pro within this month and will begin shipping out to retailers in October,’ reads the blog post. ‘There has also been rumors that they are going to cancel MacBook Air of the 11-inch model to focus on the 13-inch ones’. If the report is true, the new machines are expected to use metal injection molded hinges, have USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon set to take on the ISPs: Shopping giant developing...

Share this article Share 103 shares A new report suggests Apple is set to remove the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. Pictured is the MacBook Pro line Apple released in 2015 It is also designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks, and is being called ‘the only connector one will need across all devices,’ according to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group. However, this means users would have to charge their device through the USB-C port and connect peripherals through the Thunderbolt 3, reports Steve Dent with Engadget. possible oled touchpad for the function buttons in next macbook, as well as hella USB-C ports pic.twitter.com/MD4oCtIOSU— Sam Sheffer (@samsheffer) June 2, 2016 In the end, users will be forced to purchase their own USB 3.0 adapter.  It is also rumored that the MacBook Pro will have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. This rumor came from a reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities earlier this year. Macotakara , a Japanese publisher, also reveals Apple is killing off the 11-in MacBook altogether. However, the firm will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. Pictured are MacBook Pros Apple released in 2015 Kuo says Apple plans to introduce a dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro with a new 'thinner and lighter' design. It is expected to look similar to the slick and minimalist MacBook. APPLE’S PATENT REPLACES KEYBOARD WITH TOUCH SCREEN  A patent filed by Apple earlier this year shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be. The invention, dubbed a 'configurable, force-sensitive input structure for an electronic device,' looks similar to its 'Force Touch' trackpads. These trackpads use haptic technology which senses movement from a user's fingers on the surface. MacBook Pro might have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys. A patent filed by Apple this year (pictured) shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be located 'The trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and haptic feedback that provides a responsive and uniform feel,' Apple says. A tiny motor then vibrates to give the user feedback on what they are touching. The patent suggests similar technology laptop keyboard, a number pad, or a track pad. It claims 'micro-perforations' in the casing could light up to give the user an outline to where keys are on the flat keyboard. And the position of the haptic keys could also be customized.  The device will also include Touch ID support and a new OLED display touch bar above the keyboard. Kuo's report explains that the MacBook Pro updates are the 'brightest spot for Apple's 2016 rollouts' and was the first to mention 13-inch and 15-inch models.    Read more: Apple may ditch traditional USB ports on the MacBook Pro 次期MacBook Pro、10月末に出荷開始？ | Rumor | Macお宝鑑定団 blog（羅針盤） Apple plans to launch new Macs at an October 27 event - Recode Share or comment on this article e-mail 103 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column Farewell to the Apple Car, a dream that was never going to happen aaple Associated Press Apple's CarPlay entertainment and communications system, installed in a lowly Honda: Is this the future of the "Apple Car"? Apple's CarPlay entertainment and communications system, installed in a lowly Honda: Is this the future of the "Apple Car"? (Associated Press) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter It was just over a year and a half ago that the consumer technology and auto aficionado communities became jointly engulfed in a tizzy over a single rumor: Apple was going into the car manufacturing business. If you’ve read this far, you probably already know the punchline: Apple is getting out of the car manufacturing business. More precisely, according to Bloomberg, it appears it was never actually in the car manufacturing business. Hundreds of members of Apple’s once 1,000-strong car team, dubbed Project Titan, are gone. The program has been redirected at building self-driving programs that can be sold to existing carmakers as an Apple add-on, the way Pullman sleeper cars were sold to railroads more than 100 years ago as a branded luxury enhancement to transcontinental train travel. We take steel, raw steel, and turn it into a car. They have no idea what they’re getting into if they get into that. — Dan Akerson, ex-CEO of GM, outlined the challenge Apple faced in carmaking in February 2015 It’s not my purpose to say, “I told you so,” although I and many other observers predicted from the outset that the Apple Car was likely to end up exactly where it seems to have landed. But it’s proper to revisit what experts said about Apple’s car venture in February 2015, when rumors of Project Titan first surfaced on the website 9to5Mac. That’s because the arc of the Apple Car bears important lessons for anyone seized by the impulse to declare a speculative venture a world-changing success before the rubber, so to speak, meets the road.  We can start by outlining the arguments that presaged spectacular success for the Apple Car. Apple was not merely going to enter the automaking business, but would reinvent the business. Although auto manufacture was by nature a low-margin business, Apple would transform it into a high-margin business. (Matt Yglesias at Vox: “If Apple makes a car, it will be a high margin car because Apple only makes high margin products.”)  To those who doubted that Apple could upend the car business by producing something revolutionary, the standard comeback was: Remember the iPhone? The iPad? The iPod? This week's mythical creature: The Apple Car Michael Hiltzik Three words of advice for all you iPhone fans who are enthralled by the idea that Apple is entering the car market and are preparing to be first in line at the Apple Store when those fabulous cars start rolling off the production line: Get a grip. Apple is living in a PR sweet spot just now. The... Three words of advice for all you iPhone fans who are enthralled by the idea that Apple is entering the car market and are preparing to be first in line at the Apple Store when those fabulous cars start rolling off the production line: Get a grip. Apple is living in a PR sweet spot just now. The... (Michael Hiltzik) There were just a few problems with these notions. Begin with the hype environment. As I observed at the time, Apple then was living in a PR sweet spot. The company had just recorded blowout quarterly financial results, driven by the successful iPhone 6 launch, with the new Apple Watch lurking on the horizon. Apple CEO Tim Cook was said to have a magic touch — never mind that his ability to emerge from the shadow of Steve Jobs had been initially in question. The euphoria didn’t last: The Apple Watch has been a relative yawn, and the company’s stock lost 30% of its value between early February 2015 and mid-May this year, before recovering some of the slide. More importantly, the optimists underestimated the challenge of creating a car company from scratch, while overestimating the potential market.  There was no dearth of skeptics. Dan Akerson, ex-CEO of General Motors, reminded listeners that making a car was a burly undertaking: “We take steel, raw steel, and turn it into a car. They have no idea what they’re getting into if they get into that.” Carmaking couldn’t be outsourced to contract manufacturers, the way Apple hires China’s Foxconn to make its phone. For one thing, contract manufacturing capacity didn’t exist on the necessary scale. A few more good arguments against the Apple Car -- and a lousy one in its favor Michael Hiltzik The excitement and attention garnered by rumors that Apple is thinking of entering the carmaking business is almost entirely an artifact of the Apple-can-do-no-wrong mindset. As I observed last week, there are a lot of problems with this mindset, one of which is that Apple can do wrong, and often... The excitement and attention garnered by rumors that Apple is thinking of entering the carmaking business is almost entirely an artifact of the Apple-can-do-no-wrong mindset. As I observed last week, there are a lot of problems with this mindset, one of which is that Apple can do wrong, and often... (Michael Hiltzik) Henry Blodget of Business Insider calculated that the entire worldwide automobile market of about 88 million vehicles a year wasn’t big enough to generate more than a modest boost to Apple’s annual sales and profit, which stood last year at $234 billion and $53 billion, respectively. Unless, that is, the company managed to seize enormous market share in autos while making vehicles with 50% profit margins. As Blodget pointed out, achieving either goal required superhuman skill and luck, but combining the two was well nigh impossible: You could build either niche products like Porches and Ferraris with sizable margins, or mass-market vehicles with razor-slim margins. Not both. Since Apple’s operating margin is about 30%, it must breach a high bar to match that in cars. What the Apple fans also missed was that, traditionally, the really profitable technological advances in the auto industry were not in the vehicles themselves — every one is, after all, four wheels and a drive train — but in the manufacturing process. Henry Ford didn’t invent the car; he pioneered the assembly line. “If you want to find the next ‘big thing’ in automobiles,” observed technology analyst Horace Dediu, “look for a new production system.” (This is a challenge, by the way, also facing Tesla Motors.) Apple, whatever its virtues, is not a production company. None of this means that Apple couldn’t contribute significantly to the automobile business and make money doing so. But the likelihood from the inception was that its involvement would be as a supplier to the industry, not a competitor. The current rumors about Titan being retooled as a source of automated driving systems fits that expectation. Nor does it have to stop there. Apple’s CarPlay, an integrated automotive entertainment and communications system, could evolve into a desirable option for, say, your BMW. A luxury automobile with “Apple Inside”? That could be hit, and a profitable one yet.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

 Apple will announce new Macs at an event next week Jeff Dunn Oct. 18, 2016, 5:45 PM 17,840 facebook linkedin twitter email print A concept design of the new MacBook Pro by artist Martin Hajek.Martin Hajek Apple will announce a new slate of Macs at an event on October 27, according to new reports from Recode, Bloomberg, and TechCrunch. The date would confirm previous suspicions that arose after Apple moved its upcoming Q4 earnings report from October 27 to October 25 due to a "scheduling conflict." The reports do not provide any new details on what to expect from the event, but it's been reported for months that Apple would refresh its MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac computers with updated specs sometime this fall. None of those series have been upgraded in over a year. A redesigned MacBook Pro is expected to be the highlight. It's rumored to feature a slimmer design (and subsequently flatter keyboard), a TouchID fingerprint sensor, a USB-C connector with Thunderbolt 3 support, and a secondary, customizable OLED display that would replace the row of function keys that are found on most PCs. Previous reports have said that both 13- and 15-inch versions will be available. Apple CEO Tim Cook.REUTERS/Stephen Lam Beyond that, an updated version of the 13-inch MacBook Air that uses a USB-C connector is also reported to be in the works, though it appears unlikely that it will see a significant design refresh. A report from MacOtakara on Tuesday claimed that Apple will nix the 11-inch Air from its lineup, however, what with the thinner and ligher 12-inch MacBook already available. Bloomberg reported in August that the company will also introduce a new standalone monitor, built in collaboration with LG. That's said to have a sharp 5K resolution. Apple discontinued its most recent 27-inch Thunderbolt monitor this past June without announcing a replacement. Whatever devices arrive, they'd come at a time when PC sales as a whole remain on the decline. Macs have succumbed to that trend, too, but a fully updated lineup might provide a temporary repreive.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After launching new iPhones and Apple Watches last month, the Cupertino, California-based technology company on Wednesday announced its event for next week with the tagline “hello again.” The Mac upgrades will be the first since 2015, save for the 12-inch MacBook receiving a new rose gold finish and slightly faster processors in April.  While Apple mainly relies on sales of the iPhone, the Mac line remains a key component of the business. Macs made up almost 11 percent of the company’s $233.7 billion revenue in the 2015 fiscal year, the second-largest source of sales. In the most-recent quarter, Mac revenue continued to outpace iPad sales, showing resiliency in a category that some analysts have said would be cannibalized by tablets. Apple has been developing multiple new Mac products, including a redesigned MacBook Pro, faster iMac, and an updated MacBook Air with new ports, Bloomberg News reported in July. The new MacBook Pro’s highlight feature will be a secondary display above the keyboard that offers shortcut commands depending on the task at hand, while new features such as a larger trackpad and faster graphics cards will also be present.

I usually get the older cars of the family while my better half drives the latest and greatest, but this is of interest because it appears that there is no Apple Car on her horizon. If Apple can get CarPlay accepted by most of the major car manufacturers, then that's going to be a win for them. Trying to make an electric or later self driving car was always a fool's errand for them as a company, just as the long rumored TV. Apple would be better off staying focused with the various UI concerns of using Apple devices in a car (i.e. methods of controlling phone without looking at it). Bringing back audiobook playlists would be first on my list, for sure.   pwalker8 View Public Profile Find More Posts by pwalker8 Track Posts by pwalker8 via RSS 10-19-2016, 08:27 AM   #6 Phogg PHD in Horribleness     Posts: 2,258 Karma: 23113052 Join Date: Dec 2008 Location: In the ironbound section, near avenue L Device: Just a whole bunch.

If you mean the top opening over the whole front -- my 67 Spitfire opened that way. I used to sit on a tire to change the oil. I can think of other imported cars that did same. Apple going to ban them? On the other post - some people like Android and some like nothing. I don't need a car chattering at me.

Personally I think the autonomous cars are too damn dangerous to be allowed on the roads. Computers and software are too prone to failure.

I am with you there, I am now retired but I made my living by fixing computer, hardware and troubleshooting software. I know that every computer made and every software application made have too many bugs and errors in them that cannot ever be all fixed. And the more they fix the more bugs they create. Most of the times they fix a bug and they fix that issue but they cause other bugs that were not there before.   cvkemp View Public Profile Find More Posts by cvkemp Track Posts by cvkemp via RSS 10-20-2016, 12:14 PM   #12 DiapDealer Grand Sorcerer     Posts: 14,314 Karma: 77359760 Join Date: Jan 2010 Device: Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD I'd only be afraid of autonomous cars if they were forced to share the road with the current crop of incompetent, self-involved, risk-taking, moronic humans who use it.   DiapDealer View Public Profile Find More Posts by DiapDealer Track Posts by DiapDealer via RSS 10-20-2016, 02:36 PM   #13 Apache Readaholic     Posts: 3,149 Karma: 54950786 Join Date: Sep 2011 Location: South Georgia Device: Nook Color / Nook HD+ / Surface Pro 4 Quote: Originally Posted by DiapDealer I'd only be afraid of autonomous cars if they were forced to share the road with the current crop of incompetent, self-involved, risk-taking, moronic humans who use it.

Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service released in 2014, is working to promote a cashless society, Cook said. "We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system. We don't think the consumer particularly likes cash," he told Japanese news service Nikkei in an interview published on Monday. Apple Pay allows iPhone users to store their credit cards, debit cards and gift cards with the service, paying for goods by simply waving the device near a terminal. While handy for Apple users, the idea remains challenging, as Apple Pay works with Apple products only, meaning that the billions of people who use Android or other devices don't share the same opportunity. © Photo: Pixabay Apple to Open Second Research, Development Center in China in 2017Another point that hurts Apple Pay's global relevance is that payment terminals, ubiquitous in the US, are much less common overseas. Moreover, customers' banks must sign on to the service. Cook's wish to eliminate cash apparently creates more questions than answers. Apple is not the only company offering digital payment services, however. Earlier this year, Google launched its Android Pay mobile payment platform in the UK, and a Samsung Pay launch is expected as well. Electronic commerce technology is still treated skeptically by many older users, but consumer habits and behavior change slowly, and, as the younger generation wholly embraces their digital wallets, so the previous generations will catch on. ...

You’ll get them on October 27th Posted Oct 18, 2016 by Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) 0 SHARES Next Story This probably isn’t the RC droid you’re looking for So I’ve been hearing for weeks now that Apple has been waffling a bit on a date for its late-October Mac event. But, according to my sources, a date has been picked: Thursday, October 27th. So those looking for a new MacBook, hold your horses. And if you’re a journo, flights are getting iffy but hotels are pretty cheap still. I reached out to Apple for a comment on their secret, unannounced event but shockingly they did not reply. Apple typically holds its events on a Tuesday or Wednesday. But it moved its earnings call earlier this month to Tuesday the 25th, so that was out. And the Microsoft Surface All-in-One PC event, which takes place on October 26th, knocks Wednesday out. It almost didn’t rule it out, I think, but that would have looked pretty silly on Apple’s part. Better they go the day after. The event should hold news for those looking for new Mac models. A bunch of stuff has been previously rumored and reported and the stuff that seems the most accurate is new 13″ MacBook Air models with USB-C ports and a new MacBook Pro with a fancy digital display above the keyboard and Skylake Intel processors. New iMacs could appear, as well as a standalone 5k monitor to replace the Thunderbolt display. That device could have an internal GPU that enables MacBooks or older Macs to drive the much higher-resolution display.

Apple is reportedly set to introduce new models next week Thinking about buying a new iMac or MacBook? Hold off another week or so. That’s because Apple is reportedly about to unveil long-awaited updates to its Mac lineup, per technology news site Recode. The Cupertino, Calif. company is set to make the news official on Oct. 27. It’s been plus-or-minus a year since most of Apple’s desktops and laptops have gotten a refresh. Now’s a great time for Apple to finally go ahead and introduce some new models, as it’s got a new version of MacOS out (Sierra) and shoppers have their wallets ready for holiday buying season. What’s Apple got in store? Here’s a clue from a report in Bloomberg, hinting at a high-end MacBook Pro aimed at video gamers and, perhaps, the virtual reality crowd: The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The move had long been expected, given that the company released MacOS Sierra last month but had yet to introduce any new computer models sporting the software. It also comes just in time for Apple to have the new products on sale for the full holiday season. Apple has gone a long time without making significant changes to any of its Mac models, with most experts encouraging customers to hold off all but essential new purchases until the lineup was updated. Tops among the rumors have been reports that Apple will introduce a new MacBook Pro sporting a row of customizable touchscreen keys. Sierra, for its part, adds support for Apple’s Siri voice assistant and the ability to copy and paste between iOS and MacOS devices, among other features. The Mac event is expected to take place at or near Apple’s Cupertino campus rather than in San Francisco, where the company held many recent events, including the iPhone 7 announcement. It’s going to be a busy week. Apple has its earnings report on Tuesday, Microsoft is holding a Windows 10 hardware event in New York on Wednesday and then the new Macs will debut on Thursday.

Some kind of October launch has been rumored for months, but the exact timing has not yet been confirmed. Some people were speculating that since we haven't seen an event invite yet, Apple had scratched its plans to hold an event to launch new hardware this month. Recode's report goes against that, and if its reporting is correct, we should be expecting an invite to go to the press sometime this week. DON'T MISS: Sprint still doesn’t understand what ‘unlimited’ means Recode doesn't specify what devices Apple will launch at the event, but we're expecting a new MacBook Pro, at the very least. It's been years (literally!) since we had a proper update to the MacBook Pro, and rumors are suggesting that Apple is finally going to deliver. The primary rumor is a new notebook with an OLED touchscreen along the top of the keyboard, which will give users shortcuts to use in different programs. A fingerprint sensor for Apple Pay and always-on Hey Siri support wouldn't be all that surprising, either. Apple released the newly-named macOS, complete with Siri support, to the general public earlier this fall. However, we haven't seen any new devices specifically designed to run macOS yet, and it would be surprising if Apple only had a line of year-old laptops on sale at Christmas. Apart from the MacBook Pro, some rumors have also suggested that we'll see an updated MacBook Air, new Thunderbolt display, and perhaps a new iMac or two. Changes to the Retina MacBook line aren't off the table either. One thing is much more certain: no new iPhone hardware, and probably some encouraging sales numbers from the iPhone 7. Although Apple chose to not disclose numbers this year, it rarely misses a chance to show off its sales figures. Trending right now: Apple needs to make this custom ‘matte white’ iPhone a reality.

 Facebook's project to take on Cisco inspires such 'cultlike' devotion, it once caused a whole team to quit Apple Julie Bort Oct. 18, 2016, 5:29 PM 72,916 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stephen Lam/Reuters On Tuesday, Facebook made an announcement that should set Cisco's teeth on edge. Its second-generation computer network switch, called the Wedge 100, is now available for purchase though Chinese contract manufacturer Edgecore (owned by Accton Technology). That's the same company that manufacturers the Facebook-designed switch for Facebook's own internal use. This is a superfast 100G switch, and could be something that many other big companies — and certainly other internet companies — will want to buy. While Facebook isn't a direct competitor to Cisco — it's giving away the switch design for free, not making money on it — it is doing something perhaps even more astounding: It has created an entire ecosystem of companies that are, collectively, taking on Cisco, which owns 59% of the market, according to IDC. This is all part of Facebook's Open Compute Project, or OCP — arguably one of Facebook's most important technology projects. The new Facebook 100 network switch. Facebook Joining the 'cult' "OCP has a cultlike following," one person with knowledge of the situation told Business Insider. "The whole industry, internet companies, vendors, and enterprises are monitoring OCP." OCP aims to do for computer hardware what the Linux operating system did for software: make it open-source so anyone can take the designs for free and modify them, with contract manufacturers standing by to build them. OCP allows the world's best hardware engineers to collaborate and work openly together "without fear of transferring" their company's secrets, this person said. In its six years, OCP has grown into a global entity, with board members from Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Intel, and Microsoft. Famed network engineer Andy Bechtolsheim is also on the board. (Bechtolsheim is a cofounder of Cisco's arch enemy, Arista Networks. He famously seed-funded Google with Arista's other founder, David Cheriton.) OCP conferences draw in tens of thousands of people. In fact, there's a well-known story among OCP insiders that demonstrates this phenomenon. It involves Apple's networking team. Jason Forrester, founder and CEO of SnapRoute. SnapRoute This team was responsible for building a network at Apple that was so reliable it would never go down. Not rarely — never. Think about it: When was the last time iTunes or Siri or Apple Maps was offline? Building a 100% reliable network to meet Apple's exacting standards was no easy task. Instead of going it alone under Apple's legendary secrecy, the Apple networking team wanted to participate in the OCP revolution, contributing and receiving help. But when the Apple team asked to join OCP, Apple said no. "The whole team quit the same week," this person told us. Shortly afterward, Apple publicly joined OCP. But that was too late for the engineers who quit. Instead, they founded a startup called SnapRoute, led by Jason Forrester, the former team leader. While Forrester declined to talk to us for this article, SnapRoute's website hints at the story. "Slowly, our desire to share our ideas with the world began to overshadow the thrill and pride of working for Apple. My team and I left in 2015," he wrote. "Truth be told, I spent a few days crying on the couch. My mood only improved when we began to test our ideas with potential customers." While Facebook also gives away the software it designed to run its new switch as an open-source project, a whole list of startups and a few established players are standing by to sell commercial software that works with and improves upon the Facebook switch. That's the whole point of doing this open-source. For the Wedge 100, the list includes Big Switch Networks, Linux maker Ubuntu, and Apstra, the new startup from Cheriton, a billionaire Stanford professor. (Cheriton left Arista in 2014 and sued it over some disputed technology, though he is still a major shareholder.) And the list includes that tiny startup, SnapRoute. Word is that SnapRoute already has an impressive roster of customers, although it's not alone in attacking this software-defined networking market. Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Arista, both OCP members, have partnered on it. And Microsoft, an OCP board member, is working on something called Azure Stack. Meanwhile, Facebook will soon be upping its assault on Cisco by releasing an even faster piece of optical networking equipment currently in development, Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice president of infrastructure, told Business Insider last year. Who knows what kinds of startups — or rebellions — that piece of equipment will inspire? Apple could not be reached for comment.

Illustration: Pixabay Apple has finally come to its senses: the much-discussed Apple Car seems to be on its way to the dustbin of bad ideas. A new report from Bloomberg says that Apple has reassigned or let go “hundreds of members of the car team.” Going forward, the company will focus on creating a self-driving platform, most likely partnering with existing car makers. There’s always the potential for Apple to acquire a car maker, but Apple would need to tread carefully here, as well. Car making is a tough business, and it doesn’t enjoy the fat profit margins that Apple enjoys on its traditional line of electronics. Apple’s net margins -- the percentage of revenue it turns into profit -- was 23% last year. Compare that to 5% for Ford and General Motors. Tesla, meanwhile, has lost money in each of the last five years. Alphabet’s Google, which is further ahead than Apple in its own car efforts, has faced its own struggles breaking into the automotive world. The head of Google’s self-driving car project announced he was leaving the company in August to “find my next adventure.” That said, cars are clearly the next frontier for technology firms. This past January, much of the excitement at CES -- the annual technology show in Las Vegas -- was car specific. At the show, chip firm Nvidia showed off a new chip with the processing capacity of 150 MacBook Pros. That’s the kind of power required to solve the challenge of self-driving cars, which will need to understand all sorts of visual inputs, from pedestrians crossing the street to leaves falling from trees. Surely Apple and Google have a big contribution to make here. But there time is best spent on artificial intelligence or new interior interfaces, not engines and axles. Big Picture: Apple is rethinking its car initiatives. That’s good news for Apple investors and probably for the entire car industry. Tech firms are better off partnering with car makers than competing with them.

The event will be held "at or near" Apple's Cupertino campus instead of in San Francisco, suggesting it will perhaps be at the company's Town Hall conference center. Recode does not detail which Macs will receive a refresh at the event, but Apple's entire Mac lineup, aside from the Retina MacBook, is in need of a refresh. New MacBook Pro models will likely headline the event, as rumors suggest a major update is in the works. The new MacBook Pro is said to include a redesigned, thinner body with a flatter MacBook-style keyboard, an OLED touch panel that replaces the physical function keys at the top of the keyboard, and Touch ID support. It is expected to do away with the USB-A port, HDMI port, and SD card slot, featuring just four USB-C ports based on part leaks, and it is said to include support for USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3. A recent rumor from Japanese site Mac Otakara suggests Apple will also be introducing a new 13-inch MacBook Air, also featuring USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. Other products that could potentially see refreshes include the iMac, the Mac Pro, and the Mac mini. With an event set to take place on October 27, media invites should be going out later this week.

October 18 AAPL: 117.47 -0.08 Apple to hold event to unveil new Macs on October 27th in Cupertino Chance Miller - 4 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Mac View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following last night’s report that new Macs are still on track for this month and as predicted, Recode now reports that Apple is planning to hold an event on October 27th to announce its latest lineup, meaning that we’re just over a week away from those long overdue updates… The report cites unnamed sources and claims that the event will take place “at or near” Apple’s Cupertino campus, not in San Francisco where other recent events have been held. Apple declined to comment on the report but some think Apple’s Town Hall might see its swan song for the Mac event. While we’re still waiting for Apple itself to send out invites, it’s all-but-confirmed at this point that a bunch of new Macs are coming this month. Apple will likely send out press invites at some point this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow. Last night’s report claimed that Apple plans to introduce a new MacBook Pro that drops MagSafe and USB-A in favor of all USB-C connectivity. Additionally, the report claimed that Apple will discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air, which could mean a price cut is coming for the 12-inch MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Air. We discussed what might happen if the 11.6-inch left the lineup but some smart folks think it will stay in the lineup. The new MacBook Pro lineup is expected to feature a new, slimmer design, while the internal specifications will also be upgraded. The new models are also expected to feature an OLED touch bar in place of the traditional function row of keys. Recode’s report corroborates earlier speculation that Apple did in fact move its Q4 earnings call to make room for a Mac event. Apple was originally scheduled to hold its earnings call on October 27th, but later moved the call up to October 25th, leaving many to wonder if the change was due to the scheduling of a press event for Macs. Do you plan on picking up a new Mac this month? Apple’s MacBook Pro lineup is long overdue for an update and this could be the most excitement I’ve seen surrounding a Mac-centric event in a long time. Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

Updated: 10/21/16 12:20 am EDT. NEW YORK (CNBC) - Reviews of Alphabet's first "Made by Google" mobile phone are out, and the new handset appears to go toe-to-toe with other premium phones, though it may not outpace them. "Google's ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn't offer a lot that's new. Yet it's still one of the best out there," The Associated Press' Anick Jesdanun concludes. Google's new Pixel phone has a sleek design that struck reviewers as familiar, if uninspired. While the pricey phone, starting at $649.99, faces some criticism of its photo quality, battery life and speed, other reviewers were blown away by its artificial intelligence, camera and software. With a sleek design, sharper display, good camera, and smarter voice-activated assistant, Pixel provides a compelling sell to iPhone 7 users,The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern writes. The battery life falls a bit short on the regular-sized model, but it charges faster than an iPhone, she says. She says the biggest challenge is the software. While the apps work more fluidly than Apple's iOS or other Android versions, and the updates are automatic, Stern notes that her friends and family are already entrenched in Apple's iMessage. Plus, Google's Assistant logs queries, she writes. "The Assistant works great but you have to be willing to let Google be Big Brother," Stern wrote. Brian X. Chen takes a more downbeat view in The New York Times, calling the phone "mediocre" and "underwhelming." "It is slower than Apple's iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung's smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel's camera don't look as good as the iPhone's. And Google's built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb. But hey, the Pixel probably won't burn down your garage or injure a child." Chen ran into some glitches with Google Assistant when trying to use natural language requests, and noted that the camera seemed to "exaggerate cyans and magentas," making images appear colder. Unlike Stern, Chen wasn't taken with the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone. Still, for Android loyalists, Chen recommends Project Fi, Google's experimental wireless service, which he found to be reliable and a "good, frugal option." Personal tech guru Walt Mossberg writes that the Pixel is the first-rate Android phone that, at long last, will shake up the industry. "Suddenly, there's no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets," he wrote. The design is familiar, pleasant but conservative, Mossberg notes, and the Android platform is easy to use. "The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I've ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world," Mossberg wrote in The Verge and Recode. The phone comes with a few minor inconveniences, he says: It doesn't ship with earbuds, and when asked for the ingredients of apple pie, Google's Assistant fails to list "apples." But it still outflanks Siri, according to Mossberg. The battery life fell short of 10 hours during Mossberg's test, below the 13 hours promised, and the camera was a bit weaker than the iPhone 7 in dim light, he says. Plus, Google's 24-hour chat support just isn't the same as going to an Apple store. USA Today's Ed Baig called the Pixel a "winner," noting two positives right off the bat: the presence of a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the lack of a bump to accommodate the camera. The access to unlimited cloud storage boosts the usefulness of the Pixel's high-end camera, according to Baig, and he, too, notes how smart Google Assistant is when responding to more complicated queries. "I asked the Assistant to 'tell me about my day' and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg, and BBC. When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter Sydney rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to 'show me pictures of Sydney with bridges' it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the web. Google Assistant was also able to translate 'how do I find a bathroom in French?' into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I only knew a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. Still, Baig notes, the phone has only a single speaker and lacks the same level of water-resistance as competitors. Filed under:  Google > next

(Photo: Handout/Google) Google’s ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn’t offer a lot that’s new. Yet it’s still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch “XL” edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google’s online store. I tested the Pixel XL model; the regular version has identical features except for its smaller display and battery — still enough for 13 hours of internet use, according to Google. With either, you get an excellent camera and a strong voice assistant that promises to get smarter — all without the bloat common with other Android phones. The Pixel isn’t quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. The camera: The Pixel’s image quality is superb — though purists may quibble. Colors in some shots look too strong and clean to me, thanks to software processing intended to reduce distortion and improve detail (something all phones do to some extent). But automation pays off in another way: The Pixel will automatically combine successive shots into an animated “GIF” file, offering a fun way to share a toddler’s steps or a dog jumping. For video, the Pixel’s stabilization technology compensates for shaky hands and other movement, matching what the iPhone and Galaxy phones can do. The Pixel borrows a quick-launch feature from Samsung phones. Just double tap the power button to start the camera, even if the phone is locked. To switch between the front and rear cameras, just double twist the phone like a door knob — a feature Motorola, which Google once owned, has long offered. Low-light images taken with the Pixel in three museums aren’t as crisp as those from the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 (which has the same camera as the Note 7). But differences are small, and the Pixel does better than typical smartphones. Where the Pixel falls short is in extreme close-ups, such as shooting a flower petal or a small bug; photos were typically blurry. The Pixel’s selfie camera is also inferior, with no front flash or control over the focus. But it’s fine in good light and at typical distances for selfies. The assistant: Google’s voice assistant, simply known as Google Assistant, will seem familiar to those who have used Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa features. Google’s version goes further in offering daily updates such as weather and news, though plenty of apps already offer similar capabilities through notifications. Google is also better at remembering preferences — say, if you prefer temperatures in Celsius — and at integrating with its own services, such as Translate and Photos. But Assistant doesn’t yet sync with a similar Assistant in Google’s Allo chat app and upcoming Home speaker. And it isn’t as proactive as the Google Now assistant already built into Android phones. Google Now, for instance, will look through your Gmail account for flight reservations and remind you when to head to the airport. It will analyze your daily commute and warn of delays. Assistant waits for you to ask. Assistant holds up well compared with Siri and Alexa, but for more, swipe from left to right to get the old Google Now back. Google says Assistant will eventually get the Google Now functionality. Other features: If you need help, you can reach Google’s customer support and enable screen-sharing reminiscent of Amazon’s Mayday help feature. And the Pixel will work with Google’s upcoming Daydream View virtual-reality headset, much as Samsung phones have Samsung’s Gear VR. Long-pressing an app icon brings up a menu of shortcuts, such as getting directions to home or launching the selfie camera. It’s similar to the iPhone’s 3D Touch. The Pixel also offers “Night Light,” a feature that tints your screen amber by filtering out blue light that might keep you up at night. Apple calls it Night Shift. Pixel owners get unlimited storage of photos at original resolution, though that’s a little like offering Google search for free. Google Photos already offers unlimited storage at up to 16 megapixels; the Pixel’s camera is 12 megapixels. The free offer will make a difference for those who take video in ultra-sharp “4k” resolution, but the default setting is lower, at 1080p, which is already free at Google Photos. What’s missing: The Pixel will be OK if you spray it with water, but don’t drop it in the pool. You also can’t expand its storage with a memory card, as you can with the S7 and Note 7 — though for $100 more, the Pixel’s 32 gigabytes of storage quadruples to 128 gigabytes, and the free online storage should take care of your photos and videos. The battery isn’t removable, though that’s true for most phones these days. 12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Monday November 14, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE Apple Watch Nike+ edition release date and updates: Comes with unique features and exclusive nike sport bands Rosemarie Alba 18 October, 2016 1:37 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (YouTube/Apple)Screenshot from the official Apple Watch 2 official introduction video. Apple just released a piece of exciting news about its latest variant in its Apple Watch Series 2. The Cupertino-based company will launch its Apple Watch Nike+ edition on Oct. 28. Find out here what remarkable features the new special edition smartwatch has. The Nike+ edition will come out stylish in four color variants. Buyers can choose from Black/Volt, Black/Cool Gray, Flat Silver/Volt, and Flat Silver/White Nike bands. It comes with  a price tag of $369 (for the 38 mm size) and $399 (for the 42 mm size). The latest Apple Watch has a Nike sports band which has Nike's software and of course, the Nike+ Run Club app. Deccan Chronicle also mentioned that the new watch is water-proof for up to 50 meters deep and houses a built-in GPS. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the upcoming smartwatch has two unique watch faces which will showcase Nike's iconic font and Volt color. The report explained that this feature will not be present in other Apple watches as it is exclusive to Nike products. Another feature that users will enjoy is the watch's customization feature. Both Nike watch faces can be redesigned. Furthermore, the Apple Watch Nike+ edition is specially designed with Nike's Sport Band which has compression-molded perforations for more ventilation. This design is especially useful to users who have an active lifestyle and to users who are attempting to lose weight. The band perforations can also be adjusted to the user's wrist. Meanwhile, the publication also stated that the version of the Nike+ Run Club app is still to be verified when the latest smartwatch is released. The demo models seem to have a different version of the app found on the App Store. Also, the Nike Sport Band has also not been confirmed whether or not it will be sold separately. Check out the special Apple Watch Nike+ edition on Oct. 28.

Mossberg: Google’s first phone is first rate The Verge 18/10/2016 Walt Mossberg © Provided by The Verge At long last, almost 8 years to the day the first Android phone went on sale, Google is launching a smartphone for which it designed the hardware, software and cloud ecosystem itself: the Pixel. No longer will the tech giant be entirely dependent on other companies to present Android in its best light, in hardware that varied wildly but never was built from the ground up to be the best physical instantiation of pure, Google Android. I wrote last year and last week about why it makes sense for Google to become, like Apple, a vertically integrated hardware maker. I believe this is the right move. I believe it will shake up the industry. But the question is: how did Google do? How good is the Pixel? After testing the historic phone since last week, I can say that the Pixel is very, very good. In its first try, Google has landed itself in the same class as Apple’s iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S7 (that company’s non-exploding model). Like those formidable competitors, it’s comfortable and practical; fast and fluid; takes very good pictures; and is connected to a strong ecosystem. The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I’ve ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world. My biggest disappointment with the expensive phone is that it’s battery life didn’t measure up to Google’s claims in my tests. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t terrific. It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon. My biggest pleasant surprise with the Pixel was the built-in Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligent assistant, which, while not perfect, was impressive and far better than Apple’s Siri. My overwhelmingly positive results with the Assistant, which is debuting as a built-in feature on the Pixel, matter a lot. That’s because Google is building the Pixel and other hardware precisely so it can showcase and refine its artificial intelligence work. Design The Pixel comes in two models, with identical top-of-the-line specs and excellent cameras: a 5-inch model and a 5.5-inch model, the Pixel XL. These are premium phones, priced in iPhone territory. They start at $649 for a base, 32GB Pixel and top out at $869 for a 128GB XL model. Which makes it surprising that the design is… conservative. And, by conservative, I mean that, from the front, the Pixel pretty much looks like an iPhone, complete with the big top and bottom bezels or chins that I am hoping Apple eliminates next year. Almost everyone I showed it to just shrugged and thought it was an iPhone. Only those who took a minute for closer examination noticed the absence of a bottom physical home button, and the different arrangement of the side buttons. The back of the Pixel is very different from the iPhone’s, because there’s a glass rectangle at the top on which Google has placed a large round fingerprint sensor, instead of where Apple has it, on the front. The PIxel also lacks a camera bump, because it’s slightly thicker at the top. It’s a pleasant, familiar design that feels good in the hand. But it isn’t an attempt to show off any design or hardware chops and it gives Apple a break in a year when the new iPhone has the same body for a third year in a row. Using it I slipped right into using the Pixel with ease, even though my main phone is an iPhone. I still find Android just a bit geekier than iOS, but the gap has narrowed greatly and Google’s special version of Android 7.0 Nougat on the Pixel is fast and fluid. There’s no distracting layer of junkware and hosts of duplicate apps, as on third-party Android phones. On the Pixel, you just slide up to see all your apps, besides the ones you’ve placed on the home screens. You slide down for quick settings. And there’s even a feature sort of like Apple’s 3D Touch on the Pixel: a long press on some icons will bring up quick actions. For instance, press on the camera icon for shortcuts to taking a selfie or a video. I installed and used third-party apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Slack and Apple Music. All worked fine, but several seemed behind, or less slick, than their iOS counterparts. For instance, it’s much easier in Slack for iOS to find your history of direct messages. I tested the Pixel with my car’s Bluetooth, which was smooth as silk. It even worked fine with Apple’s pre-production AirPod earphones, although without any of their special iOS pairing features. I also tested Android Pay on the Pixel at Walgreen’s and Starbucks and it worked fine. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. The Assistant The Pixel was built to showcase Google’s new artificial intelligence feature, the Google Assistant. It’s the only phone so far on which you can call up this new feature by just pressing the home button or saying "OK, Google." The Assistant appears in a text or chat format, because it’s meant to carry on a conversation with you. (You can also use it in the new, optional Google messaging app, Allo.) Google warns that the Assistant is just in its earliest days, and still missing a lot of smarts and capabilities. For instance, it can’t read your emails and texts. It can’t book you a flight. And when I asked it for the ingredients for apple pie, it failed to list apples — though a more complete list appeared if I tapped on a web link it presented. Having said that, the Assistant blew away every competitor I’ve tried. It shredded Siri, which has a five-year lead. It not only did on-phone tasks reliably — like launching an app, or creating reminders or notes or playing music — but it understood most of the wider-world questions I asked it. Even more impressively, it remembered the general subject I was asking about, so I didn’t have to repeat the topic with every question. Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. For all of its other qualities, the Pixel is worth considering just for the Assistant. Camera In good light, I found that the camera took very pleasing, vivid photos, with colors that popped — an effect enhanced by the phone’s OLED screen. I liked them, and you may as well. But sometimes, the Pixel’s photos seemed too saturated. For instance, a Pixel photo of flowers in my garden that are a bit past their peak looked unnaturally colorful on the Pixel’s screen, even though I liked the effect. They looked more realistic in an iPhone 7 shot viewed on the iPhone 7 screen. When viewed side by side on a non-OLED laptop screen, they looked nearly identical. Your preference will be a matter of personal taste. The camera on the Pixel also lacks optical image stabilization, unlike on the iPhone. Videos I took walking around my neighborhood weren’t too shaky, though. In dim light, however, I found the iPhone 7 did much better than the Pixel. Some combination of its wider lens aperture and flash gave it the edge, and objects were clearer. Having said all that, the Pixel has a very good camera that should please almost every user in almost every situation. Battery Life It’s tough to measure battery life on a smartphone, because it depends too much on a wide variety of factors, including what features and apps a person used, for how long each, and how far the phone was from good cellular and Wi-Fi connections. However, in my short few days of testing, using the smaller Pixel, I never approached the 13 hours or so Google claimed for most activities. On a day when I was focused on battery life, streaming a 90-minute movie and playing music for hours, I got only a few minutes over 9 hours — not even enough to get most people through a full work day, including commutes. As I write this, having played little music and streamed no video today, the phone is predicting I’ll get 12 hours. For comparison, in my typical usage patterns, and in the same areas and phone network, the iPhone 7 got between 12 and 14 hours. Google couldn’t explain my results, and I must note that a colleague doing his own review had a much better battery life experience with the Pixel. Support Google has no experience supporting consumers who bought hardware. It’s promising online and phone support "day or night". From right on the phone. I didn’t test this, but, even if it’s good, it’s not the same as getting human help at hundreds of Apple stores around the world. Bottom Line If you’re an Android fan, willing to buy a premium phone, the Pixel is your answer. To repeat: it’s simply the best Android phone I’ve tested. If you’re an iPhone user thinking of switching, the Pixel will seem physically familiar, but you’ll have to overcome the sticky links you’ve developed with fellow iPhone users, things like iMessage (which Google can’t match yet) and iCloud Photo Sharing (which Google is trying to copy.) You’ll also have to do without the comfort of your neighborhood Genius Bar. But my main message, dear readers, is this: Google has come out of the gate with a top-flight phone and suddenly, there’s no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets.

While discussing how she joined Apple, including that it was her idea initially to merge both retail and online, Ahrendts also shared some new details about Apple’s recent store redesigns and upcoming initiatives. Highlighting the newly updated store design which first debuted in mass at the San Francisco Union Square location, Angela noted that Apple expects to have 95 stores converted to the new design by the end of the year. The updated store design creates several new positions including a ‘Creative Pro’ job that she described as a Genius position for services, and it also adds new areas to the store layout that focus on making them town square-like hubs for the community. The most recent to get renovated was Apple’s Regent Street location. In addition, Ahrendts revealed that Apple plans to start a new curriculum for Swift– Apple’s programming language– that will see it teach kids to code three times a day free of charge at Apple stores beginning next year. The new Apple Store designs will also play host to other regular community events, Ahrendts noted. One is a new “Teachers Tuesday” initiative currently being piloted at Apple Union Square in which the employees spend time helping teachers with anything they need in the classroom. Angela noted in the interview that the event has been popular with 78 teachers participating during a single day: “One of the things we’ll turn on next year as we turn on these stores is a Swift curriculum… we will teach kids to code, three times a day, free of charge whenever their parents can bring them in…. and there’s p[programming for teachers… we’ve been piloting something in Union Square something we call Teacher Tuesdays… the team will do nothing but spend their time helping them… last Tuesday 78 teachers showed up. Angela discussed other interesting Apple retail related tidbits in the interview, including the fact that Apple has an 87% retention rate for retail staff versus an industry average of 20%.

Instead of having to rely on Markdown formatting or other formatting types, the HTML support should make it easier for plugin developers and publishers to get their content onto Apple News even faster. Apple provided a list of newly supported HTML markup and tags in the email, and can be seen after the jump. Today’s update also means that Apple News publishers will need to confirm that their JSON files sent to News Publisher are configured with the new format ‘html’ property to take part of the HTML formatting.

Published on October 18, 2016. Brent Anderson, TBWA/Media Arts Lab chief creative officer Credit: TBWA/Media Arts Lab Most Popular TBWA/Media Arts Labs has named Brent Anderson its new chief creative officer. Mr. Anderson moves from his post as executive director of TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles, where he oversaw creative for the agency's core accounts, including Gatorade, Airbnb, Adidas, PlayStation, Visa, the Grammys and Buffalo Wild Wings. Mr. Anderson is a TBWA vet of more than a decade. He started in the L.A. office in 2005 as a senior art director, and moved up to his most recent executive creative director post. He began his career as an art director at Portland, Ore., agency JohnsonSheen (now currently North) and graduated from Brigham Young University. "When I started at ChiatDay, Apple was still in the Chiat building, Apple's Silhouette campaign was in full force and Mac vs. PC was just starting to air," Mr. Anderson said. "I really wanted to work hard to have a shot at an Apple brief. That desire to work on this amazing brand continues undiluted all these years later. And now that chance to work on an Apple brief has found me." Former TBWA/MAL Chief Creative Officer Duncan Milner steps up to the role of global creative president. He will oversee domestic and international accounts and will continue to steer the agency's MAL/FOR GOOD purpose-driven marketing arm globally. Through the years, Mr. Anderson has been instrumental in leading the agency's most innovative work. He was one of the creators of the double Cannes Grand Prix-winning Gatorade "Replay" campaign, the branded content effort that brought athletes back to the field and the rink to replay crucial games from their school days. Since then, the Gatorade work has remained stand out, with recent efforts such as the delightful animated film about Usain Bolt, "The Boy Who Learned to Fly," as well as thoughtful, poignant athlete farewells to Peyton Manning and Derek Jeter, the latter which was nominated for an Emmy. The agency has also helped steer global marketing for Airbnb, delivering much talked-about work such as the "Is Mankind?" ad that inspired multiple parodies and saw a timely tweak following the news of Caitlyn Jenner's coming out. In 2015 the L.A. office saw its most successful run in Cannes in six years, with 10 Lions and more than 30 shortlists across a broad swath of categories, including Mobile, Cyber, and Innovation. Related Stories Creativity 50 2015: Duncan Milner Mr. Milner helped co-found TBWA/MAL and grow it from 40 people in L.A. to 1000 globally. Named last year to Ad Age's Creativity 50, the agency has also received numerous accolades for its work including the 2015 Outdoor Grand Prix for the "Shot on iPhone 6" campaign, the 2013 Cannes Press Grand Prix for the iPad Mini magazine ad effort as well as the 2014 Emmy for Apple's "Misunderstood" holiday ad. "Nothing is more important than giving trajectory and growth opportunities to individuals who have earned it through their work, vision and leadership," said TBWAWorldwide President and CEO Troy Ruhanen in a statement. "Brent is an exceptional talent, a natural leader, and will drive the kind of disruptive, culture-defining work that is worthy of the world's most iconic brand." "Having Duncan at the creative helm of MALFOR GOOD is a testament to the importance of this practice within TBWA," he added. "Duncan will be able to pull from his vast experience to do very important and disruptive work on some of the biggest issues facing the world today." The agency plans to fill Mr. Anderson's vacated position in the coming weeks. TBWA/Chiat/Day L.A. Creative Chairman Stephen Butler will continue his charge in steering the agency's vision, culture and development, while TBWA/MAL President Erica Hoholick and TBWA/Chiat/Day L.A. President Erin Riley remain in their current posts. "The agencies will continue to exist as two cultures, but their leadership will work together to create a more connected and collaborative group in L.A.," said Lee Clow, founder-chairman of TBWA/Media Arts Lab, in a statement. "With our talent, clients and vision we will continue to exist in the space of big, culture changing ideas. It's the reason we should want to work here. It's the reason why I work here."

Affan, in News | Cars & Vehicles   Credit: Getty Images Apple Backs Away from “Project Titan”: No longer will be making cars   Apple car project to go in a new direction in the year 2017 Apple had announced the “Project Titan” with loads of valor and enthusiasm few years back. The company had plans to launch its own self-driving technology and a self-driving car. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals However it looks like the company has back paddled from the plan and it turning towards a new direction with the project. We have been told that Apple will no longer take part actively in making its own self-driving car. The car which was supposed to be revealed somewhere near 2020 will no longer be on the charts any time soon.  According to Bloomberg, hundreds of people working on the Project Titan will lose their jobs. Many of them have already left and the others remaining will face cut down shortly. The remaining staff on the Project Titan have been given a deadline by board in order to prove the practicality of self-driving technology, otherwise it will be closed for good.  The company however on the other hand have been reported to hire new people as well. They are hiring new people in order to work on the Project Titan in the current status and new track. According to news, Project Titan was supposed to reveal its first final development by 2020 but due to leadership failure the project was not able to give what was needed from it. The project leader Steve Zadesky of Titan also left the company and his position earlier this year.  According to Bloomberg, after much pondering and meetings, it was decided by company that Apple should not get in competition with Tesla as they already have so many electric car models in the market. The company is also working towards self-driving cars. In the past few months over 150 Software engineers and hundreds of IT experts have left the Apple.  You May Like The Author M. Affan M.

Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Oct 18, 2016 11:18 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac Mobile & Wireless Apple Comments Apple will update its Mac laptops this month by refreshing the MacBook Pro and culling the MacBook Air line, according to numerous online reports. The latest claim of impending Macs was made Monday by Japanese website Macotakara. Citing Chinese suppliers, Macotakara asserted that the 13- and 15-in. MacBook Pro models will feature the same USB-C port Apple introduced to considerable controversy in March 2015 with the MacBook. Macotakara also claimed that Apple would ditch the entry-level 11-in. MacBook Air -- at $900, the company's least-expensive notebook. Earlier speculation had centered around an OLED touch bar on the MacBook Pro, which would replace the static function keys with a row of application-specific commands or shortcuts. The most-cited date for a MacBook refresh: Thursday, Oct. 27. Analysts were uncertain whether Apple would roll out new notebooks with some fanfare -- perhaps by hosting a modest event at its California headquarters -- or simply issue a press release and post the new systems and prices on its online store. Apple has taken the second path most often in the past years, a sign of the Mac's diminished importance to the company's fortunes. In a recent interview, Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said Apple would host an event only if it had decided to change its narrative and messaging about the Mac and how personal computers fit in with the rest of its efforts. The Mac contributes a small, but still significant, amount to Apple's coffers: In the last four quarters that Apple has reported earnings, the Mac accounted for between 9% and 13% of total revenue. The long stretches since Apple last revamped the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air -- 16 and 18 months, respectively -- has been raised as the primary reason for declining sales. Most analysts accepted that rationale. Likewise, they rejected the notion that Apple would soon retire from the personal computer market in lieu of recent assertions that a keyboard-equipped iPad Pro was, in fact, a suitable substitute. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, research firms IDC and Gartner pegged Mac shipments at 5 million and 4.9 million, respectively, for year-over-year contractions of 13% and 13.4%. If those estimates turn out accurate, Apple will have recorded Mac sale shrinkage four straight quarters, equaling the span in 2012 and 2013, currently the company's longest sales slump. Near the end of that downturn, Apple lowered MacBook Pro prices by as much as 13%, a move one analyst said was necessary to bring the notebook more in line with the overall market prices. It would not be surprising if Apple did something similar with pricing to bring the line out of its doldrums.

For the next 14 years till he retired, he drew an annual salary of $1. He let the 5.5-million Apple shares do the earning for him. And, they didn't disappoint going up about a hundred times, when Jobs went about changing the world. There are several promoters serving on the boards of their Indian companies, who don't draw any remuneration at all from their companies. This is despite the fact that many of them have executive roles. The numbers offer a contrast to growing discontent over increasing levels of C-suite remuneration. An analysis of remuneration data reported by 1,450 National Stock Exchange-listed firms in their annual reports for 2015-16 showed that 1,043 non-independent directors did not draw any remuneration for the year. This number compiled by Prime Database included several nominee directors, who were appointed by the government companies and other institutional investors. Of these, around 300 promoter-directors did not draw any salary or sitting fees for their board roles. Among the Nifty firms, Anand Mahindra, chairman of Tech Mahindra, was the only non-nominee director in the list of 33 directors who did not draw any pay. Others were mostly government and investor nominees in state-owned companies such as Coal India, NTPC, and BHEL. Some family businesses have made it a policy not to draw any salary for board roles. The entire Burman family - Anand Burman, Amit Burman, Mohit Burman and Saket Burman, who have roles of chairman, vice-chairman and non-executive directors, do not draw any remuneration from Dabur India. In response to an email seeking comment on the practice, a Dabur spokesperson said: "The family restricted their presence on the board of directors of Dabur India Ltd to four non-executive members with the balance being independent directors. Since the family members did not hold any executive role in Dabur, as a good corporate governance practice, they decided not to draw salaries from Dabur." The Burman family had in 1998 handed over the management control of Dabur India Ltd to a professional team. The family, then, moved away from day-to-day management. A family council was set up and the promoter family decided that no Burman family member would get an automatic entry into Dabur. They would rather be encouraged to set up their own business ventures, the spokesperson added. Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon Industries, GVK Reddy in GVK Power, Kiran Kumar Grandhi of GMR Infrastructure, Hari Shankar Bhartia of Jubilant Life Sciences, Siddarth Hegde of Coffee Day and Atul Punj of Punj Lloyd are managing directors having a hands-on role in their companies. Yet, they did not draw any salary in the last financial year. Shyam Sunder Bhartia of Jubilant Industries, Narendra and Samir Gehlaut of Indiabulls Real Estate were among promoter directors in a non-executive role, who did not take home any pay. Mahindra, Gautam Adani in Adani Power and Adani Transmission, Dilip Shangvi in Sun Pharma Advanced Research and Sajjan Jindal of JSW Holdings are examples of directors who drew salary in some firms and not in others. Billionaire Investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who is a promoter shareholder of Aptech, did not charge any fee or salary for his role as non-executive chairman. Human resources experts say promoters prefer to benefit out of the performance of companies. Returns through dividends and equity appreciation are also more tax-efficient than salaries, they add. Kris Lakshmikanth, founder, The Headhunters, said, "Only professionals take salaries. Owners don't. They earn more through dividends and appreciation in shareholding. That has been the practice traditionally as it was also tax-efficient, especially when not very long ago, tax rates in India were over 90 per cent." Lakshmikanth added that examples such as Marans of Sun Network, who have drawn criticism for high salaries, are more an exception rather than a rule.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? October 18 AAPL: 117.47 -0.08 Opinion: After the iPhone 7 dropped the headphone jack, are we ready for the MacBook Pro’s ‘courage’ moment? Greg Barbosa - 4 weeks ago @gregbarbosa MacBook Pro USB-C MacBook Pro render View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Last night we received a report from Macotakara that the new MacBook Pros were still coming this month, despite a lack of any announcements from Apple. The reporting didn’t specify anything about the internal hardware specs, but did resurface the idea that MagSafe, Thunderbolt 2, and USB-A ports would be replaced. The thing for me is this: Apple just dropped the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and the reaction to that has been controversial to say the least. Apple explained that the move took courage and was needed to move from analog to digital, free up space in iPhones, and push wireless. There are no signs that this affected iPhone sales, but transitions are still hard. Headphone jack aside, if new MacBook Pros fully replace USB-A with USB-C, are we in for the next episode in the same series? We’ve already seen this with the 12-inch Retina MacBook’s single USB-C port, but it’s worth considering what it could mean for MacBook Pro users if true. I’m personally rocking a 2010 15″ MacBook Pro with a DIY Fusion Drive setup, and maxed out RAM. The only reason I’ve held out this long is because I haven’t had a desire or need for more out of my system these past few years. I haven’t picked up any USB 3.0 devices for personal everyday use, and I definitely haven’t gotten any USB-C devices (save for my Apple TV’s service port). I’m interested in USB-C, but just from keeping an eye out on the market, I haven’t seen many others in the Apple ecosystem pick up on it either aside from some 12-inch MacBook owners. If Apple really is replacing MagSafe, Thunderbolt 2, and USB-A, then consumers might have a hard time swallowing the USB-C pill. Outside the fact that pushing USB-C is going to create a standard in the market (which I’m actually in favor it), I don’t think USB-C has been around quite long enough in the Apple world that others are ready for it. Let’s break down the removal of these ports and what it means for Mac users. MagSafe I’ve been a fan of the MagSafe charging connector since day one. The idea of a cable that unleashes itself versus tugging the whole laptop down with it has saved my work setup on more than one occasion. When Apple introduced the 12-inch MacBook with a single USB-C port, I definitely thought that the removal of the MagSafe benefit would stick to the MacBook and head nowhere else. I wanted that MagSafe, I needed that MagSafe. I wasn’t alone either as Griffin put out their own version of a MagSafe into their BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable. While not a perfect solution, Chance did praise the ability to bring back the safety of a MagSafe-style adapter to single USB-C MacBooks.   I already have multiple MacBook Pro chargers I keep on hand for traveling, and the thought of buying multiple more sounds expensive. Though, I do have to concede that this really isn’t any different from when Apple moved from the 30-pin connectors to Lightning, it’s just potentially more financially painful. Removing this level of security, this extra comfort, all for the sake of an extra USB-C port just doesn’t seem great for my current perspective. The piece of mind that comes with a breakaway style connection seems so much better than the added benefit of an additional port. Perhaps Apple has found a way to mix MagSafe’s benefits with UBS-C, using the 12-inch MacBook as a test bed, but I wouldn’t count on it. USB-A Removing the USB-A connection would be equal parts painful and welcome. I liked using standard USB cables back in the Windows 98 days, but overtime it’s quickly felt clunky. We’ve even had smaller FireWire cables than USB-A cables. Moving to USB-C will be nice solely for the smaller connection and space it needs and occupies once plugged in. USB-C is also reversible so you don’t have to plug it in upside down before you realize it goes the other way. Bringing this into their flagship computers makes me think that Apple believes and wants this standard pushed across the entire market. While I support the idea, I don’t quite think everyone is ready yet. Not even Apple. Running a quick search on Apple’s own site shows a lackluster amount of USB-C products available for sale. Most of which seem to be additional cables, and then a smattering of adapters used to address the MacBook’s lack of other ports. In my thinking, the most common devices that consumers use that require USB cables are external hard drives, and even of those Apple only has four USB-C variants listed on their site. Apple’s choice to remove the headphone jack seemed more logical to me only because alternatives have existed for quite some time now. Bluetooth headphones are growing in popularity and finding something priced relatively low isn’t hard at all (just like with wired headphones, price often relates to quality). Apple included a Lightning to 3.5 mm Adapter with new iPhone 7 purchases so that definitely helped the transition a bit, but we haven’t heard if that’s the case with these new MacBook Pros. If Apple did choose to remove all these ports, are they going to provide multiple USB-A to USB-C adapters in the box? Maybe just one? Will Apple lower the price of that $19 USB-C dongle? If not I know Amazon already has two packs of USB-C adapters and a multitude of other USB-C accessories I can stock up on, but the transition period can’t end soon enough. Hopefully if Apple really does replace most of the ports on MacBook Pros with USB-C ports, it becomes more aggressive with marketing USB-C accessories and becomes a little more generous with UBS-C adapters than the current situation. Apple has added new USB-C accessories over time including the fairly new USB-C to Lightning cable, but the iPhone 7 appears to have just been released a little too early for it to make sense to include these in the box for new MacBooks. Transitions are hard, even for Apple.

No, really A cardboard desk? I won’t stand for it (actually I will) More like this Iot Smart Home Emergent Tech Internet of Things HomeKit is where the dearth is – no one wants Apple's IoT tech Is anyone buying it – figuratively or literally? 18 Oct 2016 at 19:18, Kieren McCarthy Kieren McCarthy Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Security , Iana, Icann, Fcc, Google Recent Articles Intel's new chip targets industrial IoT Samsung ties Thread into two new IoT Artik chips Benioff on being hacked: We're looking into some next-gen fax machines It's been four months since Apple half-launched its smart-home/internet-of-things service through the introduction of a new app in iOS 10 called "Home." At the time, we asked "where are the products?" and unfortunately it's a question we're still asking in the lead-up to what should be a holiday push for the smart home. One of the few companies to get on board with Apple's approach – in which you are required not only to register with the iPhone maker as a manufacturer but also use an Apple specified-chip and firmware – has been smart thermostat company Ecobee. This week, Ecobee launched a cut-down version of its main product, the Ecobee Lite, leaving out room sensors and motion detection to bring the price down from $249 to $169. But nowhere in its marketing materials is Apple's HomeKit mentioned, despite the extra effort and cost the company has to go to in order to work with the system. Under the tech specs, it doesn't even merit its own line, being bunched in with Amazon's Echo with the phrase: "Apple HomeKit and Amazon Echo Integration." This is not normal for any product that has jumped through Apple's hoops and goes to every length to stick an official Apple sticker on everything. The problem is that Apple is trying to do what it always does – control everything. It's our way or the highway. Except the Internet of Things is not the same as the computer or mobile phone market: Apple needs other companies more than they need it. Bang "HomeKit collides with the rest of the industry," Ed Hemphill, the CEO of WigWag, told us. WigWag is developing an open-source hub to work with just about every IoT and smart home device out there. Except Apple. "Their approach is just onerous and unnecessary," says Hemphill, referring to the need to include an Apple chip and go through its certification program. The upside of this is that Apple can set a high bar in terms of features, communications protocol support, and device security. The downside is that you have to use components provided by Apple. "And it's not compatible with Thread or ZigBee or Z-Wave," Hemphill adds. But even more damningly, he says that literally none of his customers are asking about it. And that's because right now, you can go buy products that work and are cheap and don't need HomeKit. All the big names on Apple's list of certified products – from Ecobee and Honeywell thermostats to August and Schlage door locks – work perfectly well without HomeKit. And they will all work with the larger IoT ecosystem once the industry figures out how to start working with one another. There are some compelling reasons for people to go the route of HomeKit and pull themselves into the Apple ecosystem. Or, at least, they were reasons. One is security. The whole reason Apple made the extraordinary decision to insist companies put its approved microcontroller inside their products was because, the company said, it was concerned about security. Security was, and remains, a top concern when it comes to IoT. And for good reason. The appalling lack of attention paid to software defenses in IoT products has been demonstrated again and again. With Apple's system, it has everything locked down. Crash But that concern is being rapidly addressed by the market. Google just launched a range of hardware aimed squarely at the smart-home market and it is working to massively increase standard security in products. Thread will also help with that. WigWag too is building new security features into its hub, and it is relying on the open-source community to scour code and fix bugs (hopefully better than it fared with OpenSSL and Bash). The Apple security advantage will likely be gone in 2017. It has two years to make the most of it and has simply not done so. One other big advantage to HomeKit is ease-of-use. Connecting new devices is fast, easy and secure. Other IoT devices often require slightly elaborate setup processes – connecting to your phone, then your phone handing off to your Wi-Fi. HomeKit requires a simple punch-in code and you're done. Except that advantage too is disappearing. Again, Google and WigWag now enable simple one-step setups. They're not the only ones. And lastly, HomeKit comes with Apple's trademark design and user interface pedigree and lets you run everything through a single app. Most smart home, IoT products come with their own app and the software varies wildly. Some apps are slow, clunky and prone to crashing. And of course they all have their own interface that you need to navigate. But this advantage is also under attack. As the market figures out how to start interacting with one another, the emergence of high-quality full-control apps is inevitable. And when they do, likely next year, they will be but a 30-second download away. Even more significantly, however, is the emergence of Amazon Echo and now Google Home. Every IoT manufacturer is racing to include voice control into their system; all the big ones already have. Apps themselves are increasingly becoming second choice when it comes to controlling smart home tech. Why whip out your phone and open an app when you can just call out to your digital assistant? Whallop And here's the thing: neither the Amazon Echo nor the Google Home will work with Apple's HomeKit. Apple has an uphill battle trying to impose the same constraints it put on iOS in the IoT market for the simple reason that IoT is first and foremost a hardware game. Without that physical thermostat, or lightbulb, or sensor, or power socket, or camera, or lock, the best software in the world can't do anything. HomeKit has already missed its big window of opportunity. What Apple does next will decide whether it survives at all. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 38 Comments More from The Register Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

Mr. Cook is on a list of potential running mates John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, presented before Tim Kaine was selected. Apple CEO Tim Cook was a potential Vice President choice for Hillary Clinton Mr. Cook’s name appeared along with Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and several others. The list was found in an email from Mr. Podesta to Mrs. Clinton posted by WikiLeaks. That email was sent in mid March, and by mid June the email trail says Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Cook were scheduling a one-on-one meeting. Fund raising specialist Lindsay Roitman told Mrs. Clinton in an email, “He’s supportive but new to this so I think we shouldn’t come on too strong.” In the end, Mrs. Clinton chose Mr. Kaine as her running mate, and it’s likely she never formally asked Mr. Cook to take on the Vice President role. He did, however, host a fund raising event for Mrs. Clinton in August. Still, the idea of Vice President Tim Cook is interesting. He’d have to give up his position as CEO of one of the world’s most valuable companies, and doesn’t have political experience. He’d also bring his strong support for equal rights and privacy to the White House at a time when the parts of the federal government have been pushing to strip away the protections encryption offers. Mr. Cook openly resisted a court order earlier this year compelling Apple to create a hackable version of iOS so the FBI and Department of Justice could hack into an iPhone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino holiday party mass shooting. The FBI claimed the hackable operating system was necessary for the investigation, but Mr. Cook said it would set dangerous precedent to force other tech companies to do the same. Apple saw the FBI’s demands as a real threat to personal privacy and online security, and was willing to go to court over refusing to comply with the order. The FBI eventually bought a hack from an unnamed company only to find there wasn’t any valuable information on the iPhone. Tim Cook and Apple have been championing digital privacy and security even as the DOJ and FBI continue to push for back doors into our encrypted information. Putting him in the second highest position in the federal government, as well as president of the Senate, would’ve made for some interesting closed door discussions.

The firm today announced an event at its Cupertino HQ on October 27th where it is expected to unveil a radical redesign of its MacBook laptop - and the traditional USB could be gone forever.  The firm announced the event in typically mysterious style, with an invite that read 'hello again'.  Scroll down for video  The event will take place at Apple's Cupertino HQ on October 27th, and is expected to see a range of new Macbook machines with a new 'smartkey' screen above the normal keyboard. WHAT ARE THE CLAIMS?  Macotakara claims Apple will debut a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month - and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether. The report suggests Apple is also eliminating the USB and its Megsafe connector, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The MacBook Pro could also have an OLED touch bar, which replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. Apple's dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro will feature a new 'thinner and lighter' design. A new report suggests the Cupertino company is set to eliminate the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro – and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether. However, it is also believed that Apple will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. The recent claims come from Macotakara, a Japanese publisher, which was one of the first sources to predict the death of the iPhone’s headphone jack. ‘According to information from a reliable Chinese supplier, Apple is planning to announce the new MacBook Pro within this month and will begin shipping out to retailers in October,’ reads the blog post. ‘There has also been rumors that they are going to cancel MacBook Air of the 11-inch model to focus on the 13-inch ones’. If the report is true, the new machines are expected to use metal injection molded hinges, have USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon set to take on the ISPs: Shopping giant developing...

Share this article Share 103 shares A new report suggests Apple is set to remove the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. Pictured is the MacBook Pro line Apple released in 2015 It is also designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks, and is being called ‘the only connector one will need across all devices,’ according to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group. However, this means users would have to charge their device through the USB-C port and connect peripherals through the Thunderbolt 3, reports Steve Dent with Engadget. possible oled touchpad for the function buttons in next macbook, as well as hella USB-C ports pic.twitter.com/MD4oCtIOSU— Sam Sheffer (@samsheffer) June 2, 2016 In the end, users will be forced to purchase their own USB 3.0 adapter.  It is also rumored that the MacBook Pro will have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. This rumor came from a reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities earlier this year. Macotakara , a Japanese publisher, also reveals Apple is killing off the 11-in MacBook altogether. However, the firm will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. Pictured are MacBook Pros Apple released in 2015 Kuo says Apple plans to introduce a dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro with a new 'thinner and lighter' design. It is expected to look similar to the slick and minimalist MacBook. APPLE’S PATENT REPLACES KEYBOARD WITH TOUCH SCREEN  A patent filed by Apple earlier this year shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be. The invention, dubbed a 'configurable, force-sensitive input structure for an electronic device,' looks similar to its 'Force Touch' trackpads. These trackpads use haptic technology which senses movement from a user's fingers on the surface. MacBook Pro might have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys. A patent filed by Apple this year (pictured) shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be located 'The trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and haptic feedback that provides a responsive and uniform feel,' Apple says. A tiny motor then vibrates to give the user feedback on what they are touching. The patent suggests similar technology laptop keyboard, a number pad, or a track pad. It claims 'micro-perforations' in the casing could light up to give the user an outline to where keys are on the flat keyboard. And the position of the haptic keys could also be customized.  The device will also include Touch ID support and a new OLED display touch bar above the keyboard. Kuo's report explains that the MacBook Pro updates are the 'brightest spot for Apple's 2016 rollouts' and was the first to mention 13-inch and 15-inch models.    Read more: Apple may ditch traditional USB ports on the MacBook Pro 次期MacBook Pro、10月末に出荷開始？ | Rumor | Macお宝鑑定団 blog（羅針盤） Apple plans to launch new Macs at an October 27 event - Recode Share or comment on this article e-mail 103 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

New Masters of the Universe Toys Announced It Turns Out Rats Are Actually Ticklish Gear Up For Final Fantasy XV With This Final Fantasy Gift Guide More Tech New MacBook Pro Expected to Ditch MagSafe and Old USB Ports By Lee Mathews 10.18.2016 :: 8:33AM EST Apple isn’t afraid to ditch time-tested technology in the name of progress. They just did it when they launched the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack, and they might do it again with the new MacBook Pro models. You’ll find a number of different ports on Apple’s current machines. There’s a headphone jack, USB port, dual Thunderbolt 2 ports, and the MagSafe port for charging on the left side. On the right, there’s another USB port and an HDMI output. Now, it’s been a long, long time since Apple refreshed the MacBook Pro. According to Japanese site Macotakara, an update is finally on the way and it’s going to dramatically change the Pro’s port layout. Yes, the headphone jack is gone. They’re also reportedly ditching everything except USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. If that happens, outputting to an external display will require either a USB-C to HDMI adapter or a monitor that sports a Thunderbolt input. Apple will happily sell you both those things, of course, and there are plenty of other companies that will, too. The change also means that you’ll be charging the new MacBook Pro via a USB type-C cable. They made the same change when they introduced the refreshed MacBook last year. While that does mean that you won’t need a USB hub to plug in a peripheral while you charge like a MacBook owner, you probably will need USB to USB-C adapters to hook up your existing accessories. Fortunately those are fairly cheap. You can pick up a two pack for nine or ten bucks on Amazon.

Rumor has it that Apple may get rid of the USB 3.0 port and the Magsafe port (where the charger plugs in) on the next generation of MacBooks. Japanese tech site Macotakara, which accurately predicted that Apple would kill the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, now also claims that the USB port is on the way out. The move would be similar to Apple's latest 12-inch MacBook and its streamlined profile. There's also word that Apple may discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air to focus instead on the 13-inch laptop. Discontinuing the 11-inch MacBook Air would also potentially boost sales on the 12-inch MacBook. If these rumors are in fact true, then the new MacBooks will have only a USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports. Both of these ports are about the size of the part of an iPhone charger that plugs into the phone. But since most laptop accessories still plug in via the USB port, Apple owners might have to use an adaptor, or upgrade their technology. Meanwhile, the new MacBooks would likely be charged through the USB-C port or Thunderbolt 3 port. Currently, Apple already sells a USB-C dock with other USB and HDMI ports for $79. The USB-C port uses USB 3.1 Standard, according to PCWorld, which will connect to a wide variety of accessories, such as external hard drives, cameras, and printers. The USB 3.1 can also transfer data between the host computer and the peripheral accessories at a speed of 10 gigabits per second, which is twice as fast as the USB 3.0. Macotakara also hinted that Apple would reveal the new MacBook Pro later in October, including 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch models. The new MacBook Pro may also have an OLED (organic light-emitting diode, or a lighting panel) touch bar above the keyboard, which could replace the physical function keys and add more flexibility. However, as Engadget reports, Macotakara had released similar information in June about the OLED touch bar launching in August, and that never happened. The Inquirer reports that the new MacBooks could launch as soon as October 27. While all these developments are currently just speculations, it will be interesting to watch how Apple products change, and how we're forced to adapt—literally and figuratively.

(Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: October 18, 2016 at 10:25 am | UPDATED: October 24, 2016 at 10:06 pm There’s long been a great sloshing back-and-forth of talent between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. The San Francisco Bay Area ships out tech digerati to help the government fix its problems while the Capital spits back out its seasoned strategists who then come west to help companies like Apple and Uber play better ball with the lawmakers back east. Now comes word from an email supposedly stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta and leaked by WikiLeaks that the presidential candidate once had her eyes on some of the tech world’s shining stars, starting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In the email, which was dispatched at 5:21 p.m. on March 17, 2016, Podesta broke down a list of possible candidates for the Veep job, breaking the names down into “rough food groups.” These folks, he wrote, were a “first cut of people to consider for VP.” The email went to hdr29@hrcoffice.com, which is reportedly a good place to reach Hillary these days. The “first cut” list also included Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and an assortment of top-drawer names broken down apparently by race, gender, political personality and other categories. And there, sitting at number four in the alphabetically arranged group of the tech food group, was Cook. (Apple said Tuesday morning it had no comment.) In the email, which you can read here, Podesta congratulates Clinton on “a fabulous night” and then tells her he’s ready to “get back to the longer term again,” apparently referring to the find-a-good-veep project. He said he was working with legal staff to “get prepared to execute non-disclosure agreements with anyone we involve in the process. We put together the attached notional teams of “report writers” (confidential profiles/public record vet) and “vettors” (deep-dive/oppo-book), and want to run it by you before we execute on the list. “Let me know,” he wrote, “if there are people you would like to see added or removed before we begin the process.” And he said he and his staffers also “did a first cut of people to consider for VP. I have organized names in rough food groups:” Here’s the list, separated by others of like mind or like gender (the first batch) or like whatever: Tammy Baldwin Kirsten Gillibrand Amy Klobuchar Claire McKaskill Jeanne Shaheen Debbie Stabenow Elizabeth Warren Michael Bennet Sherrod Brown Martin Heinreich Tim Kaine Terry McAuliffe Chris Murphy Tom Vilsack Steve Benjamin Corey Booker Andrew Gillum Eric Holder Deval Patrick Kasim Reed Anthony Foxx John Allen Bill McCraven Mike Mullen Mary Barra Michael Bloomberg Ursula Burns Tim Cook Bill Gates Melinda Gates Muhtar Kent Judith Rodin Howard Schultz And last but certainly not least, there was one more veep candidate that Podesta wanted his boss to consider, a guy so cool he had his very own food group all to himself: Bernie Sanders   Tags:  Apple,  Elections,  Presidential Election Patrick May Patrick May is an award-winning writer for the Bay Area News Group working with the business desk as a general assignment reporter.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 18, 2016 at 12:56PM Image source: Getty.  Over on Seeking Alpha (free membership required), contributor Nikhil Gupta offered up some commentary around a recent article in Nikkei, particularly as it relates to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) display sourcing plans. The Nikkei piece said that Foxconn and Sharp, the former having recently taken a large equity stake in the latter, will begin mass production of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, displays for smartphones in 2019. Current Apple iPhones use liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, but the iDevice maker is expected to be actively working to make sure the technology and supplier infrastructure is in place for a transition to OLED displays. Apple is expected to adopt OLED technology on a premium model that sits above the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus model in the company's 2017 product lineup, per a previous report from Nikkei.  So what does this have to do with Gupta's comments? In his article, he argues that "with the recent fiasco of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, and with reasons still unknown, Apple would not risk procuring OLED displays from Samsung." The implication, then, is that if Apple has to wait for Foxconn and Sharp to get their act together in OLEDs, Apple's plans to release a premium iPhone next year with an OLED display may be in tatters. That's not going to happen; here's why.  Displays don't explode It's very likely that the Galaxy Note7's issues are, in some way, related to the batteries inside. After all, it is the batteries that are exploding. The problem may not be due to faulty battery packs themselves, but perhaps there is an issue with the design of the phone and how it interacts with the battery that caused those problems. I don't think it's reasonable to blame the display itself. Using Samsung-built displays should be fine The reality of the situation is that Samsung Display is one of the only companies, if not the only one, capable of building OLED displays that can be used in high-volume smartphones today. Even LG, a major manufacturer of displays, still uses LCDs in its flagship smartphones -- though LG Display (NYSE:LPL) is reportedly making significant investments to enable a shift to flexible OLEDs at some point. Not only should Apple be fine with using Samsung-built OLED displays, but if Apple wants to ship an iPhone with an OLED display during the second half of 2017, it might not have any choice but to source -- at least initially -- from Samsung. Apple won't be tied to Samsung forever, though Apple is unlikely to be happy to be tied to Samsung for too long, particularly given that the two companies are fierce competitors in the world of smartphones. The iDevice maker is surely going to work to enable other display manufactures, such as Foxconn/Sharp, as well as longtime LCD supplier Japan Display, to become important OLED display suppliers over time. Indeed, it's pretty telling that Apple reportedly plans on only adopting a curved OLED display in a single ultra-premium model rather than across the board. With so few viable suppliers of mobile OLED displays today, the prices that Samsung can charge are likely substantially higher than what Apple's mobile LCD suppliers can. This means that from both a margin perspective, as well as simply a supply availability perspective, Apple probably can't transition its entire iPhone lineup to OLEDs until later on. Once all of the major mobile display vendors are able to successfully produce mobile OLEDs to Apple's specifications, pricing on mobile OLEDs should come down -- a positive for display buyers such as Apple and a potential negative for Samsung's mobile OLED margins and/or share at Apple for the longer term -- though the market opportunity is likely to be much larger as the supplier base grows.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Sues Mobile Star for Selling Counterfeit Power Adapters and Charging Cables through Amazon | Main | Samsung's Engineers Keep Pounding Out New Form Factors for Future Bendable Smartphones Looking for a Winner » October 18, 2016 Apple's watchOS is now a Registered Trademark and Apple may be Rethinking the iPod Nano Watch   Last week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published two of Apple's latest registered trademarks (RTM) for "watchOS." The first RTM was filed under International Class 9 that basically covers hardware while the second RTM filed under International Class 42 covers programming and software systems. While rummaging through various IP sites around the world this morning I stumbled on an Apple filing made in Hong Kong on September 30, 2016 for 'iPod' and thought it was probably just a renewal application. But it wasn't and the single classification that it was filed under wasn't the traditional class 9 for hardware but rather class 14 for watches. Why would Apple be filing for this class at this point in the iPod's history?   The iPod watch craze has long past. It took off around 2011 and then died off. Our cover graphic acts as a reminder of the nano watch craze of the time and the colorful bands that were available. The band actually looks like Apple's watch sport.    Sometimes there's no rhyme or reason as to why Apple files for a trademark under odd classifications and descriptions that could wildly cover such things as electric socks that hold no connection to an Apple product whatsoever. However, in this case, it was filed purposely under a single class specifically focused on watches. There is no chance for a mistake. Of course it may just be a just-in-case scenario that Apple wants protection for and it goes no further – or Apple could be seriously rethinking the iPod nano watch as an entry watch line that they could be jazzed up with colorful bands with emphasis on music.   For now, it's something interesting to keep in mind just in case Apple pulls off a surprise with this down the road. Below is the iPod application in-part from the Hong Kong Patent Office for 'iPod.'   Apple's Hong Kong filing for 'iPod' was made under International Class 14 which covers the following: "Horological and chronometric instruments; watches; clocks; timepieces; chronographs for use as timepieces; chronometers; watchstraps; watch bands; cases for watches, clocks, and horological and chronometric instruments; parts for watches, clocks, and horological and chronometric instruments; and jewelry."   Apple's RTM Certificate for 'watchOS'   Apple's First Registered Trademark Certificate 5,061,202 for watchOS is covered by International Class 9 which covers the following: "Computers; computer peripheral devices; sound recording and reproducing apparatus; MP3 and other digital format audio players; global positioning system (GPS) devices; wireless communication devices for voice, data or image transmission; computer software; computer and electronic games."   Apple's Second Registered Trademark Certificate 5,061,203 for watchOS is covered by International Class 42 which covers the following: "Computer programming; design and development of computer hardware and software; computer hardware and software consulting services; support and consultation services for developing computer systems, databases and applications; providing computer hardware or software information online; providing online non-downloadable software; information, advisory and consultancy services relating to all the aforesaid."   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Apple’s mobile payment service launched two years ago with hundreds of additional regional banks and credit unions added every few weeks. You can find the latest banks added below: BankLiberty CinFed Credit Union Cumberland County Federal Credit Union Denmark State Bank Family Security Credit Union Franklin Savings Bank Gates Chili Federal Credit Union Great River Federal Credit Union Greenfield Banking Company Heritage Community Credit Union Labette Bank Lake Trust Credit Union Michigan Educational Credit Union Natco Credit Union Neches Federal Credit Union Old Point National Bank Peach State Bank & Trust Pioneer Bank (both New Mexico and New York now) River City Bank Saco & Biddeford Savings Institution SELCO Community Credit Union Shell Federal Credit Union Shrewsbury Federal Credit Union The Mission Bank Since launching in the United States, Apple Pay has expanded to Canada, France, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Singapore. Apple Pay lets you make purchases in supported stores using your iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple Pay can also be used to make purchases in supported apps on iPhone and iPad. Here’s how to setup Apple Pay if your bank is supported (full list): On the iPhone, just head to the Wallet app on iOS 9 or later and tap the plus (+) icon in the top right corner to begin, then follow the prompts. To add a debit card to the Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on iPhone and look for the Wallet & Apple Pay section, then Add Credit or Debit Card section. iPads with Touch ID can use Apple Pay in apps; go to Settings then Wallet & Apple Pay to add your card there. If you’re looking for places to test out Apple Pay, Exxon Mobile added support for buying gas with Apple Pay through its SpeedPass+ app earlier this year. Stores like the Apple Store, Best Buy, Whole Foods, and Walgreens all accept Apple Pay as payment at checkout, and McDonalds, Subway, Starbucks and many restaurants through OpenTable accept Apple Pay payments as well. Apple also has a list of official partners here, and anywhere with the contactless payment logo at checkout should accept Apple Pay. Some stubborn retailers like CVS are still resisting Apple Pay in favor of their own solution despite having upgraded terminals, and Walmart has rolled out its own alternative while avoiding NFC terminal expenses. Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus; all Apple Watches; iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, and both iPad Pro models. Macs can also now use Apple Pay with macOS Sierra. Guides Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

By Erik Eckel | October 18, 2016, 9:30 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus This streetcar image was shot in bright sunlight that threatened to wash out colors, particularly the sky and treetops. HDR exposure assistance and a quick edit using MacPhun's Filters for Photos helped punch up the colors while preventing the image from appearing too bright. Image: Erik Eckel/TechRepublic You don't need to be a professional photographer to create professional images using an iOS device and a Mac. HDR (high-dynamic range) photographs, which are supported by Apple iPhones, iPads, and Macs, make it easier for amateurs to close photography knowledge gaps and produce compelling images for marketing, public relations, advertising, and similar purposes. According to Apple, HDR works by blending the best parts of three separate exposures into a single photo (the under- and over-exposed versions, which tend to be too dark or too bright, are discarded). Because HDR photos collect multiple images possessing multiple exposures simultaneously, it's easier for non-professional photographers to perform minor edits and create professional images. SEE: PhotoBulk simplifies bulk image editing chores for Mac users Confirm your iOS 10 device is configured to take HDR photos by opening Camera, selecting Photo, and tapping HDR from the top menu. Auto is typically the default setting, meaning the iPhone will automatically take HDR photos when capturing images, if the circumstances are appropriate. You can choose On or Off to enable or disable the feature, respectively.

Subscribe to TechRepublic's Tech News You Can Use newsletter Some users prefer to also store non-HDR, or normal, images that don't collect additional HDR information. You can confirm your iOS device's configuration by going to Settings, selecting Photos & Camera, and confirming Keep Normal Photo is enabled, in which case the iOS device will record both normal and HDR images when taking a picture. Subsequently, photographs taken using the HDR technology are stored on the device, and within macOS Sierra's Photos application (if you leverage iCloud photo sharing), with a small HDR icon in the upper right corner. HDR photos, when opened on an iOS 10 device, will show the HDR label in the upper left corner. Multiple applications and utilities are available to further edit HDR photos, thereby enabling amateurs to better manipulate shadows, contrast, highlights, clouds and sky elements, and similar components without compromising the entire image's exposure balance. For example, Mac users can open HDR images within macOS Sierra's Photos application. To do so, double-click an HDR image within Photos and click the Edit Photo icon (it resembles three horizontal slide bars) to edit the image as you would another photo. Click the Adjust icon to change the image's color and light. Note: You can also click the Add link from the Adjustments menu to add additional color and lighting adjustment menus and tools, including White Balance, Levels, and Histogram. Photos users can leverage properly configured and compatible Extensions using the Extensions icon (it resembles three circled dots). Clicking a corresponding extension should enable leveraging that program's image-editing features within Photos. I purchased and installed the MacPhun apps Tonality ($24.99), Filters for Photos (free), and Intensify ($9.99), which can all be integrated and used within Photos to manipulate HDR images and photos. One option for enabling Photos to use third-party extensions is to click Photo's Share icon from the application's menu bar, click the More icon, and select All (All third-party extensions). Check the box for HDR- and photo-editing compatible installed applications to enable those programs to interact with Photos. Alternatively, you can open System Preferences and select the Extensions app to open the same configuration window. MacPhun has recently introduced an upgraded version of its Aurora HDR 2017 for Mac program. The $99 program (which is currently available for $89.99 from the Apple Store) provides a powerful HDR-specific editing utility that just earned N-Photo magazine's Best On Test rating (for version 1.2.3). Numerous other options are available for editing HDR files on a Mac. Choices include Adobe Photoshop (multiple pricing options exist), Adobe Lightroom (multiple pricing options exist), easyHDR 3 ($39 home license; $65 commercial license), Google HDR Efex Pro (free), HDR Darkroom 3 ($89), and Photomatix Pro 5.1.3 for Mac ($99).

Yet it's still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch "XL" edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google's online store. I tested the Pixel XL model; the regular version has identical features except for its smaller display and battery — still enough for 13 hours of internet use, according to Google. With either, you get an excellent camera and a strong voice assistant that promises to get smarter — all without the bloat common with other Android phones. This Sunday, Oct. 16, 2016, photo taken with Google's Pixel XL smartphone shows a reservoir at New York's Central Park. With Pixel's camera, image quality is superb, though photo purists may quibble. Colors look strong and clean, as though they¿ve been processed with software. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) The Pixel isn't quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe ; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 . ___ THE CAMERA The Pixel's image quality is superb — though purists may quibble. Colors in some shots look too strong and clean to me, thanks to software processing intended to reduce distortion and improve detail (something all phones do to some extent). But automation pays off in another way: The Pixel will automatically combine successive shots into an animated "GIF" file, offering a fun way to share a toddler's steps or a dog jumping. For video, the Pixel's stabilization technology compensates for shaky hands and other movement, matching what the iPhone and Galaxy phones can do. The Pixel borrows a quick-launch feature from Samsung phones. Just double tap the power button to start the camera, even if the phone is locked. To switch between the front and rear cameras, just double twist the phone like a door knob — a feature Motorola, which Google once owned, has long offered. Low-light images taken with the Pixel in three museums aren't as crisp as those from the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7 (which has the same camera as the Note 7). But differences are small, and the Pixel does better than typical smartphones. Where the Pixel falls short is in extreme close-ups, such as shooting a flower petal or a small bug; photos were typically blurry. The Pixel's selfie camera is also inferior, with no front flash or control over the focus. But it's fine in good light and at typical distances for selfies. ___ THE ASSISTANT Google's voice assistant, simply known as Google Assistant, will seem familiar to those who have used Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa features. Google's version goes further in offering daily updates such as weather and news, though plenty of apps already offer similar capabilities through notifications. Google is also better at remembering preferences — say, if you prefer temperatures in Celsius — and at integrating with its own services, such as Translate and Photos. But Assistant doesn't yet sync with a similar Assistant in Google's Allo chat app and upcoming Home speaker. And it isn't as proactive as the Google Now assistant already built into Android phones. Google Now, for instance, will look through your Gmail account for flight reservations and remind you when to head to the airport. It will analyze your daily commute and warn of delays. Assistant waits for you to ask. Assistant holds up well compared with Siri and Alexa, but for more, swipe from left to right to get the old Google Now back. Google says Assistant will eventually get the Google Now functionality. ___ OTHER FEATURES If you need help, you can reach Google's customer support and enable screen sharing reminiscent of Amazon's Mayday help feature. And the Pixel will work with Google's upcoming Daydream View virtual-reality headset, much as Samsung phones have Samsung's Gear VR. Long-pressing an app icon brings up a menu of shortcuts, such as getting directions to home or launching the selfie camera. It's similar to the iPhone's 3D Touch. The Pixel also offers "Night Light," a feature that tints your screen amber by filtering out blue light that might keep you up at night. Apple calls it Night Shift. Pixel owners get unlimited storage of photos at original resolution, though that's a little like offering Google search for free. Google Photos already offers unlimited storage at up to 16 megapixels; the Pixel's camera is 12 megapixels. The free offer will make a difference for those who take video in ultra-sharp "4k" resolution, but the default setting is lower, at 1080p, which is already free at Google Photos. ___ WHAT'S MISSING The Pixel will be OK if you spray it with water, but don't drop it in the pool. You also can't expand its storage with a memory card, as you can with the S7 and Note 7 — though for $100 more, the Pixel's 32 gigabytes of storage quadruples to 128 gigabytes, and the free online storage should take care of your photos and videos. The battery isn't removable, though that's true for most phones these days. Those looking for a Note 7 replacement will find the Pixel missing a stylus. If you're an iPhone user, you'll have to brace yourself for the switch to Android, which would entail buying new apps and learning new ways to navigate. ___ MAKING THE SWITCH Google tries to make it easy to switch. The phone comes with a transfer cable, and the set-up process walks you through transferring photos, music and video, as long as it's not encrypted (so scratch iTunes video). But apps won't switch over from iPhones; you need to buy them again.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161018006400/en/ MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) technology is utilized to produce microphones used in laptops, hearing aids, wearables and smartphones among many other products. Last year, MEMS microphones remained the healthiest sensors segment for suppliers, in terms of unit volume and revenue, said Marwan Boustany, senior analyst for IHS Technology. “Our updated analysis of 2015 MEMS microphone supplier market share, shows that Knowles remained the dominant supplier with more than two times the units and revenue of the second-place supplier, Goertek,” Boustany said. “In addition to offering a wide range of analog and digital output microphones for many applications, Knowles has also started shipping its VoiceIQ ‘intelligent’ microphones with local processing as it seeks to address both mobile and IOT applications.” Strong growth for MEMS’ runner-ups Goertek MEMS microphone units grew by an impressive 104 percent CAGR between 2011 and 2015, thanks in large part to its design wins in Apple, the IHS Markit analysis shows. Apple accounts for approximately 70 percent (in units) of Goertek’s MEMS microphone business in 2015. Goertek entered in large volume in the iPhone in 2014 and has since continued to increase its share; this has had the impact of reducing the share of AAC and Knowles in subsequent years. While still solidly in third position among packaged MEMS suppliers after Goertek, AAC has faced challenges from Goertek in both Apple and in Chinese OEMs. This has resulted in a reduction in unit volume shipped by AAC in 2015 of almost 9 percent, IHS Markit says. However, AAC invested in a new technology for MEMS microphones in 2016 when it officially partnered with Vesper MEMS, a piezoelectric MEMS microphone start-up. Boosting audio performance in handsets The general adoption trend for microphones in smartphones has been towards higher performance, IHS Markit says. Driving this trend: OEMs want better quality audio for calls and hand-free communication, noise cancellation, voice recognition such as Siri and Google Now, as well as the availability of lower-cost microphones due to the erosion of ASP (average selling price). “These types of use cases also drive high-performance microphone adoption in smart watches, tablets, noise cancelling earphones, hearing aids and increasingly in automotive cabins,” Boustany said. Beyond performance, the average number of microphones per handset increased in 2015 due to Apple adopting four microphones in its iPhone 6S, with most other OEMs using two or three microphones in their mid- to high-end smartphones, the IHS Markit analysis shows. In tablets, smart watches and hearing aids, the number of microphones is between one and two. Adoption of microphones in automotive cabins can potentially exceed eight, depending on use cases and implementation choices in the future. Knowles tops list for die makers, too According to the IHS Technology analysis, Knowles – which produces its own microphone dies – holds the number one spot for market share in MEMS microphone production, with a dominant 43 percent market share. Infineon acts as the major supplier of MEMS microphone dies to Goertek, AAC and BSE among others and stands solidly in second place with a 31 percent market share. In third place is Omron, which has supplied into STMicroelectronics, ACC and Goertek among others and has a 13 percent market share, the analysis shows. Neither Infineon nor Omron supply fully packaged MEMS microphone die.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Tim Cook for Veep? Hillary Clinton was reportedly considering it By Patrick May / October 18, 2016 at 8:20 AM There’s long been a great sloshing back-and-forth of talent between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. The San Francisco Bay Area ships out tech digerati to help the government fix its problems while the Capital spits back out its seasoned strategists who then come west to help companies like Apple and Uber play better ball with the lawmakers back east. Now comes word from an email supposedly stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta and leaked by WikiLeaks that the presidential candidate once had her eyes on some of the tech world’s shining stars, starting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In the email, which was dispatched at 5:21 p.m. on March 17, 2016, Podesta broke down a list of possible candidates for the Veep job, breaking the names down into “rough food groups.” These folks, he wrote, were a “first cut of people to consider for VP.” The email went to hdr29@hrcoffice.com, which is reportedly a good place to reach Hillary these days. The “first cut” list also included Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and an assortment of top-drawer names broken down apparently by race, gender, political personality and other categories. And there, sitting at number four in the alphabetically arranged group of the tech food group, was Cook. (Apple said Tuesday morning it had no comment.) In the email, which you can read here, Podesta congratulates Clinton on “a fabulous night” and then tells her he’s ready to “get back to the longer term again,” apparently referring to the find-a-good-veep project. He said he was working with legal staff to “get prepared to execute non-disclosure agreements with anyone we involve in the process. We put together the attached notional teams of “report writers” (confidential profiles/public record vet) and “vettors” (deep-dive/oppo-book), and want to run it by you before we execute on the list. “Let me know,” he wrote, “if there are people you would like to see added or removed before we begin the process.” And he said he and his staffers also “did a first cut of people to consider for VP. I have organized names in rough food groups:” Here’s the list, separated by others of like mind or like gender (the first batch) or like whatever: Tammy Baldwin Kirsten Gillibrand Amy Klobuchar Claire McKaskill Jeanne Shaheen Debbie Stabenow Elizabeth Warren Michael Bennet Sherrod Brown Martin Heinreich Tim Kaine Terry McAuliffe Chris Murphy Tom Vilsack Steve Benjamin Corey Booker Andrew Gillum Eric Holder Deval Patrick Kasim Reed Anthony Foxx John Allen Bill McCraven Mike Mullen Mary Barra Michael Bloomberg Ursula Burns Tim Cook Bill Gates Melinda Gates Muhtar Kent Judith Rodin Howard Schultz And last but certainly not least, there was one more veep candidate that Podesta wanted his boss to consider, a guy so cool he had his very own food group all to himself: Bernie Sanders Photo: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an Apple event in San Francisco in 2015.

Perfect pick for the funeral attender in chief. darkfinger It stuns me that anyone would think that Cook would even consider a thankless job like that. Cheap & Nothing Wasted There are still far too many people that would have instantly opposed her for picking a gay man.

In 2015, the global OTT devices and services market was valued at USD 26.87 billion, and it will reach USD 68.55 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of close to 21% during the forecast period. "One of the major factors influencing the rapid growth and increased adoption of OTT services is the decreased cost of data transfer in the form of IP packets instead of traditional and more expensive voice calls and SMS," says Ujjwal Doshi, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on computer devices Competitive vendor landscape The global OTT devices and services market is highly fragmented as it comprises many vendors, both international and domestic. With international players increasing their presence in many regions, domestic vendors are finding it difficult to compete with them in terms of quality, features, safety, and price.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161018006400/en/ MEMS Microphone revenue of the top 10 suppliers in 2015. Source: IHS Markit (Graphic: Business Wire) MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) technology is utilized to produce microphones used in laptops, hearing aids, wearables and smartphones among many other products. Last year, MEMS microphones remained the healthiest sensors segment for suppliers, in terms of unit volume and revenue, said Marwan Boustany, senior analyst for IHS Technology. "Our updated analysis of 2015 MEMS microphone supplier market share, shows that Knowles remained the dominant supplier with more than two times the units and revenue of the second-place supplier, Goertek," Boustany said. "In addition to offering a wide range of analog and digital output microphones for many applications, Knowles has also started shipping its VoiceIQ 'intelligent' microphones with local processing as it seeks to address both mobile and IOT applications." Strong growth for MEMS' runner-ups Goertek MEMS microphone units grew by an impressive 104 percent CAGR between 2011 and 2015, thanks in large part to its design wins in Apple, the IHS Markit analysis shows. Apple accounts for approximately 70 percent (in units) of Goertek's MEMS microphone business in 2015. Goertek entered in large volume in the iPhone in 2014 and has since continued to increase its share; this has had the impact of reducing the share of AAC and Knowles in subsequent years. While still solidly in third position among packaged MEMS suppliers after Goertek, AAC has faced challenges from Goertek in both Apple and in Chinese OEMs. This has resulted in a reduction in unit volume shipped by AAC in 2015 of almost 9 percent, IHS Markit says. However, AAC invested in a new technology for MEMS microphones in 2016 when it officially partnered with Vesper MEMS, a piezoelectric MEMS microphone start-up. Boosting audio performance in handsets The general adoption trend for microphones in smartphones has been towards higher performance, IHS Markit says. Driving this trend: OEMs want better quality audio for calls and hand-free communication, noise cancellation, voice recognition such as Siri and Google Now, as well as the availability of lower-cost microphones due to the erosion of ASP (average selling price). "These types of use cases also drive high-performance microphone adoption in smart watches, tablets, noise cancelling earphones, hearing aids and increasingly in automotive cabins," Boustany said. Beyond performance, the average number of microphones per handset increased in 2015 due to Apple adopting four microphones in its iPhone 6S, with most other OEMs using two or three microphones in their mid- to high-end smartphones, the IHS Markit analysis shows. In tablets, smart watches and hearing aids, the number of microphones is between one and two. Adoption of microphones in automotive cabins can potentially exceed eight, depending on use cases and implementation choices in the future. Knowles tops list for die makers, too According to the IHS Technology analysis, Knowles which produces its own microphone dies holds the number one spot for market share in MEMS microphone production, with a dominant 43 percent market share. Infineon acts as the major supplier of MEMS microphone dies to Goertek, AAC and BSE among others and stands solidly in second place with a 31 percent market share. In third place is Omron, which has supplied into STMicroelectronics, ACC and Goertek among others and has a 13 percent market share, the analysis shows. Neither Infineon nor Omron supply fully packaged MEMS microphone die.

Newsletter Signup WebProNews Navigation Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search CEO Tim Cook Pushes Cashless Society and Predicts AI in all Apple Products WebProNews10.18.2016Technology Share this Post Apple CEO Tim Cook recently visited Japan for the opening of their state-of-the-art research and development facility. He described it as a "center for deep engineering that will be very different from the R&D base Apple plans to build in China." "I cannot tell you the specifics," Apple CEO Tim Cook told Nikkei Asian Review while riding on a bullet train in Japan. "The specific work is very different." According to the report Cook is seeking to integrate artificial intelligence into all of their product offerings including presumably the iPhone. "AI is horizontal in nature, running across all products and is used in ways that most people don't even think about." "We want the AI to increase your battery life and recommend music to Apple Music subscribers," he said. "AI could (even) help you remember where you parked your car." "Smartphones are 9 years old," he said. "We are not even teenagers yet. We just got going. I think there is an incredible future ahead." Apple Seeks to Promote Cashless Society Apple's CEO sees Apple Pay as the beginning of the end of cash worldwide. "We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system," said Cook. "We don't think the consumer particularly likes cash." Likely, Cook is talking about what everyone predicts, we are on a course toward a cashless society over the next 20-40 years and Apple would like to be a leader in making that happen. Cook said Apple intends to increase their push into mobile payments in Japan and all of Asian, with Apple Pay finally coming to Japan later this month. The iPhone 7 will become their first mobile phone to work with Japan's FeliCa contactless payment system. "Japan is important to us," said Cook. "FeliCa was born in Japan and so by extension, FeliCa is important." Of course, it's not the first time that Tim Cook has predicted the end of cash. "Your kids will not know what money is," Cook told students at Trinity College in Dublin last year.

Henne Oct 18, 2016 9:08 AM Share Tweet Bloomberg is reporting that Apple has scaled back its plans for developing a self-driving car. Codenamed Project Titan, the company’s push to enter the car market goes back to 2014. Apple has amassed a dedicated facility, assembled over 1,000 employees to the project, and even recruited the leadership of former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky. Zadesky departed Apple back in January as frictions over strategic direction escalated. Most employees in the Titan program are either being reassigned or leaving the company, as Apple shifts from delivering a complete car to designing an autonomous system. In other words, by focusing on the brains of a smart car, Apple is free to partner with a traditional automobile company. But whether or not we get to plug our sleek, perfectly designed crossover SUV into an Apple lightning port remains to be seen. Part of the strategic shift includes a deadline; the new group has a year to demonstrate a minimum viable project, or some evidence that getting in the car business is valuable. At which point, Apple’s senior management will decide whether to schedule an appointment at the Genius Bar, or call AAA to have the whole venture towed to the proverbial scrapyard. Apple is far from the only company facing challenges in the automotive industry. Google has had to modify its own self-driving vehicle ambitions and embrace partnerships. While it’s been less than three years since Project Titan’s conception, recent disrupting pressures have been transforming the automotive industry, with companies like Ford trying to rebrand themselves as “mobility companies.” As self-driving and ride-sharing trends continue to grow, and with companies like Uber and Tesla owning the driver behavioral data needed to build rich, AI-powered car systems, companies like Apple and Google need to reassess their own first-mover advantages in a rapidly evolving market.

Is this a leaked new model for the company's smartwatch line, or is it just confusion on the names of its products?  ( Apple ) Advertisement Reports have come in about references made in certain parts of the Apple website to a mysterious Apple Watch Victory, spawning rumors that there might be a new Apple Watch model coming soon. The mentions of the device were found in an AppleCare+ support page for the United Arab Emirates, as warranty options were presented for the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Victory. References to the Apple Watch Victory have since been taken down by Apple, but not before rumors that the company will soon launch a new Apple Watch model surfaced. These rumors were quickly shot down though, as when comparisons were made with AppleCare+ support pages for other countries, the devices listed were the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Nike+. It is highly likely that the Apple Watch Victory name is nothing more than a codename or an alternate name that Apple was thinking of for the smartwatch collaboration with Nike. The Victory name aligns with Nike, as Nike is the goddess of victory in Greek mythology. The appearance of the Apple Watch Victory name on the company's website is possibly due to an error within Apple's website development team, with the old name used instead of the unveiled Apple Watch Nike+. Still, it provides a glimpse into Apple's process of branding its products, with a name that the company may have considered but decided not to use. The Apple Watch Nike+ is a special edition of the Apple Watch Series 2 that will be released on Oct. 28. Designed for health and fitness-minded users, Nike has created special software for the smartwatch that will power it alongside Apple's watchOS 3. Apps for regular Apple Watch models will be compatible with the Apple Watch Nike+, which will feature the Nike+ Run Club app that tracks runs and sets reminders for running activities, along with special Nike-themed watch faces. The Apple Watch model will also come with a flexible perforated wristband designed for breathability while the wearer sweats from running. The Apple Watch Nike+ will come with 38mm and 42mm models, and can now be preordered for $369 and $399, respectively. The release of the Apple Watch Nike+ could be part of Apple's strategy to try to prevent the expected lower sales for the smartwatch this year. Famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities expects sales figures of between 8.5 million units and 9 million units for the Apple Watch this year, compared with the previous expectation of between 10 million units and 10.5 million units.

It named a series of powerful figures from Silicon Valley - including Tim Cook and Bill Gates - retired generals and other non-politicians, such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks. Offering some insight into who will be seen in a Clinton White House for appointments or advisory roles, it suggested she consider a series of African-American and Hispanic mayors and other officials.  Eventually the campaign opted for Tim Kaine.  Scroll down for video   Hillary Clinton was initially vetting 39 people to be her veep, a list that included a number of top business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (left) and Microsoft's Bill Gates (right) The list was made public in the most recent Wikileaks dump. Also on it: Clinton's primary rival Bernie Sanders Clinton's list was laid out by 'rough food groups,' as the campaign put it, clustering together Hispanic politicos, female politicians, white guys - including her eventual running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine - black government officials, ex-military and business leaders and tacking Sanders' name on the bottom HILLARY CLINTON'S LIST OF POSSIBLE VEEPS   Clinton's campaign laid out her list by 'rough food groups,' as she put it, clustering together Hispanic politicos, female politicians, white guys - including her eventual running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine - black government officials, ex-military and business leaders, tacking Sanders' to the bottom. The campaign did not say it was grouping them this way, but it inserted space between politicians it was considering in sets. THE HISPANIC POLS Javier Becerra (Congressman representing Downtown LA) Julian Castro (Housing and urban development secretary) Eric Garcetti (Mayor of Los Angeles) Tom Perez (Secretary of labor) Ken Salazar (Ex-secretary of interior) THE FEMALE POLS Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin senator) Kirsten Gillibrand (New York senator) Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota senator) Claire McCaskill (Missouri senator) Jeanne Shaheen (New Hampshire senator) Debbie Stabenow (Michigan senator)  Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts senator) WHITE MEN  Michael Bennet (Colorado senator) Sherrod Brown (Ohio senator) Martin Heinreich (New Mexico senator)  Tim Kaine (Virginia senator) Terry McAuliffe (Virginia governor) Chris Murphy (Connecticut senator) Tom Vilsack (Secretary of agriculture) BLACK MEN Steve Benjamin (Mayor of Columbia, South Carolina) Corey Booker (New Jersey senator) Andrew Gillum (Mayor of Tallahassee) Eric Holder (Ex-attorney general) Deval Patrick (Ex Massachusetts governor) Kasim Reed (Mayor of Atlanta) Anthony Foxx (Secretary of transportation) EX-MILITARY  John Allen (Retired Marine general, ex- commander of allied military in Afghanistan) Bill McCraven (Retired admiral, ex-commander of US Special Operations Command) Mike Mullen (Retired admiral, ex-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) BUSINESS LEADERS  Mary Barra (Chairman and CEO, General Motors) Michael Bloomberg (President and CEO, Bloomberg L.P.) Ursula Burns (Chairman and CEO, Xerox) Tim Cook (CEO, Apple) Bill Gates (Microsoft founder) Melinda Gates (Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) Muhtar Kent (Chairman and CEO, Coca-Cola) Judith Rodin (President, Rockefeller Foundation) Howard Schultz (Chairman and CEO, Starbucks) TACKED ON AT THE END Bernie Sanders  The email came after Clinton scored what was to prove the decisive blow against Sanders.  'I can breathe again!' the aide relayed to his boss after Clinton bested Sanders in five of the five March 15 primaries. 'Congrats on a fabulous night.' Podesta then told Clinton that he was ready to 'get back to the longer term again' and then supplied the list, which he called 'a first cut of people to consider for VP.'    Clinton's campaign laid out the list by 'rough food groups,' as Podesta put it, clustering together Hispanic politicos, female politicians, white male politicians - including her eventual running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine - black elected or appointed officials , ex-military and business leaders, tacking Sanders to the bottom in a category by himself. The use of the term 'food groups' is likely to haunt Clinton's attempts to highlight her record on diversity as it suggests an interest in symbolic gestures to specific electoral groups on the part of her campaign. Among the Hispanic politicos included were Julian Castro, the Democrats' 2012 keynote convention speaker who was the mayor of San Antonio, Texas, a state the Democrats hope to turn blue, before taking on his current role as President Obama's HUD secretary.  Tom Perez, the secretary of labor and Rep. Javier Becerra, were also on Clinton's short list for the veep slot. She was also apparently eyeing Ken Salazar, the former interior secretary, and Eric Garcetti, the Latino mayor of Los Angeles.  Clinton's female picks were her sisters in the Senate, including the ultra progressive Elizabeth Warren, who left-wing liberals wanted for the White House before Sanders jumped in, and the openly gay Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.  Among Clinton's white male political picks she has longtime Clinton ally, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and politicians from swing states including Iowa's Tom Vilsack, the current secretary of agriculture, and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a progressive voice in the Midwest.   There were seven black men Clinton was considering including more well known names like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who came to national prominence while mayor of Newark, Eric Holder, President Obama's first attorney general and Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and Anthony Foxx, who heads Obama's department of transportation.  Clinton also included on her list a handful of up-and-coming Democrats, who are black, Southern mayors.  She liked Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida - another swing state - and Kasim Reed the mayor of Atlanta Georgia.  The former secretary of state was looked at a trio of military types too, including John Allen, a four-star Marine Corps general, Bill McCraven, a Navy admiral and Mike Mullen, also a Navy admiral. In a likely effort to counteract what Republican primary voters liked about Donald Trump's business savvy, Clinton's list included nine top American business leaders.  At this point in the Republican primaries, Trump had become the comfortable frontrunner having pushed Florida Gov. Jeb Bush out of the race after South Carolina and besting Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida - his home state - by about 20 points in the primary two days before, forcing Rubio to also drop out.    To her list, Clinton added Cook, Gates and Melinda Gates, the Microsoft CEO's successful and philanthropic spouse.    Clinton also included Starbucks' Howard Schultz, Michael Bloomberg - the businessman and former New York City mayor who would go on to endorse Clinton and speak in front of the Democratic National Convention.  Other business leaders Clinton thought about tapping included Mary Barra, the CEO and chairwoman of General Motors, Ursula Burns, the head of Xerox who was the first black female CEO to head a Fortune 500 company, Muhtar Kent, the CEO of Coca-Cola and Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. Intriguingly, it did not name one of Silicon Valley's most prominent women - Cheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, who had presented the campaign with research on female leadership the previous year. Finally, at the very end of her list, she included Sanders - who nipped at her heels all primary season before endorsing her and coming on board as a surrogate to her campaign.   'Let me know if there are people you would like to see added or removed before we begin the process,' Podesta wrote to Clinton before signing off the email. Ursula Burns (left), the head of Xerox and the first black female CEO to head a Fortune 500 company, pictured with President Obama (right), was among the 39 names on the veep list RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Trump invites mother of slain Benghazi terror attack victim...

Share this article Share 98 shares Among the prominent business types that the Clinton campaign added to the veepstakes list was General Motors CEO Mary Barra Cory Booker, the energetic senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, was among the prominent black politicians included on the Clinton list   The list suggests that Clinton could have opted to set a precedent on the VP pick in any number of ways. Among the options suggested by Podesta were, if Clinton had gone for a woman, the first female vice-president. Only two women have ever been on the ticket, for the Republicans Sarah Palin with John McCain in 2008, and for the Democrats Geraldine Ferraro with Walter Mondale in 1984. Other firsts which were rejected were the first black vice-president, the first Hispanic vice-president, and the first openly gay vice-president, in the form of Tim Cook, the chairman and CEO of Apple, or Tammy Baldwin, the Wisconsin senator. She could also have opted for a non-politician, with a list from the world of business and the military. Instead she opted for Tim Kaine, a white married father of three who has been an elected politician since 1994, and whose father-in-law was the governor of Virginia before him. The Clinton campaign won't authenticate the Podesta emails that Wikileaks is releasing each day, pointing fingers at the Russians for being behind the hack.   Read more: WikiLeaks - The Podesta Emails Share or comment on this article e-mail 98 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

On the plus side, it is also believed that Apple is set to include a 'Dynamic Function Row' which replaces the top row of keys with an OLED touchscreen. The usage of the funciton row will be determined depending on the software you're using, meaning there could be the chance to create shortcuts for software functions at the press of a button.

By now, you’ve likely seen a surprise or two flash through your text messages. It might have been a preview image for a website. It could’ve been a short, funny embedded video clip. Or it may have even been a burst of confetti. Welcome to the future of texting, where messaging has become so much more than words. The overhaul of Apple’s original iOS Messages app (not to be confused with iMessages, which is the name of the service itself, or macOS Messages, which doesn’t have all of these whiz-bang new features yet), represents a major shift for the iPhone in a couple ways. First, it turns Apple’s text-based messaging program into a feature-rich platform able to support all sorts of media, apps, and other services. Second, it does this through a slew of “hidden” controls, features, and settings — a bit like Snapchat. The Snapchat comparison is appropriate because the new Messages app is looking to take users away from the upstart video messaging social network. To that end, Apple has a big advantage, as Messages is installed on every iPhone and iPad by default. But it could be an uphill climb, as customers will have to learn new texting tricks, find great embedded apps, and discover all the treats sprinkled into this radical redesign. This guide will help. Exploring the App At first glance, many users will notice few changes to iOS 10’s Messages over the previous version. That’s because when you load up the app, your various conversation threads appear just as they always have. Tapping on the notepad button at the top right will also let you compose a new, blank message as usual, and pressing “Edit” on the top left will let you delete entire threads. Things change slightly when you open an existing message thread. As before, the text messages take up the bulk of the screen, with a back arrow on the top-lefthand side and an “info” button at the top-right. The info button is a very under-utilized Messages feature, where users can quickly reach their friends in a variety of ways. First, there’s the FaceTime, message, and call buttons, which when pressed do exactly what you’d expect. But there’s also location-sharing options that are quite handy. “Send My Current Location” will deliver the recipient a snapshot of your location on a map, while “Share My Location” lets users continually display their whereabouts for a set period of time. And if you’re already using Apple’s Find My Friends app to keep up with your people, this info screen will automatically show where they are on a map. The info screen is also where you can elect to send read receipts to a recipient individually (rather than to all of your contacts — a new option within iOS 10), or turn off notifications when their messages arrive, using the “Do Not Disturb” option. And finally, the info screen also gathers all the images and attachments your contact has sent you, which makes it easy to find files without having to scroll back over previous messages. Mastering Your Messages Back in the message thread, the screen’s bottom bar is where Apple has made its major changes to the Messages app — and where all the fun begins. Next to the text input field you’ll see three buttons: a camera, a heart, and an app icon. Tapping on the camera springboards some photo options onto the screen, where the keyboard would normally appear. On the left is a miniature version of the Camera app, and on the right is the contents of your Photo Library. Dragging the images to the left reveals that the 100 most recent photos and videos are loaded into the Messages app, making it easy to access them without having to open the Photos app. The miniature Camera app on the left side is also very convenient — it lets users snap a quick photo to share, which it doesn’t save into the photo library (great for cutting down on digital clutter). You can even send quick selfies by tapping on the tiny front-facing camera button, just like in the full Camera app. Returning to the buttons next to the text input field, touching the heart button pulls up the Message’s new Digital Touch messaging. A feature adopted from the Apple Watch, Digital Touch lets people use their fingers to write or draw scribbles that will appear on the recipient’s screen. It can be a fun way to communicate, but it takes some getting used to. The Digital Touch input consists of three columns. On the left is an area where users can select various colors for their scribbles and a camera button for taking selfies. The center column is the drawing pad. And the right column displays Digital Touch gestures, which allow animations like hearts, kisses and fireballs to appear on your selfies, and on your recipient’s screen. The comparison to Snapchat crops up again here, as the Digital Touch messages disappear just like Snaps. Set to digitally dissolve two minutes after they are first viewed, these newfangled messages are the latest addition to Apple’s pro-privacy stance. But don’t rely too much on technology to keep your secrets. Not only can recipients can take screen captures of the messages, but Apple has programmed a “Keep” option to appear beneath the temporary missives. If tapped, this feature will save the image. Apps Aplenty Back to the buttons: Tapping the app icon next to the camera and heart opens what Apple calls the app drawer. This is where the Messages app morphs into something new entirely. Think of the app drawer as an entirely separate platform just for messages. The keyboard area (like with the camera and Digital Touch) displays the apps, and the bottom row serves as an app launcher. Tapping on the four larger circles at the bottom left transforms the keyboard area into something like the iOS home screen, full of circular icons for Messages-compatible apps. Alternatively, swiping your finger from right to left on the app space brings up one app after the other, quickly revealing what they’re all about. There are several kinds of apps compatible with Messages. The first are standard iOS apps that can generate interactive messages. For instance, Yelp users can use the Messages app to share a recent restaurant they viewed with their friends. Simply tapping on Yelp in the app drawer will load a list of recently viewed establishments to select from. Choose one, and an interactive message generated by Yelp sends the listing to the recipient — all without having to exit Messages and open the main Yelp app. And when the recipient taps on the interactive message, their iPhone springboards right into the Yelp app, loading the restaurant in question. Different apps use Messages’ interactive messaging function in various ways. For instance, tapping on the Dropbox Messages app reveals a file browser that’s familiar to anyone who’s used the cloud storage service. Selecting one of the files in the browser seemingly sends the file to the recipient. But really, it’s just another interactive message pointing the user to the file in Dropbox’s service. Still, using interactive messages through Messages is much more convenient than how links were shared in iOS 9, which involved diving into the app, finding the listing, and tapping the iOS “Share” button — which was always in a different place in each app. Stickers are another kind of app for Messages. Extremely popular in Asia and growing here in U.S., messaging stickers generated $268 million for Line, a Messages competitor, in 2015. That figure represents a giant pie of which Apple would love to have a slice. Stickers are similar to emojis, only rather than being controlled by a centralized, worldwide consortium, anyone can make these fun little images and sell them through Apple’s App Store. Unfortunately, that also means almost everyone is making them. Your iOS 10-packing iPhone is likely already stuffed full of stickers from apps and games as varied as Dunkin’ Donuts and Jetpack Joyride. It’s commercialism at its worst, but cuteness at its best. Using stickers is easier than inserting a photo, video, or emoji into your messages. Simply tap on a sticker to send it as a message, or drag the image up from the app drawer and place it anywhere in the conversation. The ability to place stickers on previous posts in the messaging thread makes them more than just a fun addition to texting — they can be really useful. For instance, the Grammar Snob stickers are a great way to correct common language errors that your friends might send your way. (See? Useful.) The new Messages app has games, too. A great conversation-starter, turn-based games like Words With Friends have long been popular, but their in-game chat features aren’t often useful. Pulling these titles into Messages gives them new life, and might even get you back into playing. Since it’s still early for Messages as a platform, there aren’t many great games available yet. But the free GamePigeon app currently bundles together eight games (like including classics like poker and eight-ball), so it’s worth a download to see what the future of messaging will be like. Hidden Tricks Returning to the Snapchat comparison once more, Apple has seemingly taken an another page from the social messaging app’s playbook with some fun hidden features. Just like how Snapchat reveals a world of wild features when you tap the app in interesting ways, so too does Messages. For instance, emoji hunters will no longer need to flick through the endless selection of little icons with Messages’ new Tap to Replace feature. Simply writing your text out and tapping on the emoji button causes certain words within the message to turn orange. Tap on those orange terms, and a bubble will appear with emoji that can replace the word. Another great new hidden feature in Messages is called “tapback.” Looking to eliminate the mundane replies that aren’t necessarily worthy of a text message unto themselves, tapback lets users doubletap on a received message and send a brief icon as a reply. So, if someone sends you a funny comment, holster your “lol” and tapback with a “ha ha” instead. They’ll get your message, and you won’t interrupt them with your casual acknowledgement of their hilarity. But if you do want to get a little more sincere in your response, turning the iPhone sideways reveals a larger keyboard — and a digital scratch pad with a new button found at the bottom right of the screen. Selecting this button gives users the option of hand writing out a reply, or choosing from previous (or pre-made) notes that can be sent along instead of a cold, impersonal text. Among the most fun new features in Messages are the “send with effect” options, which let you transmit a message with balloons, confetti, lasers and more. When you’re done composing your text, instead of just poking at the blue send button, use 3D Touch (if you have an iPhone 6S or newer) or press and hold (with an iPhone 6 or older) to pull up the various options. Bubble effects can be applied to a message to denote emotional meaning. Use “slam” for impact, “loud” for excitement, “gentle” for those quiet moments, or “invisible ink” to surprise your recipients. That last effect works by sending an obscured text message that the recipient can’t see until they swipe across the words — a great effect for hiding some great news. Screen effects also help to get your message across. You can send your message with a video loop of balloons taking flight in the background, confetti pouring down from the top, fireworks bursting in the sky behind your words, a shooting star flashing in the night sky, or with lasers because, well, lasers. As more users take advantage of these hidden tricks, more developers make Message-compatible apps, and the platform continues to evolve, there will undoubtedly be new ways to use your iPhone to communicate. Messages is among the most frequently used iOS apps — and with these new features, it’s now a lot more fun. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

African Entrepreneur With Feyi Olunuga: What Comes After Business Failure? 18.10.2016 at 4:00 pm By Feyi Olunuga 2 Comments “Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.” – Denis Waitley. To understand how to tackle failure in business, you have to get to know failure. Don’t avoid it, don’t be afraid of it. Face failure head on; know that failure has something to offer and be determined to get it. Failure in business takes various forms. It can be a product failure – as we have seen with the recent recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. This wiped $20 billion dollars off Samsung’s market value in the US in one day. Failure can have a devastating effect on a company’s finances, as well as her reputation. Another form of failure is when a business encounters market failure. This happens when the expected or projected sales figure is not met. Failure can be external, internal and very subjective. Parameters for success on the other hand are mostly predetermined by external influences. For instance: How many hits did your website get this week? What was your turnover last year? How many followers do you have? How many outlets do you have? You are responsible for setting your business objectives and goals therefore, you are responsible for defining what success or failure means to your business. Failure is a reality in business. Though it may not be publicized or celebrated; but out of failure has come some of the best innovations. Apple’s computer Lisa was launched in 1983 and was a huge failure by most accounts but that did not stop or kill Apple. In other words to get the best out of failure, you have to confront it head on and take control of what comes next. Failure occurs when a product or service does not meet an expectation that is, expectation of the buyer, the manufacturer, or the end user. Here are some questions to ask: Was your expectation realistic? Why wasn’t your expectation met? What must be changed to meet this expectation? These steps bring to focus your next course of action. Business decisions are often driven by assumptions that are sometimes not backed by research data. In answering these questions you might discover that your assumptions were wrong; if your assumptions are wrong, your decisions will be flawed. For example, you launch a gift-wrapping store in a shopping mall and assume that 10% of the 2000 people that daily visit the mall will be your customers daily. There is a risk of failure if you don’t confirm this with research before basing your financial projections on this. One way you can do this is to set up a stand in the Mall for one week and see what the consumer response is. This can be a great way to get feedback for your product or service before investing in a store in the mall. Entrepreneurs are faced daily with the reality of limited resources. In the seed and start-up stages it often seems like there simply isn’t enough money to do half of the things you want to do. The truth is that there will always be limited resources, even when your business grows and it is thriving, there will be multiple competing needs for every resource you have. Looking from the outside, it may seem that older successful companies don’t have this problem, they actually do. The difference is, with experience these companies have learnt from their mistakes and have become better decision makers. Where are we going with this? A common mistake we make is compromising on quality (competence) to save cost. I accept that managing costs is essential, but as an entrepreneur you have to know the areas of your product development and service delivery you absolutely cannot compromise with low quality. You have to define what quality – in product and in service – you want to develop and take to market. For instance, if I want to launch a website and I need to employ a website developer, I have many options. If I decide to compromise on quality to save cost, it will affect the end product. If you cannot afford the quality you require, you should consider getting a technical partner because 50% of something great is better than 100% of mediocre business existence. Failure to plan is planning to fail; this is a common saying and it is true. Your plan after failure is very crucial. Investigate what went wrong and establish what you need to deliver an updated product then plan. In other words, review your previous assumptions – both wrong and right – and update them. Then, move on to setting new parameters for evaluating your product or service before you launch. This will also guide ongoing review of product performance post launch. Leave no stone unturned. Consider every aspect of your product delivery: manufacturing, marketing, finance, customer service, distribution and everything else that is applicable to your business. Before you launch your product, send a sample to you biggest critics to test and review. This is bold move – but so are all comebacks. Learn to take criticism well and act on it. Are you ready to get back up? Yes! There is one more thing to do. In business, a consequence of failure that is often neglected is the impact it has on the team. As an entrepreneur, you business is your ‘baby’; when things go wrong there is a tendency to internalise the disappointment. When you have a team around you, it is so important to keep them motivated. Failure can destabilize demotivate and disorganize a good team. However, your reaction to it and what comes next can bring your team together and set them on a unifying course to fix and come back stronger. How do you do this? Keep the communication lines open; let them feel free to express their opinions on what went wrong. Lead, define the next step for the business and let them be part of building the new plan. The fact is, failure occurs multiple times in business – becoming mastered at handling failure is an indispensable skill for successful entrepreneurs. In all this, remain vision focused but market intelligent. Consistently strive for perfection but be prepared for evolution. About Feyi Olunuga Feyi Olunuga is a start-up enthusiast.

October 18 AAPL: 117.47 -0.08 Comment: Something is wrong when an Apple fan steps outside the Apple ecosystem Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature Opinion icloud View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I love the Apple ecosystem. It’s not perfect by any means, but I’d say that the vast majority of the time it lives up to Steve’s famous ‘it just works’ promise. It’s the main reason that I have two Macs, an iPad and an iPhone. So when a big Apple fan deliberately moves outside of that ecosystem, that’s a sign that something is very wrong. And I do so not just in one area, but two. The common theme? iCloud … iCloud is both Apple’s greatest strength and biggest weakness. When it works, it delivers a variety of different services, but it doesn’t always just work. It falls over far more often than is acceptable in something so fundamental to that ecosystem, made worse by the fact that Apple is usually very late to update its status page to reflect those outages for users concerned that something has gone wrong. Things that should be instant sometimes take hours, like creating a new Note on a Mac and waiting for it to appear on an iPad – resulting in ridiculous things like force-quitting the app and going offline and on again in the hope that might spur the app into checking its iCloud repository. And don’t get me started on the Pages document I created on my iPad and then couldn’t access on a plane an hour or two later because the device had apparently offloaded it to iCloud and not retained a local copy. Which brings us to iCloud Drive. As someone with an all-Apple setup, using iCloud Drive to store my documents ought to be a no-brainer. But I don’t: I use Dropbox instead. I actually store the entire Documents folder of my Mac on Dropbox so that I can access anything from any device. In particular, I regularly access the same documents on my MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. With Dropbox, I can consistently count on the latest version being available on either machine within a matter of seconds of hitting the Save button. With iCloud Drive, it may not be there even an hour later. So I’m in the crazy position of having four Apple devices, a paid iCloud account to give me enough space to backup the iOS devices and have a little working space for a few Pages documents – and then going to a third-party company to get truly seamless document transfer between them. The second case is photos. Apple offers the iCloud Photo Library, so that any photo taken on my iPhone or iPad (yeah, I admit it) is available on my Mac. Eventually. But the free tier with Photo Stream effectively only syncs the last 1,000 photos taken. After that, they just vanish into the ether. Which is why I use Google Photos. Apple – a company from whom I buy expensive new devices at least every year or two – gives me only 5GB of free storage plus 1,000 photos. Google – a company which has never seen a dime of my money – gives me unlimited storage of both photos and HD videos (with more reasonable constraints). Now, sure, I’m not stupid: I know Google doesn’t do this out of the generosity of its heart. The old saw about ‘if you don’t pay for something, then you are the product’ is true. I do indirectly give money to Google every time I view one of its ads. And personally, I don’t have a problem with that. I also don’t have an issue with personalized ads. I visit Amazon to look at a product, they drop a cookie on my device and later Google uses that cookie to serve me an ad. As it happens, that process is largely wasted on me as I’m a decisive shopper: I research something, see it, buy it. So Google mostly shows me ads for products I bought last week – but that’s all taking place on my own device so doesn’t cause me any privacy concerns. And the business model isn’t really the issue here. Just today, Amazon announced free unlimited photo storage for Prime members and their family. I’m already a Prime member, and consider it well worth the price for the unlimited free next-day delivery, so that would again be free for me. So I’m not really concerned about how it’s funded (though I do agree with Stephen Hackett at 512 Pixels that ‘5GB is the new 16GB’). Apple could build it into iPhone pricing, make it a free extra on the paid iCloud tiers or make it a chargeable iCloud add-on. My concern is that I simply cannot get from Apple something that other tech companies now seem to be viewing as table stakes. It’s getting increasingly difficult to understand Apple’s position in this space.

Needs to Address on October 25 Apple should provide detailed insight into the demand trends that it's seeing across its product portfolio, post-iPhone 7 launch. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 18, 2016 at 9:46AM Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2016 and, more importantly, provide a forecast for how it expects its business to perform in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017. The first quarter in every Apple fiscal year represents the company's peak quarter, as it's the first full quarter that incorporates sales of the company's newest iPhone models, and iPhone sales comprise the majority of the company's revenue. Apple's performance in this quarter tends to set the pace for the remainder of the fiscal year, as it typically only does one flagship iPhone release in a given year. With that in mind, here are three things that Apple management needs to address on its upcoming earnings call, after market close on Oct. 25. How is iPhone 7 demand trending relative to iPhone 6s? It is going to be absolutely critical for Apple to let investors in on how the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are selling, in aggregate, relative to last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple has insight into both its build plans and the number of iPhones it's shipping to its distribution partners (known as "sell-in"), and it is very likely that the company has gotten enough feedback from said distribution partners to know how quickly those units are being sold to end customers (known as "sell-through"). Early on in the iPhone lifecycle, Apple's sell-in is pretty much limited to its ability to crank out the new phones (as demand tends to exceed supply). However, after a while Apple's production capabilities improve and the initial surge of demand usually moderates, leading to a situation in which supply and demand are in sync (or "balanced"). Is end demand for the iPhone 7 series of smartphones faring better than that for the iPhone 6s series of phones? If the answer is "yes," then that might indicate that iPhone demand bottomed with the iPhone 6s series, alleviating some of the fears that the iPhone 6 (which outsold the iPhone 6s series) represented "peak iPhone." If not, then I suspect investors will watch the next iPhone cycle very closely, as Apple is expected to bring a substantially redesigned set of smartphones then. If those devices fail to stimulate demand growth (assuming the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus don't do the trick), the iPhone 6 may truly have been "peak iPhone." How are the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s doing? Although much of the focus is going to be on how the flagship iPhones are doing, Apple still sells a reasonable quantity of mid-range smartphones (Apple now serves this market with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus) and low-end smartphones (Apple uses the iPhone SE here). It would be interesting to hear how demand for the iPhone SE, which Apple released back in March to tackle the $399 to $499 smartphone market, is holding up. Has this device been able to help push Apple's share in these price points meaningfully upwards? Perhaps more important, though, would be commentary on how the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus sales are progressing, now that they have seen both price cuts and storage-capacity increases. In particular, how are sales of these phones progressing, relative to how the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sold when they were Apple's mid-range offerings? Insight into sales of these products may make it easier for investors to make educated guesses on how many iPhones the company will sell throughout fiscal year 2017. The iPhone 7 mix question The iPhone 7 cycle is unique in that the iPhone 7 Plus is far and away the superior phone to the vanilla iPhone 7. The camera is obviously superior on the iPhone 7 Plus (likely the biggest selling point for the larger phone over the smaller, for most people), and the display is sharper (while being just as color-accurate, according to several third-party tests). Additionally, while the iPhone 7 seems to be in reasonable supply, many iPhone 7 Plus models are still quite hard to get hold of in a reasonable time frame. Though it may simply be the case that the iPhone 7 Plus is much more difficult to manufacture than the iPhone 7, it may instead be that demand for the 7 Plus relative to the vanilla 7 this year is significantly higher than it has been for prior Plus models relative to their non-Plus counterparts. That's something that I'd like to see Apple shine more light on. If higher demand ultimately proves to be the cause, Apple could be looking at a boost in iPhone average selling prices, as iPhone 7 Plus models are $120 more expensive than their iPhone 7 counterparts. Such an average selling-price improvement from a mix shift would be amplified by the fact that this year's iPhone 7 Plus models sell for $20 more than their iPhone 6s Plus counterparts did, when they were Apple's flagships.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Google Pixel XL: Armed with an Assistant, here is the ‘first’ Google phone Google Pixel XL: Armed with an Assistant, here is the ‘first’ Google phone Google Pixel XL first impression: Meet the phone that wants to be the new king of Android smartphones. Written by Shruti Dhapola | Updated: October 20, 2016 4:07 pm Google Pixel is an ambitious project from search giant to take on the Apple iPhone and its premium tag. Here is our first impression of the device. Google Pixel, the first official smartphone with an all-Google branding, has arrived. The device, which starts at Rs 57,000 is Google’s ambitious project to take on the Apple iPhone and its premium tag. In a world where the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead, and the iPhone 7 appears like an incremental upgrade to some, Pixel wants to take on the title of the best Android smartphone, one that isn’t just about the Android platform but also about the best of what Google has to offer. Here is our experience so far with Google Pixel XL 32GB ‘Very Silver’ review device. Setting up Google Pixel and Pixel XL have some exclusive features. Like we have said before, this is about the best of Google, and setting up this device is actually quite easy. Google has given a special data transfer tool which is a Type-C USB port on one and a regular USB on one end. Just plug that into your new Pixel and old iPhone/Android and you’ll be able to transfer all your data.

All my text messages from Moto Z waiting for me in the folder, which is pretty impressive. I will be wiping this device clean though, to start over with my iPhone. But the thought of switching off iMessage before I do so is a little terrifying. Do note that setting up requires a fast Internet connection as Google Play Store will start downloading all the apps once again, after it has transferred all the apps. Even on my slow mobile network, close to nine apps were updated. With my faster home broadband network, the rest of the apps (around 24 of them) took less than half an hour. Interestingly, on apps like Antutu Benchmark, I could still see the test for the Moto Z getting reflected as the last data. And yes, the phone remembered my WiFi password for my home because it was used on the earlier device. Getting to the Assistant While setting-up Google will ask you fine-tune the Assistant, the highlight of this phone. Yes you can still see the Google Now cards if you swipe right from the edge of the screen, but Assistant claims to do a little more. Google Assistant is part of the on-screen home button; long press and the assistant is activated. Just like with Google Now you can say ‘Ok Google’ and get it to do stuff like send Messages. In this case, SMS and Hangouts are the options. Surprisingly, Allo doesn’t appear in the list, but that could be because I’ve yet to set up the app. Also I had to download Hangouts on the phone as it doesn’t come pre-installed. Google Assistant can go through Photos and find your pictures from a particular vacation as well, although this works on Google Now as well. Google Assistant is part of the on-screen home button; long press and the assistant is activated. Google Assistant appears to do a lot of the stuff that your Google Now can do as well. However, it is a lot more conversational, and yes you can say things like “I’m bored” and see how it goes. The difference with the Assistant and Google Now is that the former can have a conversation with you about random stuff. Since this is machine learning in its infancy, the answers are not always perfect. Plus, Google plans to add third-party app support to Assistant, just like how Apple did for Siri to make it more useful. Right now Assistant is a slightly more advanced version of Google Now, and we’ll have to wait and see how soon its capabilities are boosted. When the third-party apps come, it will be interesting to watch how Assistant evolves. Camera Camera is the other big feature of the Pixel smartphone that Google is touting. Google isn’t relying on OIS in the 12.3 MP rear camera, and instead is talking about EIS and software wizardry to give you pictures which are stunning. I’ve not had much time to play around with this, but I have to say one thing it is fast and there’s no shutter lag, even in low-light. Are the results better than an iPhone 7 or S7 edge? I wouldn’t say so yet, and I’m hoping to use this around more to see how it responds to different lighting conditions. There’s no manual mode in the camera app as such, although users can tinker with exposure. Meanwhile below are some shots I just took in low-light conditions in my house. Sample shot from Google Pixel XL. (Image resized for web) Sample shot from Google Pixel XL. (Image resized for web) We’ll have more on the Google Pixel XL in the coming week. Our focus with this phone is going to be on the camera, the software, and yes the Google Assistant. For now, I’ll try and find the courage to replace my iPhone with the Pixel XL, which I admit is not so easy. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News US President-elect Donald Trump could return Iraq war boosters to power Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Shruti DhapolaLooking at technology and web culture.... read more Asus Zenfone 3 Laser review: Good phone, but pricey for its specs Fake news and how it is killing democracy through social media timelines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes gone: Paytm to MobiKwik, digital wallets are rejoicing                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

And now students have had the chance to settle in and begin the process of late night study sessions, procrastinating on projects and getting limited sleep as a result; it's time to re-evaluate the devices.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Education, Student By Industry: * TechnologySTILLWATER, Okla. - Oct. 18, 2016 - PRLog -- The school season is now well underway! And now that students have had the chance to settle in and begin the process of late night study sessions, procrastinating on projects and getting limited sleep as a result; it's time to re-evaluate the devices that will help you get through those sleepless nights, in particular, your laptop! In the following blog, we have reviewed some of the best current laptops on the market in order to help you navigate through the grind of the school year! Apple MacBook This device is definitely a bit more on the pricy said but, as with most of Apple's products, the MacBook is an excellent laptop choice for students who are required to complete graphic design projects. The 12-inch MacBook is one of the more slim laptops out on the market, making it easier to carry to class than most devices. Plus, it boasts an extra hour of battery life compared to the 2015 model (8:45 vs. 7:47). In addition to the extra battery life, the Apple MacBook has a crisp display with a 2,304 x 1,440 resolution. Given that the MacBook was just released in April of this year, its price is currently listed at $1,248.00. HP Stream 13 On the opposite side of the spectrum the HP Stream 13 is on the much cheaper side at just $229.00! However, don't let the price fool you! According to multiple battery life tests, the HP Stream 13 offers an excellent battery life at an estimated 9 hours and 9 minutes. For a student who needs to carry their laptop around during the day without the luxury of a charger, this is the perfect choice! This device is also an excellent lightweight laptop at a miniscule 2.6 lbs. Acer Chromebook 15 Compared to the previous two laptop models, the Acer Chromebook 15 has the much larger screen at 15.6 inches. So if you're more concerned in finding a device where you can potentially multi-task and see more applications at once, this might very well be the laptop for you! As a result the Acer Chromebook 15 weighs roughly 5 lbs. In terms of the display this laptop offers a 1,920x1,080 resolution. In the end, the Acer Chromebook 15 is an affordable option at $449.99 and offers a durable build. 13-inch MacBook Air Going back to the Apple MacBook line of devices, the 13-inch MacBook Air provides an improved core processor compared to last year's model; going from a 1.4 GHz Core i5 Haswell to the new 1.6GHz Core i5 Broadwell processor. One of the bigger advantages of this product is the weight of the laptop at just 2.96 lbs. Compared to the Apple MacBook the MacBook Air's screen resolution is a little smaller at 1,440x900. Along with most of the Apple products, this device is a bit more on the expensive side at an asking price of $899.00. Lenovo ThinkPad X140e This laptop is described as being perfect for business students! Weighing in at 3.9 lbs. and offering a 11.6 in. screen size, the ThinkPad X140e offers top-notch processing power and is an extremely portable laptop. In terms of the battery life, this device in the top-tier at 8.5 hours of estimated life. For a price of roughly $270, the ThinkPad X140e is one of the best laptop options on the market for college students! As mentioned above, laptops have become a critical tool for the education of all undergrad college students. A huge concern to think about, though, is what happens when your laptop is damaged, broken or stolen?  Well, that's where we come in! Insure your laptop through Worth Ave. Group and avoid the risk of having to replace your laptop at a much higher cost!

In the wake of the release of so many streaming exclusives from high profile artists like Frank Ocean and Beyoncé, it looks to some as though streaming services are poised to further subvert the old media status quo by positioning themselves in an increasingly label-like role. ________________________________ Guest post by Jonathan Robinson on Musictank Much has been written over the course of this year about exclusive releases on streaming platforms, with Frank Ocean’s Blond the latest of a number of high profile, profitable exclusives, with Beyoncé, Kanye West and Rihanna, among some of the industry’s biggest-selling artists carving exclusive deals on services such as Tidal and Apple Music. Back in 2014 our Artist Economics of Streaming think tank debate heard from a stellar panel including Billy Bragg, Spotify’s Mark Williamson and Beggars’ Simon Wheeler.  Session chair, Keith Harris, asked whether Spotify was, in effect, replacing much of what record labels traditionally do, in particular, floating the idea that streaming platforms might morph into a distributor-turned-producer model, akin to Netflix/ House of Cards. Fast forward to 2016, this in hindsight was perhaps a prescient question, given how much more label-like some of these streaming services have become, not least in their ability to woo top-selling artists’ exclusives. Comparisons are often made between the release strategies of the film and music industries, whose approach to windowing new releases is significantly different.  The former is often hailed as having been highly successful in its ability to control and monetise each release stage and format in a way the music industry hasn’t itself managed. Of course the film world’s single biggest advantage is in having a primary release format that is a ‘live’ public experience – a cinematic screening – which holds sway over a procession of subsequent release platforms and formats, typically (and in order of maximum return) DVD; pay-per-view; video on demand; broadcast TV.  Such has been the success of this strategy that despite the onslaught of piracy, cinema audience figures in the UK have remained strong over the past 25 years, partly encouraged by innovations in the cinematic experience, with huge investment in digitisation radically improving how films look and sound.  Without that windowing of cinematic releases, thereby guaranteeing sustained demand for the cinema experience, that investment would likely not have happened with audiences drifting away, to consume film in other potentially less-profitable ways. Enter Netflix, and more recently, Amazon Prime who now challenge that model, destabilising the status quo of the ‘old media’ distribution model, with same-day, multiple format release strategies, and with content in which they’re made massive financial investment…Netflix’s £100m royal biopic The Crown and Amazon’s £160m investment in the BBC’s Top Gear team appear to dwarf Apple Music’s $19million investment in Drake’s Views release… Granted, Apple worked with Drake’s labels to unleash what was a massive marketing campaign – traditionally a core label function, not an end-to-end label service, but could this be the start of services such as Apple Music, Deezer, Spotify, Tidal and others making further land grabs in the label space, particularly when looking at current speculation on further consolidation between rival platforms? Should Spotify secure a deal with SoundCloud, this would see a near-perfect alignment of two digital platforms, fusing one that’s made much of it’s artist-friendly ethos with another boasting a 125m+ catalogue, a large chunk of which is from emerging, independent artists. Not for the first time, speculation of this possibly signaling the end of the label as we know it are, of course, extreme, however these new routes to market are heaping pressure and increased scrutiny on label business models and their continued evolution in light of technological advances, recently articulated in Bas Grasmayer’s Hypebot post, here. But this market disruption does highlight the music industry’s disjointed approach to release strategies, not all of which appear to be for long-term benefit. Contrast Adele’s windowing of 25 that favoured locking out streaming services for a period with a physical release, with Drake’s Views Apple Music exclusive, both potentially frustrating consumers who have become pawns in the battle for streaming supremacy, at a time when simply converting the average ‘three-CDs-a year-buying-joe-public’ into a £120 a year streaming service subscriber has been a continued uphill climb, albeit one that appears to have found its stride. But at least these were time-limited exclusives, unlike Tidal, some of whose exclusives have remained within its walled garden of subscribers, frustrating a music-buying public, before leaking onto Torrent sites… So just at a time when mass market streaming really is starting to gain some traction, we further alienate the customer… But at least these were time-limited exclusives, unlike Tidal, some of whose exclusives have remained within its walled garden of subscribers, frustrating a music-buying public, before leaking onto Torrent sites… So just at a time when mass market streaming really is starting to gain some traction, we further alienate the customer… The other loser in this arms race is new music. What perhaps gets lost in the hyperbole of advocates of disintermediation is that whether talking about a Netflix or an Apple Music, although their levels of investment in talent are undeniably huge and impactful, the majority of that investment goes to talent that has already cut through; talent that has been nurtured and developed; talent that’s now at the top of its game… and up until now, typically thanks to the investment risk born by ‘traditional’ core industry, be that film, TV or music. What happens next is anyone’s guess, but for music’s sake, continued mutual co-existence between labels and digital platforms has to be infinitely more preferable than the destructive short-termism of tech-led exclusives. -  Editorial by Jonathan Robinson ____________________________________________________ The next MusicTank live event is: Rock ‘n’ Roll Disasters & What They Taught Me… November 8 2016 @ 6:30 pm - 9:00 pm | £10.00 - £35 More info here.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Spotify for Apple TV should not be expected anytime soon By Christian Zibreg, Oct 18, 2016 Tweet 11 Comments Have you been keeping your fingers crossed for Spotify for Apple TV? If so, you’ll be disappointed to learn that a Spotify tvOS app has been “down prioritized,” with a company executive stating that a release supporting tvOS should not be expected anytime soon. It’s unclear why the Swedish startup does not want to support the Apple TV, more so given its rivalry with Apple in the music-streaming space. Asked by a customer in a comment posted on the code sharing website GitHub if there will be a tvOS framework supporting Spotify for Apple TV and when such an app might see the light of day, Samuel Erdtman, who is a Product Owner at Spotify, said that “support for tvOS has been down prioritized.” “You should not expect a release supporting it any time soon. I’m sorry about that,” he added. One possibility is that Spotify doesn’t prefer Apple’s changed terms for In-App Subscriptions that requires developers to share 30 percent of subscription revenue with the Cupertino firm. After a subscriber has accumulated one year of paid service, the revenue share changes from the 70:30 split to the 85:15 split, meaning developers get to keep eighty percent of proceeds to themselves after each subscriber’s first year. Another possibility could be Spotify’s critique of the App Store subscription sharing scheme and blocking of external subscription links. Spotify’s answer: they have raised the price of subscriptions in its mobile app for the iPhone and iPad. Spotify for iOS does support AirPlay so Apple TV owners can stream music to their TV, but a full-on tvOS app would have been much appreciated, that’s for sure. Apple Music launched in June 2015 and has 17 million paid accounts while Spotify, which launched in September 2008, currently has 40 million subscribers.

So annoying to have to go for my phone each time I want to search, play specific song/playlist, etc Ángel Javier Esquivel AppleMusic m8. techfreak23 There are a few crucial features that are missing that Spotify has such as Connect. Spotify is even going as far as collaborating with Sonos for Connect so that I can seamlessly switch playback from the Spotify app on my phone to my Sonos when I step in my front door. I also hate the integration of Apple Music into iTunes. It’s a giant clusterfuck. Chloe Elizabeth Wade Spotify looks ugly anyway and apple music is just better if u own apple products bc it’s 1st party Daniel Plainview I’d be happy with Spotify for Apple Watch. I need a complication to use when I get my AirPods Andrieux Querido Cmon Spotify, don’t make it hard. And we want Lyrics back too. !!! websyndicate You can airplay to the apple tv and that sucks. They need to step it up. No Apple Watch app still and TV has been down prioritized. I will say TV not such a big deal….not for me but apple watch is. I’m not fond of apple music I can only use it on apple products and spotify I can use it everywhere really. techfreak23 I’m honestly about ready to build my own Spotify client with a Watch app because it’s been a year and a half since the Watch came out and still nothing. Their iOS SDK allows me to do pretty much everything their app does. Just need the free time to do it. Swanny246 They do exist, there’s Joy for instance. The problem is it doesn’t integrate with the actual client, it only communicates with the Joy iPhone app, which doesn’t help when it comes to wanting to play your offline tracks. techfreak23 I’ve seen some of those. I don’t really like the design of most. I honestly don’t really care about storing offline tracks on my watch as I don’t ever use it for music. I’m sure if Spotify ever does release a watch app they will have that feature. I just want to be able to switch playlists, pick specific songs, etc. without having to reach for my phone.

The report cites a “reliable Chinese supplier” and says Apple is planning to both announce and shape the new MacBook Pros to retailers. The refreshed notebook will sport USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. Apple will be ditching all traditional USB ports along with MagSafe and Thunderbolt 2. It also says that Apple will be ditching the 11-inch MacBook Air, while retaining the 13-inch Air on the market. There have been tons of doubt regarding Apple’s MacBook Air line ever since the 12-inch Retina MacBook released. Most have said that Apple will retain the 11-inch MacBook Air and ditch the 13-inch model. This report says Apple will ditch the 11-inch MacBook Air when the new MacBook Pros are announced. In terms of dates, there seems to be no new details beyond they’re still on track for release this month.

Apple Just Hired a New Savior Mark Spoonauer Editor in Chief Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 18, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Me: Hey, Siri? When is the next presidential debate? Siri: The third 2016 presidential debate will take place from 9 pm to 10:30 pm ET on Wednesday, Oct 19 at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, Nevada. Me: Who's moderating?

Anyone who has used Siri knows that Apple's intelligent assistant isn't all that smart. In fact, it has become the butt of jokes for some and just ignored by others because it's just not accurate or fast enough. But help is on the way. According to Mac Rumors and his own tweet, Apple has just named Carnegie Mellon University professor Russ Salakhutdinov as the new Director of AI Research at Apple. He will be charged with making Siri smarter at a time Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant are gaining ground. MORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks Siri likely won't just be inside your iPhone, MacBook or iPad going forward. Apple is rumored to be working on a smart speaker that's similar to the Amazon Echo, and it's looking to integrate its software more deeply into vehicles via Project Titan. As reported by Technology Review, Salakhutdinov "researches very large neural networks used in a technology called deep learning, which lets a computer learn to perform a difficult task by consuming copious training examples." Hiring Salakhutdinov could help give Siri improved language understanding, as well as learn from unstructured data on the Web. So instead of Siri simply delivering Wikipedia results, the assistant could conceivably scan those results and spit out a contextually relevant answer. MORE: Siri vs. Alexa: Why Amazon Won Our 300-Question Showdown It's not that Siri can't learn. In the above example about the election and who's moderating, Apple's assistant sort of got the answer right the second time I asked the same series of questions. It merely surfaced search results from Bing, so I still needed to click on those results to find out that Chris Wallace would be moderating. Salakhutdinov's team could also potentially help catch Google and its ability to do things like caption images automatically. Siri can show you pictures based on location and who's in them, but it can't go that far. And Google already has a smart speaker on the way in Google Home that will put its assistant in more places.

 Hillary Clinton's campaign considered Apple CEO Tim Cook for vice president Kif Leswing Oct. 18, 2016, 9:25 AM 8,478 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook and John Podesta at a fundraiser in California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A stolen email leaked by WikiLeaks shows that Apple CEO Tim Cook was on a short list for vice president. John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, sent an email in March discussing a "first cut of people to consider for VP," Gizmodo spotted on Tuesday. "Cheryl, Robby, Jake, Huma, Jennifer and I also did a first cut of people to consider for VP. I have organized names in rough food groups," Podesta wrote. The "food group" of business leaders included Cook along with both Bill and Melinda Gates and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. The Clinton campaign planned a meeting with Cook, who is CEO of the world's most valuable company, in June 2015, but a staffer said the meeting was "one we should proceed cautiously." Cook is "supportive but new to this so I think we shouldn't come on too strong," a staffer wrote. The meeting was about fundraising, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Cook eventually hosted a fundraiser for Clinton in August of this year. It's unknown whether Cook is a Republican or a Democrat, though he has taken public stances on issues such as gay rights and climate change that more closely align with those of the Democratic Party. pic.twitter.com/hrCAaTz96Y — JoshuaCohen (@jcohen570) August 25, 2016 But Cook has also hosted a fundraiser for Paul Ryan, the current Republican speaker of the House. Apple declined to comment. The Clinton campaign ultimately selected Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to serve on the ticket for this year's election. Here's the entire list of VP candidates Podesta suggested in the email, as he wrote them: Javier Becerra Julian Castro Eric Garcetti Tom Perez Ken Salazar Tammy Baldwin Kirsten Gillibrand Amy Klobuchar Claire McKaskill Jeanne Shaheen Debbie Stabenow Elizabeth Warren Michael Bennet Sherrod Brown Martin Heinreich Tim Kaine Terry McAuliffe Chris Murphy Tom Vilsack Steve Benjamin Corey Booker Andrew Gillum Eric Holder Deval Patrick Kasim Reed Anthony Foxx John Allen Bill McCraven Mike Mullen Mary Barra Michael Bloomberg Ursula Burns Tim Cook Bill Gates Melinda Gates Muhtar Kent Judith Rodin Howard Schultz Bernie Sanders SEE ALSO: Here's Apple CEO Tim Cook raising funds for Clinton NOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years Loading video...

That might sound like a slightly gawky message, but it's laced with potency. More than at any other time in the history of Android, Google is taking the fight directly to Apple, and the Pixel is the punch into the soft belly of the iPhone.  This is the Google Pixel XL, the larger of the two Pixel devices, and it's Android's new heavyweight champion. Google Pixel XL review: Different design, stunning build Each Pixel device that Google has announced has shared the same quality: an uncompromising approach to design. With the Chromebook Pixel, the first of this new family, an eye-wateringly beautiful laptop was born. The Pixel C tablet followed suit. And now we have the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Pocket-lint Like those previous devices, the Pixel XL pulls no punches. It is cast from a block of aerospace-grade aluminium, anodised for a finish that's as premium as you'll find on any smartphone, with shapely chamfers to the front and curves to the back. In a world where a phone is a slab dominated by the display, the Pixel XL manages to be different. The handset has a polished glass section set into the rear, where the camera and fingerprint scanner sits. Its purpose remains something of a mystery, other than giving this phone a distinctive look. If you wanted to do something to ensure that no one was going to say it was an iPhone clone, that might do it. At first we were unsure about this detail. It seems to serve no purpose, but as we've used the phone more and more, we've come to love the smooth feel of the glass. It's interesting, it's different and - remarkably - it's unique. Pocket-lint From the front the Pixel is less unique. Arguably, if there's one criticism we'd bring to bear against it, it's the height of this phone (at 154.7mm). We criticise the height of the iPhone 7 Plus for the same reason, because there's a little too much bezel above and below the display that doesn't really do anything. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge manages to be shorter and by keeping the controls off the display, makes better use of that space. We think that the S7 edge is the Pixel XL's most natural rival: Samsung's phone is a masterclass in Android adaption, a juxtaposition of Google's Pixel purity. Samsung also offers waterproofing, which is another Pixel weakness - the XL is an IP53 device, for fleeting rain splashes only - although some users are finding the Pixel will survive a dunk in water. Google Pixel XL review: Display to behold When you're choosing between the Pixel and the Pixel XL, there's one difference: the display. Topped with Gorilla Glass 4 to keep scratches at bay, the 5.5-inch display of the XL puts it in an incredibly popular class of big phones. The Pixel XL lives up to its name with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution display, resulting in a pixel density of 534ppi. Google Pixel XL vs Pixel: Which should you choose? Pocket-lint Quad HD is very much the current standard in flagship phones - the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium went one better with its 806ppi 4K display - but the Pixel XL is every-inch competitive with its rivals. Opting for AMOLED, Google's display choice is fantastically detailed and offers bags of punch and vibrancy. It doesn't push the vibrancy quite as vigorously as Samsung often does so it strikes a more neutral balance. There's richness to colours, deep blacks and nice clean whites, although the latter are slightly on the warm side, not that it matters a great deal. One of the new additions to the Pixel XL is Night Light. This changes the colour temperature of the display in the evenings so it doesn't drown you in blue light and stop you sleeping. It's hardly unique: Apple offers the same, as does Samsung. On the Pixel it's a standard Android feature, so will soon be commonplace we suspect. Pocket-lint We found the adaptive brightness to be good: there's enough brightness to cut through sunny conditions, and it dims well enough for night-time video watching. We also found the screen's polarising layer to be cleverly positioned so the Pixel doesn't blackout in portrait or landscape if you're wearing polarised glasses. Google Pixel XL review: Performance and hardware Launching late in the year, the Pixel XL comes up against comparable rivals that have been on the market for some time. There's a small advantage in that it offers the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, with 4GB RAM, which is a minor upgrade on one of the year's most popular quad-core chipsets. Flagship specs mean flagship performance and the noticeable thing about the Pixel XL is how smooth and fast it is. Much of this will come down to the clean Android build - as there's no bloat - which we'll cover in the software section later.  Importantly, the Pixel XL behaves like the flagship phone that it is. It's fast to open apps, it's fast to react to your commands. For those on the EE network in the UK, it's fast with data too - with top performance when it comes to signal and reception. Pocket-lint There's the option for 32GB or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. There's also a fingerprint scanner on the rear, as we mentioned. We're happy with it's positioning, it worked for the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P - and it works here. The fingerprint scanner is easy to find and very quick to unlock the phone. Perhaps the only thing to watch out for is the new swipe gesture (or Move as Google calls it). This allows you swipe down the notifications shade to glance at your alerts and messages, and we've found it very easy to accidentally swipe when handling the phone. Not that it matters much. Pocket-lint There is one speaker in the bottom of the Pixel XL. This provides plenty of volume, but isn't the most accomplished speaker on a smartphone, lacking the smart separation and bassy punch of HTC's BoomSound. It will also distort at high volumes, so you're better off with headphones. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone Google Pixel XL review: Battery life Sitting inside the Pixel XL is a 3,450mAh battery. That's likely to put a smile on your face for starters, as generally devices with batteries over 3,000mAh do pretty well in getting you through the day. Indeed the Pixel XL does offer good battery life. It's got us through the day without the need to visit the charger for a top up. We've enjoyed day-long battery, even with that necessary Pokemon Go session while out walking the dog. The XL does offer a battery saver mode, too, but it's the native Android offering and is rather basic. Google will tell you that Android Nougat offers great Doze battery saving without you having to do anything: but sometimes we just want to toggle on a mode to ensure we're not wasting power we don't need to. Pocket-lint There's a USB Type-C connection on the bottom of the Pixel XL and this offers fast charging, so if you do run short of juice then a quick blast will have you back in action again. However, there is no wireless charging. Google Pixel XL review: Unique software charms The Pixel XL launches on Android 7.1 Nougat, bringing with it a number of unique Pixel features, designed to make this device stand-out from other Android phones and to offer a little more than previous Nexus devices of old. Google Pixel vs Google Nexus: What's the difference? That really draws a line between the Pixel and previous "Google" phones. In the Pixel you have an "exclusive launcher", the integration of Google Assistant voice-control on the home button, a unique camera experience, a calendar icon that shows the date rather than just "31" and a few other bits. Again this follows Google's narrative of the Pixel being a more complete and appealing proposition and we have to say, Android is very slick on the Pixel XL. It feels sophisticated, a proposition that's much more consumer than some Nexus devices of the past.  Android 7.x Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update One of our favourite features isn't exclusive, as it's coming in Android 7.1: app shortcuts. It replicates the sort of thing that you get with a deep press on Apple's iPhone with 3D Touch, but on the Pixel it's just part of the software system, rather than needing a hardware change. These app shortcuts allow you get right back into a conversation, open the camera to take a selfie or open a new Chrome Incognito window without having to open the app first. Pocket-lint Currently this only works on Google's own apps, but we're sure it will come to many other apps soon. It's one of a few small changes in Android that's making everything more immediate, like the proper integration of replies into notifications and more information in the settings menu, so you can see important details at a glance.  There will be a brief window where the Pixel is the most Google-y Android phone around, but with updates coming, a lot of the refinement will be flowing through to other devices. We love the purity, something that's become increasingly consumer friendly on recent Nexus devices, and in the Pixel this refinement is at its purest. Where the Pixel perhaps isn't as exciting as some other devices is in the apps tray. Although it's accessed with a swipe through Pixel Launcher, the apps tray is a fairly basic layout, with no customisation options. You can switch launcher, of course, and the Google Assistant shortcut on the home button will stay in place, but you might lose those fancy app shortcuts in the process. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel XL review: Google Assistant One of the top billings for the Pixel is Google Assistant. There's been a lot about how Google is pushing its artificial intelligence system forward. In reality, Google Assistant is an evolution of existing systems established by Google Now and at a surface level works in a similar way. Google Now has always been about tailoring information for you and Google Assistant does the same. What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and how can you use it? Google Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Assistant is accessed via the "Ok Google" hot word and the real change here is in the visual presentation. It can also be accessed from the Pixel Launcher with a long press on the home button. Where once you had Now On Tap you have Google Assistant instead. That sort of makes sense too, as Google Assistant is designed to be contextually aware, integrated and capable of serving a wide range of your needs. Aside from presentation of results, it's the ongoing conversation with Google Assistant that makes it different - being able to extend a question or topic to find more or do more. Pocket-lint Currently though, it doesn't feel much like a breakthrough into an AI future. Yes, Assistant will do things for you, but it isn't a vast change from existing voice interaction with Google. We're sure that position will change with the launch of Google Home, where Assistant will have a range of tasks to perform that currently don't surface on the phone. Like Siri on the iPhone, we expect to be able to tell Assistant to dim the lights from our Pixel in the future.  There are some cool things that you can do however. We've previously seen integration into Google Allo, the new messenger app, but now you get that outside of Allo - you just have to start talking to Google. There's some app integration, like you can say that you want to watch something on Netflix and it will open on that programme, for example, which is clever. The same has worked for Spotify for some time. There's also clever intrgration with Google Photos and the camera - you can ask Google Assistant to find pictures of your dog, or ask it to take a selfie. Finding things and developing that information can be pretty good, but on many occasions Google Assistant will serve you up a search result and read the answer. That's ok in dealing with a question - like "what is a dangling participle?" - but currently it seems there are a number of dead ends. Google Pixel XL review: Camera The camera is one of the other areas that benefits from some software exclusivity. Unlimited backup storage for full resolution of photos and videos is a serious proposition and applies to all photos and video you take on your Pixel, along with smart storage that will erase backed-up photos from your device as storage needs increase. No worries about running out of space on the Pixel XL. Pocket-lint The camera app makes a step forward towards usability, too, coming from a position of relative weakness in previous years. Nexus devices never really did well in the camera department until the Nexus 6P shook things up in 2015 with its great performance. However, the Pixel app is still rather basic. Gunning for the iPhone means delivering on the camera and the Pixel aims to deliver a simple camera that works. The bad news is no real manual controls and very few menu options. The good news is that you can pretty much just point and shoot and you'll usually get good results, which is the important point. The 12.3-megapixel camera on the Pixel XL is very fast to capture. It employs auto HDR+ (high dynamic range) as a default to make the best out of scene. We're fans of that setup on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, as these days it generally means you get great results in a wide range of conditions. Here you can engage HDR+ proper, or leave it in auto mode which is faster and the results aren't hugely different. Pocket-lint Indoors it is prone to white balance mishaps however. On both the Pixel and Pixel XL, we've found some indoor shots that look very yellow, as though it's misinterpreted the conditions. That can be corrected by manually selecting the white balance and perhaps switching to "tungsten", for a more natural look. With 1.55µm pixels in the sensor and f/2.0 aperture, low-light performance is pretty good too although there's no optical image stabilisation. In lower light there's fine grain which can reduce the contrast and detail. In very dark conditions image noise crashes in and with no options for manual lengthy exposures or anything else, it's not really a "pro" camera in that sense, more a reliable point-and-shoot. Google has clung on to some of the old Google Camera features in its Pixel Camera which are less exciting: Photo Sphere remains an option, as does the old Lens Blur option, which gives you a sort of bokeh effect. The fun addition is slow motion video with 120fps and 240fps options, with the easy option of selecting the portion you want in slow-mo. Pocket-lint Elsewhere video capture offers 30fps and 60fps up to Full HD, with 4K video offered at 30fps. Video stabilisation is effective, so you can walk down the road and get pretty smooth results. This is all effortless too, which is great. Overall, we feel that the Pixel XL could make more of its camera with a more encompassing app. For those wanting to push the camera's capabilities, the answer might lie in a different app. However, as many iPhone owners will tell you, often it's just about pointing and shooting. In these conditions, the Pixel XL delivers. Verdict The Pixel XL is the most accomplished phone that's come from Google. The dabs of consumer refinement that Pixel has applied makes the Nexus programme feel like beta testing. And Google loves beta testing, so in many ways the Pixel is the result of learning through all those Nexus phones. The XL is a pure delivery of Android: it's fast, it's fun, it's high quality; it has exclusive features, the camera works and the battery lasts too. For many, however, the stumbling block will be the price. The Pixel XL is priced to rival the iPhone 7 Plus; not undercut it, but to look it straight in the face and stare it down. The Pixel refuses to accept the position that Android offers you more for less, because as it is, the Pixel will struggle to answer questions from the much cheaper OnePlus 3 or the slightly cheaper Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Fortunately the Pixel XL delivers. It's a premium smartphone at a premium price, but it offers a truly premium experience. And thanks to that glass panel on the back, there'll be no mistaking that you're carrying around the hottest Android phone in town. From £719, Google Originally published 18 October 2016.

As a lifelong iPhone user, I decided to put Google to the test and find out how well that process really works. And after spending a weekend working through it, I came to a nuanced and messy conclusion. Broadly speaking, migrating works fine, but the nitty-gritty details of the process are painful to deal with. I expected the transition to be far from frictionless. After all, I use iCloud Photo Library to sync my photos, correspond with my friends using iMessage, track my exercise with an Apple Watch and use a Mac. Migrating wasn't going to be easy, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway and see whether the Pixel XL lived up to Google's hype. On Friday morning, I pulled my SIM card out of my iPhone and stuck it into a new Pixel XL that Google provided for review. I fired the phone up, and it walked me through the process of trying to move my contacts, calendars, email and messages. Google also offers to migrate users' music and photos, but can't transfer snaps only saved in iCloud Photo Library, or iTunes music that's DRM-protected or stored in Apple's cloud, so I skipped that. The whole process took about a half hour, and I was left with a phone that promised to be personalized for me, just like my old one. My text message conversations were all there, and my contacts carried over. My iCloud-synced calendars were copied into Google Calendar, too. I was then faced with the next hurdle: getting all the apps I wanted onto the new phone. I installed 37 new apps, in addition to those Google provided. In the process, I had to find alternatives for several of the apps I use every day, which meant switching my to-do list, podcast app and Twitter client. It wasn't a super-costly process, but I also didn't try to replace the apps and hardware I'd be missing if I made a full migration. (Replacing an Apple Watch for fitness tracking would be difficult, for example.) After all that, I finally got to settle into the Pixel XL. The transition to Android didn't feel as foreign as I had feared. Many of the apps I was already used to on iOS have analogs on Android that feel similar. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone didn't feel nearly as weird to use as I anticipated, especially after I got used to gripping the phone. As I got more comfortable with the phone, however, more annoyances started showing up. Photo attachments to text messages, which Google promised to import, didn't show up in line in the conversation, like they did on my iPhone. Instead, each image was replaced with a helpful message that I could find them in my phone's Photos app. But the photos in that folder aren't organized in any way, with some images that I received months ago showing up right alongside photos that arrived in the past week as though they all came in at the same time. Using the new Google Assistant was impressive at times, but didn't feel like a game-changer. In some cases, it was better at understanding my queries than Siri, while Apple's virtual assistant handled other situations better. Overall, I'd give Google the edge in voice recognition accuracy and experience, but it doesn't feel like an insurmountable lead. Migration once again introduced some issues. My relationship information is all loaded up in my iOS contacts, so Siri knows who my parents are. But when I asked the Google Assistant how old my Dad was, it didn't know who I was talking about. When I gave it his name, I assumed it would associate that with the contact card of the same name already on my phone. It didn't. Moreover, making reservations using the Assistant -- one of the things that Google advertised heavily -- was finnicky and difficult. The interface clearly shows potential, but the execution isn't quite there yet. Siri and Google both integrate with OpenTable, and I'm unconvinced that I can find a reservation using either of them faster than I could just use the OpenTable app.  Don't get me wrong: the Pixel XL is a great phone. Google's done well with this one, and I look forward to seeing what comes of it in the future. But making the move over to it from iOS when I'm so invested in Apple's platform already felt like death from a few dozen different, tiny cuts, without a shiny reward for my troubles. People who already rely on services that have a stronger cross-platform component like Fitbit for fitness and Spotify for music will have an easier time making the move. It'll be easier still if their photos are already in Google Photos and they already use Google Calendar. If I was looking for a new phone without any baggage of migrating, I'd be taking a good, long look at the Pixel line. But I have a shiny, new iPhone 7 that I enjoy using already, and it has the benefit of working with all the iOS-only apps and services that I love. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to switch iMessage back on.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Granted 47 Patents Covering Apple Store Fixtures and More the Day after Fortune Interviews Angela Ahrendts | Main | Apple Sues Mobile Star for Selling Counterfeit Power Adapters and Charging Cables through Amazon » October 18, 2016 Samsung to Kick-Off 2017 with the World's First 10nm CPU Powering their Galaxy S8   In August we posted a report titled "Apple's iPhone 6s Crushes Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 in a New Speed Test," proving Apple's customized ARM processors are meticulously tweaked to get more performance out of seemingly older processors. For the iPhone 7, Apple notes on their website that the "iPhone 7 is supercharged by the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. It's not just faster than any previous iPhone — it's also more efficient. That's because the A10 Fusion chip uses an all-new architecture that enables faster processing when you need it, and the ability to use even less power when you don't. And with the longest battery life ever in an iPhone, you can work at twice the speed of iPhone 6 and still enjoy more time between charges." Wikipedia describes the A10 design here. While Apple could have gone with a TSMC 10nm processor, their engineering team skipped it for the A10 Fusion chip. The 10nm processor is now likely to debut for the 2017 anniversary iPhone delivery a next-gen version of the Fusion chip. But for the sake of bragging rights, Samsung is going to launch their new 10nm processor in Q1 powering their new Galaxy S8.   After the Note 7's battery crisis, Samsung has been trying to put it behind them and change the subject. Just prior to stopping production of the Note 7 we posted a report titled "Copycat Samsung to Introduce Galaxy S8 in Q1 2017 with Dual Cameras and No Home Button." Today we learn that Samsung will be powering their new S8 with a 10nm processor. A new Korean tech report published today states that Samsung Electronics is mass-producing world's first 10-nano mobile APs (Application Processor) and has surpassed its competitors in next-generation system semiconductor process.   Samsung Electronics made an announcement yesterday that it has started mass-producing 10-nano logic process. While performance of 1st generation 10-nano process is improved by 27% compared to 1st generation 14-nano process, its electricity consumption is reduced by 40%. Output of chips per wafer is increased by about 30%.   Industries are predicting that Samsung Electronics will mass-produce new Exynos series, which is its own AP, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 830 series (835) through 10-nano logic process.   Patterning process that is more intricate and draws finer circuits than 14-nano process is needed to mass-produce 10-nano APs. Samsung Electronics utilized current equipment for immersion lithography to apply triple-patterning technology that repeats patterning process three times. By doing so, it was able to overcome limitations and has secured flexibility in design. Samsung's Galaxy S7 introduced liquid cooling and I'm sure they'll be praying that it'll keep their new faster 10nm processor cool enough to keep it from exploding and extending their battery crisis into 2017. While a negative scenario is highly unlikely to unfold, any crisis arising from the S8 would likely sink their brand for good. You could only imagine the pressure that they're currently under to not screw up again.   In a report posted last week I noted that Samsung was planning to surprise the market with a formal introduction of their Galaxy S8 during January's CES to kick off 2017 with a bang breaking with tradition of introducing new Galaxy smartphones at the Mobile World Congress smartphone show in Barcelona.   Analysts believe that such a move would now give the market the impression that Samsung is panicking and rushing the product to market. Will Samsung throw caution to the wind and ignore the critics with an early S8 smartphone introduction?   While only time will tell, Android OEM's like Huawei, Oppo and other leading Chinese smartphone companies will definitely take advantage of this processor in their marketing campaigns in the hopes of staying ahead of Apple, their top foreign competitor.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Daydream ready, fast USB-C charging Con. Not water resistant, only a single speaker. NEW YORK — Google's new Pixel phones should be on a smartphone shopper's short list — and not just for those disheartened by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall. Pixel is a winner for anyone looking for an excellent phone. Start with cameras that are at the very least on par with the terrific cameras on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, which represent its main competition. USA TODAY Google Pixel camera: Great but not revolutionary Add the baked-in voice-enabled Google Assistant, Google’s answer to Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, where another battleground is poised to take place. Such digital assistants still represent a work in progress, including Google Assistant, but Google's voice brings a high IQ and a world of potential. Pixels are also the first phones in which Google took over all aspects of the hardware and software design (though HTC actually manufactured the units), borrowing from Apple’s playbook. Google Pixel XL, the larger version of Google's new Pixel smartphone.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Over the past several days, I’ve been testing the larger of the two Pixel models, the Pixel XL, which boasts a lovely Quad HD 5.5-inch display and costs $769 for 32 gigabytes of storage or $869 for 128 GB. The smaller Pixel has a Full HD 5-inch screen and costs $649 or $749, respectively. The phones are already on back order and will be available through Verizon (as the exclusive U.S. carrier), at Best Buy, via Google’s Project Fi or Google’s own Play Store. You can get an unlocked version that will work with any of the other major U.S. carriers. The timing for Google couldn't have been better, coming on the heels of Samsung's decision to stop making the Note 7, a high-end phablet that had attracted a fierce following but which was vulnerable to overheating and fire. The expanded recall may persuade some Android users to try a new brand. Here are the key takeaways: *Design: Pixels are crafted out of an aerospace-grade aluminum slab and glass and the XL model feels like the high-priced phone that it is. It's a tad shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and, viewed from the front, the two phones look a fair bit alike, though from the rear not so much. The relatively wide bezels on the front appear to be mostly wasted real estate, as there are no physical buttons. On the upper third of the back, Pixel has a Gorilla Glass-covered glass shade that reveals smudges. What I do like is that there’s no camera bump as on most other phones — the rear lens and flash lie flat. The fingerprint sensor you can use to unlock the phone is also on the rear. And when you do unlock the devices, you can swipe down on the sensor to reveal notifications, a small but nice feature. The new fingerprint scanner on the back of the Google Pixel  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Pixels run the latest version of Android called Nougat and with Google in charge, you ought to get software updates as soon as they are ready. The phone has a robust Qualcomm processor. And score one for Google against the iPhone 7: Pixel has the same standard 3.55mm headphone connector that the iPhone 7 got rid of and that every other smartphone I know has. Alas, there’s only a single speaker on Pixel; Apple added stereo speakers to the iPhone 7 and other smartphones also have them. And unlike the iPhone 7 or ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, you wouldn’t want to drop Pixel in a puddle. It is not fully water-resistant. Using the camera on Pixel.

I detected only subtle differences between the pictures and videos I shot here (under all sorts of lighting conditions) and those I’ve captured on a Galaxy or the iPhone. Consider that high praise. I was impressed with the color and fine detail on most shots. The main rear camera on the Pixel is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large pixels and an f/2.0 aperture (good in dim light). It is fast to fire. By double-twisting the phone, you can switch from the rear camera to the front 8-megapixel selfie camera or back, a trick that usually (but not always) worked. Maybe as important as the picture quality is what you can do with the images you capture. Google is giving Pixel owners unlimited free cloud storage at full resolution for all the pictures and videos shot with the phone, including 4K video. That’s a big deal. Google Assistant delivers the weather on a Google Pixel.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Google Assistant: You can summon the Google Assistant by barking out “OK Google” or by pressing down and holding against the phone’s home key. As with other digital assistants, it can give you the basics: stock quotes, sports scores, even tell you a lame joke. But Google is pushing the conversational aspects of its AI-based Assistant further. You can tap contextual buttons that appear on the screen with suggested replies, or you can respond by voice. I asked Assistant to “tell me about my day” and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg and BBC. A Google Assistant search found photos of Edward Baig's daughter Sydney with a horse.  (Photo: Edward C. Baig) When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter, Sydney, rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to “show me pictures of Sydney with bridges” it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the Web. Google Assistant was able to translate “how do I find a bathroom in French?” into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the Web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the Web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I knew only a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. There's a fun aspect to the Assistant, too. I could play trivia, or have Assistant flip a coin with the appropriate sound effect as I tried to guess heads or tails. Most promising is the idea that you can continue a conversation without repeating search parameters each step of the way. So you might ask it to find you an Italian restaurant. You can then can ask how late the place is open, without repeating the name of the restaurant or have Google Assistant find the menu. In my experience, however, such queries were hit-or-miss. Another example: I asked Google to show me pictures of dogs and it did so off the Web. Without mentioning dogs I followed up with "how about by the beach?" and Google surfaced Web images of canines by the beach. Impressive. Pixel help screen  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Battery. The phone kept a charge well into the evenings during my mixed use; since I never ran it down, I didn’t get to test a fast-charging feature that Google claims can get you up to seven hours of juice in just 15 minutes, using the USB-C adapter that comes in the box. *Worth noting: If you run into a tech support snag, you can solicit help by tapping a “support” tab inside the phone’s settings. From there, you can request a callback from a support agent 24/7 or alternatively open a chat session (the hours are more limited). You can even remotely share your screen with the person helping you out. Pixel will be the first phone to support Google Daydream, but the mobile virtual-reality headset wasn't yet available for testing. Google's new phones are powerful, pricey and pretty darn intelligent and demonstrate Google's commitment to be a major player in the space.

For now, the tech giant has another innovative goal – replacing your car keys. October 18, 2016 WSP Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is said to have big automotive ambitions with its 55 patented vehicle technologies. Since 2014, the company has been mysteriously conceptualizing an electric, self-driving car. However, no one outside Cupertino knows any specifics in terms of what Apple has in mind. Before the rumors of ‘Project Titan’, Apple’s car initiative, came out, the company already had plans of a futuristic iPhone system that allows users to open car doors, start- turn off the cars’s engine at specific times, customize car settings, and a lot more. These features that were envisioned went beyond what was to be conceived in Apple’s infotainment system, CarPlay. In fact, Apple was recently granted several automobile patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which seem to prove that there is indeed a Project Titan. But is there? According to the grapevine, the tech company is backing away from building a car, leaving hundreds unemployed. While Apple is now focusing its efforts on building a self-driving software, the Project Titan team is re-organizing. In fact, The New York Times reported that the hundreds of layoffs were part of a reboot process. Despite Apple’s new challenges, they remain a threat to seasoned car manufacturers, the latter already beefing up their software capabilities. They know better than to allow tech companies to acquire the lucrative software aspect of new automobiles. However, Apple may struggle with automotive suppliers. They may have wide contacts and often exclusive rights to certain suppliers of smart phones parts, but the reality is that more investments are required in dealing with automotive parts. This means that suppliers might not be keen on committing their products to Apple vehicles, which might initially be produced in small quantities. Reports say that Apple executives envisioned an electric car capable of recognizing the driver by fingerprint. They also imagined it being able to navigate with the press of a button. A plan was in place for a partially autonomous vehicle with steering wheel and pedals, but changed to a fully autonomous automobile. There are other companies that are working on devices and applications to unlock cars. BMW, for example, allows drivers of certain automobiles to lock and unlock with their smart phones. Another software company called Eleks Lab designed an experimental application that could allow drivers of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S to control the car using an Apple Watch. They can turn on its headlights to show where it’s parked. Hyundai also released a device called Android Wear watch. This watch can start a car’s engine, lock or unlock its doors, using the Blue Link system. Apple, meanwhile, has already been granted a patent that allows drivers to unlock their vehicles using an accessory control. Apple touch ID fingerprint recognition feature is a great concept of how the company’s visions translate from computing technology, which could transition to the automotive industry. With a slight push of a finger on the sensor, you will be taken to your destination. From engine to combustion-centric technologies, and now to autonomous driving, it is exciting how automobile technologies are evolving when companies start envisioning innovative improvements and start turning them into reality.

The device is a finely tuned, reliable melding of hardware and software, a strategy Apple has adopted since the iPhone’s inception. More importantly, the Pixel and Pixel XL are built from the ground up by Google, in terms of both design and software, a key element Nexus devices — which are now dead — desperately needed. When it comes to the Nexus line, a Google initiative that consists of my favourite smartphones of all time, contrary to what some might assume, manufacturers like LG and Huawei handled about 90 percent of the design process. With the Pixel’s creation, the entire development of the phone has been handled by Google. The company even reportedly eventually has ambitions to design its own proprietary chipsets in the same vein as Apple and Samsung. The phone’s manufacturing is handled by HTC, a fact Google intentionally didn’t mention during the device’s reveal, in the same way Foxconn makes Apple’s smartphones and tablets. This is a huge step for Google and a shift that moves the tech giant in line with Apple as an end-to-end hardware manufacturer, with devices like the Google Wi-Fi router, Google Home and the revamped 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra acting as further proof of the company’s new hardware direction. This new strategy is not without its faults, however. As Apple’s walled-garden slowly crumbles with the company opening up various aspects of iOS, such as iMessage and Siri, Google is building its own partially closed version of Android with the Pixel. It’s unclear what result the phone’s release will have on the broader Android ecosystem, particularly given Samsung’s recent Note 7 recall fiasco. Will the Pixel’s high-end build quality push Google’s manufacturing partners to step up their game like Microsoft’s Surface line did when it initially launched? Or will it instead ruin the open nature of Android, making an already disparate operating system even more confusing for the average consumer? These are questions that are nearly impossible to answer right now as the Android operating system enters uncharted waters with the launch of the Pixel. With all that said, however, let’s dive into the actual device. Pixel Specs Android 7.1 Aluminum body Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, 2.15Ghz Quad-core processor 5.0 inch, Full HD 1080 x 1920p pixels, 441 ppi with Gorilla Glass 4 4GB RAM 32GB or 128GB internal storage 12.3-megapixel camera (1.55um big pixels f/2.0, 4K video recording) 8-megapixel front-facing camera Fingerprint sensor, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light Bluetooth 4.2 3.5mm headphone jack 2,770 mAh battery with fast charge USB-C, Nano SIM slot 143.8mm x 69.5mm x 8.6mm Weight: 143 grams See Google’s band list Colours: Silver, Black, Blue Pixel XL Specs Android 7.1 Aluminum body Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, 2.15Ghz Quad-core processor 5.5 inch, Quad HD 1440 x 2560p pixels, 534 ppi with Gorilla Glass 4 4GB RAM 32GB or 128GB internal storage 12.3-megapixel camera (1.55um big pixels f/2.0, 4K video recording) 8-megapixel front-facing camera Fingerprint sensor, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light Bluetooth 4.2 3.5mm headphone jack 3,450 mAh mAh battery with fast charge USB-C, Nano SIM slot 154.7mm x 75.mm7 x 8.6mm See Google’s band list Weight: 168 grams Colours: Silver, Black Divisive looks Visually, both the Pixel and Pixel XL are divisive devices. The phone’s uni-body metal design is minimalist, though it’s difficult to deny that the Pixel doesn’t share aesthetic similarities with current and past iterations of the iPhone. While I agree that at first glance the Pixel looks like it was manufactured from spare iPhone parts, I’d argue that the same can be said about almost any modern smartphone. The Pixel’s slightly curved glass and sides give the phone a sleek profile. Its antenna bands are covertly placed on its top, with one also located on its base. An interesting Gorilla Glass 3 backing houses the Pixel’s fingerprint sensor, rounding out the design. Despite having a great feeling weight to it (168g with the XL and 143g for the Pixel) and an overall air of refinement and quality, the phone will still feel chunky to some, especially when compared to recently released Android devices like the Moto Z and the dearly departed Note 7, though the later comparison isn’t exactly fair given what a disaster Samsung’s latest flagship has become. Specifically, the Pixel and Pixel XL measures in at 8.5mm thick. To put the thickness of Google’s flagship in perspective, the iPhone 7 comes in at 7.1mm. While 1.4mm doesn’t sound like a significant amount on paper, placing the Pixel beside the iPhone 7, Note 7 or even the Moto Z, there’s a drastic difference in girth. Even when comparing this Pixel to last year’s well-received 6P, a phone that’s 7.5mm thick, the Pixel feels considerably larger. With that said, I warmed up to the Pixels’ thickness, especially after recently spending a few weeks with the Moto Z, a phone that I felt was perhaps a little too thin for its own good. To its credit, the chunky nature of the Pixel actually makes the phone feel more solid and durable than its contemporaries. Where the Pixel’s design falters is its large bezel, especially given its home, back and multitasking buttons are located on the screen. There is a significant amount of black space located just under the Pixel’s display. While large bezels are common on Android smartphones, the Pixel’s feels especially large. It’s as if the phone was meant to feature physical buttons, but Google opted to drop the feature at the last second. It’s worth noting that while the buttons are located on the display, it’s difficult to accidentally press them like it was with the HTC 10, a phone that the Pixel unsurprisingly shares design language with. And finally, in a very Apple-like move, a Google ‘G’ sits on the Pixel’s rear under the fingerprint scanner, just in case you forgot who created the device. Overall, I’m a huge fan of the Pixel and Pixel XL’s design, though I will admit I wasn’t at first. As I’ve spent more time with the the phone, however, its look has grown on me, though it’s difficult to deny that beyond its glass backing, the Pixel doesn’t have a standout, unique visual cue. Under the hood, however, is where the Pixel does pack a more reliable and standout punch than any Android device before it. Specs that push Pixels Between the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL, I’ve spent most of my time using the Pixel XL; I prefer smartphones with bigger displays and the larger form factor of the XL speaks to how I use my device on a daily basis. Specs-wise, the only difference between the two smartphones other than size, is screen resolution, with the Pixel coming in at a 1080 x 1920 pixels and the XL measuring in at 1440 x 2560 pixels. The AMOLED display featured in both phones is bright, vibrant and one of the best-looking screens I’ve seen featured in an Android device, rivaling the Note 7’s impressive glass. Videos, games and browsing the web all look spectacular on the Pixel. The Snapdragon 821 rounds out the Pixel’s hardware features, with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 128GB of storage, with a 3,450mAh battery in the XL and a 2,770mAh for the regular sized Pixel. While many of these specs are now the standard for high-end Android devices — though the Pixel is one of the first devices to feature the Snapdragon 821 — my time with Google’s phone has been a notably flawless experience. The phone is able to play high-end games, rapidly switch between apps, shoot video, snap photos and most importantly, browse the internet, all with a level of smoothness I have not experienced before with an Android device. While some of this fluidity is likely the result of the Pixel’s Snapdragon 821 processor, it’s also because this is the first Android device where the software and the hardware has been designed in unison. Issues that often affect high-end Android phones like screen lag or typing not being able to keep up with my fast moving fingers, are problems I haven’t encountered with the Pixel, at least not yet. The Snapdragon 821 also actually runs much cooler than the Snapdragon 820 in my experience. The Pixels’ power button and volume rockers are solid and placed on the right side of the phone. It’s fingerprint scanner, which sits on the rear like the Nexus 6P and 5X, is responsive and in my experiences, works under almost any conditions, even when my finger is slightly damp. The Pixel isn’t IP68 waterproof like the iPhone 7 and instead “IP53 water ingress,” which means it can withstand the occasional splash, but can’t be submerged under water. For some, water resistance is an expected feature with a smartphone in this price range, so this could be an issue. Battery life measures in at roughly a day with the XL, though in some cases I’ve managed to avoid charging the phone until the next morning. While the Pixel features a smaller power source, I’ve found battery life to be comparable across both devices. The ability to charge up to seven hours of battery life in just 15 minutes through the Pixel’s proprietary quick charge technology, is useful as well. Additionally, and most importantly for some, the Pixel and Pixel XL still feature a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, a fact Google placed cheeky emphasis on during the device’s reveal. Pixel perfect camera As the name ‘Pixel’ suggests, one of the Pixel and Pixel XL’s marquee features is its new camera. On paper, it may look like the Pixel’s camera features the same specs as last year’s Nexus devices — a 12.3 megapixel camera at f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 μm sized pixels on the back and an 8-megapixel front camera — but in reality, Google’s boasting about its impressive DxOMark seems to be true. It’s not as if the 5X and 6P featured bad camera technology, but as the months wore on, devices with better photography capabilities like the S7 and iPhone 7 hit store shelves, making the once impressive Nexus shooter seem older than it really was. The Pixel’s camera performs excellently under low-light and natural light, though the phone’s lack of true image stabilization seems to sometimes cause issues, especially under low-light conditions. These focusing problems rarely occurred, but sometimes when trying to snap photos quickly while jostling the phone around, the resulting shot ended up blurry. Google claims that some level of image stabilization is handled through the phone’s gyroscope, but in my experience, I found it didn’t always work very well. Gallery With so many high-end smartphone cameras snapping great photos in 2016, it’s difficult to say where the Pixel falls. Comparing shots with the iPhone 7 Plus, my favourite smartphone shooter, reveal that under almost all conditions, with the exception of low-light, the Pixel can certainly hold its own. On the plus side, both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature EIS video stabilization, a new feature Google showed off during the phone’s unveiling that makes videos look like the were shot with the phone placed in a gimbal; yes the video stabilization really is that impressive. I’d even go so far as to say that at least at first glance, EIS stabilized video shot with the Pixel rival the video that comes out of Panasonic’s upcoming Lumix G85 micro four thirds camera, which features 5-axis body stabilization. The Pixel’s image stabilization is very impressive and the kind of feature that’s only possible when the software and hardware of a device are designed to operate in unison. The ability to backup all images in their original quality for free via Google photos, a feature that’s exclusive to the Pixel, is also convenient and extremely useful. Google Assistant destroys Siri With the voice-assistant AI wars slowly heating up, one thing is already clear: Google Assistant is significantly ahead of Apple’s Siri. While the Pixel and Pixel XL are the first devices to feature Android 7.1, Google has also launched new offshoot features, which it says are exclusive to Pixel devices for the time being. Anyone who’s played around with Google’s Allo will be familiar with Google Assistant, a voice-activated assistant that scours the phone’s screen for search terms and responds to user questions, similar to previously launched Now on Tap. What makes Google Assistant different, however, is its conversational nature, which makes it significantly more contextual than Google Now or Now on Tap. Assistant is always collecting data from Google’s various services, including apps like Gmail, as well as Chrome web browsing activity. While this is likely a privacy issue for some, giving up your entire life to Google’s Skynet gives access to the first virtual assistant that I’ve actually found useful. Saying “Ok, Google” springs the assistant into action (you can also swipe up from home button to activate Google Assistant). A new window pops up in the lower section of the screen and a speech-to-text conversation tool launches. You’re then able to ask Google Assistant questions like, “Where is the nearest Starbucks?” to which the AI will respond with Google Maps-specific locations where you can purchase overpriced, fancy coffee. Where things get interesting is what you’re able to do next. For example, if you happen to have a follow-up question related to when that Starbucks location closes, simply tap the screen again and ask when that location will set to close. You don’t to clarify that you’re still talking about the same location; Assistant is smart enough to follow a conversation. While similar functionality is built into Google’s Allo app, having Google Assistant always-listening and available with a simple voice command or swipe, has made me actually use an AI for the first time. I’ve found it very difficult to come up with a question that Google Assistant doesn’t have some sort of answer to and I’ve never been able to say the same about Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana or Amazon’s Alexa. Furthermore, rather than respond in a robotic voice like Siri, Google Assistant displays a text confirmation that your question has been received and that the task is currently being accomplished. Responses are also speedy, significantly more so than Google Now and all in, Google Assistant is able to answer questions faster and more accurately than Siri. Google obviously has prowess in the search space because it’s behind the world’s most popular search engine and it seems like the company is finally harnessing that power through its mobile operating system in a way that makes sense. If Google Assistant is able to find an audience, it’s possible it could replace standard Google searches in a couple of years; yes, it really is that good. Polished Pixel launcher Google Assistant integration isn’t the only exclusive feature the Pixel is getting, the phone also includes a brand new Android overlay. While some have criticized the Pixel’s circular icons, I feel like they add a much-needed level of polish to Android’s sometimes confusing operating system. The ability to swipe up to launch the dock is also a great decision on Google’s part and I’m surprised that one of its partners, particularly Samsung, didn’t implement a similar feature years ago through its own launcher. While Android has always been a pretty operating system, the rampant skinning often done by manufacturers, particularly companies like LG, Samsung and a string of mid-range OEMs, have resulted in an operating system that never had a clear, concise identity. Sure, stock Android has always been the clearest vision of what Google wants its mobile operating system to be, but it’s always felt like the company was holding back with devices like the 6P and 5X in order to give its partners a blank slate. With the Pixel, that hesitation to add new exclusive features and a cleaner aesthetic direction are gone. How this changes the broader Android ecosystem remains unclear, but in the context of the Pixel, this is a welcome shift. High-end price tag for a high-end device The Pixel and Pixel XL are high-end devices with expensive price tags, with the latter fact coming as a shock to many fans of Google’s now-dead Nexus brand. Whether or not the cost of admission and significant price increase over the 6P and 5X are worth it will come down to what you value from a smartphone. I’d contend that while both the 6P and 5X were great devices, they’re severely lacking in certain areas, particularly build quality. So while the Pixel and Pixel XL are expensive, starting at $899 CAD and $1,029 CAD respectively, this cost puts the phones in line with the devices it’s vying to compete with like the S7 and iPhone 7. If you’re looking for a more affordable device with a mid-range price and high-end specs, there are great options out there. Smartphones like the OnePlus 3 and even the Axon 7 instantly come to mind and it’s not as if these devices are going anywhere when the Pixel launches. With the Pixel, Google is making a clear grab for the high-end smartphone market, with its sights set directly on the iPhone and to a lesser extent, high-end Android handsets from manufacturers like Samsung and LG. The included transfer cables, which allow users to easily transfer data from an iOS devices running iOS 8 or higher, directly to the Pixel, is yet another example of Google’s overarching goal with the new direction of its hardware division. While the Pixel and Pixel XL might not be the smartphone for everyone anymore, the high-end devices are exactly what the Android ecosystem needs right now. Make no mistake, the Pixel is the Android device you’ve been waiting for. The Pixel is set to be available on October 20th through the Google Store as well as at Canadian carriers. Pros Sleek looking and feels high-end Google Assistant is great Circular skin adds a level of polish to Android Reliable melding of hardware and software Cons Expensive, especially in Canada Not water resistant Design may be too simple for some Second opinion Igor Bonifacic The Pixel is the five-inch smartphone I’ve been waiting for Google to make since I first dipped my toes into the Android ecosystem with the Galaxy Nexus back in 2011. The company has created a palm-sized smartphone that isn’t a compromise; the Pixel features impressive internals, a bold new take on Android, and, at long last, a camera that is not a liability in all but the most favourable lighting conditions. As with all Android devices, we’ll have to wait and see how the Pixel performs down the road (lest it be forgotten, Android lag is still a very real thing), but after one week with the device — far too little time, I admit — I’m happy to report the Pixel is a joy to use. Unlike the Nexus 5X, which suffered a number of performance-related issues that no amount of software tweaking by Google seemed capable of fixing, the Pixel is snappy, and I’ve yet to see any apps crash or hang up. Similarly, Assistant has also been a revelation. In the past, I’ve seen little utility in personal assistants like Siri and Cortana, but with its ability to correctly parse speech and infer context from previous queries, Assistant has won me over. I can see it becoming a favourite feature of many future Pixel users. Granted, unlike the Nexus 5X, the Pixel costs $899, $450 more than the $449.00 I paid to get my 32GB Nexus 5X last year. Given its less than stellar looks, some may end up scoffing at the price, but given how few small high-end smartphones there are out there, particular in the Android ecosystem, this is the 5-inch smartphone to get.

Are you guys fanboyz or what? Patrick O’Rourke The lack of waterproofing sucks, but other than the Xperia line, it’s rare for a high-end Android device to feature IP68. The camera takes great pics, probably better than the iPhone 7 Plus, it’s just the lack of image stabilization becomes an issue under rare circumstances. MrQ Galaxy flagships are also IP68 And OIS works/comes in handy for every picture, it is not limited to “rare circumstances” neo905 Except the Pixel takes great pictures the majority of the time based on early reviews I have read. So the instances it wouldn’t would be rare. MrQ OIS helps with camera/hand shake, slow shutter speed, not image quality neo905 I know what it does. In reviews I’ve read so far the camera has gotten high marks and it performs better than phones with OIS for videos and stills. OIS isn’t the end all and be all. Zbiba The important thing is the end-result, maybe it would have been better with OIS but the fact that it doesn’t have it doesn’t seem to hurt the quality of the picture and videos nearly enough to make any fuss out of it Patrick O’Rourke I’m not saying is isn’t useful, I think you’ve misunderstood. OIS is dope and extremely useful, but with the Pixel, I didn’t miss it at all, not until I tried to shoot in really low light. Whatever magic Google has done with the Pixel’s software has made OIS not a necessity. thereasoner It’s the high quality VR sensors that can pull double duty to help enhance EIS for the cameras with adjustments up to 200 times per second. A smart move by Google to place them in the phone instead of their VR headset like Samsung did. monsterduc1000 “OIS is dope and extremely useful, but with the Pixel, I didn’t miss it at all, not until I tried to shoot in really low light. Whatever magic Google has done with the Pixel’s software has made OIS not a necessity.” Except in low light situations. Patrick O’Rourke Yes, that is what the comment says lol. monsterduc1000 Ha! But not really. In one sentence you say you didn’t miss it until a low light situation arrived, but in the next you say you don’t need it at all due to software optimisation. So I’m just wondering which is it? thereasoner Actually “really” low light conditions, probably something that can be addressed in future software tweaks I would think. perfectlyreasonabletoo “Galaxy flagships are also IP68” and are prone to explosion. MrQ S7/S7 edge? Collin dubya what good is a phone being waterproof if it explodes? MrQ There are other Galaxy phones too, you know? Sean-Paul Dumbest response ever. Must be an iPhone fan boy. Deadly Disco lol like 1% of the phones sold had an issue, the rest is so blown out of proportion and exploding is not the same as a bomb going off, they mean the case was ruptured. But i agree Samsung is taking the lead in trying to replace the phones, apple ignored their issues with the iPhone 5 and 6 for like a year, then instead of offering a replacement for their iPhone 5 with the battery issues, they ignored it and swept it under the carpet until all of their user base complained and they faced lawsuits, then they issued a recall. But only if the devices were from a specific batch. Smanny Patrick you didn’t mention anything about Daydream VR which is embedded in this device (both hardware and software). Are you going to review Daydream VR separately? Patrick O’Rourke Indeed I am. I couldn’t really talk about Daydream in this review because, well, I haven’t tried it yet (other than a few minutes at Google’s keynote). Deadly Disco if you want water proofing put it in a ziplock bag.. LOL Iphone took 10 years to come out with theirs Brett Allard Some of these are subjective… Unless you plan on swimming with your device it’s not a deal breaker for most. The look itself is fantastic (perhaps it looks identical to a Honor 8) I don’t understand how you think the back looks ‘ugly’ when everything that LG released in the last year looks more plain then a bowl of oatmeal! fred Waterproofing is a must now that both Samsung and Apple have it on their flagship. No excuse. Maybe you don’t plan on swimming, and you might not plan in dropping it in the water by accident, but that may happen nonetheless. Ruining a $1000 device that could not have been ruined. Brett Allard So because Apple and Samsung have a feature means that every other manufacturer has to follow through with the same? If you decide to go swimming with your device in the first place that’s your own stupidity..using your phone in the rain or Dropping your phone in a toilet and or puddle is a more realistic example as I myself have done so in the past.. However IP53 is more then enough protection to prevent these accidents from happening. Mike Simpson The marketing-driven reality is that hyped-up specs drive design just as much as actual consumer needs do. I’ve never put much value on waterproofing because I’ve never felt it necessary. In a market where there is little actual room for innovation but one manufacturer is always trying to make their phones look better than their competitors’, however, anything new that can be made to seem important will become a big feature. As a result, other manufacturers competing in the same price bracket will have to include it in their designs so it doesn’t look like their have skimped on features. Apple demonstrated this a few years ago when the most conspicuous design ‘improvement’ they could market on several successive iPads was how much thinner each one was than the last one. We now know where that might have led us with the Note 7. fred IP53 is not enough for a drop in the water. It doesn’t mean it will fail, but there is no warranty it will survive. And swimming with a phone is not stupid it’s useful to be able to take pictures in the water. thomas nguyen yes. “let me take the phone and take pictures in the water” is something that is certainly spoken by everyone. fred it is, when you get out of your basement thomas nguyen haha, the majority of Canada lives inland, where the closest water system is either your bath or a lake, and 1/4 of the year it’s frozen over, and mostly it’s not a water system where you would be jumping into, or clear enough to take said pictures. sure it’s good for vacationing and taking pictures of the coral reef, but that is a small fraction of the people actually going. maybe you should rethink the criticality of taking a picture in the water vs. real life expectations and usage. maybe for you it is a hit or miss, but for others, it’s plainly shows that it’s a nice to have, but not a make it or break it decision fred I think a lot of people in Canada goes on or near a lake from time to time. A phone you can bring when in canoe is nice and useful. And yes, people do drop their phone into the bath. thomas nguyen maybe it’s me, but I don’t need a phone in the bath. as for being on / in a lake, that’s a great scenario, but again, the amount of people that use that feature is miniscule compared to the people that spends their time going from home, to work, to the store, and back at home. I stand by my point, it’s a great feature to have, and as much as people want it, it is not critical to the functionality of the phone. it’s like arguing all phone needs to have a bumper or a rubber exterior built into the phone because it helps with the phone being damaged / broken when dropped. sure there are people and scenarios that can justify it being developed, but it’s not critical to the way the phone functions. But of course, if you or anyone is in a market for a phone with those specific features, I can see your expectation being lost, but as far as I can tell, there are phones out there that can do what you want. It’s just where do you compromise? You can’t have everything in every phone 😀 fred I’m sure those who drop their phone in the bath by accident didn’t need their phone in the bath to begin with, but there it is nonetheless Brett Allard Except it’s not so useful when you actually do drop it in the lake and are unable to retrieve it after lol.. fred it doesn’t have to be deep. I dropped a phone in the lake and recovered it. Patrick O’Rourke What about a toilet or sink? fred If both Apple and Samsung do it, it becomes an expectation. It means it’s no longer a plus to be IP67/68, it’s a minus if you aren’t. Brett Allard That’s the problem with Consumers and ‘expectations’ people want everything for less clearly you are one of those that fall into that category. fred Exactly, I want the best for my money. No phone is perfect. But I still think no IP68 is a big mistake for a $900 phone in 2016. For me it is the 2nd biggest deal-breaker (after the pricing). Brett Allard Unfortunately there aren’t many devices that have joined the IP68 crowd other then the Samsung/Apple devices.. That right there tells me you would never consider any other device other then those that are listed as IP68. Pricing aside (everyone has a different budget) I’ll take the better processor and Camera over waterproofing any day..(i know I’m not in the minority) fred First Apple is IP67 instead of IP68. Not as good, but can be good enough for many users. There might not be many devices with IP67 or better, still, the major flagships have it (Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7). Google is trying to position itself against these two flagships (similar price). Is the camera and the processor so much better on the Pixel compared to these two? Better enough to out-weight the lack of waterproofing? Fortunately Google has other advantages like a pure OS, better updates (better than Samsung) and a more open, less vendor locked-in OS (better than Apple) otherwise it wouldn’t sell. Brett Allard The snapdragon 821 is much better then the 820 and benchmarks prove it.. The camera is also proven as better then the IPhone 7 plus. (at first I had a hard time figuring this out as it seemed quality were both similar) fred The 821 is an overclocked 820. It’s a marginal improvement not worth 6 months wait over the Galaxy S7. The camera seems great. But again, is it worth 6 months (half a generation) over the S7? Don’t forget the Pixel will compete against the future S8 for half of the year. Brett Allard You are wrong.. It’s clocked at the same speed as the 820. This is one of the things we were shown during demo testing! fred You can underclock the 821 to the 820 speed. Qualcom still says it is designed for higher clock speed. Brett Allard You can!? How about as is? Brett Allard Bottom line you buy a pixel device.. It’s clocked st the same speed.. Brett Allard your reasoning is somewhat irrelevant.. As time goes by you could say the same thing about the S8 when the next (Pixel) big device comes around the corner assuming the processor and camera etc are better. If people can wait until September/October for the new IPhone (Which usually stomps every android device on the market at the time of release) the same can be said about almost any other device release. Keep in mind not everyone Pays full price for thier devices and contract upgrades differ month to month from person to person. Bottom line your not going to wait 6 Months for a new device if your in the market for one right away. If this was released say February and the S8 is just weeks around the corner then I would agree with you 100 percent. fred The thing is, the Pixel/Nexus October release has historically been closer, generation-speaking, to the previous Galaxy S release than the next one. This one is no different. Other than the pure Google experience, I’d rather have a Galaxy S7 in April than a Pixel in October. The S8 is going to have the next snapdragon or Exynos. The Pixel has an incremental update (SD821) not worth 6 months. Put it this way, the S7 is still a good buy. The Pixel also is, but won’t be when the S8 will be released. Brett Allard That’s the inevitable Which is still 6 months away! So say you want a device now and your contract is up do you wait the 6 months or go ahead with the next big thing? What if you could never get your S7 in April but now you have that opportunity? fred I don’t know I don’t like contracts NoWayHosEH The 821 runs cooler then the 820. I would rather let someone else use the new chip. How do you know if the pixel won’t be competitive when the s8 comes out. Sammy now is going to make sure it works and they may not to the extreme with extra stuff. Personally I am done with samsung and their crappy after purchase service. neo905 What about that 720P screen on the 7. Should Google have gone backwards with that? How about the lack of Quick charge on the iPhone. It takes forever and a day for that thing to charge it’s tiny battery. You can’t just cherry pick the features you like and ignore areas they are falling behind. I will be charging the phone and looking at the screen far more than it will be getting wet. fred Good points, the iPhone has a bad display for a flagship. And the connector and chargers for the iPhone suck too. BetelgeuseOrion you are wrong, the iphone 7 is 750p because they have to one up the bare bottom garbage android devices. they still fail though, even cheap phones for $279 CDN (zenfone 3 laser) has 1080p neo905 Really dude? 720 or 750p. Spec wise it’s still trash. Let’s not quibble here. Next thing you will be saying the Pixel XL is really 5.46″ not 5.5″ thomas nguyen that is where you’re wrong, just because other does it, it doesn’t mean that it is now a standard. fred when that “others” is the two market leaders then yes, it become an expectation thomas nguyen I don’t know. I think that logic applies to many things, but this isn’t. Samsung released this in the galaxy s5, sony released this in their last few, they targeted niche people. It is just now that it hit Apple that this has become an “expectation”. Where do we draw the line? Motorola and Apple released phones without headphone jack, if every phone now loses that jack, is that expected because an industry leader does it? how about the removal of the SD Card, is that now considered an expectation? Water resistant is not critical in a phone, unlike ports, so really maybe your expectation of certain “features” only pertain to you or a small portion of the people. fred Well if Samsung removes the 3.5mm hack then yes, I think it would be wise to check if there is one included when buying a phone. But lack of feature is not the same as a feature. water resistance is a feature. Not having a 3.5mm jack isn’t. thomas nguyen But same logic applies, just because some manufacturers does it, it should not be expected others will, especially when considering features or lack thereof NoWayHosEH Then go buy them. That’s the beauty of choice. Zee I currently have a Sony Xperia Z3 which is waterproof, when I initially got it I took it to a swimming pool to “show off” with my family who were all very impressed. After that I really didn’t need the waterproof feature ever again. Brett Allard That’s kind of how I see it as well… I mean sure it’s a cool feature but how often is the average human being going to take thier device ‘swimming’? It’s a pro to have it included in your device but not a deal breaker of a con where I would change my mind about buying it. Zee If it’s that important to you, then someone should just go get a waterproof phone. For me it was “cool” but not needed. gommer strike Waterproofing is now the standard on phones that reach the $800 – 1000 mark. So no, not everyone has to do it, just because Apple/Samsung/Sony have. Let’s remember that Sony and Samsung had this feature on their phones for *years* now. The Galaxy S5 debuted in 2014 with waterproofing, for instance. It’s Apple who was slow and late to the party. Well finally they have waterproofing(and officially so, not “soft” water resistance as was on the iPhone 6s, which didn’t count as a feature), and now that they do – the biggest players in field who play in the most expensive high-end space, have it. If your phone is midrange-priced and no waterproofing? Forgivable. One Plus 3 has no waterproofing, and it really doesn’t matter. You can buy two of those for the price of a single iPhone 7/Galaxy 7/Pixel. Phones like the Axon 7, and many other phones in the $400 – $600 don’t have this or that – and it’s totally fine. But if you want to play in the $800+ space – the lack of features(yes, even though just because iPhone made it cool) is all the more magnified. Smanny You still cannot swim with any device with IP67/68. If you do swim with it, then you will take a major risk and could break your warranty. fred No you don’t. Under 30 minutes the device must survive. NoWayHosEH But samsung don’t have timely updates all the time and I would trade waterproofing for direct timely updates. Now wireless charging I wish it had but not a deal breaker. Hopefully it will be in the next one. Deadly Disco not water proofing, water resistant and not for an extended period, its like up to 5′ of water but try leaving the phone in it for 30 mins… then this water proofing really doesn’t work well. Additionally, smart people who actually are smart don’t get their phones wet, for those who drop it in the toilet or drop it in the water on the street, those aren’t smart people. if you want to use your phone in the rain. Put it in a zip lock bag LOL, or like a smart person, wait until your under a canopy or something…. sheez. Oh and dont use it in the rain, unless of course your under an umbrella fred IP67 means the phone must survive under 1m of water for 30 minutes… Patrick O’Rourke Yup, totally subjective. I get why people hate the look of the phone and in fact, I wasn’t a fan of it at first. Once I got it in my hands though, it quickly grew on me. Brett Allard Patrick I have a question.. Did you ever get a chance to test out the 3.5mm Headphone jack for audio quality? Patrick O’Rourke I did! Audio quality with the speakers is decent, but not iPhone 7 level. The headphone jack is fine and performed the same as any other device. Brett Allard I found the speaker quality average.. However I never did test out the 3.5mm Headphone jack. Here’s another question. You say it’s on par with other android devices. Yet devices like the V20, HTC 10 and the Axon 7 have amazing sound quality due to having a built in amplifier.. I doubt it’s comparable to either of those devices but is it say S7/note 7 quality? Zbiba The S7 is known for having a very average dac. In fact it’s (the snapdragon variant) worst then the S6. I’m also looking for some info about the dac, I’m hoping it’s of the same caliber as the HTC 10. I think I’ll wait for the Galaxy S8 reveal, then I’ll decide which phone to upgrade to. I feel the Pixel has one too many compromise for the price. Brett Allard I found out through a few sources that there is very little degradation and volume levels are above average… The best device to compare said audio quality would be the IPhone 7 which itself is quite good (Not class leading but more then acceptable as a portable audio device) I’m hoping by next Friday when I have the device in hand I can do better testing.. As of right now information is still limited. Zbiba Alright, let me know what you think about it Alex Perry I have a $800 credit on my Rogers account from my Note 7 saga. The people at the store are RAVING about the Pixel and all I can think about is why someone would pay $1100+ for this phone. No Waterproofing, No SD Card Slot, No Best in Class Screen, No Best in Class Battery Life. I know I picked a “exploding” phone but buying a Pixel at this point would be paying the same price for last years phone. Brett Allard Except the screen is pretty darn close to ‘best in class’ if you had time to use one like myself and the few others this would perhaps change your mind! At this point the only real downsides are in fact the IP53, lack of expandable memory and no image stabilization.. Having the best in class processor and camera must not mean alot these days. thomas nguyen the EIS lives up to it’s name, it’s fantastic based on a few reviews. Brett Allard I was actually blown away.. Truth be told I thought we would be viewing lacklustre screens. thomas nguyen I think on paper too many people see the lack of OIS as a make it or break it, but the replacement far exceeds the expectation of people using it, as well as in direct comparison. Patrick O’Rourke I’d go so far as to say the Pixel’s screen is just as good as the Note 7’s. NoWayHosEH AND don’t forget the non carrier dependant updates. That has real value, at least to me and that is what I like about the apple iphone. David Lynch The lack of waterproof and dustproof is the lone reason I won’t trade my Note7 for it. My previous phone was a Note5 – removable battery and no proofing – and it clogged with dust after 2-years of constant biking and running with it on dusty trails. Other than that, Google is now competing with the top phones. Well done on them. Waqqas Khokhar You mean your previous phone was a Note4? thomas nguyen Nope, note 5 is a real thing. They skipped only one number this year. Nathan He means that the Note 4 had a removable battery, The Note 5 didn’t thomas nguyen Ahh, gotcha David Lynch Yes, my mistake. thomas nguyen apparently the EIS performs much better than the OIS of even the nexus 6p. Water resistant might be a detractor, but really I had a phone for the past 7 years without a need to use it in the bath/shower, so this isn’t a total loss. The other thing you stated are purely aesthetic and your value of the device as a whole (possibly comparing to the nexus line). This phone is on paper and in practice comparable to other phones in the price bracket. Now if it lags in the next month, that is still something that needs to be considered. thereasoner EIS+VR sensors that can make adjustments up to 200 times per second in place of OIS works very well according to reviews and video I’ve seen. Plus no camera bump as a bonus! Bryan Breguet And only two years of updates Deadly Disco says the iphone lover 😛 Ipse “These are not the droids you’re looking for ” OK, maybe I’m dating myself, but the point is people were waiting for a Nexus-type phone, mostly high end but with a reasonable sticker price. Google copied a page from Apple’s book and threw it at us. More cons: – camera is not so great in low light…DxO must have conveniently left that testing as summary as possible – can’t unlock bootloader? What’s then the differentiator worth of a Google phone”? – no wireless charging in this day and age? I ONLY use this method and probably not alone – of course no SD card…splurge on the 128GB, won’t you gremlin0007 Agreed! What initially attracted people to the Nexus line was the price vs specs. The Nexus 5 was an amazing price vs spec’ed phone. Then it got more and more expensive for avg specs down the line. They definitely went Apple style…but Apple’s marketing skills are spectacular. Patrick O’Rourke The phone is great in low light as long as you keep the camera steady. This is where the lack of image stabilization comes into play. I’ve never had an interest in wireless charging because to me, current wireless charging technologies aren’t really “wireless.” No Nexus device to my knowledge has ever included an SD card slot so I’m not sure it’s fair to expect it with the Pixel, though I do hear where you’re coming from with that one. I think what people are missing about this phone is how smoothly it runs. Seriously, it’s been a flawless experience in the little over a week that I’ve had it. This stems from Google handling both the hardware and software for the Pixel. This might be a page from Apple’s book, but it’s definitely a good page to copy, especially in the high-end space. There are phones out there that meet almost all the requirements you mention in your comment, Google just isn’t interested in making that device anymore. They’re doing after a different market. TouchMyBox The Nexus One had an SD Card slot. 🙂 (and a laughable amount of useful onboard memory) Patrick O’Rourke Did it? I had no idea. I imagine it’s likely the only Nexus device to feature one. Zach Gilbert We also have to remember, this isn’t a Nexus. So it isn’t really fair to compare it to one. Just like it isn’t fair to compare an iPhone to an Android device. They are both awesome devices and that means that not one is perfect for everyone. monsterduc1000 “This stems from Google handling both the hardware and software for the Pixel” HTC handled the hardware, since they actually built the phone. Devhux HTC only built the phone (like Foxcomm builds iPhones). The design is all Google monsterduc1000 Really? Because isn’t it Samsung that supplies (and I’m pretty sure designed) the screen, Qualcomm that designed the SD821 in it, Sony that designed the camera… so on… so forth… I think the only thing Google actually did was add that very ugly looking piece of glass on the back. thereasoner That applies to many OEMs phones really. The Pixel is still all Google with absolutely no input in the hardware/software choices made from the assembler chosen, in this case HTC. Christopher Robert Holy Bezel….and still not a Note 7 Patrick O’Rourke There’s a button on the back that transforms it into a Note 7 🙂 thomas nguyen yup, same button will activate a self destruct sequence similar to inspector Gadget. Unorthodox If I ever wanted an iPhone, I’d buy an iPhone. Google lost it’s ways. The open space is turning into another walled garden, this time assisted and in future controlled by AI. Good luck with that. I’m feeling claustrophobic. MXM4K I’m sure this phone is fantastic if you’re willing to pay the price for it. For those of us who enjoyed the Nexus experience over the years, keep an eye out for the other manufacturers to come up with comparable phones in the near future. There’s a void in the premium mid-tier vanilla Android space now. I’m sure it’ll get filled soon. Until then, I’m rocking my Nexus 6P for a while until it starts running slow, then I’ll flash custom roms to give it a breath of fresh air when the time comes. Patrick O’Rourke I think that space is always going to exist and there are already great phones that fill that void like the OnePlus 3. Techguru86 Oneplus can never seem to manage the hardware and software in unison, I’ve seen side by side reviews where the O+3 gets destroyed in testing, camera, wifi testing. Patrick O’Rourke Yup, that’s the biggest issue with a lot of Android device and something the Pixel doesn’t suffer from. thomas nguyen the Zenfone3 too is a good option. Devhux …. That will be lucky to see Nougat (don’t hold your breath, if the Zenfone 2 or any of the ZenPads are any indication) HiKsFiles I keep on reading Google Assistance is far beyond what Siri is capable of. Is this affirmation only valid when using English or is Google Assistant just as powerfull, say, in French? From experience, expectations rapidly meet disapointment when the default “English mode” is not used in many smartphone newest functionnalities/technologies… Patrick O’Rourke That’s a great question that I have no idea the answer to. I’ll have to reach out to Google. HiKsFiles Thanks! If you ever get an answer, please let us know. A strong argument in Siri’s favour is that she’s just as good (or bad, depends on your point of view héhé) in French as she is in English. The same can’t be further from the truth with S-Voice for example. It’s just plain unusable in French. Maybe in fr_FR, but most definitely not in fr_CA ! Cheers! Brad Fortin The part of the retail packaging for the Pixel that has to do with the Assistant currently states “La version française arrivera bientôt”, right above what I imagine is a similar message in spanish. HiKsFiles Still, the question remains : when it’s released, will it be as “powerfull” as its English counterpart!? 😉 Philippe Paquet Patrick, “5.0 inch, Quad HD 1080 x 1920p pixels, 441 ppi with Gorilla Glass 4” I think you meant Full HD, right 😉 ? Only the XL is QHD. Patrick O’Rourke Thanks for the heads-up. EWZ Obviously, a lot of Nexus-lovers are screaming about the price point for this new launch, which is a bit ignorant as they are only focusing on the name rather than the specs and dev cost of – like you said – the hardware/software integration. Patrick/Igor, at this price point (I don’t care that it’s coming from Google, or formerly was Nexus), do you think the value is worth the price of admission? If having to select between the Samsung S7 and G’s Pixel – since they’re in the same price point – which would have more value for the price? Which would you select? Thanks! Patrick O’Rourke I’d always go with the XL, just because I like larger phones. The Pixel is expensive, especially the XL, but it’s the best Android phone yet in terms of reliability and performance. It depends on what you value in a phone really. Zee Patrick which carrier are you using it on and can you do an LTE speedtest? Patrick O’Rourke I used it with koodo, but I can run a test soon and let you know. thomas nguyen when comparing the normal usage from the pixel vs. PxL, is there a noticeable difference in speed and usability? Patrick O’Rourke I mostly used the Pixel XL, but didn’t notice a difference in performance between either device. AppleBerrySandwich Waiting for a price drop in the new year when my contract is up. I’m pretty sure I’m in for a Pixel XL – Love what I am reading on these phones. I love Apple’s refinement, I hate the closed Eco system. This phone is it! Frank The Pixel sure looks like a good phone especially it’s specs and I don’t think anyone who’s being honest with themselves can completely disagree. The problem with the Pixel is at it’s current price point other Android flagships from Samsung, HTC, LG and others all have extra features, whether it be Waterproofing, wireless charging, quickcharge 3, SD slot, camera OIS or Audio DAC which makes them more interesting and a better value for the money. Those missing features didn’t bother users with the Nexus line because of it’s pricing, it was simply a matter of compromise for the best cost/value ratio. With the Pixel, the game has changed and from where I’m standing the value just isn’t there. southerndinner Nice review for a fairly overpriced phone. I wish I could replace my Note 7 with this but the lack of waterproofing, SD card and an even remotely compelling design makes the a total nonstarter for me Surveillance Waterproofing is overhype if you ask me. Most incidents involving water has the owner quickly scooping it up and drying it off. But could you imagine these phones running IOS10 out of the box? southerndinner Waterproofing is absolutely not “overhype”. It’s how many phones get damaged. Warren Chang That completely depends on who you ask because I have never once thought my phone needed to be waterproof. I have never owned a car, rent occasionally, so I’ve had to walk or take public transport and I’ve traveled in quite a few rain showers, mostly without an umbrella because I’m stubborn that way and never have I had a phone die on me from water damage. Most of my phones get replaced through age despite them going through all kinds of hell from the elements from freezing cold, thunderstorms, sandy beaches and unbearable sunny heat. For me waterproofing is just not something that have ever concerned me and I have yet to meet anyone who has lost a phone from water damage and I have alot of tech geek friends who buy phones. thomas nguyen that is true, but so is dropping the phone. a lot of the cases it’s due to misuse, that is why we now have insurance company out to replace your phone because people don’t understand how to properly take care of their stuff. Don’t get me wrong, similar to insurance, rarely ever needed, but you’re glad you had it when you do. I don’t believe it is critical that every phone needs to have this. Patrick O’Rourke I’d say the Pixel is a great replacement for the Note 7 (I’m still lamenting the loss of my Note 7). Moose I understand why Google went upmarket – there is too much good competition in the mid-range and budget sectors plus it is hard to make much money at that end of the spectrum, especially now that markets are getting saturated and there is so much more choice, which means that any one brand can’t expect to sell huge numbers – better to sell fewer phones with a higher profit margin. However, I think the high end of the market is a dying breed because so many mid-priced phones have high end specs these days. Also, competing against Apple is a losing proposition because Apple has a monopoly on iOS while no one has a monopoly on Android, which makes all Android phones much more price sensitive. Good luck Google. I won’t be paying that kind of cash with so many great phones around the $400 mark. Gimmicks like assistants, high end cameras or audio, secondary screens, force touch, 3D displays, etc, are not real value propositions to me. Brett Allard I agree with you 100 percent on this statement.. This is why I went Upper mid range this year for both my mobile devices.. I’ll take excellent performance and build quality over gimmicks that ultimately inflate the price (Even if these gimmicks are ultimately useful and practical) beyond it’s kind of fugly Mike Simpson It sounds like a high-end phone but like the Samsung S7 Edge, those specs don’t excite me. I exchanged the S7 Edge I had for a Note7 mostly because the added benefit of the stylus justified the price. The S7 Edge felt nice, looked nice and was slick but it was still just a phone to me. Still, I’m now having to look at some considerably cheaper options to replace the features I miss on the Note7 and I am curious to find out, having tried some high-end phones, if I notice a significant drop in the quality of the user experience. If so, I’ll be even more convinced that phones like the S7 Edge, Pixel and iPhone are more about fashion than functionality. Budrow 420 Ltd If I had a few drinks I could possibly take this phone home for the night. It looks too much like my ex – and I have a lot of baggage in my old relationship with her. My ex was an iPhone btw. I’m sure it is a great device – and I do understand why Google is going right after Apples market. With the OP and the Axon and others that are offering high specs at low prices – Google is smart to go after the big dogs. I will hold out for the Pixel 2. JD Huge bezels. That’s what you get for basing a “flagship” on some POS midranger A9 Mike Lovell What this guy said. ^ thomas nguyen Huge bezel is due to the symmetry required for “daydream” to fit in the accessory, the screen had to be centered. and the lower bezel is huge due to the top bezel requiring all the sensors. JD Daydream can suck a dick thomas nguyen I’m sure some people may use it for certain things, that being one of them. thereasoner Lol ! JD The Pixel is an uncompromising Nexus but a compromised flagship in everyway down to its bloodline and maker. thomas nguyen interesting take, what do you mean by that? I don’t know if I read that as a positive or a negative. Bob Loblaw $900 CAD before taxes just for the 32 GB. Ridiculous price for minimal storage. Looks like you need more GB…. here’s an excessive amount for an even more ridiculous price! No thanks. Call me when we have affordable phones in Canada again. thomas nguyen Guess this is the last time you will get a phone call! 😀 thereasoner Actually, the storage for full resolution video and pictures is unlimited :-), that sure as heck is going to free up tons of space on my Pixel. Bob Loblaw Who knows how long that will be. Google could change the terms of service at any moment and you’d lose access to “unlimited” storage. Take a look at what MS did with Onedrive. thereasoner That would be suicide for the Pixel brand and it’s brand new. I don’t see it happening, it’s an important feature that sets it apart from the others . They may have to cap it at some point but I expect Google to continue to beat the others in free storage regardless. That and One Drive was never more than 15 GB free and Google has already been giving that and more free for years already. I’ve got 17 or 19 free GB (can’t remember) from Google already having picked up extra just for checking my security settings when prompted. It’s getting full however so this Pixel deal will be great for me. Andrew Not everyone’s comfortable storing their photos on the cloud. Personally, the only thing I let my phone sync online are my contacts. I keep everything else local, and like it that way. That’s why I purchased a 128GB Nexus 6P. $900 for 32GB is definitely excessive. The phone’s specs are impressive (though the lack of waterproofing and stereo speakers are very noticeable oversights on a phone asking such a premium price), but in terms of value for money this is a HUGE step down from last year’s 6P. joe2disqus i would title this phone as “high end” in terms of pricing not in terms of features and materials used… thomas nguyen why do you say that? what about the materials and features are missing? joe2disqus I am sure you would get to know if you read all the comments further down below. 900 cad for the 32 gig is too much ask for the hardware that they have just delivered, “greedy google”.. If they continue to go in this way then there is no doubt that the pixel branding will be gone in few years.. Here are the negatives imo, – no OIS (for better low light photography) – mediocre display (poor sunlight visibility) – little older gorilla glass which is less sturdier – no stereo speakers – no expandable storage – ugly bottom chin – no Ir blaster and etc… HelloCDN Agreed. Google has a lot to learn in terms of product marketing their supposedly premium products. None of these are big omissions, yet all of them add up enough to question spending $1049 plus tax on a “premium” product that doesn’t even come with headphones in the box… thereasoner – OIS is for stability NOT low light. The Pixel cameras have excellent stability thanks to a combination of EIS + VR sensors that check up to 200 times per second. Also, reviews are showing great low light performance thanks to the extra large pixels used in these cameras. – the displays are also reviewing well, not the brightest but more than adequate for outdoor use. -GG4 is fine, GG5 just came out -the other stuff is replaced by the Pixels own exclusive features like AI Assistant, free unlimited storage, 24/7 on device support etc. Brad Fortin OIS is for both, isn’t it? The improved stability allows for longer exposure, which results in better low-light shots. Technically EIS only works during video but they’re doing image stacking, where they combine parts of multiple images, so I’m sure they have an EIS-like algorithm working to align and and stack the images correctly. Erik Tyler I think the circle icons were a huge visual mistake, especially when 3rd party apps remain rectangular. There’s no consistency at all (although you claim there is?). A bad mix of circles and standard icons. Also, most icons are just shrunken versions stuffed into a circle, instead of redesigns (like maps or the calculator). Seems like a halfhearted effort and a real shame… thereasoner I use folders to organize all the common apps I use so it works for me. The last thing I want to see is an iPhone like wall of icons. NoWayHosEH A lot of people are stuck on just having more and more features in there device. What I am really happy about is the more frequent updates direct from Google with no carrier interference or phone manufacturer bloat ware which causes lag even on top spec phones. Though I do wish it looked better but I don’t buy a phone to make a fashion statement, I just want it to work and work fast. RichHomieGuan honestly i think majority of us are just stuck on the pricing, i mean regardless of whether apple or android is better, the reason why i didnt get an iPhone is because it was too damn expensive… again i can never justify spending over $1000 on a phone even on contract phones these days are expensive lol thereasoner There’s a lot of great alternatives with flagship like specs at more affordable prices. The Axon 7, Honor 8 and One Plus 3 are calling out to you. RichHomieGuan I’m currently using the OP3 lol after I saw the pixel pricing I decided returning my OP3 was longer needed Not for you Couple of questions/points: – How usable is the regular pixel for one-handed use? I found the 5X too wide for this, and returned it after a week – How slippery is the pixel compared to other metal backed phones? I’d prefer not having to use a case as that adds bulk. – I don’t see any comment on how well ambient display works? Has it gotten any better over marshmallow? I’d imagine it works great with an AMOLED screen. – Please tell me the device in Igor’s video is the XL – it looks way to big for one-handed use JammerMan79 No micro SD, no buy… Lil’ Cwyin’ PC ChinnBoi 128 not enough…? JammerMan79 Nope… I have one phone with 90gigs used between internal and external and a second phone with 135 gigs used (combined) Lil’ Cwyin’ PC ChinnBoi Oy gevalt! GordyDevice How come there was no mention of the lack of memory expansion via SD card and a removable battery. These two items are high in my selection of my next phone. SD card can be loaded up with media when traveling in no network zone, which is more common in cottage country. Replaceable battery, they wear out more frequently or refuse to charge, a battery change is cheap and quick. thereasoner Google didn’t do that with the Nexus brand either, that said, I’m looking forward to the free unlimited storage for full resolution video and pictures. That will surely free up a ton of space on my phone. Also, others were saying that a USB stick can be used in examples like you mentioned for loading up content. Mr_Smoosh Google has been very clear that the Pixel is not a Nexus, the price tag should be evidence enough. The brand change was a missed opportunity to add an SD. There’s also no such thing as ‘free’ cloud storage in a world with data caps, not to mention areas with no coverage in our large country. thereasoner Use a USB stick for SD card, the free unlimited storage is going to be of great use to me. That said, I’m not against SD cards but I’d rather they wait for the new high speed UFS cards that are coming so we won’t see any lag. Mr_Smoosh Now why would I use an USB stick on a phone to have it sticking out, bending, breaking or just coming out, when I can buy a competitor’s phone with an SD for the same price or cheaper? The inclusion or exclusion does not affect your cloud storage, leaving options for others out certainly does. This is the same argument used against removing headphones jacks. I’m not using a work around for no gain. There’s alternatives. Google should’ve known this. thereasoner Current SD card tech can cause lag, USB is a work around yes but for those who want to load up content like videos for the cottage, the option to do so can also be done on USB. Obviously on board storage is best, even better if built in as opposed to SD card so Google has a 128 GB option for those who want it. I would suggest that the Pixel, or any previous Nexus device from Google for that matter was never targeted at users like you who must have SD card support anyways because, after all, Google hasn’t offered it for 8 or so years. So Google isn’t really taking anything away but they are offering free unlimited back ups of all your photos and videos but for Pixel users only. I’m sure that Google knows the pro’s and cons of the current SD card tech and I’m sure that they also realize that some of the most popular phones sell quite well without it, including my GS6 or the HTC One M7 I had before it. Mr_Smoosh Fair enough. I just figure if they’re not differing themselves on price, then they ought to differ in other areas. Full disclosure, I was very excited for this phone, and would buy the 128gb XL, but I’ve read the audio is lackluster and music is my top criteria. I don’t care about storage speed. thereasoner They did differ in other areas imo. They are the only ones with the AI Assistant built in, 24/7 on device support, free unlimited back up storage and the new SD 821 chip. The cameras are fantastic from the reviews I’ve seen and they benefit from those high quality VR sensors on board working with the cameras excellent EIS. As far as I know Google is the only one doing that as well and as a bonus there’s no camera bump like those on phones with OIS instead. I only heard that the music playback is similar to any other headphone jack supported device unless you’re talking about the phone speaker itself, in which case so long as it’s loud enough then I’m happy. Mr_Smoosh Agreed on most of your points. Support if a tough one, only time can answer that. Google has shown itself to be a pretty fickle company with how they abandon products. The idea of real android support is undoubtedly the big draw for many though. For audio, it’s the DAC. I’ve read it’s pretty quiet. I have an htc m8 as my outgoing benchmark. thereasoner Googles phones are here to stay though so I don’t see them being abandoned. As for the support, I agree that it will be a selling point though I and many other tech knowledgeable people won’t have much use for it. I can see people like my tech illiterate Aunt constantly harassing Google Support with simple questions like “how do I share this picture” ect. so good for those who don’t know or are new to smartphone tech to have that convenience. That and if there is actually a problem with the device or software then the screen share feature should come in handy as well I suppose. I’m excited to get mine, just got a shipping notice a few minutes ago, hopefully it’s in my mail box by Friday! Can’t wait !! 🙂 Bill Tsats “Google’s Pixel is exactly what the Android ecosystem needs to compete with the iPhone in the high-end smartphone space in terms of quality, performance and reliability.” …. Credibility lost immediately. thereasoner The phone looks to be living up to the hype in all the reviews I’ve seen so far. Can’t wait to get mine! Bill Tsats No doubt its a nice phone… However the opening statement implies that the iPhone is the benchmark of mobile phones. Brad Fortin The iPhone kind of is the benchmark, or is at least one of the most popular to compare against, when it comes to those criteria (quality, performance, reliability), especially performance. monsterduc1000 Just grabbed an Lg G5 off of Kijiji for $400, less than half the price of the Pixel and it has everything the Pixel doesn’t. OIS, removable battery, expandable memory, IR Blaster, FM Radio, Higher Res screen (vs regular pixel), Dual camera, Not underclocked processor (Snap 821 underclocked to match Snap 820?… Weird!) etc., etc… Only thing I miss is the Amoled screen of my Nexus 6, but I do love the increased outdoor legibility from the crazy bright G5 screen. Just sayin’ 🙂 NoWayHosEH So what’s the point of your post? Trying to justify your purchase?? monsterduc1000 Yup. Got a better phone for half the price ???? nekkidtruth Better is entirely subjective. 😉 Haxor99 Pass Ken Any reason the review doesn’t mention the unlimited full resolution video/photo backup feature that was mentioned at the Keynote? Patrick O’Rourke No reason other than it slipped my mind. The feature is great and another +1 for the Pixel. Thanks for the reminder. joe2disqus Not sure if I or everyone get this correctly, but I believe that the unlimited backup feature is only for the photos/videos that is shot on pixel…you cannot backup any other media from your phone at original quality .. I might be wrong Brad Fortin This may be the first Android phone I want to purchase for actual use (as opposed to testing). If only it were a bit more affordable and available in a smaller (<4.5") size. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC ChinnBoi I would be more than happy with an HTC built device; who remembers the original Desire line? Why did the Nexus line stop…? Karen Walker-Lavery Loved my original HTC Desire. Have yet to find another I enjoy as much as that one. Pingback: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Review | Gadget, Apps & Games World() mike m total BS. no phones in stores.. no 128 in CANADA for 4 weeks Rabid Rotty A single bottom firing speaker like the LG Nexus 5, and not being a true Pixel device, throws me off of this. For it to be a True Pixel, it lacks the Pixel light features and was not directly built by Google. It was built by HTC Lil’ Cwyin’ PC ChinBoi I would like to thank the person responsible for the photograph of the delightful bed of succulents upon which the phone was positioned. For far too long the tech world has ignored these marvellous, ground-dwelling, botanicals. Oh, and the plump feline toting the cellular device also brought me considerable pleasure. jay everything GOOGLE/APPLE does makes sense in there way. why the iPhone 7 still have a bad display or why the pixel is not waterproof? in three weeks nobody is talking about it anymore and moved on. don’t think a lot people will ask for waterproof phones is more about OS experience good camera and display. iPhone 7 does not sell at all(plus does) and why is that? it is not an upgrade at all. with the pixel i believe people think it is to expensive because we used to these 400$ price tags. after all we do not know how regular customers think but we as tech heads think different. Caspan @patrick can you do a test of the Pixel and the Pixel XL to see if they used different speed of memory for the lower one like they did on the iPhone 7 it’s like 4x slower memory on the 32GB Jon Duke They copied so much, I wouldn’t have been surprised if they opened it and found a A10 chip. Caspan Do you really think so in today’s day and age. Like how much different can you make a phone? Everything is a rectangle slab, it’s a little silly no one even tries to do a different design! Jon Duke Nope. LG phones don’t look like iPhones nor Samsung yet they are a rectangle. I hate when people use that stupid argument. There are many ways to not look like an iphone. If I shut off the screen of a Pixel phone and put a circular button at the bottom., 100% of casual users will think it’s an iPhone. There’s no reason for that to happen ever. Small differences like Samsung’s rounded rectangle button instead of a circle are what makes their phones different for iPhones. That’s all they need to do. Also, the top and bottom bezels are ridiculous. Caspan I get what you are saying but it doesn’t look like an iPhone then because it doe snot have a round button at the bottom and the screen is not edge to edge. So how is it that it looks the same other then shape? Jon Duke I see your point. If everything is in the details then you suggest that this is like the basic template and say Apple added the button to it while Google kept it basic. Fair enough. I agree. I still don’t like their design choice but you point makes sense. thereasoner Really, if you want to be honest, then even the iPhone design is not Apples, they copied so much from the HTC One M7 and Samsung Ativ S that they are easily the least original iPhone designs ever made by far ! Jon Duke Haha true. I just like to point at iPhone as an example because people listen more when you kind of defend their beloved apple. Dustin Clark Just shows the intelligence of the iPhone user community. Jon Duke Not sure if you are for or against iPhone with your comment but whichever it is, the community doesn’t design the phone for Apple so people copying the iPhone doesn’t give any indication of the level of intelligence of its community. Dustin Clark I’ll stick with my Nexus 6P. Nothing really that compelling with this device.

Giant shield begins sliding over Chernobyl reactor FBI report: Hate crimes against Muslims rose by 67 percent last year According to reports, Apple's so-called Project Titan is now focused on the development of self-driving car technology instead of an actual car. By Viknesh Vijayenthiran, MotorAuthority October 18, 2016 Save for later Saved The Apple logo hangs in the glass box entrance to the company's Fifth Avenue store in New York. Mark Lennihan/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Though Apple [NSDQ:AAPL] has never publicly acknowledged it is working on a car, comments from numerous insiders as well as the tech giant’s recent poaching of senior auto industry staff suggest otherwise. Sadly, the project, which has been doing the rounds under the code name Project Titan, may have just been nipped in the bud. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Project Titan is now focused on the development of self-driving car technology instead of an actual car. This way, the people said, Apple has the flexibility to either partner with an established automaker ( McLaren?) or return to developing its own car at a later date. Recommended: How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Two people told Bloomberg that senior Apple executives have given the Project Titan team a deadline of late 2017 to prove the feasibility of its self-driving technology so that a final decision on direction can be made. This change of focus has meant that hundreds of people hired to help develop a car have either been let go or reassigned. Project Titan is thought to still have around 1,000 staff around the globe. Test your knowledge How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 Complexity, internal strife News of an Apple car emerged in 2013 and by 2015 it was being reported that Apple might have a  car on sale as early as 2019. However, according to Bloomberg sources, there was internal strife regarding the direction Project Titan should take, for example whether the car would still require a driver or if it would be fully autonomous. The complexity of manufacturing cars, coupled with their low margins compared to what Apple’s investors are used to in the tech industry, may also have persuaded Apple to take a different route. Recall, senior Apple executives  visited a BMW plant in 2015 to learn about car production. There’s a lot riding on self-driving technology as it has the potential to disrupt the entire auto industry. For example, it could lead to a change of the standard business model for automakers where revenue is generated from offering rides instead from actually selling cars—and Apple has already invested  $1 billion in Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing. Most of the major automakers are working to develop self-driving technology, as are ride-sharing firms and Apple’s main rival Google. Success may be vital for the automakers, because in a world where people choose on-demand rides instead of private car ownership, traditional car brands may no longer matter.

Therefore, we knew early on that this was going to be an impressive piece of consumer kit. And that Google was setting it up as Android’s answer to Apple’s iPhone 7. As soon as you get it in your hands, the similarities with Apple’s phone are apparent. From the curved look of the aluminium casing to the choice of 5-inch or 5.5-inch screens. Even though the Pixel (and its larger brother, the Pixel XL) were built by Taiwanese company HTC, you won’t find any evidence of it. This is billed as the first phone made by Google “inside and out” - from the carefully positioned fingerprint scanner to the latest version of Android running under the bonnet. Read More Google Pixel and Pixel XL: UK release date, price, specs and features of Google's new Android smartphones So, with Apple continuing to divide opinion with the iPhone 7 and Samsung busy cleaning up after its Galaxy Note 7 (literally) backfired - is this the time to defect to Google? We’ve spent some quality time with the Pixel in order to find out. Read More Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus - which smartphone will win when Google takes on Apple? Price Getty Images Members of the media photograph a display of Google's Pixel phone and other products during an event to introduce Google hardware products Google might be trying to outdo Apple, but that doesn’t include undercutting it. The Pixel and Pixel XL are priced exactly the same as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The 5-inch Pixel costs £599 for the 32GB model and £699 for the 128GB version. That goes up to £719 for the 32GB Pixel XL and £819 for the 128GB one. These kind of prices take the Pixel out of any kind of secondary or replacement device territory and right into the upper echelons of the smartphone market. It also means the stakes are high for Google to deliver a genuinely market-leading smartphone that’s going to be able to justify a two, three or four year investment. Read More How much will the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones cost? Best UK deals and where to find them Currently, the only way to get hold of the Pixel is either to buy it SIM-free from Google or Carphone Warehouse or pick it up on a plan from EE. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data per month for existing customers. The Pixel XL is also available free on a £55.99 a month, 24 month plan, and comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers. Buy the Google Pixel from Carphone Warehouse here Design AP Photo/Eric Risberg The new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event The Pixel may bear a striking resemblance to the iPhone, but that’s only because the iPhone bears a resemblance to the HTC One phones that came earlier. But unlike Apple, Google has made a point of keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of both the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The phone is built from aerospace-grade aluminium and has thin bezels which make for a big screen in a relatively thin 8.5mm body. The Pixel weighs 143g whilst the Pixel XL is slightly heavier at 168g. If there’s one thing that’s a little unsightly about the design it’s the bottom of the phone where you would expect to see the home button if it was an iPhone. The so-called ‘chin’ is fairly prominent on the Pixel and doesn’t serve much purpose because the home, back and recent buttons are all displayed on the screen. Similarly, I’m not really keen on the two-tone back panel that Google has decided to add. Supposedly it can help with antenna reception - but an important word of warning: it'll crack easily. I'd only had the review unit a few days and putting it down flat on a linoleum floor resulted in a nice crack along the bottom of the glass panel. Moral of this story is you're going to want a case to go with the Pixel. Read More Apple to make iPhone 4 'obsolete' by November - bad news if you're still using one Getty Images Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products However, its sculpted surfaces and rounded edges leave you in no doubt that it is a premium device and a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Sadly, in the UK, it is only available in two colours - "quite black" and "very silver", with the "really blue" option reserved for the American market. Like some other Android handsets, Google has placed the fingerprint scanner on the back of the Pixel. That makes it really easy to unlock in your hand because your fingers naturally curl around the handset. The flip side is that if it’s lying flat on a surface and you want to unlock it without picking it up you have to key in your PIN or swipe your pattern.

The company is relentlessly pursuing artificial intelligence - something it made sure to talk about at the Pixel’s unveiling. Just like Siri on the iPhone or Cortana on Microsoft Windows, the Google Assistant is a voice-controlled digital PA tucked inside the Android operating system. It learns your voice and helps you do everything from checking the football scores to ordering an Uber.

The phone comes with unlimited cloud storage via the Google Photos app for both pictures and video. This is particularly useful if you opt for the 32GB model as there is no option to expand the storage with a microSD card. Read More Google Pixel: How much space do you REALLY get on the new 32GB smartphone? Google has also thrown in its new video-calling app Duo as standard, although this will only work if you know someone else using Duo (and not Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp or another video calling app) to call. Android Pay is also bundled in, letting you set up a secure digital home for your debit and credit cards in exactly the same way as you can with Apple Pay. And finally, Google's Daydream VR is its new virtual reality platform that Pixel has been specifically calibrated for. Read More Google Daydream View VR headset: UK price, release date and features Getty Images A journalist uses Google's Daydream VR headset during an event to introduce Google hardware products Because Google undoubtedly built the hardware as a means to showcase the software, Android feels fluid and easy to navigate. Swiping down brings up the notifications and a range of quickfire settings whilst swiping right opens up a Google-style newsfeed showing recent headlines, map directions and the option to search the web. Aside from Google’s own suite of apps there’s no extra bloatware that you’d find on a Huawei or Samsung phone running Android. What’s more, because this is Google’s phone the inevitable software updates will be available on the Pixel before its Android competition. At this point in smartphone development there's very little to distinguish between iOS and Android when it comes to functionality, so which one you want to use basically comes down to personal preference. Camera and battery AP Photo/Eric Risberg Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, talks about the camera in the new Google Pixel phone Battery life on the Pixel is as good as you’ll find on a modern smartphone. There are all the usual tricks to eke out more power but because Google has kept the software on track, the smartphone runs as efficiently as possible. Neither the Pixel nor the Pixel XL have removable batteries, and as you’d expect the larger model (with the higher resolution screen) has the bigger battery. The Pixel has a 2,770mAh power pack while the XL’s is 3,450mAh. Read More Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3: Which is the best Android phone to buy in 2016? I comfortably managed a full day of usage (from 6am to 11pm) with some juice left to spare. There was even a bit left over the next morning although you’re not going to get a solid 24 hours of heavy use without a charge. The Pixel phones use the new USB-C type charging port and, thankfully, they come with one in the box. A quick point is that the Pixel appears to get quite warm when the performance is being pushed hard. AP Photo/Eric Risberg Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president of hardware, introduces the new Google Pixel phone during a product event The Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel camera, featuring an f/2.0 aperture and big 1.55 micron pixels to capture lots of light. While those specs may not sound all that impressive on paper, the Pixel's camera has been given a score of 89 by DxOMark - the industry standard for camera and lens image quality - making it the highest-rated smartphone camera ever tested. The camera app offers a number of clever features like "Smartburst", which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best ones, and "Lens Blur" to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects. You can also switch between the rear camera and selfie mode with a double flick of the wrist. In practice, the camera on the Pixel is extremely accomplished and will be more than capable for 90% of your day-to-day photography needs. It’s quick to load as well and having unlimited Google Photos cloud storage space is extremely handy. Conclusion For Android purists, the Google Pixel is the best phone you can buy - even if it costs the same as Apple’s high priced iPhone 7. When it comes to design, the Pixel doesn't match the quality of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge - but the wealth of Google software and the support for things like Google Assistant and Daydream VR help make up for that. The high price is tough to swallow but on the other hand the Pixel is a worthwhile investment and undoubtedly one of the best smartphones 2016 has produced.

By Xavier Harding posted Oct 18th, 2016 at 9:00am Xavier Harding Pixel: Phone by Google The Google phone is here Since the first Android phone, Google's offered up its smartphone operating system that rivals Apple's to phone manufacturers like LG, HTC, and Samsung while letting those companies handle the hardware. The Nexus line of devices were destined to serve as the titular Android experience but Samsung phones remained dominant in terms of popularity and outright sales. So Google not only made a de-facto Android phone, the company even put its name on it. So in 2016, we finally have a Google phone. Or more accurately, Pixel: Phone by Google. The Alphabet-owned company wants to position this device as the iPhone of Android phones--a premium-made device at a premium price. But if Google is taking on Apple and Samsung with the Pixel, how does it fare? It Looks Thick, Why So Big? In recent years, phone makers have placed a priority on thinness. Even though a bigger phone tends to lead to a bigger battery, handset manufacturers like Apple prioritize the depth of the device--even if it means a camera lens that's sticking out from the back of the phone. Google eschews this thinking with its Pixel phone. The phone isn't a monstrosity, but it does look beefier than the other 2016 phones on the market. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, the back of the Pixel is one even surface. The phone's camera (more on that later) stays tucked beneath the surface and there's a good chance Google was able to fill the extra room with more battery (more on that later, as well). The Pixel XL we tested has a 5.5-inch screen, the same diagonal screen-size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but felt much more comfortable to hold than the sometimes unwieldy larger iPhone. Using the large Pixel feels like holding a smartphone. Using the large iPhone feels like handling a lunch tray. How’s The Camera? Google's quick to tout the prowess of its rear shooter on the Pixel phone. The 12.3-megapixel camera is comparable to rival smartphones on the market with one standout metric: Google's phone receives a DxOmark rating of 89, better than any other smartphone on the market. So how do the shots look? Like this. Xavier Harding Google Pixel Wine cork photo test Xavier Harding Google Pixel Tree photo on Google Pixel Xavier Harding Google Pixel Google Pixel at bar And this is how it compares to iPhone 7 Plus photos of similar subjects. Xavier Harding iPhone 7 Plus Wine cork photo on iPhone Xavier Harding iPhone 7 Plus Tree photo on iPhone Xavier Harding iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Plus at bar The Pixel's highly-rated camera holds up well in low-light situations like at the bar or after sundown too. And selfies come out clear when using the front-facing camera. The Pixel can't rival the second telephoto lens on the back of the bigger iPhone. Nor the zoom that comes with it--the iPhone can zoom farther and offer a clearer photo. Zoom aside, Google's premium phone camera is just as capable as Apple's. If you're using your smartphone to take photos you likely aren't planning to use those pictures for professional shots or printing poster- or billboard-sized images. Snap a photo with this camera and your picture will come out good. Just like if you took that picture with iPhone or Galaxy S7, it will come out fine. For many real-world uses, the Pixel and its competition are plenty. Does it really have unlimited storage? Google's Pixel phone ships with 32GB storage options, which actually leaves you with 23GB of storage you can make use of. Google also offers a 128GB version of the device for those looking for added storage. You won't be able to add a micro-SD card to the Pixel, but Google's phone can rely on something else. Google's offering Pixel users the option of offloading their photo and video library onto Google Photos when needed. Swiping open the app's hamburger menu to the left and selecting "Free up space." The phone will ask if you want to upload "X" number of pictures and videos to the cloud. Selecting yes will upload everything to Google's servers and free your device from the clutches of clutter. When you're without service you're still able to load lower-resolution versions of your photos. Xavier Harding Google Pixel Pixel, the phone by Google, offers the company's new Assistant as a replacement for Google Now. What are the new fancy AI features? Google is coupling its Pixel phone with the new Google Assistant. Introduced in its Allo chat app, the Assistant is the updated version of Android's Google Now features. Say the words, "Ok, Google" aloud and the Assistant is summoned and ready to answer questions. Based on your location, the Assistant will serve up pertinent information regarding what's happening around you. And depending on what you're seeing onscreen, bringing forward the Assistant will have it chime in with info on that (after swiping up on the Assistant) screen. Very convenient. These superpowers are nothing we haven't seen from the search company in the past from features like Google's Now On Tap. But with the new Google app Allo, the big G is able to take its rebranded virtual assistant and place it inside the device's messenger app. So you're able to perform searches and gather information from right within your chat screen. The feature is handy and comes with any download of the Allo app. The difference is Pixel users get the assistant featured in Allo throughout the whole operating system. Even iOS users can make use of the Assistant within Google's app. Does it have a headphone jack? Yes. 3.5mm-supporting headphones will work with Google's Pixel, and that's without an adapter. Xavier Harding Google Pixel 3.5mm port This phone has the luxury of a headphone jack Will the battery catch on fire? No. Well... At the very least, it charges at blazing-fast rates. Google claims users can get 7 hours out of charging for 15 minutes and our tests held up with that claim. When charged with the USB-C cable and included charging block, the Pixel did indeed charge at a rapid pace. The phone indicates how fast power is moving through it by reporting just that: near the fingerprint icon you'll see a status message that says, "Charging rapidly." We also were able to get the phone to be "Charging" (simply plugging the USB-C to USB 3.0 into a portable battery charger) and "Charging slowly" (plugging the phone into a computer to charge). The smaller Pixel offers a 2,770mAh battery while the larger XL offers a beefier 3,450mAh battery. Both can last you through the day during normal use. Our Pixel review unit remained flame-free throughout all of this. We'll update this review should the handset ever go up in smoke. Xavier Harding Google Pixel home button and volume rocker Price The Pixel: Phone by Google, at the low-end, costs $649.99. Which is just as much as Apple's most affordable iPhone and slightly less than Samsung's most affordable Galaxy S7. While Google could have made the Pixel more affordable than its competition, it has situated the device right around other premium handsets. Which is to say that it's expensive. The Pixel XL starts at $769.99. So the question remains: should you buy? If you recently traded in your sizzling Samsung Note 7 but would like to stick with Android, there's finally a Google phone for you. If you're looking for an excuse to make your escape out of Apple's iOS ecosystem, you now have the perfect opportunity. But if you're thinking of switching because of the camera and currently have a phone from 2015 or 2016, you should do yourself a favor and save your money. Regardless, you may still be swayed by the potential that Google's Assistant holds.

Android has been a fixture of the smartphone world for years, but when it comes to hardware, Google itself has only tinkered around the edges with its Nexus line. This means the combination of hardware and software has always been something unique to Apple (it's 2016, so let's ignore BlackBerry and Microsoft). And many feel this held Android back: that if phone and operating system were to work in harmony, Google could steal Apple’s crown. So the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, which go on sale this week, mark a watershed moment for the entire industry. They show Google is serious about taking on Apple directly and, as Samsung recoils from its exploding phone fiasco, provide a much-need Android counterweight to the iPhone. And at £599 and up, the phone is squarely in Apple's territory. Having tested it for a few days, it’s clear that the Pixel is a very good phone. It is lightning fast, well built and comes packed with an array of pleasing features. But it is not without flaws: its design is questionable and Google’s bragging about the camera does not quite stand up to scrutiny. Design and build The Pixel comes in two sizes, a 5-inch screen and the 5.5-inch XL, and two colours – “very silver” and “quite black” – which I refuse to say out loud (a "really blue" is not available in the UK). The front is glass, and the back is aluminium apart from a glass panel that covers the top third. While it's a Google-branded phone, the Pixel was built in partnership with HTC. The headphone jack (yes, there’s a headphone jack) is on the top. As with last year’s Nexus phones, the fingerprint reader is on the back, and the front buttons are on screen, rather than physical. The power and volume buttons are both on the right hand side of the device. When the Pixel was unveiled earlier this month, a lot was made of how much it looks like the iPhone – down to the antenna bands that wrap around the back. And while it’s easy to tell the difference up close, every single person to see my review unit has commented on the likeness. But in the hand, it is unmistakeably different, and, I have to say, not quite as nice. The body of the phone does not quite curve all the way round, but has flat edges on its sides. The glass panel at the back was an engineering, rather than a design, decision – it was needed to cram all the Pixel’s various innards inside – but it feels a little cheap and plasticky. The screen takes up quite a small proportion of the body, especially considering there's no physical button on the front. It’s by no means a bad-looking phone but it’s not as nice to hold as Samsung’s Galaxy devices or an iPhone. The XL doesn't feel overwhelmingly large, but the smaller-handed may struggle, while I find myself having to claw my finger into an unnatural hook to reach the fingerprint sensor on the 5-inch model. Setup and performance But what the Pixel might lack in grace, it more than makes up for in speed. The device is blisteringly quick: you can zip around menus and apps with ease. The fingerprint reader responds instantly, and in five days of testing I’ve experienced no lag across the phone. The screen is also sharp and bright. Setting up the phone is fast and easy, and Google has included a “quick switch adapter” cable for moving your stuff from your old phone. This is a neat idea – no more exporting contacts or losing your text messages. You simply connect one end of the cable to your old phone and one to your Pixel as part of the setup process.  Key features | Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones With the iPhone you can move contacts, messages, calendars, music and photos across; on Android this also includes apps and settings. The whole process made switching phones a lot easier (although apps didn’t move across perfectly when I tried to switch between Android phones) and takes much of the pain out of moving. Charging via USB-C is very fast – Google claims seven hours of juice in 15 minutes of charging – and I found battery life to be excellent: you will easily last a day on either device although the XL will get you a couple more hours. Software The Pixel is the first device to run Android Nougat 7.1. This will be coming to various Nexus phones in the coming weeks and various other Android phones over time (although the delays with this are well documented). But there are also a number of Pixel-specific features on the phone. First, the Android 7.1 features. These include: A Night Light mode which reduces blue light for using your phone before going to bed App shortcuts, which let you long press on an app from the homescreen or menu to choose a quick action such as phoning a favourite contact or opening a new tab in Chrome (this is similar to 3D Touch on the iPhone) Circular app icons Moves, which are special phone gestures. On the Pixel there are three moves – swipe down on the fingerprint reader to bring the notifications drawer down, double tap the power button to open the camera, and do a little double twist when in the camera to switch between the rear camera and selfie mode. pixel phone shake to selfie The circular app icons are pleasing, but at present they are mostly Google's own: most third-party apps are still square so the app screen ends up being a combination of both. The moves, though, are a nice touch - swiping the notification drawer down from the fingerprint sensor is often easier than from the top of the screen. The Pixel-specific features include: Google Assistant (more on that below) A new launcher – you swipe up from the docked apps to see all the apps you have installed A new camera app, that includes pro features such as video stabilisation, viewfinder grids and smartburst for taking multiple shots in a row Unlimited space for photos and videos, stored in their original quality, on Google Photos, as well as a “smart storage” feature that removes old backed up photos and videos when you run out of space. Between them, the upgrades in 7.1 and the Pixel-specific features make for a compelling version of Android, and since it’s a Google phone, you know you’ll get all the latest updates as soon as they’re available. They also come with Google's new video call and chat apps, Google and Allo, built in. Google Assistant A big selling point of the Pixel is supposed to be the Google Assistant, the voice-activated artificial intelligence that sits in the phone. To activate it, you say “Okay Google” or hold down the centre button. Assistant is also present in the Google Home speaker, a rival to the Amazon Echo that launches soon, and Google clearly sees it as a big part of its future – something that will bring together its services and become a key part of your life. Given the company’s AI prowess, it is well positioned to succeed here, but after a few days, I haven’t been completely blown away by it. The voice recognition is very good, and Assistant is perfectly capable of setting timers, checking the weather and so on, but these everyday, useful features already existed in the previous incarnation, Google Now. Google's Assistant can thread a conversation The big advance that Google is claiming in Assistant is that it is conversational and contextual: ask it for dinner recommendations and then for opening times and it will know that the second question relates to the first. But in practice, I haven’t found this that useful: while the Assistant clearly has a lot of potential, the application is not quite there yet in terms of actually making my life easier. The Assistant is due to come to other devices at some point: it won't be a Pixel exclusive forever. Camera Google surprised a lot of people when it said the Pixel had been rated the best smartphone camera ever. The reference for that is DxOMark, a website that rigorously tests cameras and phones and assigns them a score: the Pixel got 89, against the Samsung Galaxy S7’s 88 and the iPhone 7’s 86. Specs-wise, it ticks all the boxes. 12MP on the rear and 8MP on the front, an f2.0 aperture, 4K video. It also has Google’s HDR+, which stitches together different shots to produce the best photo. The camera app also has tons of features, such as a bokeh mode, white balance presets and digital video stabilisation, and there’s unlimited Google Photos storage at top quality, meaning you can take as many photographs as you want without worrying about space. The camera app is also very snappy, focusing and taking shots quickly. But while the fine people at DxOMark know better than I do, it hasn’t been my experience with the camera. While shots in good natural light look excellent and the camera works well in low-light situations too, the level of detail and the vibrancy of the colours don’t quite match my iPhone 7. I took a few comparison shots over the last few days to compare the two – simply pointing and shooting, no messing with settings – and this is what I got. There are a couple of cases in which I prefer the Pixel’s results, but most of the time, the iPhone wins. The Pixel has a very good camera with a great app, and it shouldn’t put anyone off buying the phone, but I wasn’t as blown away as I’d hoped. Verdict I wanted to love the Pixel. It has all the right ingredients to be the best smartphone on the market - unprecedented support from Google, great specs, very good battery life - and it certainly won't let you down. At the same time, there are a few too many missing pieces to make it a must have. I find the design a little underwhelming, especially in a world occupied by beautiful phones like Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. The camera is very good but I can't agree with the claims that it's the best on any smartphone. There's no waterproofing or stereo speakers. These are minor complaints, though, especially considering it is Google's first phone. The Pixel is a very good device that is a worthy alternative to either the iPhone or the Galaxy S7, if you're willing to shell out for it. Pros: Zippy performance, unlimited photo storage, good camera, great battery life Cons: Underwhelming design and feel, fingerprint reader on back not for everyone, no water resistance or stereo speakers, expensive Price and release date The Google Pixel costs £599 for the 32GB model or £699 for 128GB, while the Pixel XL costs £719 for 32GB and £819 for 128GB. Both are available to order today from EE and Carphone Warehouse and are out on Thursday October 20.

Pixel by Google (Photo: Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY) Story Highlights Pixel by Google: $649 on up; store.google.com Pro. Google Assistant, excellent camera, free cloud photo storage, free support Pro. Daydream ready, fast USB-C charging Con. Not water resistant, only a single speaker. NEW YORK — Google's new Pixel phones should be on a smartphone shopper's short list — and not just for those disheartened by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall. Pixel is a winner for anyone looking for an excellent phone. Start with cameras that are at the very least on par with the terrific cameras on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, which represent its main competition. USA TODAY Google Pixel camera: Great but not revolutionary Add the baked-in voice-enabled Google Assistant, Google’s answer to Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, where another battleground is poised to take place. Such digital assistants still represent a work in progress, including Google Assistant, but Google's voice brings a high IQ and a world of potential. Pixels are also the first phones in which Google took over all aspects of the hardware and software design (though HTC actually manufactured the units), borrowing from Apple’s playbook. Google Pixel XL, the larger version of Google's new Pixel smartphone.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Over the past several days, I’ve been testing the larger of the two Pixel models, the Pixel XL, which boasts a lovely Quad HD 5.5-inch display and costs $769 for 32 gigabytes of storage or $869 for 128 GB. The smaller Pixel has a Full HD 5-inch screen and costs $649 or $749, respectively. The phones are already on back order and will be available through Verizon (as the exclusive U.S. carrier), at Best Buy, via Google’s Project Fi or Google’s own Play Store. You can get an unlocked version that will work with any of the other major U.S. carriers. The timing for Google couldn't have been better, coming on the heels of Samsung's decision to stop making the Note 7, a high-end phablet that had attracted a fierce following but which was vulnerable to overheating and fire. The expanded recall may persuade some Android users to try a new brand. Here are the key takeaways: *Design: Pixels are crafted out of an aerospace-grade aluminum slab and glass and the XL model feels like the high-priced phone that it is. It's a tad shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and, viewed from the front, the two phones look a fair bit alike, though from the rear not so much. The relatively wide bezels on the front appear to be mostly wasted real estate, as there are no physical buttons. On the upper third of the back, Pixel has a Gorilla Glass-covered glass shade that reveals smudges. What I do like is that there’s no camera bump as on most other phones — the rear lens and flash lie flat. The fingerprint sensor you can use to unlock the phone is also on the rear. And when you do unlock the devices, you can swipe down on the sensor to reveal notifications, a small but nice feature. The new fingerprint scanner on the back of the Google Pixel  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Pixels run the latest version of Android called Nougat and with Google in charge, you ought to get software updates as soon as they are ready. The phone has a robust Qualcomm processor. And score one for Google against the iPhone 7: Pixel has the same standard 3.55mm headphone connector that the iPhone 7 got rid of and that every other smartphone I know has. Alas, there’s only a single speaker on Pixel; Apple added stereo speakers to the iPhone 7 and other smartphones also have them. And unlike the iPhone 7 or ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, you wouldn’t want to drop Pixel in a puddle. It is not fully water-resistant. Using the camera on Pixel.

I detected only subtle differences between the pictures and videos I shot here (under all sorts of lighting conditions) and those I’ve captured on a Galaxy or the iPhone. Consider that high praise. I was impressed with the color and fine detail on most shots. The main rear camera on the Pixel is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large pixels and an f/2.0 aperture (good in dim light). It is fast to fire. By double-twisting the phone, you can switch from the rear camera to the front 8-megapixel selfie camera or back, a trick that usually (but not always) worked. Maybe as important as the picture quality is what you can do with the images you capture. Google is giving Pixel owners unlimited free cloud storage at full resolution for all the pictures and videos shot with the phone, including 4K video. That’s a big deal. Google Assistant delivers the weather on a Google Pixel.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Google Assistant: You can summon the Google Assistant by barking out “OK Google” or by pressing down and holding against the phone’s home key. As with other digital assistants, it can give you the basics: stock quotes, sports scores, even tell you a lame joke. But Google is pushing the conversational aspects of its AI-based Assistant further. You can tap contextual buttons that appear on the screen with suggested replies, or you can respond by voice. I asked Assistant to “tell me about my day” and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg and BBC. A Google Assistant search found photos of Edward Baig's daughter Sydney with a horse.  (Photo: Edward C. Baig) When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter, Sydney, rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to “show me pictures of Sydney with bridges” it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the Web. Google Assistant was able to translate “how do I find a bathroom in French?” into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the Web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the Web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I knew only a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. There's a fun aspect to the Assistant, too. I could play trivia, or have Assistant flip a coin with the appropriate sound effect as I tried to guess heads or tails. Most promising is the idea that you can continue a conversation without repeating search parameters each step of the way. So you might ask it to find you an Italian restaurant. You can then can ask how late the place is open, without repeating the name of the restaurant or have Google Assistant find the menu. In my experience, however, such queries were hit-or-miss. Another example: I asked Google to show me pictures of dogs and it did so off the Web. Without mentioning dogs I followed up with "how about by the beach?" and Google surfaced Web images of canines by the beach. Impressive. Pixel help screen  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Battery. The phone kept a charge well into the evenings during my mixed use; since I never ran it down, I didn’t get to test a fast-charging feature that Google claims can get you up to seven hours of juice in just 15 minutes, using the USB-C adapter that comes in the box. *Worth noting: If you run into a tech support snag, you can solicit help by tapping a “support” tab inside the phone’s settings. From there, you can request a callback from a support agent 24/7 or alternatively open a chat session (the hours are more limited). You can even remotely share your screen with the person helping you out. Pixel will be the first phone to support Google Daydream, but the mobile virtual-reality headset wasn't yet available for testing. Google's new phones are powerful, pricey and pretty darn intelligent and demonstrate Google's commitment to be a major player in the space.

That’s pixels, plural: two Nougat flagships, distinguished only by their size, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Each, for better and for worse, the purest embodiment of what Android is today and where it will go tomorrow. Google and HTC’s design is oddly divisive for something so simple. Some I showed it to welcomed the clean lines and minimal ornamentation. Others, though, felt it fell somewhere between boring and just plain ugly; the shiny glass crop-top on the upper rear, presumably required for RF reasons, earned particular criticism. HTC fans will search fruitlessly for badge or logo credit, but the phone maker’s hand is clear all the same. The aluminum unibody, with its balance of smoothness and yet just enough roughness to grip, is right out of the HTC playbook. Weigh it in your hand and you can feel the textural legacy of the One S and other phones of old. Plenty has been said of the stylistic comparisons between Pixel and iPhone, though in person they’re less similar. There’s something about the sharp ridge line that runs the Google phone’s periphery that makes its aesthetic more distinct. The satin-finish bezel around the Gorilla Glass 4 protected front is another subtle but pleasing differentiator. The 5.5-inch display of the Pixel XL is a pleasingly detailed 2560 x 1440 – a welcome step up from the 1920 x 1080 of the regular, 5-inch Pixel – and, like the Nexus 6P before it, uses an AMOLED panel. It’s also surrounded by fairly thick bezels, particularly top and bottom. They’re about the same girth as those of the iPhone 7 Plus, in fact, only Apple at least has a home button to occupy its lower portion. Google, though, has done away with as many physical controls as it can. You get a power button and volume rocker on the right edge – pleasingly individualized by some nice micro-texturing – but otherwise the idea is that Android and its software UI leads the way. You wake the phone with a tap of the circular fingerprint sensor on the back. Google calls it Pixel Imprint, and it’s neatly placed to nudge against with your forefinger. The nature of the angle you generally press it at, however – more toward the side of your finger, rather than the very tip – meant I had to reteach the Pixel XL what my digit looked like, as it hadn’t gleaned enough about the edges of my fingers the first time around. After that, though, it’s been pretty consistent at unlocking each time; you’re taken straight to the home screen. If you have “swipe for notifications” turned on in the settings, dragging your fingertip down on the Pixel Imprint sensor draws down the notification slide too. It’s a small detail, but it makes checking recent notifications a one-handed affair, which is more than I can say for many phones of this screen size. Google is out to conquer iPhone users, and that extends to making the transition process from iOS to Android 7.1 Nougat as straightforward as possible. In the box with the Pixel XL there’s a USB-C OTG dongle, into which you can plug the Lightning cable and thus your iPhone. The initial Pixel setup process then promises to gulp all your media and data from the tethered phone. At least, that’s the theory. Unfortunately, if – like I have – you’ve encrypted your iPhone backups then the Pixel XL can only get its mitts on your photos, music, and videos. For anything else, you’ll need to connect your iPhone to iTunes and turn off backup encryption. Is it a deal-breaker? No, but it’s an added step of hassle and I can certainly imagine putting off many who just want to get started with their shiny new Google Phone. In theory, if it goes right you can slurp your contacts, SMS and iMessage conversations, and other content right across in one fell swoop. Even if it doesn’t quite work for you – or if you’re not transitioning from an iPhone in the first place – the dongle itself is a welcome addition to the box since it means you can plug in USB drives for speedy file transfers. USB-C has been around a short while now, but Google takes no chances that you might end up frustrated by missing an accessory. As well as the 18W power adapter and its accompanying USB-C to USB-C cable, there’s a USB-C to USB Standard-A plug cable too, allowing you to use any existing adapters you might have, or plug the Pixel XL into your computer. Sadly you can’t run a USB-C display from the Pixel, which seems like a missed opportunity. Google also opts not to include headphones in the box; not something I expect to bother most users, but a strange absence given the otherwise comprehensive accessory set. Perhaps you’re meant to use the mono speaker on the bottom, which is as bass-weedy as you’d expect it to be. Like the iPhone, there’s no support for expandable storage. You get a nano SIM slot, and a 3.5mm headphone socket, and of course the USB-C port, but if the 32GB or 128GB of internal memory aren’t enough for you then it’s off to the cloud. Salving things there somewhat is Google’s offer of unlimited online backup of photos and video you shoot with your Pixel. Of course, the battery isn’t removable either, and unfortunately where the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 took advantage of that latter fact to add waterproofing to their list of abilities, the Pixel XL falls short. There’s actually IP53 compliance, though Google was coy to confirm it. That might be because it falls well short of what Apple and Samsung deliver. Basically, your new Android flagship will survive typical day-to-day dust, as well as exposure to “spraying water” encountered when the phone is at up to 60-degrees from the vertical. That basically means you’re okay to use it, caseless, in your hand out in the rain, but don’t think about dropping it in the sink or pool. It’s unlikely to survive. Killing your Pixel would be a shame, too, as it’s quite the pocket powerhouse. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 with Adreno 530 graphics takes pride of place, paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 memory. Of course, as you’d expect it’s running the latest version of Android, in this case 7.1 Nougat with the promise of two years of OS updates and three years of security updates. In a post-benchmarks world I’d rather go by real-world experience to judge a device’s performance, and there the Pixel XL holds up well. It’s not just about system-intensive apps running without lag, but how responsive the phone feels. Google said it put particular emphasis on touch reaction and that paid dividends: it just feels perkier than other recent Android phones. Of course, Nougat’s changes don’t end there. The revamped UI now has circular icons that, with a long-press, pop up a selection of context-relevant options. Long-press the camera icon, for instance, and you get shortcuts to shoot a video or take a selfie; do the same to the Maps icon, and you can navigate to saved Home and Work destinations. There’s also a new launcher, summoned by dragging up on the app row at the bottom of the home screen. From there you can search through your apps, or drag their icons out to the home screen. Swiping from left to right on the home screen opens up the familiar Google Now page, with its contextually-relevant cards. Most interesting, though, is the Google Assistant. The latest branding and packaging of Google’s user-learning, location-aware, search-instilled knowledge graph, it’s Google Now and Now on Tap and Google Allo all rolled into one, and set loose throughout the Pixel and Pixel XL. Google Assistant will eventually crop up in the Google Home speaker, in upcoming smartwatches, and in cars, but for now the Pixel is the main place you can experience it. Although you can trigger it with a long-press of the on-screen Home button, it’s really intended to be voice-led. Saying “Ok Google” is enough to call it up, whether the phone’s screen is on or not. As we saw with Allo, Google Assistant interactions resemble IM conversations. You ask a question; the Assistant replies with an answer, complete with a row of possible follow-up queries should you not have the answer you need. They’re generated dynamically: if you asked for photos of cats, the hints might be for color or size; if you requested a nearby Best Buy, the hints could include “open now”. It’s a deceptively straightforward front to some deeply complex tech going on in the background. For a start, Google Assistant takes your previous question into account when you ask a follow-up. It knows that, if you first asked to find a coffee shop, then straight after say “show me how to get there”, you’re still talking about the same location. Google also takes into account what you’re looking at on-screen to better shape its suggestions. When I looked at SlashGear’s homepage, for instance, Google Assistant had shortcuts to our YouTube channel. In the YouTube app, when watching a “Last Week Tonight” video, the Assistant offered IMDb ratings, details on John Oliver, and recent news articles about the show. Unsurprisingly, it’s not a perfect system. For a start the voice recognition isn’t infallible – sometimes my contextually-related conversations with the Assistant derailed when it misunderstood what I was asking for – and the results are at the mercy of what Google has indexed and cross-referenced. You can’t chat silently with text, either: it’s voice or nothing. The biggest hindrance is the fact that, currently, Google Assistant doesn’t work with third party services. For that, we’ll have to wait until December, when the Assistant SDK will allow so-called “Actions on Google”. That could be something simple, like turning on your connected lights, or something more complex like having a conversation with your bank about money transfers and bill payments. If you’re having problems with Android or your Pixel, meanwhile, there’s an actual Google assistant who can help. Much as we saw Amazon do with its Fire range, there’s a link to support from a human expert on-device. They can talk you through issues, or have you share the screen and lead you through a solution. With a name like “Pixel” it’s no surprise that the Pixel and Pixel XL’s camera has been generating a lot of interest. On paper, there’s not a huge amount different from the old Nexus 6P, in fact: an upgrade from the 6P’s IMX377 to the Pixel’s IMX378. That means 12.3-megapixels on the rear, with an f/2.0 lens and a combination of phase-detection and laser-detection autofocus, plus a dual-LED flash and up to 4K/30fps video recording. On the front, an 8-megapixel camera for selfies has an f/2.4 aperture and 1080/30p video capture; it’s actually the exact same sensor, Sony’s Exmor IMX179. There’s no camera bulge as you’ll find on the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, but then neither is there optical image stabilization (OIS). Instead, Google is pushing its EIS, or electronic image stabilization, which the company claims is as good as – or even better – the physical system Apple and others rely upon. I’ll confess, I was skeptical at that. The results, though, seem to tip in Google’s favor. Natural light, you won’t be surprised to hear, flatters the camera’s abilities the most. The twin autofocus systems are fast, as is capture and processing; hold your finger down on the shutter release, and you’ll snap burst shots as long as you press. You can either let Nougat pick which it thinks is the best of the bunch, or create a GIF animation out of all of them. Google’s HDR+ mode is set to Auto by default; force it to run on every frame, and there’s a moment’s pause after a capture as it processes. Although it may not have the twin cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL offers a faux-bokeh mode called Lens Blur to rival Apple’s Portrait mode. After you hit the shutter button, you lift the phone slightly; post-processing takes care of the rest, and you can manually adjust the blurring if you prefer. While the results aren’t always ideal, it’s a lot easier than transferring shots to your desktop and editing there. Low-light performance is solid too, though there’s the expected grain to be found in among the relatively high level of detail. The EIS shows its value here particularly, allowing for longer captures while minimizing blur or smearing. As for video, the EIS serves it well, though changes in brightness can cause the autofocus to stumble. Moving from a regularly-lit room to bright outdoor light, for instance, sent the camera scurrying to re-lock. Then there’s battery life. The Pixel XL has a 3,450 mAh li-ion battery, which supports Qualcomm’s fast charging for what Google claims will be up to 7hrs of use from 15 minutes on the bundled 18W adapter. Fully charged, the claim is up to 14 hours of WiFi or LTE browsing, the same amount of time of video playback, or up to 32 hours of talktime. Absent, and missed, is wireless charging. The Pixel – which I’m yet to test – has a smaller battery, too. Its 2,770 mAh is rated for up to 13 hours of WiFi or LTE browsing, or the same period of video playback. In practice, with several on the team carrying a Pixel XL, battery life has been more than impressive across the board. A full day is more than achievable; getting well into the second day on the same charge is equally possible. Tempted? Convinced, even? The Pixel and Pixel XL have a lingering sting in the tail, unfortunately, and that’s price. In recent years, Google’s Nexus phones have struck a price/feature balance skewed toward affordability. No, they may not have been the epitome of style or performance or photography refinement, but they’ve been SIM-free, unlocked, and most importantly fairly cheap. Pure Android at a compelling price is a strong equation for many. Nobody is going to accuse the Pixel XL of being cheap. It starts out at $769 for the 32GB version; if you want 128GB, you’re looking at $869. Opt for the smaller Pixel and you can save $120 on those numbers, but it’s still broadly in line with what Apple will charge you for an unlocked iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. Further muddying things is Google’s carrier deal. Officially, Verizon is the “exclusive” network, but the Pixel and Pixel XL actually come unlocked and support all of the big US carriers and most of the major networks worldwide. If you buy from Google direct, you don’t get Verizon’s preloaded apps and, more importantly, you don’t have to wait and see whether the operator’s commitment not to slow down future Android updates holds true. Meanwhile, Google will happily throw a free Project Fi SIM into the box when you order a Pixel from them direct. That means you’re actually using the networks of Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular in the US, not Verizon at all. There really is more to the Pixel and Pixel XL than just a change of branding from the Nexus of old. Google has taken a far stronger hand in shaping its flagship smartphones, and along with marginalizing the physical device manufacturer in the process, has pared away the device itself until it is a mere frame for the software. Never before has a “Google phone” so clearly been a husk within which the company’s services are packaged; the delivery mechanism for distributed intelligences like Google Assistant. That’s not, inherently, a bad thing, but it does make opting for Pixel a platform commitment as much – or more – than it is a hardware choice. You buy a Pixel because you buy into Google’s ecosystem vision of services. Ironically, while Apple might be more commonly thought of as controlling, the value proposition of an iPhone 7 seems far less tied to the Cupertino company’s services than Pixel does to those being developed down the road in Mountain View. In return you get a solid, if perhaps physically uninspiring device. A fast processor and great battery. A camera that’s not only good, but capable of some outstanding shots if the conditions are right. Just be sure you like how the flavor of Google’s vision tastes, because it’s everything the Pixel XL embodies.

Blog Steve Jobs Heard in Supreme Court Steve S. Chang 10/18/2016 08:00 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet In last week's Supreme Court hearing of the design patent case of Apple v. Samsung you could almost feel the presence of Steve Jobs. Just a week after the fifth anniversary of his untimely passing, Steve Jobs made an appearance -- at least in spirit -- at the U.S. Supreme Court. I was attending the oral argument in the patent suit between Apple and Samsung[1], and as I watched the arguments unfold, I was reminded several times of Mr. Jobs’ influence on our lives, the tech industry, and now the law. Here’s a quick summary of what happened. In 2011, Apple sued Samsung, alleging that 19 Samsung cell phones infringed several of Apple’s patents. Apple ultimately prevailed, and won an award of $399 million – Samsung’s entire profits on eleven of the accused smartphones.[2] The issue at the Supreme Court was whether the lower courts properly interpreted U.S. patent laws in awarding all of Samsung’s profits. The patents at issue were design patents. When most people think about patents, they think about utility patents on new and useful inventions, like cancer-fighting drugs or flying cars. Design patents, however, are different. Instead of covering useful inventions, design patents cover ornamental inventions. Most early design patents were for things like cast iron stoves. Although the technology behind different stoves may have been the same, different stovemakers went to great lengths to create cool ornamental designs for their stoves, and they lobbied for protection against copycats. Apple asserted three design patents against Samsung -- two had Steve Jobs as an inventor and were focused on the front face of the iPhone, while a third was directed to the phone’s home screen. Apple's case focused on three design patents on the original iPhone. The trial court awarded $399 million – all of Samsung’s profits on the infringing phones because of a provision in the U.S. patent laws that addressed design patents. That provision states that whoever “applies the patented design…to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale…shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit.[3] That provision was expressly added by Congress in the late 1800s, in response to a series of court cases involving carpets. In those cases, a design patent holder successfully proved that carpet manufacturers had copied the patented design, but was awarded only six cents because they were unable to prove how much of the infringer’s profits came from the design itself, as opposed to the carpets they sold.[4] While the total-profits concept might make sense for things like carpets, where the ornamental appearance is a main reason for purchase, it starts to raise eyebrows when applied to other products. One example used in the Supreme Court arguments involved a cup holder in a car: should the inventor of a novel cupholder design be entitled to all profits for a car, if the car had the infringing cupholder? Chief Justice John Roberts made a remark that reminded me of Steve Jobs’ passion for design. In particular, Chief Justice Roberts remarked that “all the chips and wires” on the inside of Apple’s iPhone don’t really contribute to the distinctive design of the phone’s exterior case. I was reminded of how Jobs famously insisted on making even the unseen parts on the inside of Apple’s products look as beautiful as possible.[5] The Supreme Court justices asked Samsung and Apple various questions about how courts should properly and fairly apply the existing design patent laws to situations like the cup holder. Both Apple and Samsung agreed that in general you would not want to give automatically the owner of the cup holder the entire profits of a car.[6] They said the issue should come down to how you prove what the “article of manufacture” actually was in a design patent case, and what effect that article had on the overall profits from the sale of the car. So in the cupholder case, the “article of manufacture” might just be the cupholder, and the proof of damages would focus on the effect that the cupholder had on the sales of the car. We should know how the Supreme Court wants us to handle these issues when it releases its decision, expected sometime around June 2017.  --Steve Chang (schang@bannerwitcoff.com) is a partner with the intellectual property law firm of Banner & Witcoff, Ltd., working on design and utility patents. END NOTES [1] Samsung Electronics Co. et al. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777 (U.S. December 16, 2015) [2] Other damages were awarded as well, but the issue before the Supreme Court only dealt with the $399 million. [3] 35 U.S.C. 289. [4] See, e.g., Dobson v. Dorman, 118 U.S. 10 (1886); Dobson v. Hartford Carpet Co., 114 U.S. 439 (1885); and Dobson v. Bigelow Carpet Co., 114 U.S. 439 (1885). [5] As recounted in Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs, Jobs once rejected an initial circuit board layout for the Apple II because “the lines were not straight enough.” Chapter Six, p. 224 (iBooks edition) [6] This is not to say that Apple agreed it shouldn’t have gotten the full $399 million.  They still contend that the evidence at trial supported that award, regardless of whether the Supreme Court articulates a new standard as a result of Samsung’s appeal.  Samsung, on the other hand, contends that at a minimum, there should be a new trial after the Supreme Court sets forth the proper standard for applying the design patent damages provision.

Ramin Talaie/Getty Images If you were setting out to build a smartphone, you could do a lot worse than make it an iPhone. Which is what Google seems to have done. For the last several days, I’ve been using a new Pixel XL, the first phone Google has designed and manufactured itself. (OK, the manufacturing is being handled by HTC, but on the same basis that Foxconn stamps out iPhones for Apple.) The Pixel is lovely and capable. But it feels and even looks like an iPhone. And not even the new iPhone 7: The Pixel, with its analog headphone jack and the antenna bands Apple managed to hide on its latest models, resembles nothing so much as an iPhone 6s, albeit one with the fingerprint reader on the back and some glass there along with the brushed aluminum. Don’t get me wrong, the 6s is a great phone. And the Pixel has a few tricks the iPhone doesn’t, like providing free, unlimited, full-resolution cloud storage for your photos and videos. But if you had as many resources as Google does, and as much at stake, wouldn’t you try for something different, something bolder, something … definitive? But there’s little definitive about the Pixel, save that it’s intended to be the vehicle for definitive versions of Google’s Android operating system—it runs version 7.1, known as “Nougat”—and the new, touted Google Assistant. The latter is supposed to be a vastly enhanced version of the “OK, Google” feature found on Android devices and in the Google Now app for iPhones and iPads. Google has long struggled with the question of whether and how to be in the hardware business. In early 2010, it launched the Nexus One, an HTC-designed phone, along with an innovative but ultimately unsuccessful online store where consumers could order unlocked devices and choose from among different carriers. Since then, it’s kept the Nexus name alive, bestowing it on a limited number of phones made by various companies. In 2012, it also acquired cellphone pioneer Motorola—but sold it less than two years later while retaining a vast trove of patents to arm itself for legal battles with Apple and others. This latest hardware push feels different—more like a commitment to take on Apple directly while controlling hardware, software and services from end to end rather than counting on third-party manufacturing partners. And it comes at a moment when the most important of those partners, Samsung, is reeling from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phone. In announcing the Pixel earlier this month, CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed Google Assistant to be its key feature. The idea is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning, plus the huge storehouse of data Google has on us, to provide better answers and more helpful suggestions than Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. In my early go-rounds with it, though, it seemed no smarter than Siri, and sometimes worse. When I asked who won Sunday’s playoff game, for instance, Google Assistant provided me with the results of the day’s regular-season NFL games. (Siri, by contrast, correctly deduced I meant baseball—the only sport currently holding its playoffs.) Anyone expecting to be dazzled out of the box by Google Assistant will be disappointed. And when I asked when the next presidential debate would be held, Siri gave me the specific information I asked for; Google returned three news stories, only one of which, if I opened it, contained the relevant information. I also found Google Assistant had a hard time accurately transcribing my questions, especially the first few words. Of course, one of the hallmarks of an AI-based system is it should get smarter over time. Still, anyone expecting to be dazzled out of the box by Google Assistant will be disappointed. Rather more satisfying are other Pixel features like battery life—a full day’s normal use still left me with close to a 50 percent charge—and the camera, which Google says received the highest-ever score for a cell phone in testing by image-processing company DxO. (It’s worth noting that Google’s claim excludes the iPhone 7 Plus, whose dual-camera set-up and zoom features make it my current favorite.) I’m also looking forward to trying the Pixel with Google’s Daydream virtual-reality headset, which wasn’t available  for review. As befits its premium positioning, the Pixel commands a premium price; the base model, with a 5-inch,1080p display and 32 gigabytes of storage, starts at $649, while the Pixel XL—which has a 5.5-inch 4K display—starts at $769. The phones will initially be available both through Verizon and directly from  Google. If you go the latter route, you can use it with Google’s terrific Project Fi wireless service; that’s what I’d do. Perhaps Google was wise to play it safe with the Pixel. After all, it’s a solid phone with a lot of nice touches, and establishes that Google can build Apple-caliber hardware. But if it really wants to establish the Pixel line as a true iPhone rival, it will need something more than a me-too approach.

Apple still wants to be in your car, it just doesn’t want to make your car. (“Apple-CarPlay” image by Sam Churchill on flickr, CC license CC BY 2.0) Apple puts on the brakes Apple is backing off its ambitious plan to manufacture its own cars. Bloomberg reports Apple will focus instead on building the software for autonomous vehicles. That leaves the option open down the road to either partner with an existing car manufacturer or revive the entire car-building program when it makes more sense. Vox chimes in on why building cars is so difficult, and why Silicon Valley companies have so far struggled to compete with Detroit on mass-produced vehicles. Inside Seattle’s homeless crisis The city of Seattle has cleared a homeless camp that dates back to the 1930s. Public radio station KUOW spent months getting to know some of the 400 people who lived in the camp, and tells their stories in a special report that aired last week. The report ends with a look forward at what can be done to address the housing challenges, financial and social, that affect so many cities. Chinese payola opens college doors A Chinese educational company helped its clients game the admissions process at major American universities, according to a Reuters investigation. Reuters says officials from the company, Dipont, wrote admissions essays for students, helped them alter high school transcripts and even paid off admissions officers to gain special access. To make things even weirder, the founder of Dipont has donated to U.S. institutions that are trying to stop the problem of admissions fraud, according to Reuters. Blocking the ad blockers The Atlantic is launching a new online subscription option for readers who want to view the site without ads. The Wall Street Journal reports the move will prevent people from visiting the site while using an ad-blocker. The WSJ says about 8.5% of Atlantic readers currently use ad blockers.

October 18 AAPL: 117.47 -0.08 Opinion: Could Apple’s rumored plan to drop the 11-inch MacBook Air signal a big price-drop for the 12-inch Retina MacBook? Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature Opinion 12-inch MacBook View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit A report from last night suggests that Apple is planning to drop the 11-inch MacBook Air when it unveils new MacBook Pro models later this month. Macotakara has an above-average track-record, but the move would – on the face of it – seem surprising. The 11-inch Air has always served two purposes. First, it has been the machine of choice for those who want a Mac in the sleekest possible form-factor. It of course lost that role when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, so that side of things makes sense. But the 11-inch machine also served a second role since the plastic MacBooks were phased out: as the entry-level machine designed to bring new customers into the Mac world. In particular, it appealed to students on a tight budget – customers whose lifetime value to Apple would be huge once hooked on Macs from a young age. It’s not a market Apple would want to abandon. So what might Apple be planning if the rumor is true … ? One way or another, Apple is going to want to keep that entry-level path open. So let’s start by looking at the current line-up, and the four possibilities I can see. The current entry-level machine is the base-model 11-inch MacBook Air at $899. The first possibility is that it could simply leave the older model in the line-up, iPhone-style, with maybe a $100 price drop. If you look at 9to5Toys over the past year, it’s been pretty easy to find the entry level MacBook Air for $100-$200 off and another $100 off for students. Next up in price is the 13-inch base-model at $999. So possibility two is that Apple may consider that the $100 difference isn’t that big a deal, and position the 13-inch Air as the new starting point. A third and related to the above possibility is that it could reduce the price of the 13-inch Air to $899, so that it retains the existing entry-level pricing but customers get a bit more for their money. But the fourth and most interesting possibility is that it significantly reduces the price of the 12-inch MacBook – currently priced well above the Air models at $1299 for the base-model and $1749 for the maxed-out version ($1599 plus $150 for the 1.3GHz upgrade). This might seem unlikely. Even if we take $999 as an acceptable entry point, that would mean Apple dropping the lowest price of its shiniest executive toy by $300 – or 23%. That would be a huge price-drop from a company not noted for slashing its margins. But there is precedent. The 27-inch 5K iMac launched two years ago at a starting price of $2499. Apple’s current pricing for the machine starts at just $1799 (or $1649 on Amazon) – a massive reduction of $700, or 28%. Of course, that isn’t a true like-for-like comparison. The original entry-level machine had a fusion drive and 3.5GHz CPU, while the current one has a spinning-metal drive and a 3.2Ghz processor. But even if we take the mid-range machine, with the fusion drive, that’s still $500 cheaper than at launch. Perhaps Apple could position a 2015-spec 12-inch MacBook as the new entry-level machine, at $999? There have been, after all, sales on the previous generation models that hit the $999 mark. While that was notably weedier than the 2016 model, the vast majority of MacBook and MacBook Air users are not doing anything demanding. The average MacBook owner uses their machines to run standard productivity apps, browse the web and watch movies. The old-spec machine is perfectly able to perform these jobs. So while many will be expressing dismay at the rumor, it could turn out to be a good thing. Sure, there will still be some – like me – who love the small size of the 11-inch Air but still use it for some photo and video editing, but we’re a tiny minority. For most 11-inch MacBook Air buyers, a basic-spec 12-inch MacBook will get the job done, and in a much sexier package. If Apple can make that the new starting point, it will attract a lot of new Mac buyers. What do you think? Am I being hopelessly optimistic here, or is this a viable possibility?

Google launched the premium device, available in five-inch and 5.5-inch variants, on October 4. It will be available from Carphone Warehouse and EE in the UK from October 20 and is the company’s first own-branded handset, having worked with HTC, Samsung and Huawei in the last six years for its Nexus range. A major feature is Google Assistant, similar to Apple’s Siri. Unlike its rival, it uses data from the owner’s Google history to tailor information. It can also be paired with Google Home, an IoT device that lets users control connected devices in the home. Google vice president of global operations Ana Corrales confirmed to Mobile News the company was targeting the premium smartphone market, claiming Google Assistant enables it to offer “features others can’t”. According to IDC, Internet of Things technologies will be worth £1.3 trillion by 2020 as more consumer products become available. Carphone Warehouse managing director Jeremy Fennell backed these features to help Google compete with the market leaders. “There is demand for customers who want this kind of experience. The phone is at the centre of your life and you can extend that through AI and IoT products. “This can help them compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung. It’s a product that’s differentiated enough and there’s always an appetite for new technology like this.” Fickle industry Vodafone partner Maintel group strategy director Rufus Grig agreed, claiming the premium market is currently lacking innovation. “It’s a fickle industry and the iPhone 7 is unexciting. Now is a good time to release any new device into that market, because it does seem pretty uninspiring.” GfK technology director Imran Choudhary concluded: “It certainly has a chance of competing against Samsung and Apple purely because of its presence and size. If not this year, then certainly the next. “They have really good brand awareness among customers and the new phone has enough features in terms of differentiation. They’re capable of taking on the more premium brands.” TAGS Ana Corrales Apple Carphone Warehouse EE GfK Google IDC Imran Choudhary Jeremy Fennell Maintel Mobile News Pixel Rufus Grig Samsung SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleO2: "We have not been distracted and are more focused than ever on our partners" Next articleSix Degrees Group surpasses £100m revenue on fifth anniversary Alex Yau http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR EE hits out at government report over poor coverage Dealers revolt as Vodafone scraps renewal connection bonuses Samsung to buy automotive specialists HARMAN for $8bn NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Business Development Manager: Garry Wybourn – 0203 122 0872 / 07747 632 553 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

All three devices were announced during Apple's September 7 iPhone event, and are positioned as compatible options for users looking to purchase wireless headsets due to the iPhone 7's lack of a 3.5mm headphone port. In the ad, celebrities including Nicki Minaj, Amber Rose, Rebel Wilson, Juno Temple, Steve Buscemi, and more, all sing along to "I've Got No Strings" from Disney's Pinocchio. Most of the people in the commercial are seen sporting the company's newer model, the BeatsX, which it aims as a more mobile and everyday pair of headphones. That's in contrast to the over-the-head Solo3 and activity-focused Powerbeats3. All three Beats devices include Apple's W1 chip, which allows the new headphones -- like Apple's new AirPods -- to take advantage of easy, instant pairing to an iPhone. They also come with Fast Fuel, a fast-charging solution that can deliver more power with 5 minutes of charging. 5 minutes of charging delivers 3 hours of playback for the Solo3, 2 hours of playback for the BeatsX and an hour of playback for the Powerbeats3. The Solo3 has been available to purchase for $299 on Apple.com since the September 7 event, but the Powerbeats3 ($199) and BeatsX ($149) won't be coming out until sometime later in the year, likely to coincide with the holiday shopping season. Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Tag: Beats by Dre 35 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) newyorksole 4 weeks ago I found this ad awful. Apple's obsession with celebrities highlights the vacuousness that defines it under Tim Cook. What is the point of Apple today? They have become like every other obnoxious tech company. For as long as Cook is CEO, this company is going to keep shrinking in revenue and profits. For me, they effectively shut up shop in October 2011. Things couldn't be much worse. That's funny because Apple has been growing in revenue in profits every quarter since Tim Cook took over... except for one quarter. What exactly do you want from Apple? So what if they use celebrities in their ads. Pop culture is everywhere these days. Rating: 7 Votes GrumpyMom 4 weeks ago Whatever. A bunch of famous/infamous people paid to strut around to show off wireless headphones. I own some of this crap. I know what I like and don't like about it all and I'm not going to beat that dead horse here again. I will hang onto my wired headphones and earbuds until I can no longer get a good quality smart phone that has the 3.5 mm jack. Meanwhile, I've got no dongles, either. Nor do my ears look like they're smoking cigs. And no strutting celebs and cute baby will persuade me to have it any other way. /grump ;) Rating: 6 Votes Daniël Oosterhuis 4 weeks ago Apple's obsession with celebrities highlights the vacuousness that defines it under Tim Cook.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News A MacBook Air with USB-C could be on the way (but don’t expect an 11-inch model) A MacBook Air with USB-C could be on the way (but don’t expect an 11-inch model) By Darren Allan Laptops   Revamped MacBook Air and Pro models will supposedly be revealed this month Shares More chatter from the MacBook grapevine (or should that be Apple-vine? – no, probably not) has emerged reinforcing the prospect of revamped offerings being revealed before the month is out, including a new 13-inch MacBook Air with USB-C. The latest from Japanese tech site Mac Otakara is that according to its sources, Apple will unveil refreshed MacBook Pro 13-inch and 15-inch laptops at some point later in October – as previous rumors have indicated – and these models will ship before the end of the month. And the aforementioned 13-inch MacBook Air will also debut, but apparently the 11-inch Air will be canned. Again, this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that; indeed, back in the summer, Mac Otakara cited a Chinese supplier saying that the plug would be pulled on the smallest MacBook Air. However, at the time there was also speculation that a 15-inch version of the Air would be introduced, and there’s no mention of that now. The Japanese site also notes that all of these new MacBook models will run with USB-C ports along with Thunderbolt 3, which is again in line with some previous chatter. But of course, all this remains speculation, and as ever, some of these rumors pan out, and some don’t. Clock is ticking  At any rate, as MacRumors, which spotted this development, notes, time is rather running out if there is to be a press event for Apple’s launch of these new notebooks. Invites will pretty much have to be going out today, or in the next couple of days, for a near-the-end of October launch, if it’s going to happen. Although it’s possible Apple plans to introduce the new hardware with a simple set of press releases. That might depend on the gravity of the changes being made to the devices. On the MacBook Air front, as well as the mentioned connectivity changes, among other rumors, we might finally see a Retina display, or at least an option for one – although Apple will have to play a careful balancing act in terms of the pricing of the range. Particularly if the 11-inch version is being dumped, which is the cheapest MacBook available, the loss of which will certainly hurt those who want to buy a wallet-friendly Apple laptop. (The 11-inch Air runs to a relatively palatable £749, $899 over in the US, or AU$1,399 in Australia). As for the MacBook Pro, speculation includes the introduction of an OLED touchpad providing dynamically changing context-sensitive keys that adapt to whatever app you’re currently using (replacing the row of function keys at the top of the keyboard), and a super-slim design helped by specially crafted metal injection molded hinges. The rumored USB-C ports are further anticipated to be of the USB 3.1 Gen 2 flavor, making them zippier than the (Gen 1) port which Apple introduced with the 12-inch MacBook.

Apple's old handset could be obsolete by November The phone was launched in 2010 and succeeded by the iPhone 4S in 2011 Report suggest it will soon be added to Apple's official 'obsolete' list This means that the firm will no longer offer service repairs  By Libby Plummer For Mailonline Published: 07:18 EST, 18 October 2016 | Updated: 07:35 EST, 18 October 2016 e-mail 289 shares 89 View comments Apple users still clinging onto their iPhone 4 handsets will soon find them officially out-of-date. That's according to new reports that the aging device will be added to Apple's official list of obsolete products on 31 October.    Apple defines 'vintage' products as those that have not been manufactured for more than five years and less than seven years ago. The Cupertino tech firm considers anything that was discontinued more than seven years ago to be obsolete.  Scroll down for video  Apple users still clinging onto their iPhone 4 handsets will soon find them officially out-of-date. That's according to new reports that the aging device will be added to Apple's official list of obsolete products on 31 October END OF THE HOME BUTTON?  Apple's latest patent reveals technology that places the home button underneath the display. The innovation uses an electrostatic lens that connects the screen and sensors, allowing the device to accurately read fingerprints on the screen. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with the user’s finger, reports AppleInsider. These specially designed lenses would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user’s finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint’s natural dispersion. While the  firm offers limited service repairs for vintage products, no such support is continued for obsolete products.  'Apple has discontinued all hardware service for obsolete products with no exceptions,' the company explains on its website.  'Service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products'. While Apple made versions of the iPhone 4 using CDMA technology officially obsolete last year, the new October deadline will include all iPhone 4 handsets, reports Japanese website Macotakara.  The iPhone 4 was first released in 2010 and was succeeded by the iPhone 4S in 2011. Apple ceased making the iPhone 4 in 2013, after it achieved the milestone of being the firm's longest serving flagship handset, racking up 15 months in the top spot. The late 2010 13-inch MacBook Air, the third-generation AirPort Extreme and the mid 2009 AirPort Time Capsule Wi-Fi stations will also be added to Apple's 'obsolete' list at the end of October, reports Macotakara.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Will Google desktop users be left behind?

Share this article Share 289 shares While the report concentrates on Japan, any products added to Apple's official obsolete list are likely to suffer the same fate in other major markets, including the UK and US. The iPhone 4's rumoured obsolescence is unsurprising, given that the handset is more than six years old. As the firm continues to update its iOS software to work with its latest handsets, it isn't primarily designed to work with ageing hardware. The same is also true for other phone manufacturers.    Apple has been contacted for comment.   The iPhone 4 was first released in 2010 and was succeeded by the iPhone 4S in 2011. Apple ceased making the iPhone 4 in 2013, after it achieved the milestone of being the firm's longest serving flagship handset, racking up 15 months in the top spot Read more: Apple¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿MacBook Air (13-inch, Late 2010)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿2016/10/31¿¿¿ | ¿¿¿¿ | Mac¿ ...

Make hearty fall curries Trish Mumme 12:05 a.m. EDT October 18, 2016 Trish Mumme 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE When there’s a little nip in the air, I get in the mood for a spicy curried stew with nutritious fall vegetables. Here are two tempting versions to try this month. The chicken one uses a slow cooker, and the pork version could probably also be adapted successfully for a slow cooker. Hot cider and a green salad are all you need to complete these meals. Curried Apple-Pork Stew 1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder 4 medium red and/or green crisp-tart cooking apples 1 tab. cooking oil 1 large onion, cut into thin wedges 1 tab. curry powder One 14 oz. can chicken broth 2/3 cup apple cider or apple juice 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. black pepper 1 12 oz. package peeled baby carrots 2 stalks celery, sliced 1 large butternut squash, or 2 sweet potatoes peeled, seeded, and cubed(about 3 cups) Sour cream, shredded orange peel, and/or snipped fresh oregano for garnish Trim fat from pork and cut in 1-inch cubes. Peel, core, and chop two apples; set aside. In a 4-quart Dutch oven brown pork, half at a time, in hot oil; return all pork to pan. Add chopped apples, onion, and curry powder; cook and stir 2 minutes. Add broth, cider, salt, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add carrots and celery to pork mixture; return to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cut remaining apples into 1/4-inch-thick wedges. Add apples and squash to pan. Cover; cook 10 to 12 minutes or until pork and vegetables are tender. Serve with sour cream, orange peel, and oregano. Serves 6. Sweet Potato and Chicken Curry 1 15 oz. can coconut milk 1/2 cup chicken broth or bouillon 1 tab. curry powder 1.5 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs 3 med. sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed 1 cup baby carrots, halved 1 med. onion, chopped 1 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. black pepper Handful of cilantro leaves for garnish Hot cooked rice Whisk together coconut milk, chicken broth and curry powder in slow cooker. Add chicken thighs, sweet potatoes, carrots, and onion sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir and cook on low for 8 hours. Serve over rice and garnish with cilantro leaves. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2eLt9ih TOP VIDEOS Johnstown's Workman wraps up stellar career 0:51

Debates, commentary and tweets from this seasons unlikely pair of US presidential candidates have been causing big swings in the US markets. Meanwhile, the wild ride in Deutsche Bank shares has been swaying markets on the other side of the Atlantic here as investors ponder whether Germanys largest financial institution is too big to fail. While basically solvent at the moment, the US government recently slapped DB with a massive politically-motivated fine which some believe could push the bank to the brink of collapse. Investors are awaiting a possible settlement with the US Department of Justice less one month before Americas election and less than 12 months before German Chancellor Angela Merkel comes up for her reelection. Politics are front and centre but investors should not be tempted to overreact. Election season is, of course, the time of year when investment strategists bring out the historical charts of whether the stock market does better or worse under a Democrat or a Republican president. Then there is the question of whether the Senate and Congress are controlled by the same party and if that helps or hurts. Personally, I do not believe that such historical studies are particularly relevant this time around. For one thing, these candidates are the most disliked and distrusted party leaders to have ever run for Americas highest office (according to independent surveys). Meanwhile, the US is experiencing the poorest post-recession recovery in the countrys history while being propped up by unprecedented levels of money-printing and artificially low interest rates. These are not exactly normal times. Historical studies are interesting to contemplate but each business cycle is different. Noted economist John Mauldin likes to say the struggle for economic growth is always between innovation which creates wealth versus governments and central banks which destroy it. One recent example is Apple which has grown over the past two decades to become the largest publicly-traded company in the world by developing innovative computing products while creating millions of jobs along the way. Apples latest series of market-leading smart phones helped pioneer an innovative glide path for the burgeoning mobile internet. Then last month the European Union hit Apple with an unexpected tax bill of $14.5 billion, because they can. Or at least they think they can. Interestingly, the ruling is on appeal by the government of Ireland, Apples European domicile, which actually does not want the tax money. Ireland has been trying to keep corporate tax rates down in order to encourage direct foreign investment  a strategy that has been working. At least one country gets it. Looking at the two US candidates, we see more examples of wealth destruction policies. Mrs Clinton has announced she will go after the drug companies through price controls, go after wealthy people with higher taxes and go after the banks with more regulations. Apparently the only thing she wont go after is the smothering $20 trillion federal debt load and the reckless government spending which caused it. Choking debt, barely a footnote in this election, has been the main source of anaemic growth and stagnant incomes, a fact confirmed by many studies, including this months report from the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, the Donalds plan is less clear. Although he has a good point on lowering Americas corporate tax rate, currently the highest among the developed world countries, many believe his protectionist views on trade also have the potential to destroy wealth. Despite the elevated political noise, investors can still profit by using market swings to their advantage. Importantly, the American political system is constitutionally constructed with a series of checks and balances. Legislation must be voted on by both the House of Representatives and the Senate with the President having the right to veto. Besides the President, America has another 535 voting members in Washington. Weak hands selling assets purely on the basis of Americas presidency may provide opportunities. Politicians typically talk extremes in order to set themselves apart during election season, but actually passing much of this legislation is a whole different story. For example, Mr Obama spent a record $1.5 billion on political advertising to conjure a vision of hope and change. The clever campaign was enough to get him elected twice, but in the end nothing much happened. In the case of the Obama presidency, the stock market actually did fairly well as Congress was able to neutralise some of the most destructive proposed legislation while the Fed kept the pedal to the metal on monetary policy. Medical students are taught primum non nocere, or first, do no harm. As a rule of thumb, this is usually the best outcome from government, too. Healthcare and financial stocks, this years two worst performing industries, offer compelling opportunities for longer term investors. Both sectors have been beaten down by political banter. As mentioned above, the banking sector continues to face major fines related to the credit crisis seven years ago. Governments in the US and Europe have been using large financial institutions as sovereign piggy banks of sorts, slapping the largest ones with the biggest fines. However, with loan growth beginning to pick up, the real estate market edging forward and interest rates likely seeing an increase (at least in the US), the financial sector has good potential from these depressed valuations. The government fines are large but they are finite and the better managed banks have recently been allowed to begin returning cash to shareholders. Not surprisingly, healthcare is once again being kicked around like a political football. Late last year, a negative tweet from Mrs Clinton was enough to knock billions of dollars in market value off the group. Political rhetoric about the high cost of healthcare is louder than ever, but the positive long-term fundamentals of an ageing population should ultimately supersede the inevitable Washington meddling. Meanwhile, exceptional levels of innovation are occurring in healthcare, particularly in the areas of oncology and immunology. Therapeutic drugs are now reaching the market in less than half the time required a decade ago and companies are becoming more productive. At the same time, merger and acquisition activity has been robust with the major pharmaceutical companies leveraging their vast distribution systems by snapping up smaller drug and biotech concerns.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is expected to eliminate traditional USB ports and its MagSafe connector from the new MacBook Pro, which will make its official debut later this month, according to a new rumor. It’s thought the Cupertino company also has plans to scrap the 11-inch MacBook Air. Japanese website Macotakara, which has been reliable with its Apple news in the past (it was among the first to report the iPhone 7 series would lose its headphone jack), claims the new MacBook Pro will be unveiled during an event later this month. The machine is expected to come in 15.4- and 13.3-inch options like its predecessors, and like the 12-inch Retina MacBook, it will switch to USB-C. Traditional USB ports and the iconic MagSafe connector will disappear. The site adds that Apple won’t discontinue the MacBook Air series just yet, but it will drop the 11-inch model from its lineup and focus solely on the 13.3-inch model instead. This makes sense now that the 12-inch MacBook is available and selling well. The new MacBook Pro is expected to feature an improved design with an OLED touchbar above its keyboard. Some rumors have also claimed it will be the first Mac with Touch ID, allowing users to log in using only their fingerprint.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 18, 2016 3:59 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Artificial Intelligence Apple iOS Emerging Technology Apple Comments Ever wish Siri was more intelligent? Well, it seems Apple's virtual assistant will be moving in that direction with the hiring of Apple's first ever director of A.I. research. So who is this new director? And what does Apple hope to accomplish? In IT Blogwatch, we ask Siri for the answers. So who is this famed new director of A.I. research? Michelle Starr has the details: Apple is getting serious about artificial intelligence...It's just hired its first director of A.I...Ruslan Salakhutdinov. ... Salakhutdinov...primarily researches deep learning and neural networks, where computers learn from a large pool of examples...but Salakhutdinov's research takes it a step farther -- he's trying to figure out how to get A.I. to learn from raw data. So why did Apple select him as the director? Will Knight is in the know: Salakhutdinov, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, will...help the company make sure that Siri and its other products make use of the fundamental breakthroughs coming out of academic A.I. research. ... Salakhutdinov’s work on cutting-edge machine-learning techniques could...drive progress in A.I., and...could be applied in...different areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and even robotics. And what exactly does this mean for Apple as it continues work in A.I.? Kif Leswing has one theory: His hiring raises the question of whether Apple's growing A.I. team will take a more academic approach to A.I. research...One of the...reasons why people believe that Apple is falling behind in the field is...Apple's researchers don't publish their research, because Apple has traditionally kept its methods secret until a new product is launched. That secretive approach may be hampering Apple's recruiting efforts in the A.I. field...By contrast, Google and its A.I. subsidiary, DeepMind, publish their research all the time. But hiring Salakhutdinov is not the only steps that Apple has taken to bolster its A.I. chops? So what else is it doing? Edoardo Maggio fills us in: In the recent months, Apple...gobbled up Tuplejump, Perceptio, VocalIQ, Mapsense, Emotient, Coherent Navigation and Semetric...to remain at the forefront of A.I., machine learning and other similar, relatively new-wave technologies. But what about that perception that Apple is falling behind in the field of artificial intelligence? Our own Apple Holic, Jonny Evans, isn't having it: Apple’s A.I. will not be technology for the sake of it...the company wants to protect your privacy while it brings you convenience.

A report from Quartz reveals how the company files trademark applications for new products, including macOS and the Apple Watch, in Jamaica. The country's trademark databases aren’t as accessible as those in other countries, which means Apple can keep its plans under wraps for longer, while still claiming the rights to unreleased products. Related: iPhone 7 As the report states: "The Jamaica Intellectual Property Office allows visitors to search filings in person at its office in Kingston. "People can also ask the office to search filings for them, but a Jamaican address is required to receive the results, and the process takes three weeks. "A lawyer in Jamaica, however, can be appointed to perform the search, the office told Quartz. It said it has no current plans to put its filings database online." According to the report, filing trademarks in Jamaica gives Apple about six extra months of privacy, with the company eventually filing in the US. Other firms such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also make use of Jamaica's more secretive trademark database, but Apple is apparently the most prolific filer. Elsewhere, Google engages in a similar practice in Tonga, while countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and South Africa are also popular with companies looking to keep trademarks a secret.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit Recent Posts: The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit View All Posts In a blog post, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Devices team announced the company will be holding a special event on Oct. 26. It has been a while since MSFT made any major product announcements, so what can we expect to see two weeks from now? Source: Microsoft There are plenty of theories, but here are a few of the most likely. New Surface PC to Take on the iMac Photos have leaked online of a new Surface-branded keyboard and mouse. The company has been always offered a range of wireless accessories. And recently, in wake of vulnerabilities discovered in millions of older wireless keyboards, MSFT has been heavily promoting its line of AES encrypted keyboards. However … Given the credibility it has gained as a premium hardware designer after the release of the Surface Pro tablet, then the Surface Book laptop, a new Surface All-in-One PC seems highly likely. That keyboard and mouse may sell separately, but would likely be pack-ins included with the new desktop computer. The 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Every Retirement Portfolio PC sales have been in the dumps, but MSFT has proven it has the design chops to steal premium device dollars from its OEMs in the Windows tablet and laptop spaces. It’s only natural it would want to take on the desktop PC as well. But by going the route of releasing a minimalist, All-in-One Surface PC, Microsoft gets a device that looks infinitely sexier than just a box. Just as importantly, it would have an option to take on rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its popular iMac line. A Surface PC using the All-in-One approach — which actually shows up in a patent filing uncovered by Windows Central — would have appeal to professionals, especially when paired with a Surface pen for interaction. Apple’s iMac lacks this capability altogether. Windows 10 The Verge and other outlets are looking for the Microsoft Event to include a Windows 10 component. Specifically, MSFT is expected to outline its plans for two major feature releases in 2017, code-named “Redstone 2” and “Redstone 3.” The general theme of the Windows 10 presentation is expected to be the operating system’s tight integration with Widows devices. MSFT will be pushing this as a productivity and convenience advantage. There could also be some Xbox gaming news, focused on Windows 10 integration. Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, Band 3? Nope, Nope and cancelled (supposedly). It looks as though MSFT isn’t going to show off a refreshed Surface Pro — or Surface Book, for that matter. Instead, rumors have Microsoft playing nice with its OEM manufacturing partners (perhaps repairing some damage done by the news of the new Surface PC), instead featuring their laptops onstage. MSFT may still be planning to take on Apple and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google with a flagship Surface smartphone, but don’t expect to see it at this Microsoft event. The Microsoft Band 3 fitness tracker apparently exists — at least spy shots have leaked of it — but the device has been cancelled, at least for now. Microsoft has gone on record saying existing Band 2 inventory has been sold through with no plans to replace it this year. Additionally, the company has removed the Band SDK for developers and is purging references from its webstore. McDonald’s Corporation Shakes Up C-Suite to Revive Sales (MCD) If you want to hear what MSFT has to reveal at the October Microsoft event, check the website for a live stream. For all the details without having to listen to two hours of how cool Windows 10 is or how the new Surface PC is going to kick the iMac off trendy desktops everywhere, check back here for our post-event wrap-up. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Photo: Joseph Erdos) Apple pie, apple crisp, apple turnovers, apple tart, apple sauce, apple cider — it’s the season for apples. I can’t think of a better way of enjoying it other than by baking with apples. Who doesn’t love a classic apple pie this time of year? They’re worth making from scratch — the dough, the subtly spiced apple filling, warm out of the oven. But when you want to quickly put together an apple dessert, a pie just takes too much attention. That’s when this simple tart comes in to play. Based on a French apple tart, which is made with a pastry dough bottom, this recipe uses store-bought puff pastry instead. It’s a shortcut that’s worth making. The crisp puff pastry, soft apples and sweet almond filling all come together to make one amazing dessert that’s impressive enough to fool anyone into thinking it took all of your time. Typically, the classic recipe would use applesauce as a base under the apple slices, but that would make this puff pastry tart incredibly soggy. So instead, this recipe uses almonds, sort of like a frangipane tart. When working with puff pastry, be careful to handle it as little as possible. Trim around the edges of the rectangle of dough using a sharp knife. Don’t pull the knife, but cut down. Using a pastry wheel or dull knife would compact all the buttery layers of the dough, inhibiting it from rising in the oven. For this tart, score a border around the edge to create a clean line of demarcation between the apples and crust. Docking the main area with a fork keeps the center from puffing up unevenly during baking. If, after baking, there are puffy bumps under the apple layer, use a pin to let out the steam. Serve this beautiful tart with afternoon coffee and tea or for any special or ordinary occasion. Apple Puff Pastry Tart 1 sheet puff pastry, preferably Dufour, defrosted overnight 1/3 cup slivered blanched almonds 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 apples, preferably Cortland, McIntosh, or Macoun 2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon) 1/4 cup light-brown sugar 2 tablespoons apricot jelly Unfold puff pastry dough on a large sheet of parchment paper, lightly dusted with flour. Dust the rolling pin with flour and roll out dough to about a 10-inch-by-15-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour. Using a ruler as a guide, trim off excess dough along the entire perimeter. Transfer pastry with parchment paper to a rimless baking sheet. Using a ruler and the back of a knife, score a 1/2-inch border around the pastry. Using a fork, dock the interior area sparingly. This will keep the center from puffing unevenly. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator to chill while preparing the apples. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a food processor, pulse the almonds and sugar until finely ground. Peel and core the apples. Slice them very thin, about 1/8 thickness. Toss with lemon juice to prevent browning. Spread the almonds on the pastry. Evenly and overlap the apple slices over the almond mixture, creating three rows lengthwise. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the apples. Brush off any almond crumbs or sugar from the pastry border and the pan. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake the tart until the pastry is golden and the apples are soft, about 25 minutes. While the tart cools, mix the jelly with 2 tablespoons hot water. Strain out any solids. Brush the apple slices with the jelly glaze. Cut the tart into squares and serve. Makes 8 large squares.

While PayPal is the clear leader in terms of users across all US smartphone owners and mobile payment app users, merchants are requesting Apple Pay “much more” than they are requesting PayPal when it comes to in-store payments (67% vs 8%), the findings show. When looking at the mobile payment app users specifically: Nearly 70% use PayPal About 40% use the Starbucks app More than 30% use Apple Pay About 25% use Android Pay More than 20% use Chase Pay About 18% use Samsung Pay While more than 67% of mobile payment app users are only using one mobile payment app. Mobile payment app users report spending US$98 per month using PayPal, $75 per month with Apple Pay and $56 per month with Android Pay. Among retailer-branded apps, Starbucks is the leader with 7% of US smartphone users, followed by Dunkin’ Donuts (3%). ‘Competitive disadvantage’ “While PayPal is the clear market share leader, more merchants are requesting information from Apple Pay than any other mobile payment solution,” says Chris Tweedt, research analyst at Parks Associates. “Apple has added a Pay with Apple Pay button into its Safari browser and the company has signed up 21 of the top 100 online merchants, with others to come. Likewise, Google has launched an Android Pay function into its mobile Chrome browser. PayPal’s counter strategy is to leverage its large customer base and Venmo’s popularity to expand into in-store payments and earn revenue from transaction fees.” “Merchants must be ready to accept mobile payments because those that wait will be at a competitive disadvantage,” Tweedt adds. “Users don’t spend much money with mobile apps today, but we expect to see a large increase — as much as 150% — in mobile payment users and transaction values over the next five years.” LEARN MORE — Topics: Android Pay, App, Apple Pay, Chase Pay, Chris Tweedt, Chrome, Mobile payments, Retail, Safari, Samsung Pay, Survey Trials and live services: USA Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Featured partner: Get NFC World's email newsletter The top industry headlines by email, every Wednesday.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Goldman says Apple should launch a Prime-killing subscription plan Goldman says Apple should launch a Prime-killing subscription plan Goldman says Apple could start creating its own content, much like Netflix Inc. has created shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. By: Bloomberg | Published:October 18, 2016 4:16 pm Goldman says Apple could start creating its own content, much like Netflix Inc. has created shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. Is it time to ‘subscribe’ to Apple Inc.? As the iPhone becomes a less dependable source of growth at the world’s most valuable company, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say a monthly subscription service could be the company’s next killer product. According to a note by Simona Jankowski and her team, the proposal would both boost sales of the smartphone and help the company challenge new competitors. “We think Apple should launch a subscription bundle as a way to reinforce iPhone loyalty and leverage it into content,” she writes. The team drew up a plan that would cost roughly $50 per month and — in addition to paying for the smartphone through monthly subscriptions — would offer other products like Apple TV, Apple Music and freemium access to the iTunes library, in the style of the enhanced rewards enjoyed by Amazon Prime customers. Subscriptions have been a key driver of profit at Amazon.com Inc., with analysts citing strong growth in the service as they upgrade the company’s profit estimates. A subscription plan could serve a dual purpose for the tech giant, the Goldman team writes. Not only would it set the firm’s smartphone apart from products offered by competitors like Samsung Electronics Co., but it would allow it to take on companies like Amazon that are already well-established in the streaming space. Goldman says Apple could start creating its own content, much like Netflix Inc. has created shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. Still, original productions should be a lower priority than adding live sports and more “sought after programming,” according to the bank’s analysts. Live sports is an area in which Apple would have some unorthodox competition, after Twitter Inc. recently signed a deal to stream a number of NFL games online. In the case of Apple, Jankowski says that it would benefit both the tech giant as well as the sports networks it partners with. “We believe Apple could partner with national sports networks, such as ESPN, Fox Sports etc., and offer the content bundled through Apple Prime,” Jankowski writes, suggesting an additional cost of roughly $10 per month. “While it would be beneficial for Apple and its consumers, we also see merit in this move for the sports networks, since it would help them position for an increasingly OTT future [i.e., video streamed over the internet], while maintaining the economics of the traditional pay TV bundle.” She argues that a partnership between Apple and ESPN would let the sport network “add a new type of bundle that could preserve its pay TV economics while allowing it to participate in the OTT trend.” Bundling sports video is a point of contention among the analysts. Drew Borst, Goldman’s media and advertising analyst, sounded a note of caution over the feasibility of such a deal. “We think this proposition is a tough sell to the likes of ESPN or Fox Sports in the near-term,” Borst writes.”However, over the long-term, if cord cutting accelerates and sports networks distribution continues shrinking, then this proposition could make sense.” Among analysts Apple currently has 44 buy recommendations, 7 holds and 3 sells, with an average 12-month price target of $129, according to Bloomberg data. That represents more than a $10 improvement on where it traded by 10 a.m. in New York. Its next earnings report is scheduled after the market closes on Oct. 25.

[Photo: Eric Ogden; hair: Tai Crawford; makeup: Flynn Pyykkonen] Rick Tetzeli 10.17.16 6:00 AM General Motors CEO Mary Barra was walking the stage at the J.P. Morgan Automotive conference in New York on an early August morning, making a dramatic point-by-point case for the company she leads: that GM, despite all its challenges and varied competitors, just might be the strongest and most well-positioned business in all of automotive transportation. And how did the audience of investors respond to Barra’s pitch? With seeming indifference. Indeed, many of the attendees appeared to be more engaged with their iPhones than the CEO’s presentation. It wasn’t just that lunchtime was approaching and blood-sugar levels were low, or that the meeting room’s drab brown-and-tan decor and muted acoustics had dulled everyone’s senses. No, the bigger obstacle was most likely an instinctive skepticism about GM itself—and, perhaps, about Barra, too. General Motors was once an acclaimed titan, the most respected company in America, but those days are long gone. Decades of decline have been punctuated by bankruptcy, a government bailout, and a devastating ignition-switch design flaw that has been implicated in 139 deaths. All of this solidified the notion that GM was a dysfunctional, bureaucracy-ridden has-been. If any business was likely to dominate the future of auto transport, it would be a Silicon Valley darling like Uber, Tesla, Google, or even Apple—all of which have been aggressively investing in disrupting the car business as we know it. They are the ones with the creativity, the talent, and the consumer passion to do something special. Not old-fashioned GM. As for Barra herself—dressed in a conservative brown suit, speaking with a flat, slightly nasal Michigan accent—her stage presence didn’t exactly challenge this story line. The best she could do to liven up her less-than-dynamic delivery was chopping one hand into the other to punctuate her argument. A 35-year lifer at GM, Barra is a product of the exact company and culture that she is tasked with transforming. Perhaps it’s no surprise that GM’s valuation has dropped by about a quarter since she became CEO, the stock falling from $39 a share to a recent $32. If there is anything unexpected about her as a GM leader, it’s that she’s a woman (which, unfortunately, hasn’t always been viewed as an asset in the testosterone heavy auto world). But here’s the wacky thing: What if all those reasons for doubting GM and dismissing Barra as something less than a Steve Jobs–like revolutionary . . . what if they are all wrong? A case of prejudice and assumption that misses some larger understanding? What if Barra is the perfect leader to reestablish GM as a premium, world-beating brand, outdueling all of those tech cowboys? Now that would be a story for the ages. GM does have some things going for it, signs that it just might be a winner in the long-haul future of transportation—if things line up the right way. After Barra’s J.P. Morgan presentation, I met with her in a conference room upstairs in the bank’s offices, one of several meetings I’ve had with her and her top lieutenants over the past few months. Barra, an electrical engineer, doesn’t have the shiny bravado of so many tech-world leaders, but a career spent overseeing factories, supply chains, and GM’s entire product portfolio has given her a practicality they sometimes lack. She is much more at ease in person than she was on stage. When she explained that her father, who spent 35 years working as a die maker in a GM factory, taught her the value of hard work, it came off as authentic, not clichéd. She is keenly aware that GM’s 223,000 employees will have to behave differently if its plans for the future are to succeed; that she needs to replace a culture of blame and bureaucracy with one driven by accountability, speed, and collaboration. "In this area of rapid transformation, you have to have a culture that’s agile," she said. "We still have a lot of work to do." GM To Top Tech Talent: Ditch Silicon Valley For Detroit By reinventing its culture, the old-line automaker hopes to attract those looking to shake things up, rather than beat them into submission. GM could have gone away in 2009, disappeared. Yet today it is a profit machine, with some $20 billion in cash on its books. It has paid back more than two-thirds of the funds it received from the government, and for the last three consecutive quarters has reported solid results, including more than doubling its earnings in its June filing, to $2.9 billion. Just as critically, over the past year, GM has leaned into ride sharing, autonomous-driving technology, and electric vehicles at a heady pace. With a flurry of deals and product releases more reminiscent of its tech-industry competitors, GM has, in short order, constructed a portfolio of assets dedicated to disrupting its own core business from within. What if Steve Jobs had been tasked with reviving a post-bankruptcy GM? What playbook would he have adopted? Looking back at Jobs’s return to Apple in 1997, he was faced with a financially strapped and dysfunctional operation. His first priority was to stabilize cash flow so he would have the resources to put toward innovation. This, too, was required at GM, and so far it has been successful. Jobs’s other priority was to make sure he had the right team in place around him and the right culture upon which to build. It wasn’t iPods or iPhones that Jobs obsessed about at that stage. It was the people. Only then could he turn himself to the products in earnest. Barra has her own, similar obsessions. In Detroit a few weeks earlier, I had watched her deliver a far more impassioned—and successful—presentation in yet another dreary auditorium, in the bowels of Tower 300 of GM’s seven-building headquarters complex. This time Barra was speaking to 35 newly promoted mid-level executives, and they eagerly followed every word. "Remember your whole career, how you’ve been talking about them?" Barra said. "If only they would get it. If only they would work this out. Well, you are now they. If you don’t like something, you have to talk to yourself." Chuck Stevens[Photo: Steve Fecht for General Motors] Barra knows that she cannot succeed without turning around GM’s famously stagnant bureaucracy. This is a place, after all, that has long been known for its "GM nod" (agreeing to something in a meeting and then never doing anything about it) and "GM salute" (pinning blame on somebody else). "Look at what came out in the Valukas Report," CFO Chuck Stevens told me, referring to a 2014 internal investigation of the ignition-switch crisis, which delivered a scathing indictment of GM’s management. "No sense of urgency. No accountability or responsibility. A siloed mentality." That kind of culture will never compete with Google and Uber. Barra has launched a slew of initiatives across the company designed to push GM in a new direction—from a program called GM 2020, which builds cross-functional "co-labs" to address all kinds of problems; to a yearlong "transformational leadership" course for senior execs; to a quarterly two-day off-site that Barra personally leads with her 16 top reports, focused not on strategy but on their own interactions. "Mary believes that if we change the behaviors [of top managers], people who work for us will see that and emulate it," says HR chief John Quattrone. "There won’t be this dysfunction that we had before." GM started thinking about the daily experience of the 86% of Americans who commute to work by car. "Lots of people say they love to drive," says Ammann. "But I haven’t met anyone yet who says they love their commute." Back in June, Barra had gone to San Francisco for her first test ride in one of GM’s new Bolt electric cars, which was equipped with the autonomous-driving technology of Cruise Automation, a company GM purchased earlier in the year for $581 million. Barra sat in the back seat with Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt and kept her eyes trained on two things: the busy streets of San Francisco and the technician up front, who was resting his fingertips lightly on the steering wheel, as is required by California regulations. Upstairs, under the broad wood beams of Cruise’s airy office, staff members gathered around a video monitor showing the car, which was marked by a flashing green light that moved around a digital map of the city. If something were to go wrong and the driver needed to grasp the steering wheel and quickly take control, the light would turn red, as it had on previous drives when the Bolt had shifted lanes. The crowd—and those two CEO passengers—was eager for that not to happen this time. The drive was an important moment, symbolically and practically. Barra says GM started down "an evolutionary path" toward re-envisioning the company soon after it emerged from bankruptcy. At that point, under then-CEO Ed Whitacre, GM’s efforts at disruption had a me-too, late-to-the-party mien. GM launched its first hybrid car, the Volt, in 2010, significantly lagging behind hybrid pioneers such as Toyota. Still, Barra says, it was an important first step in acknowledging where the company needed to go. Over the next few years, GM began incorporating aspects of self-driving technology into select models, including software that alerts drivers if they veer out of their lane or stops the car if it detects an imminent collision. Many other car companies were also integrating features like this, but at least GM was in the game. The evolutionary began tilting toward the revolutionary in late 2014. Barra had been appointed CEO earlier that year and pulled together a new group of leaders: former investment banker Dan Ammann, whom she named president; longtime GM exec Mark Reuss, whom she appointed product chief; and CFO Stevens. Together they dug into evolving data about the rise of ride sharing, the ambivalence of urban-dwelling millennials toward car ownership, and the appeal of all-electric vehicles. They looked at the economics: Shared self-driving cars might cut the cost of an average trip in half. And they started thinking about the daily experience of the 86% of Americans who commute to work by car. "Lots of people say they love to drive," says Ammann. "But I haven’t met anyone yet who says they love their commute." All those trends threatened the traditional car-selling business. While none of these factors were yet showing up in GM’s improving bottom line, Barra’s team concluded that without radical change, the road ahead would be rough. So how to turn these looming shifts into an opportunity? From Audi To Zoox, 17 Companies That Are Driving Change In the Car Industry Along with GM, these innovators are finding ways to improve the basics of modern transportation. What Barra was trying to do in that August J.P. Morgan presentation was lay out how quickly, radically, and effectively GM has put in place the plan it started hatching at the end of 2014. Spanning the arenas of connectivity, sharing, alternative propulsion, and autonomous technology, GM now has credible assets in each pillar of the business increasingly referred to as personal mobility. The company has, in short order, constructed a five-part portfolio, which arguably gives it as many or more of the necessary pieces to succeed in the driving world of tomorrow as anyone else: 1. The platform. While most people think of wireless connectivity as the purview of Silicon Valley, when it comes to the auto world, GM’s OnStar service provides both access and data that no other competitor has available. Historically, OnStar has been used by drivers to create an immediate connection to a live operator who can offer directions or help in an emergency. But moving forward, that platform will be applied to providing remote diagnostics, distributing software updates, and tracking data—not to mention managing autonomous fleets. 2. The partner. On January 4, GM announced a $500 million investment in Lyft, the country’s No. 2 ride-share service. The deal gives GM a foothold (it reportedly later passed on buying Lyft outright), allowing it to test, learn, and take advantage if ride sharing takes off even more. Already this year, the companies have worked together on a program called Express Drive, which lets Lyft drivers in seven big cities rent GM cars at heavy discounts, with other collaborations in the works. General Motors’ new car-sharing service, Maven[Photo: John F. Martin/General Motors] 3. The startup. Eleven days after the Lyft investment became public, GM announced that it would launch a proprietary car-sharing service called Maven. A Zipcar-like offering, Maven taps into another possible future of mobility: replacing ownership with sharing. This startup inside GM has some features Zipcar doesn’t—an app that lets you book, open, and start the car; free Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, OnStar, and 4G wireless in every car—and it is already operating in seven cities, with plans to expand significantly next year. At the same time, Maven lays the groundwork for a possible future when GM owns and operates a fleet of its own autonomous cars. It is a testing ground that can pivot as the marketplace does, even providing a backup brand that could be tapped for ride sharing in the event of Lyft’s demise or its outright purchase by a competitor. The Chevrolet Bolt EV[Photo: Steve Fecht for General Motors] 4. The car. Barra believes GM’s new all-electric Bolt, which goes on sale later this year, will be a landmark product. When she and then-CEO Daniel Akerson initiated the Bolt project in 2013, the goal was to develop a fully electric vehicle that would be fun to drive, affordable, and practical, with a range of at least 200 miles (the minimum needed to make it viable for commuters, research shows). At a cost of just $30,000 (after a $7,500 federal tax rebate) and getting 238 miles from a single charge, the new car will far surpass the specs of competing electrics made by competitors such as Ford and Nissan. While the Bolt is similar in price and range to Tesla’s heavily anticipated Model 3, it will be available to consumers much earlier. 5. The technology. GM’s initial approach to autonomous driving was to incrementally add features to existing vehicles, gradually making drivers more comfortable with deferring to a computer. But when Ammann nailed down the acquisition of Cruise in March, it marked an investment into the more radical all-at-once strategy being pursued by the likes of Google and Uber. Launched in 2013, Cruise has built a complex array of software and hardware that uses artificial intelligence to pilot a car. While in-house GM engineers were working on their own fully autonomous system, Ammann and Barra came to believe that Cruise was further ahead—and so they jumped. Cruise CEO Vogt has been obsessed with self-driving cars since childhood, and designed his first autonomous vehicle for a state fair at the age of 13. When Vogt started Cruise, his goal was to sell autonomous-driving kits that could be retrofitted to regular cars. After he pivoted to the bigger idea of operating a fleet of autonomous cars, the shift put him right in line with the future as imagined by Ammann. Now GM and Cruise are working together to implement that vision at a huge scale: millions of customers, mostly young and urban, sharing rides in autonomous Bolt EVs. "[Google and Apple] generate a lot of cash, and have a lot of resources and talent, but neither one has made cars," says Reuss. "A car has to work right every time, all the time." Of course, Cruise’s technology actually has to work, which is why Barra’s test drive that June morning was so significant. Inside Cruise HQ, the mood was confident but tense, with little noise beyond the occasional iPhone ping. As the car navigated a particularly heavy stretch of traffic, it had to make a sudden lane shift. Barra and Vogt watched the driver’s hands; the Cruise staff watched the telemetrics monitor. The driver never grasped the wheel; the light stayed green. After the car piloted itself back into Cruise’s garage, Barra and Vogt bounded into the office, triumphant. Barra stood in front of the assembled crowd. "If somebody [at GM] says you can’t have something, or you can’t do something, or it’s going to take this much time, and it doesn’t make sense to you, challenge them," she told them. "I want to take the energy and speed and how you look at doing things and drive it into the core of GM." If there’s skepticism about GM, it is hardly without foundation. The basic components of autonomous, electric, shared rides are being pursued by many of GM’s competitors. Ford, for one, has announced plans to have a fully self-driving car (with no steering wheel) available by 2021, and is building its own stable of mobility-focused products and services. Uber launched a trial fleet of autonomous cars in September that is already ferrying paying passengers around Pittsburgh. Tesla’s ability to persuade 400,000 people to put down a $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 just from a press conference is eye-opening. But what if we train that same lens of skepticism on the tech world? Suddenly, GM’s aspirations may not look so far-fetched. After years of development of self-driving cars and billions of dollars of investment, Google has little to show for it. And Apple, according to published reports this summer, may be rethinking its approach to making a car. Despite all of Silicon Valley’s astonishing accomplishments, it turns out putting together thousands of pounds of metal and plastic in a way that can safely move human beings at high speeds over great distances is, well, pretty hard to do. "[Google and Apple] generate a lot of cash, and have a lot of resources and talent, but neither one has made cars," says Reuss. "The piece that is not well understood outside of the automotive industry is how hard it is to take technology and integrate it into a car. It seems like you should be able to layer it in and have it work and that would be great. Right. The effort to integrate that into the car is equal to or more than the technology itself. A car has to work right every time, all the time." Then there’s Tesla, which, with its high-profile Model S electric luxury car and the upcoming affordable Model 3, has been at the forefront of transportation’s transformations. But the company lost nearly $600 million in the first half of 2016, and two fatal Model S accidents have raised questions about the viability of its technology. While GM is sitting on some $20 billion in cash, Tesla is deeply in debt and seems likely to need a major infusion in order to achieve even its near-term goals. Despite its outsize reputation, Tesla delivered just 50,580 vehicles in 2015, compared to GM’s output of nearly 10 million. Elon Musk says Tesla will make 500,000 cars in 2018, but so far this year the company has missed its production goals. "Moving from producing tens of thousands of vehicles to hundreds of thousands of vehicles is a very significant challenge," says Mike Ableson, who heads GM’s strategy group. "The Silicon Valley culture of developing fast and iterating fast can be a strength. But if you’re going to put this stuff in production, sooner or later you’ve got to turn it into hardware at high volume. That’s the Detroit side of the discussion." But what if that whole us-versus-them way of looking at it is wrong? Maybe, as the technology improves and consumer trends solidify, GM and the tech world won’t prove to be rivals after all. Perhaps they’re just different pieces of a larger puzzle—a future where Silicon Valley inspiration and Detroit know-how (and vice versa) converge in ways that yield transformative innovations we can’t yet imagine. "I don’t think any one company can do this all by itself, automotive or nonautomotive," says Reuss. "That’s why you see acquisitions and partnerships happening." In other words, GM could still be part of the mobility of the future even if all of this year’s new ventures fall flat. For now, however, Barra isn’t thinking about that. She knows the work she and her team have done so far is just the beginning of a long process with many unforeseeable turns to come, but she’s determined to be first across the finish line. And like Steve Jobs and his renowned reality distortion field, the CEO believes that determination is as important as strategy. "Don’t confuse progress with winning," she said while onstage at GM’s headquarters, discussing the company’s autonomous-car efforts. "It’s not like, ‘Check, check, check, done.’ It’s, ‘Okay, the table is barely set. This is a huge opportunity. So what are we going to do?’ " In her vision of GM’s revved-up culture, Barra told the group, "best efforts" alone aren’t going to cut it. "Are you doing what you can?" she asked. "Or are you doing what it takes to win?" related video: Ford's CEO On The Future Of Connected And Autonomous Cars A version of this article appeared in the November 2016 issue of Fast Company magazine.

Analysts now believe that the newest iteration of Apple’s MacBook Pro line-up will be announced before the end of the month. That report falls in line with prior speculation that Apple plans to release the new model MacBook Pro within weeks. So how close is the release of the new MacBook Pro 2016? The answer may not be all that far away. According to Forbes, the latest report comes from Japanese-language site Macotakara, which has a pretty reliable record when it comes to predicting release dates. Along with most analysts, the site also believes that production has already begun on the new MacBook Pro, which will allow Apple to release the laptop not long after it’s been announced. With that in mind, those looking to pick up a new MacBook Pro could expect to have the laptop in their hands by mid-November or even sooner depending on how early Apple announces the new Pro. Apple looks set to reveal new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops this month: https://t.co/kPnvUFq6Tp pic.twitter.com/ocoabJQPln — T3.com (@T3dotcom) October 18, 2016 The prediction follows a recent prediction from Rhoda Alexander, Director of Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology. The analyst recently confirmed that they’re expecting to see a MacBook Pro refresh later this year, with Apple likely to introduce new versions of both their 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. However, she also went one step further by saying that she expects to see a new 13-inch MacBook Air model too. That being said, most analysts appear to agree that Apple will likely kill off their 11-inch model of the MacBook Air. The smaller form factor device has seen something of a decline in sales over recent years, and with the release of Apple’s streamlined 12-inch MacBook last year, there’s little space left in the MacBook line for an 11-inch Air. In fact, it’s widely predicted that Apple will eventually phase out the entire MacBook Air line of laptops. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0Cm6DEKcdo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: New MacBook Pro 2016 Rumors Round-Up: Release Date, Specs, New Features And Everything We Know So Far New iMac 2016 Update Rumors: Release Date And Specs For Apple’s Latest All-In-One New MacBook Air: What’s Next For Apple’s 13 Inch Laptop? 2017 Model Release Date, Specs And More According to The Verge, Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro refresh might be even more drastic than initially foreshadowed. Apple is said to be ditching traditional USB ports on the new MacBook Pro in favor of USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, similar to the aforementioned 12-inch MacBook. That being said, Apple included one single USB Type-C with that MacBook model, which could cause some concern amongst users of the MacBook Pro. The 12-inch MacBook’s single UBS-C port can be used for sending data, display connectivity and charging the device, removing the need for multiple ports serving different functions. However, Apple’s decision to only include a single port with the 12-inch MacBook means that users have to carry a USB hub whilst on the go. Whilst that might not be all that much of a problem amongst users of the 12-inch MacBook, it could be a problem for users of the MacBook Pro, who often requires quicker and easier access to a range of different ports. Apple’s new MacBook Pro might ditch regular USB ports https://t.co/oH09mBtbWo pic.twitter.com/VhBpGO7gsa — The Verge (@verge) October 18, 2016 Of course, any information we have about the upcoming 2016 model MacBook Pro is purely speculation. It’s impossible to accurately predict what form the new laptop will take until Apple officially announces it. However, the good news for those waiting for that announcement is that they may not have to wait all that long. Apple’s final keynote address of 2016 is almost certainly just around the corner, with the new MacBook Pro expected to take center stage. So will you be picking up a new MacBook Pro before the end of the year?

Use Apple’s virtual alternative which offers similar functionalities. By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Tuesday, October 18, 2016, 15:12 [IST] Apple, in favour of a new solid-state home button, jettisoned its iconic mechanical home button on the new Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Rumours are already abuzz that Apple will eliminate the physical home button for good by integrating it under the glass screen when it launches the next iPhone in 2017. SEE ALSO: Diwali Festival Offers 2016: Best Exchange offers on Hot-Selling Smartphones That being said, it appears as if all is not well with the solid-state home button on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Recently, an image was posted on the MacRumors forum which read "The Home Button May Need Service. In the meantime, you can use the onscreen Home button below." Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals This virtual home button discovered by a layman on the MacRumour forum is not entirely new and has been there with us for a long time now. Known as the Assistive Touch, the virtual button serves the same purpose as the physical home button along with a few shortcuts which include one-tap access to Notification Center, Siri, Control Center, and a few more. SEE ALSO: 5 Best WiFi File Transfer Apps You Should Try Right Now Earlier, the Assistive Touch feature on the iPhone had to be enabled manually. However, with the iOS 10 rolled out, Apple is providing this feature by default whenever there is a Home button malfunction or when it needs service. With that being said, if you want to give the virtual alternative for the home button a try anyway, follow the below instructions. SEE ALSO: Did You Know You Can Play Games on Facebook Messenger? Open Settings > General > Accessibility and scroll down until you find Assistive Touch and enable it. Voila! You can now use it to access Siri, open notifications, take a screenshot, control the volume, and much more just by a few taps. Do make a note that, unlike the physical home button, the virtual alternative doesn't support fingerprint recognition.

With support for HomeKit built into some connected devices, such as Elgato's Eve range and its Eve Room indoor sensor, you can turn any home into a smarthome quickly and easily. You can then manage it from your mobile device using Apple's Home app, as well as control it with your voice through Siri. Your HomeKit-enabled connected devices can be controlled locally via your phone, or remotely via an Apple TV connected to your home Wi-Fi network. You can program time-related commands, such as having your connected lamps turn on or off at specific times each day, for instance and HomeKit also supports non-scheduled events, such as turning on all your connected lamps when a connected motion sensor is triggered. Here's everything you need to know about HomeKit and a number of reasons why, when turning your home smart, it should be at the top of your list. What is HomeKit? Apple's HomeKit technology might seem really confusing, but it's not. It basically allows connected devices from various manufacturers to work together, and it gives you a uniformed way of controlling all those devices at once, in a given scene, using an iPhone, iPad, and even an Apple Watch. HomeKit lets you create "scenes" to control your connected devices in different combinations. You could create a scene called "leaving home" for example, which might turn off your smart lights, lock all your doors, and lower your smart thermostat - all with a single command. Siri can recognise any HomeKit-enabled connected devices you have in your home, so you can ask Siri to turn a device on or off. HomeKit-enabled connected devices are smart accessories with built-in support for Apple's HomeKit technology. They can be lights, locks, thermostats, plugs, switches, sensors, shades, etc. Over 50 brands worldwide make accessories that work with HomeKit, including Elgato Eve. Elgato's Eve range currently consists of Eve Energy (switch and power meter) (Buy: UK, US), Eve Room (wireless indoor sensor), Eve Weather (wireless outdoor sensor), Eve Thermo (thermostatic radiator valve), and Eve Door and Window (wireless contact sensor). Why should you invest in a HomeKit device? Here are five reasons why you should invest in HomeKit-enabled devices: Energy efficiency HomeKit-enabled devices can offer energy efficiency opportunities. The Eve Energy Switch and Power Meter, for instance, lets you instantly see how much energy your devices are using and see their consumption at a glance over a set time. You can view graphs by week, day, or minute historically, with the accompanying Eve app being intelligent enough to forecast what your yearly electricity bill will be given your current usage. No more shock bills. Thanks to Bluetooth Smart, all Eve accessories are energy efficient enough to run on battery power (except for Eve Energy (Buy: UK, US) which obviously uses wall power). Comfort HomeKit-enabled devices are all about streamlining your day-to-day process, making life more automated and thus easier. The idea is you can not only make your home smart, but also make it just the way you like it. The accompanying free Eve app lets you seamlessly connect your devices, gain insights, build scenes, create automations and control your home right from your mobile device and even by voice commands. Portability While some HomeKit devices will involve bridges and installation, not all of them do. The Elgato Eve range for example, uses Bluetooth LE rather than Wi-Fi to connect directly to your phone or Apple TV. That means you don't have to invest in a starter kit or a costly installation, but also that you can easily move the devices around your home or take them with you when you move. If you rent, it also means you don't have to get permission to make your home smart. That's especially handy when it comes to the Eve Thermo, the intelligent radiator thermostats that make individual radiators smart without having to call out a plumber. All Eve devices can be installed in five minutes or less. Simply use the Eve companion app to connect an Eve device to your Home Wi-Fi network, then you can use Apple's Home app in order to control it through Siri, as well as make it communicate and work with other devices. That's it. Siri control One of the cool features about HomeKit is that is has been baked into Siri. Yep, you can simply tell Siri to turn your lights down, unlock your front door, or turn off a device plugged into the Eve Energy (Buy: UK, US), for example. There are a number of commands to give, and as you set up scenes, Siri automatically adapts. "Hey Siri, it's movie night!" Automation Being able to control lights, plugs, and or check room temperatures from your phone is one thing, but where things get really clever is that HomeKit offers an array of automation options if you have an iPad or Apple TV 4 connected to your Wi-Fi network. By doing so, HomeKit allows you to create a number of rules or triggers based on things that are happening in your system. That could be turning on devices when you get within a set distance of your house, or having something happen if a certain accessory is controlled. You can even go as far as automating things based on the time of day, giving you one rule for daytime and another for after hours.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards BMW's new 5 Series does CarPlay without the wires Max Langridge18 October 2016Cars BMW First car to offer wireless Apple CarPlay Controlled via BMW's iDrive system Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment BMW has recently unveiled the new 2017 5 Series saloon and with it, a whole host of technologies to improve the driving experience. Chief among them is the addition of Apple CarPlay, but the 5 Series is the very first car to deliver wireless CarPlay. What is Apple CarPlay and which cars support it? Wireless functionality has been built into Apple's in-car system since iOS 9, but car manufacturers haven't installed it in their cars. To access the features at the moment, you need to plug your iPhone into the car's USB port. With the new 5 Series that will be a thing of the past, as your iPhone connects through BMW's iDrive system and presents the familiar CarPlay interface on the car's 10.25-inch touchscreen display. Everything is controlled via BMW's iDrive Touch Controller, voice commands, gestures and by pressing on the touchscreen itself.

South Africa’s rand has strengthened this year from hovering around R16 to US dollar in January to a level of R13.28 to the greenback in August. “Within the next 72 hours, prices for the apps and in-app purchases (excluding subscriptions) will decrease in South Africa to account for foreign exchange rates,” Apple said in a statement as reported by US website '9to5mac.com' on Monday. The price drop comes after Apple hiked its App Store pricing for SA in January this year amid the sharp weakening of the rand following the firing of former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene. It’s unclear if Apple’s latest move to reverse its App Store price hike will last as political uncertainty has hit the rand again in recent days. Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) announced its decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for fraud. Amid the announcement, the rand sharply weakened to R14.36 to the US dollar last week, but it has made gains again this week to reach closer to the R14 mark.Meanwhile, Apple is further hiking prices for its App Store in New Zealand owing to the introduction of an “interaction of goods and services tax (GST)”.
