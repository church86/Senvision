Updated November 7, 2016 9:24AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple MacBook Pro Enterprise Hardware Intel Touch Bar Macros Computing Steve Jobs GUI macOS The first time I saw and played with the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros, the concept of the macros of the past popped into mind. Like many who read this column who are power users, we all know the value of creating macros and applying them to our apps to speed up a particular business process. What Apple has done through the Touch Bar is basically deliver this kind of functionality, and gives the power of macros to the masses. What Apple has done with the Touch Bar is to give the power of macros to the masses. How many of you remember the role macros played in the early days of the PC? Macros are basically shortcuts to set up an often-used spreadsheet or to add a set of database formats that would be employed for repetitive data input. These were very important during the days when Microsoft's DOS ruled the PC world. Even today, programmers use macros all the time, and power users still create macros for use in various types of apps where they are still supported. However, most users don't even know these shortcuts exists, or if they do, consider them too difficult to find and use. Then Apple introduced the Mac, with its graphical user interface. This, and the next generation of GUIs, made navigating through apps much easier. Also, these GUIs introduced an updated version of cut and paste that, in many ways, allowed a person to do similar things macros did when it came to interjecting what, in binary code, is just mathematical equations used over and over within an app of some type. Another way to look at this is to look back on Apple's influence on UIs in the past. With the Mac, Apple introduced the graphical UI and the mouse. This advanced the user interface of man-to-machine dramatically. With the iPhone and the iPad, the company introduced touch, something that is now mainstream in UIs for smartphones and tablets and even PCs and laptops. But Apple's philosophy on touch does not extend to laptops and iMacs for one key reason. Jobs always believed, right or wrong, that, when your hands were on the keyboard, the best position for input was via a keyboard and mouse. He felt that the motion to take the hand from the keyboard and move it to the screen as part of navigation was unnatural. Although adding a keyboard to the iPad breaks with this view, this is more a function of the iPad's design, and many of us who use iPads with keyboards would love a mouse to use with it. An interesting side note comes with Microsoft's Surface tablet. Most of my friends who use it with a keyboard also carry a mouse, as they don't like using their fingers because the touch input is not as precise as one can get with a mouse. The Touch Bar brings the functions of power-user macros to the general user by demystifying the concept of shortcuts for repetitive tasks, and it adds easy-to-use and fast access to all types of functions within applications that will support it. The Touch Bar is an important evolution of Apple's contribution to user interface design. It brings the functions of power-user macros to the general user by demystifying the concept of shortcuts for repetitive tasks, and it adds easy-to-use and fast access to all types of functions within applications that will support it. This is why the Touch Bar matters. Once people start using it, this will be viewed as a logical next step in UIs for laptops, and we will want this on other Apple laptops and desktops as well. This will be especially true as the software community embraces this new feature and uses Apple's APIs for the Touch Bar in their own applications. At the Apple event, the company showed us the tip of the iceberg for use on its own applications and ones from early partners like Adobe. But Microsoft plans to support the Touch Bar APIs in all of its Mac applications, and by early next year, we should see thousands of macOS apps supporting it. This gives Mac users a new way to speed up navigation and access within apps on a portable computer, and enhances the laptop experience significantly. As for the new MacBook Pro's design, I believe it will be a big hit for Apple's high-end customers, and the entry product, which still has the older function keys, will be targeted as a replacement for the MacBook Air, especially in the enterprise . I have played with this model for about four days now and can see this as a great replacement for the Air. I am concerned with the new MacBook Pros pricing, but to be fair, if this meets the needs of their pro customers, it will still sell well. However, if Apple's new Touch Bar is the next evolution of Apple's contribution to mobile user interface design, I suspect the Touch Bar will eventually be on all laptops Apple brings to market over time, and if history is our guide, the prices of these MacBook Pros will also go down in next-generation models. I realize there will be naysayers who will be skeptical about the role the Touch Bar plays in the future. But if there is one thing I have learned over the 35 years of covering Apple, it is that when Cupertino puts a lot of thought and detail into user interfaces, it is best to take note. That is why I believe the Touch Bar not only matters, but that it and the special chip Apple uses to power it will have more of an industry impact than most can see right now. © 2016 Re/Code syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

At this point from announcement, the delay has raised concerns and requests for pre-order cancellations — and thus, Apple gets to be educated on how diminishing returns actually come about. One retail worker claimed that his store was expecting a shipment of AirPods late next week. Barclays researchers claim that it is far from the case. They note that factories won’t begin churning them out until December — late into the holiday retail rat race and certainly out of range for the typical shopping binge period of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The first lot is estimated to range between 10 million and 15 million units. That could leave Apple catching up to demand as it has been with its iPhone 7 Plus models this year. In fact, channel inventory has proved difficult for Apple to manage — if not procure — for the past year as the company has tried to pull batch discounts and manufacturer competition to its favor in getting a good price on its components and assembly. Its failure to keep product flowing has left customers waiting for their products week after week — shipping wait times on the iPhone 7 Plus are still at three to four weeks at this stage. But who knows if exclusivity and prestige may keep Infinite Loop in consumers’ favor. And we’ll have to see if what information the investment firm has is good info.

Contacts Economy Arts&Culture Electronics Science Sport Worldwide Medicine Local Science Apple hikes Mac prices in response to pound's decline in value Israel Wilson Nov 12, 2016      It will let users change the settings like screen brightness, speaker volume sans a separate cable or buttons on the monitor, owing to Thunderbolt 3. Users are no longer required to use their Apple Watch to unlock their MacBook Pro. The same could not be said for the new iMac desktop however, and because of that somewhat surprising absence, it has suddenly become more hard to predict a possible arrival date for this particular product. MacBook Pro and Surface Studio both have spectacular and unique features and specifications and it will be hard to decide which is greater and worth buying. It will also provide support for adding emoji's easily. They have also done away with all the traditional USB ports in favor of the new USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, and they have also killed off the SD card reader, which is actually quite a pity, and also the glowing Apple logo. Bob O'Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research LLC, said before the Mac announcement that the market believes focus on the iPhone means Apple has "almost given up on Macs", which has led to losing market share to other personal computers. They will be available later in November, starting at C$2,299 (13 inch) and $2,999 (15 inch). Gone are the familiar function keys, replaced by Touch Bar, which you can customise according to Apple's breaking news. The 2016 MacBook Pro has a 6th-generation Intel Core i5 processor. Apple announced three new models in the Macbook Pro range yesterday and there are some interesting features seen on the newly announced devices. Even if loads of people have a Touch Bar-enabled Macbook, the firm says that developers should steer clear of duplicating functionality already available as a keyboard shortcut (e.g. copy, paste, page up, page down). According to Engadget, the iPad Air's future doesn't seem promising, especially now that the Apple has a new line of tablets, the iPad Pro. Both the Macs will come with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and any of them can be plugged in as Power, Thunderbolt, USB, HDMI and much more. The touch bar will adapt to the program now being used, provided it supports this feature. In the performance segment, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro will feature a quad-core Core i7 processor, AMD Radeon Pro graphics with up to 4GB of video memory, and up to 16 GB of RAM. A second-generation Touch ID sensor covered with a sapphire crystal has been included to the right of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro. The new MacBook, which has three models, also gets support for Touch ID as well as Force Touch technology, among other goodies. 12 November 2016 Clinton tells supporters to greet Trump with 'open mind' 12 November 2016 Parrikar's opinion on nuclear doctrine stirs political debate 12 November 2016 Jrue Holiday to return to Pelicans 12 November 2016 Jose Mourinho could face another FA charge after Burnley incident 12 November 2016 Bucks serve as gracious hosts, fall to Pelicans (AUDIO) 12 November 2016 Blac Chyna Does The Mannequin Challenge Hours After Giving Birth 12 November 2016 Give Trump a chance to lead: Clinton 12 November 2016 Wayne Rooney return to Everton would please Ronald Koeman 12 November 2016 President Obama Delivers Remarks On Trump Victory, Clinton Loss 12 November 2016 Blue Jays reportedly sign free agent Morales 12 November 2016 How NRIs can change their rupees 12 November 2016 Halya Coynash: Make Russia's open interference a Pyrrhic Putin - Trump victory Most Read Most Commented Melania Trump, Michelle Obama tete-a-tete over tea at White House The president-elect said he is very much "looking forward" to his predecessor's counsel when he takes office.

Apple Black Friday sales are expected to be strong especially at Target, Best Buy and Walmart as these stores will offer the lowest prices for iPhones, IPad and MacBooks. Here are some of the discounts from Target, Best Buy, and Walmart on Black Friday. Buy if you're in the market on Black Friday for an Apple iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus then wait no longer. iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. The Apple Black Friday Deals at this store will also reduce the price of iPad Air 2 models by $125. Originally unveiled in Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the display uses four-channel ambient light sensors to detect the light signature of the room before adjusting screen brightness accordingly. Apple will launch a trio of new iPad Pro models in March, including refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions and an all-new bezel-free 10.9-inch model, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang, citing sources within the company's Asian supply chain. Prices for these times while the Apple Black Friday Deals is in effect will range from $900 to $1,599.99. Good thing that this 9.7-inch model will be $150 less during the Black Friday. This is more than Best Buy and Target are taking off the regular iPad Pro price. The iPhone 8 series would be the same size as the existing models - but thanks to the bezel-less design, the phones could feature larger displays. In what's become something of a tradition, many retailers have started publishing their Black Friday deals weeks in advance, presumably so that shoppers can take stock of what's available and plan accordingly. 12 November 2016 Enjoy the Iron Man Experience in Hong Kong Disneyland 12 November 2016 Can Electors Make Hillary Clinton President On Dec. 19? 12 November 2016 AT&T Debuts 'Stream Saver', Will Downgrade Video Quality 12 November 2016 Chargers stadium vote fails, opens door for move to Los Angeles Russia Says It Was In Touch With Trump Campaign During The Election 12 November 2016 Bella Hadid & The Weeknd Have Reportedly Split JK Rowling hopes Potter fans embrace 'Fantastic Beasts' movie 12 November 2016 Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh to face tax, 200% penalty on mismatch 12 November 2016 India, Japan should march forward to explore bigger potentials: Modi Trump, Clinton split early votes in tiny New Hampshire towns 12 November 2016 Well-preserved bird-like dinosaur discovered in China 12 November 2016 Kohl's tops earnings forecasts on lower costs Most Read Most Commented Michigan, Flint Ordered To Make Home Water Deliveries State lawyers were reviewing Mr Lawson's order, said Anna Heaton, spokeswoman for Governor Rick Snyder.

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE iPad Mini 5 release date, news: Will it be launched under the iPad Pro line? Jessica Ferrera 10 November, 2016 11:06 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Robert Galbraith)Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, Phil Schiller, presents iPad line back in 2014 at Cupertino, California. Apple has not spared any detail whether or not the iPad Mini 5 will still be a thing in future. However, there are speculations that suggest iPad Mini 5 could be launched under the iPad Pro line as the iPad Pro Mini. According to PC Advisor, there is a possibility that the iPad Mini 5 (or iPad Mini Pro) could be revealed in March 2017 along with the iPad Pro 2 refresh. It can be remembered that in the recent MacBook Pro 2016 reveal, Apple has capitalized mainly on the Pro line while not launching anything major for the line of MacBook Air. The same report weighed in on the possibilities whether the iPad Mini 5 will turn out to be a new addition to the Pro line. It said that a 7.9-inch tablet could be a little bit too small to effectively enjoy the productivity-focused features of the upcoming tablet. Regardless if it will be iPad Mini 5 or iPad Pro Mini, there have already been several rumors about its specifications. For starters, it is highly possible that the upcoming 7.9-inch tablet will be released with the newest iOS 10 just like the iPhone 7 did last September. One of the most anticipated features for the 7.9-inch tablet refresh is the inclusion of 3D Touch, a technology developed by Apple that enables its screen to determine different pressure levels of touch and attribute them to specific functions. Just like what Apple did with iPhone 7, it is highly possible that the next iPad Mini will ditch the 16 GB standard model and start with a bigger built-in storage of 32 GB. And being under the same category with iPhone 7 as Apple's main mobile device product, it is highly possible that the iPad Mini refresh will experience the same major tweak that takes away the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from the design. Despite these specific speculations, Apple has not yet given any clue about its plans for any iPad product. So, it's best to take all these with a pinch of salt.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Cupertino tech giant Apple recently held an event where they introduced their latest MacBooks and iMacs, but unfortunately, there was no mention of the highly-awaited iPad Pro 2 that was rumoured to be launched at the same event. Because of this, recent speculations suggest that the new Apple tablet might be launched in early 2017 instead. Apple recently unveiled their latest MacBook Pro at their recent event, and the newest entry in Apple's line of powerful laptops had innovative features — including a new OLED touch panel — that has left many Apple fans in awe. However, fans who were aiming to get information regarding the iPad Pro 2 were left disappointed as the device was not mentioned at the event. Recent speculations suggest that the delay of the iPad Pro 2's launch was due to hardware manufacturing issues since Apple plans to create a powerful successor to the iPad Pro. Unfortunately, the right hardware for the device is still unavailable. Furthermore, recent speculations suggest that the tech giant will be releasing three variants of the iPad Pro 2 in 2017. Apple will be launching a new 9.7-inch base model, a medium sized 10.5-inch model, and a large 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2. Rumors also suggest that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 and it's larger 12.9-inch variant will have a powerful A10X processor, while its smaller 9.7-inch variant will have a less powerful A9X processor. It is also speculated that because of Apple's choice of processors, the iPad Pro 2 launch will be delayed until 2017 since chip manufacturers still haven't moved down to 10nm. As of now there is still no official news as to what the iPad Pro 2's features, specs, and hardware will be. There's also no official news about the Apple tablet's official release. However, rumors highly suggest that the Apple tablet will be launched in the first quarter of 2017.

Tags : Apple-Apple+ Apple has published its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide, a focused view of its own products that the company strongly recommends, and while there are no deals or price cuts here, fans of the Apple brand will find it worth taking a quick look at the lineup. After all, an endorsement of a product in the Holiday Gift guide is a strong statement for tight-lipped Apple and it suggests that the products mentioned are of truly outstanding quality and value. Of course, you have the staple products front and center: Apple's Holiday Gift guide shows that some of the best Holiday gifts would be an iPhone 7, a new Apple Watch, the iPad Pro, Macbook, and Apple TV, but along them comes an interesting selection of accessories, as well as separate sections with gifts for music enthusiasts, photography lovers, and games and toys. The cute BB-8 droid is one neat gift ideaThere is a particularly curious selection of products not made by Apple that still made it into the 2016 Holiday Gift guide: the neat Roli Blocks music making solution with its colorful interface and novel way of making beats, as well as the Sonos:Play1 wireless speakers with great quality are prominently featured in the music section. For photography enthusiasts, Apple recommends the extremely tiny and foldable DJI Mavic Pro drone that also features fast speed, as well as some neat following features, as well as the DJI Osmo Mobile gimbal that is great at stablizing your iPhone videos. If you shoot video in the dark, Apple recommends the Manfrotto Lumimuse 3 LED lights system, while vloggers will probably appreciate Apple's recommendation for the Manfrotto Twistgrip universal smartphone mount accessory. Our favorite section, however, is the toys and games, where you find recommendations for the cool Ubtech Jimu Robot Meebot Kit, as well as the cute Anki Cozmo Robot with Power Cubes.  You can find out more cool ideas for Holiday gifts in Apple's 2016 guide right below: 2016 Holiday Gift guide:  Devices | Music | Photography | Toys and Games 2016 Apple Holiday Gift Guide Popular galleries Sprint has Verizon executives sweating and trembling with fear according to its new ads The upcoming OnePlus 3T: 5 expected new features that will set it apart from the regular OnePlus 3 Best smartphones you can buy right now: (October-November 2016) Xiaomi Mi MIX official: 6.4-inch ceramic monster with high-end specs and a 91.3% screen-to-body ratio LG V20 review: 10 key takeaways iPhone 7 catches fire, burns a car Time to look for alternatives: get the Galaxy Note 7's features on the Note 5 with these tips!

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE iPhone 8 release date, news, specs rumors: Curved screen, wireless charging and all other premium features expected Catherine Salvador 11 November, 2016 11:29 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. iPhone 7 has just been released but Apple enthusiasts are already looking forward to the upcoming flagship phone, the iPhone 8. It has been rumored that Apple is preparing something grand for the upcoming handset as it will be launched in celebration with the 10th anniversary of the initial iPhone model. There are rumors stating that Apple will ditch the iPhone number labels and just release the upcoming flagship as iPhone Pro or The iPhone. However, for the sake of avoiding confusion, enthusiasts continue to call it iPhone 8. In an article by The Wall Street Journal, the Cupertino-based tech giant is planning a grand 2017 with major changes. These changes may possibly be the long-standing rumor about the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen and the ditching of the home button by creating a fingerprint sensor. One of Apple's China-based engineers were previously asked why the current model has no major design change and one of them revealed that a "new technology" is on the way and will take some time to be released. Furthermore, iPhone 8 is expected to have a curved screen, which is not seen in the current model as the device is not yet ready to be applied with such technology. In an article by PC Advisor, iPhone 8 will be able to get charged without having to be connected through a wire. However, this has yet to be confirmed. As for the release date, it is still early to speculate. However, enthusiasts believe that 2017 is the year of iPhone 8. Three models may come out, according to Nikkei. These are the 4.7-inch model, 5.5-inch model and the "Pro" model with a 5.5-inch curved screen. Also, since Apple has a release pattern of launching handsets and if assumed to be unchanged, iPhone 7s may also be released in 2017, after the iPhone 7's launch date. Apple apparently has to plan something grand to celebrate the event so an "S" model is highly possible.

Rumor has it that the iPad Mini 5 will be released in March next year. After it was thought that Apple would release the latest iPad Mini at its event late last month, the latest in the rumor mill is that the Cupertino-based company will release the mini tablet in March next year. Although, some people already expected that the Apple event last Oct. 27 would serve as a venue for the launch of the MacBook Pro 2016, there were some hoping that the iPad Mini 5 would share the spotlight with the released device in the same event. However, the event commenced and concluded sans even the mere mention of the iPad Mini 5. According to reports, the mini tablet will break the tradition of getting released between the months of October and November. While Apple has yet to release an official statement, the latest buzz online is that the company will release the iPad Mini 5 this March 2017. Apart from the rumors claiming that the iPad Mini 5 will come out in March next year, it is also alleged that the upcoming device will come with specs and features similar to those in the iPad Pro 2. As Apple is expected to be ready with its iOS 11 next year, it is also suspected that the iPad Mini will be one of the first Apple devices to come with the said operating system. Because Apple has already gotten rid of the 3.5-mm headphone jack beginning with its iPhone 7, it is, likewise, alleged that the company will introduce such a change to its upcoming devices, including the iPad Mini 5. If this turns out to be true, the iPad Mini will come with a USB Type-C port, too. However, it is also rumored that the upcoming iPad Mini 5 will be the last for Apple's mini iPad line as, allegedly, the technology brand will replace its current nomenclature with something else and categorize it under its iPad Pro line. Without any official word from Apple at this point in time, though, everything said about the iPad Mini 5 — good or bad — must be taken with a grain of salt.

The company may be planning on releasing a trio of new iPads in March, including one device with a bezel-free 10.9-inch design. According to reports, the bezel-less design will allow the device to have the same physical size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, while offering a larger display. That could also signal the removal of the Home button and an edge-to-edge design on the device. The news comes from a research note obtained by MacRumors from Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang. More: Great deal! Apple slashes the price of refurbished iPads This isn’t the first time we’ve heard news that Apple was developing an iPad in the 10-inch size range, however we haven’t really heard what the exact screen size would be until now. On top of the new bezel-less iPad, analysts also expect Apple to release a new 9.7-inch low-cost iPad Pro, which will be sold alongside the iPad Mini. Analysts don’t expect the iPad Mini to get an update — instead, Apple will continue selling the iPad Mini 4, which was released by Apple in September 2015. It’s also said that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will receive its own update. Some expect the device to get a True Tone display, like the smaller 9.7-inch device. That display uses a series of ambient light sensors to change the color of the display depending on the color and intensity of the light that is surrounding the iPad, ensuring that it always appears to look natural. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also apparently get the 12MP rear-facing camera from the 9.7-inch device. All three of the new iPad models will reportedly get quad microphones, and will keep the headphone jack, unlike the new iPhone 7.

In the memo, Cook urges employees to reach out to colleagues “if they are feeling anxious” about the election results and underscored that Apple celebrates the diversity of its employees regardless of “what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” Earlier this year, in the middle of the Apple-FBI fight, Trump suggested that customers boycott Apple products because they’re produced overseas and due to Apple’s tough stance on user security and encryption. Here’s Cook’s memo to troops in full: Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world —regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward —together! Best, Tim Due to Trump’s comments on minorities, women and immigrants, Apple is said to have withheld money and support from the Republican National Convention. What did you think of Cook’s message?

President Elect Trump will be president and just give the guy a chance. burge So you didn’t read what was put then. Nothing was said about not giving him a chance this post was all about Tim Cook and what he has said to Apple employees. Rowan09 I know, but I’m making the statement for anyone protesting for a useless cause. People are taking the relevance out of protesting now-a-days. Plus the underlying tone is all about President Elect Donald Trump. burge You was the 2nd to post so at that point no one had said anything at all about their opinions of Donald Trump. And this thread is not about people’s opinions of Donald Trump it’s about Tim Cook’s email to employees of Apple. Bugs Bunnay Lol rowan is just taking it one step ahead because eventually someone will say it Rowan09 Exactly and I’m just upset people protesting and even going as far to say they hope he’s assassinated. burge But no one was protesting when you posted, you jumped the gun and started it yourself. Rowan09 You have to read between the lines. Do you think Tim Cook would have sent this same email if Hillary Clinton won? The media needs to stop this nonsense they are creating chaos. I was watching the news and now they say ISIS is celebrating President Elect Trump’s victory. I mean someone called them to confirm they are happy. Come on man this guy is going to be the president so people need to deal with it, he won fair and square. burge And as we can see the point of the post has gone out of the window and it’s moved on to others opinions of what has happened. The point of post has been sidelined. Rowan09 No this all “unity” call is nothing than what’s going on right now. It’s definitely about President Elect Trump winning. burge But the thread is not about who won what it’s about Tim Cook’s email to Apple employees. The subject matter of that email has become the hot topic and that’s not what this thread is about. It should be about what Tim Cook has said not what Donald Trump has said or done. ( read above) Rowan09 I understand but here’s the issue. This email was sent after President Elect Trump’s victory, so it’s easy to put things together and assume he would not have sent this email if Hillary won. burge sorry to say but you can not say that, how do you know what someone else would or would not do. Yes the email “might” of been different but you can not say Tim Cook wouldn’t of sent an email. Rowan09 I’m speaking of sending an email of “unity”. He supported Hillary Clinton. burge Sorry I’m responding to your first comment. The one where you say “Stop the protesting for a useless cause. President Elect Trump will be president and just give the guy a chance.” No one was protesting anything at the time. You started it with that comment thinking it was about making a protest because of what has happen. There was no protest. You have taken your own view on this and applied that view when nothing was about protesting about Donald Trump been elected. The thread is as about an email and what was said in that email. No one was protesting in the email and nothing was said about protesting because of what’s happened. So now I have to ask did you actually read what was said and actually understood what was said in both this thread and the email that Tim Cook sent ? No one made any protest in this article or the email that Tim Cook sent. And yet your first reply was to say “stop protesting” Who protested ? Because I still don’t know. Rowan09 I made that statement because of what was going on in the news and on the streets. It can be easily implied that Tim Cook is writing to Apple employees to calm them from the protests and issues surrounding the new President Elect, hence me making that statement. burge So your first comment in reply to the post but just to say give him ( Donald Trump ) a chance. So infact your reply was not a comment in reply to the post but a reply to as you say it what s now going on in the streets/news. So on that did you notice that no one had made any protest in the article written about ? Your reply has nothing todo with the article. Your telling people to calm down but no one was getting in to end sort of rage. Don’t forget that this site is not just for the USA. I’m in the UK and your reply had no merit whatsoever to do with the article written above. Chris I think it speaks wonders about the type of culture you want to have for your employees, I share this same culture at my workplace and it does wonders when you have such a diverse group of people with various different opinions. Mark S Yeah Tim, we’ll I’ve had “strong feelings” about the last 8 years of a horrible administration gutting this country of morals and values and claiming tolerance and diversity only when it suits them. YaBoyLilMayo And what about all the damage bush did that Obama fixed? Ur delusional Bugs Bunnay Problem, reaction, solution. Obama is in on it. This game is now totally flipped around because trump isn’t part of the establishment. Rowan09 I’m a democrat didn’t vote for him only because of his stance on sending law abiding illegal immigrants back and stop and frisk in NY. I think law abiding illegal immigrants should be fined and helped towards citizenship, but illegal criminals should be sent back home. I’m not mad Hillary Clinton lost because I didn’t agree with any of her views, just couldn’t vote Trump for those 2 reasons I stated above. President Obama is a part of why Hillary Clinton lost as well because you thought he was more love than he really was. Bugs Bunnay It’s been stated multiple times in his rallies that illegal criminals are his targets and not the peaceful, freedom loving illegals. They kill someone, get kicked out and they come right back in. Guess what, if it’s your daughter that got raped and murdered this time by that criminal illegal then you got no one else to blame, but yourself. Hillary on the other hand wants to make them all a citizen without background checks, without checking what people coming in might have like, tuberculosis, etc. This is serious and people need to wake up. PhoneTechJay Obama was just picking the lesser of two evils, same as everyone else. No one really wanted Hillary but she was the only choice we had other than Donald.. Rowan09 He wasn’t , he was just supporting his party line. American politics is very interesting. I’m natively from Jamaica and it’s totally different. PNP and JLP don’t hang out with each other, like democrats and republicans. PhoneTechJay That is still the same thing with different words, there was no-one else to chose from. Had Bernie of gotten to the same point he would’ve done it as well.. Rowan09 President Obama didn’t care who it was as long as it was a democrat. PhoneTechJay That is what I am saying, My own tidbit was that she was the lesser of the two evils. Both reasons are true. Rowan09 I understand, but I don’t think that’s necessarily true. Hillary Clinton didn’t say anything I agree with, but Donald Trump did say some things I agreed with. PhoneTechJay They both have things I agreed with, but I’m crazy and shouldn’t be president, neither should either of them.. Rowan09 Lol. Bernie should have been the guy. Bugs Bunnay it’s a shame where people get their “info” from. *cough mainstream media aka controlled media* It’s time to drain the swamp! Rowan09 Exactly n0ahcruz3 I find it funny when people said they’re moving to other countries Rowan09 They are not moving anywhere. This is the land of capitalism where those same people are filthy rich. Most of those people do nothing for society, but yet complaining. Those with the power to do something mostly do nothing and those with the power to do little, do the most work. M_thoroughbred The thing that we have to remember is that we the people are the power. We need to realise that this government works for us not the other way around. When The People are divided they are easier to govern. Rowan09 Been saying that for years, we are the government and hire governing officials to represent us. Rowan09 Ok. Can you please tell me how disagreeing with your way of life is always deemed homophobic? I understand if someone says bring harm to people with different views, but simply having a different view is deemed homophobic. If I believe someone that tells lies is wrong am I some “lierphobic”. We need to respect our differences and difference in opinions. I can’t even have a conversion without someone being offended anymore. President Elect Donald Trump wants to fix immigration like every other president and he is a republican so they are all for traditional marriage. There is nothing to be scared about because the system will always keep the system going. The Supreme Court who is suppose to interpret law passed a law for making gay “marriage” legal and that’s not their job. No need to worry, this is bigger than one person. dudeimmexican I’m latino and my girlfriend is black, we aint fearing anything and there’s plenty of others who the categorized list who aren’t afraid. Too much bs Bugs Bunnay You know what I’m proud idb did not bash trump with their articles. You go on over to the verge and you see articles upon articles of cry babies. What’s worse is they’ve disabled the comments section. Thumbs up for you guys. Rowan09 I agree I’m having a discussion and they didn’t block my comments, even though I didn’t see any reason they should. Bugs Bunnay XD Anonon Amous I certainly understand why Cook sent this memo to all his employees. Just read the replies here. Some people joyously ridiculing others. Where is the compassion? That’s the whole point. What Cook is saying is everyone should be helping each other, not ridiculing them or calling them names. I suspect anyone at Apple who feels emboldened to pick on anyone for any reason will soon find themselves looking for work elsewhere.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines KGI details three new iPhones coming in 2017, including 5.5″ OLED model with dual cameras Twitter unveils expanded Mute filter and a more direct way to report hateful conduct SSD in the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar can’t be upgraded A quick look at upcoming “TV” app on Apple TV Super Mario Run is coming to iPhone and iPad on December 15   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 The tweet was almost a warning to Silicon Valley. And, now that Trump is going to be the next president, the whole of the IT industry is very cautious, including the Indian IT sector. Apple is one company that has faced Trump's ire many times. After Trump won the election, CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to the team in which he talked about diversity, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. Team, I've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: "If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward." This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. On the other hand, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's message was focused on securing the future for the next generation by tackling disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity. As it happens, Peter Theil who is on the Facebook board has been a staunch Trump supporter and has even funded his campaign. He is even rumored to be chairing Trump's transition committee. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Facebook news feed played a part in Trump's win even though Zuckerberg is downplaying it. Google's Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a robust post that emphasized the role of immigrants in the US and exhorted support for the Muslim community. It also appealed to the people to not be dictated by fear. One part of the post said: My experience is obviously not unique. It's been said a million times that America is the "land of opportunity" — for millions of immigrants, it's not an abstract notion, but a concrete description of what we find here. America provided access to opportunities that simply didn't exist for many of us before we arrived. And it's not just about opportunity. The open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance of new Americans is one of the country's greatest strengths and most defining characteristics. And that is no coincidence — America, after all, was and is a country of immigrants. Let's not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world. Another Indian-born CEO, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, said,"Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future." Some of the other Silicon Valley figures did not hold back, though. I am not moving to Canada, not surprised by white supremacists & misogynists, and not afraid of Donald Trump. We have got to get to work. — Anil Dash (@anildash) November 9, 2016 Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 We are one country, and we have one goal: provide for the common good. We must question anything that gets in the way of that. — 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 10, 2016 Back home, the general mood among Indian IT leaders was more openly positive than their US counterparts. "On the campaign trail, statements are not based on calculated assessments, on what is possible or what the impact will be. You could say you will eliminate H-1B visas, build a wall. But practically, you have to see what you can do to boost the economy, create jobs," NASSCOM's president R Chandrashekhar told the Economic Times. "I personally welcome Donald Trump as the president of USA. He is the voice of the people. He is a creator vs professional politician. Second, during Republicans, India was given access to elite nuclear club when George Bush was president. My take is that economic, social and defense-related ties between India and USA will increase during Mr Trump's tenure. Also, he is just straight forward human being with all emotions ranging from love to anger vs. a seasoned professional politician with controlled temperament," Mr Sandeep Aggarwal, Founder, ShopClues & Droom said in a statement. The IT industry sounds cautious in the wake of Trump's victory, as what it fears most, just like any other business, is uncertainty.

These apps look legitimate and even use legitimate payment systems to empty your e-wallet. As BrandingBrand.com (BB) stated, “Apple we have a problem.” To Apple’s credit, it is removing fake apps as fast the New York Times and Post expose them, but it is reacting, not proacting as these apps don’t contain malware or other nasties – they just take your money and never deliver the goods. Why is Apple being targeted? iPhone users are easy marks for premium goods and Apple's vetting is not as good as it could be. BB says there has been a surge of fake apps parading around as real retailers and ruining the reputation that brands have established. Even worse, some developers are using Apple Search Ads to promote the dodgy shopping apps. According to Branding Brand Index (BBI), 2 in 3 retailers don’t have an iOS or Android app, leaving plenty of opportunities for others to represent them in the app stores. Fake apps have included hundreds of brands such as New Balance, Nike, Pandora, UGG, Coach, Converse, Louis Vuitton, and many others. Most of these have come from China. Where Google Play has tightened up, and the occurrence of “spammy” apps has reduced, these apps have simply moved to iOS. iOS allows adware that pops up unwanted advertisements and Apple cannot stop that either as it is key to the whole advertising eco-system. In the case of brands that do have shopping apps, the fake apps are made to mimic the real one — and sport voluminous merchandise pages, selector wheels for size and colour, and sophisticated checkout forms that can themselves spot fake addresses and credit-card data. Thousands to tens of thousands of unsuspecting shoppers have downloaded fake apps and unwittingly sent the cyber criminals their details and payment thinking they are making a real purchase. According to the New York Post Apple was approached for comment and the usually very helpful – not – officials would not comment. However, Apple did comment to the New York Times a few days ago. Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr stated, “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously. We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. But despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. BB CEO said Chris Mason, said, “This is the first year we’re seeing this kind of proliferation with Apple, and the brands are losing the game of Whack-a-Mole. It is vital that brands monitor how their brand is being used.”       HOW TO OFFER 4G TO YOUR CUSTOMERS Download an information pack to learn more about how you can offer competitive 4G plans to your customers. > everything you need to operate your own 4G telco > support for you and your customers > billing, back-end and full compliance.

Now, it seems like Apple is following suit — at least a little. The company has quietly launched a support app on the App Store. The app represents a slightly less hands-on approach from Apple, which has traditionally offered more personal support through avenues like the Apple Store. Clearly, the goal here is to help people quickly and easily without them having to come into the Apple Store every time something goes wrong. More: Apple seemingly getting some 2016 MacBook Pro orders ready for shipment The app basically includes help articles for popular topics, and it actually doesn’t stop at the iPhone — users can get help with their Macs and other Apple devices too. When you open the app up, you’ll see a list of devices registered to your Apple account, with help articles for each of them. Thankfully, the app doesn’t stop there — it also offers a live chat feature, so if you can’t find the help you need from the articles, you can get more personal help from an Apple support representative. Not only that, but if you can’t find what you need through the chat feature, you can then call a support agent. Last but not least, if all else fails, you can schedule an appointment at the nearest Apple Store. It seems as though the app is currently only being offered in English, but it’s available in a number of countries around the world, and it is likely we’ll see it open up to more languages in the future. It’s also likely we’ll see the app pre-loaded on future versions of the iPhone. You can get the app for yourself here.

In fact, the new MacBook Pro is outselling a number of competitive notebooks on the market, including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook, according to Slice Intelligence. The data is most impressive because it’s based on just five days of sales for the 2016 MacBook Pro. In that brief span, the MacBook Pro generated 78 percent of the revenues that the diminutive MacBook has generated since its introduction on April 10, 2015. Generally speaking, the new MacBook Pro has already generated more revenue than any other notebook in 2016. More: How Intel’s Ultrabook initiative challenged the MacBook Air — and won Compared to the competition, the 2016 MacBook Pro has generated more revenue in its first five days than a number of competitive machines have since they were introduced. This includes Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Asus Chromebook Flip, Dell’s Inspiron 2-in-1, and the Lenovo Yoga 900. Slice Intelligence These results are particularly important for Apple’s long-term success, as Slice Intelligence points out. In the two years since the previous MacBook Pro refresh in 2014, fully 40 percent of Apple’s notebook customers moved on to other vendors. Dell and Asus were the biggest beneficiaries, with each gaining roughly 7 percent of Apple’s customers. Slice Intelligence While seeming like very good news for Apple, it’s entirely possible that these significant sales gains represent pent-up demand for new MacBook Pro hardware. The Windows 10 notebook ecosystem hasn’t been standing still, and time will tell if Apple can maintain these sales levels against excellent alternatives like Dell’s popular XPS 13 and the new thin and light — and more affordable — 2-in-1 convertible machines from HP, Lenovo, and others. Slice Intelligence gathers its data from 4.4 million online shoppers, so it doesn’t track all sales from every channel. Therefore, there’s room for interpretation of this data, although a general conclusion has to be that, at least initially, Apple is enjoying some renewed vigor when it comes to selling MacOS hardware. If the MacBook Pro is still selling at these levels in six months or so, then we can mark this as a tremendous success. Otherwise, it’s possible that Apple’s perceived lack of innovation could end up costing it even more customers as the market continues to move forward around it.

We share with you how the new tech will work. In the picture is the popular iPhone 6.  ( Kārlis Dambrāns | Flickr ) Advertisement Apple is anticipated to unleash its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone — dubbed the iPhone 8 — in the second half of 2017. Rumors related to the smartphone have been emerging online and the latest buzz pertains to the alleged wireless charging technology the handset will support. According to a new report, Apple is eyeing the implementation of a new module into the next-gen iPhone. "The company is supposedly looking to implement some sort of module into the iPhone 8 that will connect to a transmitter that gets plugged into a wall outlet. This setup will then allow the iPhone 8 to charge as long as it's within 15 feet of the transmitter, and if this turns out to be true, it could easily be the best method of wireless charging that we've seen yet," reports PhoneArena. Apple is reportedly working in tandem with Energous for the new technology. Energous has affirmed in the past that was collaborating with a "tier 1 manufacturer" in the smartphone space, and experts assumed the company to be Apple. In January this year, we brought to light that the wireless charging technology Apple was preparing was far superior than the traditional charging mats available. Rumors suggested that the company was working with its partners in Asia and the United States to make the wireless tech a reality in 2017. Earlier in February, we reported that Apple was possibly partnering with Energous, the company behind WattUp, an upcoming wireless charging tech that deploys radio frequencies. This tech could potentially enable people to charge their devices even when they would be several feet away from the charging point. In October we shared that Apple was testing the wireless technology  at Foxconn. Now the grapevine reveals that Energous has supposedly received $10 million in funding from Dialog Semiconductor, whose top customer is none other than Apple, accounting for almost 70 percent of the latter's sales. How Will The Tech Work? The WattUp system basically uses a Power Router, which uses radio frequency signals to emanate energy. This signal is transformed into power, which is able to charge batteries that have a WattUp receiver, the possible chip in the iPhone. You simply have a designated charging point or base station and put the iPhone anywhere within a perimeter of 15 feet. A small chip on the iPhone would connect wirelessly to the base station and begin to charge the device's battery. How Will It Be Useful? If such a tech saw the light of day, then one could possibly be in the kitchen and still charge their iPhone from the charging point located in the living area, which was a maximum of 15 feet away. Moreover, one would potentially be able to charge multiple compatible iDevices simultaneously — up to 12 thanks to this tech.

White Nov 11, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size During his campaign, Donald Trump touted his experience as a CEO and real-estate tycoon as his most significant qualification for president. His theory has in large part been that running a company counts as qualification for public office because it teaches one about taxes, how to grow a business, manage debt, and how deal with employees—skills he claims will translate to presidential success when it comes to the U.S. economy. Business owners, CEOs, and financial titans have traditionally leaned toward the conservative side when it comes to politics and economic ideology. In part, this is because they stand to benefit from policies that include less stringent regulation and lower taxes. Yet as of May 2016, few top business leaders had thrown money behind Trump’s campaign for the presidency. And some were very outspoken about their opposition to his candidacy. In the wake of Trump’s election, the business and finance community has weighed in on how (and if) they think the new president-elect will influence economic and business growth in the country. Many are also using the election’s results as a chance to address ethical or moral considerations, with many sending letters to their staff post-election. Here’s what they’ve said so far: Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor and long-time Trump supporter told CNBC that Trump’s victory was “a very important thing for our economy in general." Icahn was also excited about the victory for other reasons, including the fact that he reportedly poured around $1 billion into the stock market as futures tanked during the close race, and then presumably reaped the benefits as the market fully recovered on Wednesday. But Icahn and Trump may not see eye-to-eye on everything: The famed investor has said that he doesn’t support a repeal of Dodd-Frank, the post-crisis legislation that Trump has threatened to dispose of. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook posted a note on his personal page about watching the election with his daughter Max. In it he urged others to continue making strides on big, important task, regardless of who sits in the seat of the president: Holding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. The most important opportunities of Max's generation—like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity—will take long term focus and finding new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades. Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, investor, and vocal supporter of Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he thinks the Trump administration will focus on decreasing regulation and of small business and boosting fiscal stimulus. A lot of people voted for Trump because he just got it. He understood that things were very off track even if he didn’t have a precise road map of what to do. Other Republican candidates were almost delusionally Panglossian in their views of America. Hillary was also optimistic in a way that made her very out of touch It’s rumored that Thiel may become part of Trump’s transition team. Indra Nooyi, the CEO of Pepsi and a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton started a conversation with The New York Times writer, Andrew Ross Sorkin, by first congratulating the president-elect. But, when asked about the crassness of Trump’s language toward women (Trump had once appeared in a Diet Pepsi ad in 1988) and domestic-violence issues among NFL players (Pepsi is an NFL sponsor), and how these issues affect the Pepsi brand, Nooya was more pointed:* “Forget the Pepsi brand — how dare you talk about women that way?” Ms. Nooyi said. “Why do you talk that way about a whole group of citizens?” Also in conversation with Sorkin, Aetna’s CEO, Mike Bertolini, admitted that the company was blindsided by the election, and must now hypothesize what will happen to healthcare and the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has previously vowed to repeal. Bertolini is optimistic that some tenants of the bill will remain: coverage for children until the age of 26, and Medicaid expansion, for example. Other tenets, such as the high tax on high premium plan might be completely done away with. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple wrote a letter to his staff (published by BuzzFeed) addressing the divisive political election, but never naming Trump. He urged employees to move forward in the spirit of togetherness and offered reassurance that business would continue as usual: While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. Trump and Apple have come into conflict before, with Trump criticizing the company’s overseas manufacturing operation, saying, “We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.” Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post made a statement that some saw as conciliatory, given the fact that Trump vowed to have the company investigated for antitrust violations and tax violations. On Twitter, Bezos wrote: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 GrubHub’s CEO, Matt Maloney, wrote an email to his staff expressing surprise at the results and disagreement with the morals he attributes to Trump’s policies. In closing, he said that those who didn’t believe in inclusiveness should quit: I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States. If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here. We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team. I want to repeat what Hillary said this morning, that the new administration deserves our open minds and a chance to lead, but never stop believing that the fight for what's right is worth it. Maloney's statement was criticized shortly after it was made public, with some suggesting that he told staffers who voted for Trump to leave. In a second statement Maloney clarifies the intent of his message: I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees. Grubhub welcomes and accepts employees with all political beliefs, no matter who they voted for in this or any election. We do not discriminate on the basis of someone's principles, or political or other beliefs. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, appeared on CNBC saying that that markets rebounded in the wake of a massive decline in futures in part because Trump’s late night acceptance speech was more gracious and conciliatory than his campaign. The markets will continue to move in his favor if he maintains the same tone, and focuses corporate tax rates, deregulation, and infrastructure, according to El-Erian. But prioritizing protectionism could quickly make markets sour. So far, much of the response to Trump’s election—including from Trump himself—seems to be about tone setting. The President-elect’s rhetoric in recent days has been more toned down and focused on unification than it was for much of the election. Business leaders, even those who vocally opposed Trump, are taking the same tack and hoping that markets, investors, and consumers will respond positively to a collective confidence and hopefulness about the future of the economy. * This article has been updated to clarify that Nooyi’s comments were in response to a question about the NFL in addition to Trump. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video What Does St. Louis Feel Like Now? In a short documentary, residents reflect on what racial reconciliation—if any—has happened in the segregated city. Nadine Ajaka Nov 14, 2016 About the Author Gillian B. White is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic. Twitter Facebook Email previousThe U.S. Media Is Completely Unprepared to Cover a Trump PresidencynextFacebook Goes Full Nietzsche, Declares Users Dead Most Popular Presented by Carlos Barria / Reuters Why Hillary Clinton Lost Molly Ball As devastated Democrats cast about for explanations, her campaign’s decisions have come under scrutiny. Why did Hillary Clinton lose last week’s presidential election? The candidate herself believes James Comey, the FBI director who notified Congress in an October 28 letter that he was reopening the inquiry into her private emails, was to blame. Her campaign, meanwhile, has cited “a host of uncontrollable headwinds,” asserting that her team did all they could in an unforeseeably difficult environment. Many Democrats, however, are less forgiving of the campaign and its strategy. It may be true that the Comey letter shaved a crucial few points off Clinton’s vote in the home stretch. But critics believe a better campaign would have left her less exposed to a last-minute surprise. If not for a series of miscalculations, these critics contend, the Comey letter wouldn’t have had the impact it did—and she might be president today. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading CBS Stephen Colbert Finds Refuge in Punditry Megan Garber The comedian has long chafed against the bipartisan mandates of network TV. Now he’s taking sides. On Monday evening, Stephen Colbert, television host and comedian, engaged in some light explanation of the political and cultural significance of the alt-right movement in the United States. Colbert, in the opening monologue of the Late Show, summarized for his audience the meaning of Steve Bannon, Trump’s newly appointed chief of White House strategy. “Bannon is considered a leader of what’s known as the alt-right,” Colbert said—“an extreme online movement with ties to white supremacy.” The comedian paused. “Here’s how to understand the alt-right: Think about what’s right, then think about the alternative to that.” Bannon, Colbert added, for more context, “is best known for running something called Breitbart News. If you’ve never read Breitbart, it’s the news your racist uncle gets sent to him by his racist uncle.” Continue Reading Mark Makela / Reuters Liberals Have a Choice: Reach Out to Trump Voters, or Condemn Them Emma Green If progressives want to win back political influence in America, they may need the support of the people they see as racists. PHILADELPHIA—They marched defiantly down John F. Kennedy Boulevard, carrying signs that said “White violence is silence!” and “Dykes against the Klan!” They were young, mostly female, some with blue and shock-blonde hair shaved up the sides. They were black women, brown women, gay women, trans women. They were there to protest the election. They were self-described feminists, fighting back. As Washington slowly hobbles back toward normal, with talk of transition teams and cabinet appointments and the first 100 days, progressives are still reeling. Late last week, several hundred people gathered for multiple rallies in Philadelphia, but this hasn’t just been happening in Pennsylvania. Thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower in New York. Students walking out of class in Oakland. People occupying New York Senator Chuck Schumer’s office in D.C. This is not just “small groups of protesters” coming together, as Donald Trump put it last week. Continue Reading Jason Reed / Reuters ‘The Smell of Corruption Emanating From the Clinton Machine’ Chris Bodenner None So far we’ve heard from two Trump voters in great detail: Alan, who’s most animated by identity politics, and our Southern reader who wants to take a “wrecking ball” to Washington. But both readers also had major qualms with the Trump candidacy. Another reluctant Trump voter, Marco, describes his deep aversion to establishmentarianism and dynastic politics—and doesn’t spare the Republicans one bit: We shouldn’t be asking what happened with Trump. What happened to The Atlantic? I’ve been a reader for years, after abandoning Time and Newsweek because of their People-like superficiality. The appearance of considered thoughts at The Atlantic is what kept me there. But since you decided to take sides in the presidential election, strident hysterical writing is all I find, especially on November 9. That’s perhaps understandable The Day After, but, folks, the sky won’t fall. It won’t fall because the U.S. government’s institutions are designed to prevent irrational outcomes to a good degree. Trust the system a little, if you learned anything from history. I probably do not feel the pain to the same degree as you do, though I am concerned, and on pins and needles. I admit it: I voted for Trump—at the limit of my tolerance for bad taste and unhinged statements. But I did so not because I am an undereducated, violent, intolerant, gun-waving xenophobe—as the press has made habit of defining Trump supporters. I have an MBA. I refuse violence and support gun control. And I’m an immigrant, now a citizen after obtaining green cards twice, all by the legal process. I voted for Trump only because of the smell of corruption emanating from the Clinton Machine. That smell is well documented by Wikileaks and Podesta’s emails depicting the Clinton Foundation / State Department connections. To that you can add the past four decades of continuous scandals—why only them with so many? You get my picture. But there is one more reason to fear their corruption: the history of ALL countries around the world, since WWII, where an immediate relative followed a president or PM (see my list below). In all cases, either the “succession” was made possible by endemic corruption, or advanced it as a result, or both. This is to be expected when the vested interests supporting one person get to take advantage of continued control of the government from behind the scenes by electing the relative. Continue Reading NASA The Prospect of a New Dark Age Ross Andersen How President-elect Trump could affect our ability to understand our changing planet Last Thursday, there was a moment when it was possible to hope that Donald Trump’s presidency wouldn't be as ecologically catastrophic as many feared. As with so many matters of serious policy, Trump’s approach to the environment is difficult to predict, given the paucity of detailed plans he has released, and his tendency to switch positions on a whim. And so, when several of his more extreme campaign promises vanished from his official website, including his vow to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, I wondered if he’d reconsidered. Perhaps he decided to heed President Obama’s advice. Perhaps he was swayed by China’s grumbling. Or perhaps, the collected works of an entire generation of climate scientists finally persuaded him that it would be foolish to abandon a collective pledge, negotiated by all of Earth’s nations, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Continue Reading The Voorhes How Casinos Enable Gambling Addicts John Rosengren Modern slot machines develop an unbreakable hold on many players—some of whom wind up losing their jobs, their families, and even, as in the case of Scott Stevens, their lives. On the morning of Monday, August 13, 2012, Scott Stevens loaded a brown hunting bag into his Jeep Grand Cherokee, then went to the master bedroom, where he hugged Stacy, his wife of 23 years. “I love you,” he told her. Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him. Continue Reading Paul Kane / Getty Supermoon 2016 Alan Taylor Look up in the sky tonight for a remarkable perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. Last night, and later tonight, skywatchers around the world will be treated to views of this year's so-called "supermoon," the largest full moon of the year. Today, on November 14, at 6:20 am Eastern time, the moon approached within 356,500 km (221,500 mi) of Earth, in what is scientifically known as a perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system (perigee: closest point of an elliptical orbit; syzygy: straight line made of three bodies in a gravitational system). Though the moon does appear larger than normal, the size difference is so small that a casual observer would probably never notice. Nonetheless, photographers across the globe set out to capture the event, and collected here are 21 of the most super images of this year's supermoon. If your skies are clear, be sure to look up around moonrise tonight. Continue Reading Molly Riley / AP Trump Tries to Bend Republicans on Infrastructure Russell Berman Whether the president-elect gets his way on money for roads and bridges will say a lot about who runs Washington in 2017. During his victory speech last week, President-elect Donald Trump devoted more than a single sentence to just one piece of policy. It wasn’t a border wall or immigration, nor trade, nor even Obamacare. Instead, the very first specific promise Trump made upon claiming the presidency was to follow through on the one issue that united him and Hillary Clinton—and divided Republicans in Washington: infrastructure. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” the president-elected pledged. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

The last time Apple sold refurbished iPhones appears to be in 2007. Google has decided to pull the plug on its free Map Maker tool that people have used for more than eight years to make community edits to Google Maps. The company will formally retire Map Maker as a stand-alone product in March 2017 and integrate its features directly into Maps. Doing so will allow Google to focus on enabling the best editing and moderation capabilities right within the desktop and mobile versions of Maps, the company announced. Google will continue to roll out new features and update existing ones so the user community can continue to contribute to Maps. But there will no longer be a separate stand-alone tool for doing it. Back in December 2010, SAP re-invigorated its entire business with the introduction of the HANA (high-performance analytic appliance) in-memory database. Since then, it has grown into an almost-$2 billion business for the German software company, and prospects continue to look good for sales going into 2017. At its SAP TechEd Conference Nov. 8 in Barcelona, the company announced that it soon will release a new version of the speedy database, SAP HANA 2, which includes new features and enhancements involving database management, data management, analytical intelligence and application development. Advanced Micro Devices is targeting content creators in such areas as gaming and virtual reality with the latest high-end graphics cards for workstations and similar systems. AMD officials this week announced that the Radeon Pro WX Series of professional graphics cards, which are based on the company's 14-nanometer Polaris architecture, are available. They will address the demands rising from such trends as real-time gaming engines, virtual reality (VR), low-overhead APIs—such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan—and open-source tools and applications. GPUs are a key part of AMD's larger effort to grow its fortunes, allowing the chip maker to compete with Nvidia in a range of growth areas, including gaming, immersive computing and VR.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Could Look Like Under President Trump The president-elect already has a tumultuous relationship with Apple -- but that might not mean much in the end. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Nov 11, 2016 at 5:24PM Image source: Getty Images. The dust is still settling from the surprising election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Markets tanked on the uncertainty of having Trump in the Oval Office, though they have since begun to bounce back. However, investors are still wondering what Trump's policies could mean for their investments, and that's particularly true for companies Trump singled out specifically during his campaign.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took several jabs from Trump over the past year, and there are a few policies that could directly affect the company. It's worth noting that Trump reportedly holds millions of Apple shares, so any of the following proposals would directly impact his portfolio as well. Let's take a look at two key proposals and why Apple is likely to remain steady under President-elect Trump. Persuading Apple to make more products in the U.S. Trump said at the same campaign rally where he called for an Apple boycott (over Apple's refusal to unlock an iPhone for the FBI) that he wants the company to bring its manufacturing out of China and into the U.S. Trump said, "I want to see the day when Apple makes its products on our land. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country." That's not all that unique of a proposal, though Trump has taken it a bit further by saying he would force jobs to come back to the U.S. by proposing high tariffs on imported consumer goods (which Wired points out would be virtually impossible to pull off). Apple jobs were actually brought up in the 2012 campaign election as well. And when President Obama met with Silicon Valley leaders in 2011, he asked the late Steve Jobs what it would take to bring iPhone manufacturing jobs back the U.S. Jobs simply replied, "Those jobs aren't coming back.". So, while U.S. presidents love to pitch the idea of Apple bringing most of its manufacturing back to the states, it's not likely to happen. A New York Times article written four years ago describes a possible reason why:  It isn't just that workers are cheaper abroad. Rather, Apple's executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products. Don't expect President-elect Trump to be able change Apple's mind on this one. Encouraging Apple to repatriate billions in cash Trump proposed on the campaign trail a plan to offer American companies a tax repatriation fee of just 10%. Right now, many American companies leave their foreign profits in other countries instead of bringing the cash back here because the tax rate for doing so is 35%. President-elect Trump has said about overseas profits, "We'll bring it back, and it'll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at 35%? Obviously nobody, because nobody's doing it..." Apple, unsurprisingly, wants this as well. The company has lobbied for tax reforms in the past, namely because it has about $200 billion in cash overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn't brought foreign profits back into the U.S. because the tax rate is simply too high. Earlier this year, Cook said: When we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Considering that Trump is proposing a 10% rate, it seem that this would match up with Cook's "fair rate."  It's still unclear whether or not Trump would be able to do this. But with Republicans gaining control of the House, Senate, and the White House this time around, it seems very possible for them to implement it if they really want to.  That would clearly be a good thing for Apple and its investors. An HSBC economist, Kevin Logan, recently said that a low repatriation rate "could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments." Apple stands on its own While a Trump presidency could certainly have some affect on Apple, investors should remember that the future of the company is ultimately determined by how well Apple itself performs. Apple's iPhone revenue fell 13% year over year in the company's fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. iPhones accounted for 60% of Apple's total revenue for the quarter, and its results mark three consecutive quarters of falling profit and revenue for the company. Clearly, Apple has more important things to focus on than what Trump has said. In an internal memo (obtained by BuzzFeed), Cook wrote to his employees following the election, saying, While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. In the wake of Trump's election, Apple's direction remains the same. The company lives and dies based on how well it makes and sells its products and services. And in that regard, nothing has changed.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

City officials have sought since July to condemn and demolish it as a public nuisance. Attorneys file response to city suit over rotting Cider Ridge house By Zach Tyler, Star Staff Writer, ztyler@annistonstar.com Zach Tyler Nov 11, 2016 (…) Bill Wilson/The Anniston Star A house along Apple Blossom Way is in disrepair. City officials have sought since July to condemn and demolish it as a public nuisance. Attorneys for a Jacksonville man and a homebuilding company at the center of a dispute over a half-finished house in one of Oxford’s priciest subdivisions this week filed responses to a city lawsuit against them both. Cedrick Baker’s attorney argues against demolishing the house, the city’s preferred solution, while homebuilder Chris Birchfield’s attorney says his client is guilty of no wrongdoing. The legal entanglement hinges on the house on Apple Blossom Way, in Oxford’s Cider Ridge neighborhood. Jacksonville resident Cedrick Baker more than two years ago hired Chris Birchfield’s building company, Birch LLC, to build the house according to plans Baker drew. Court documents say Baker halted construction on the $430,000 house when he found that Birchfield’s company wasn’t building it according to his plans. Baker later filed suit against the company, leaving the unfinished house in limbo. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the city of Oxford’s attorney last month, meanwhile, seeks a judge’s permission to condemn and demolish the structure as a public nuisance. Baker’s attorney in her filing this week argues against that. “We believe that the house should be left as-is until a resolution to the dispute is made,” Union Springs attorney Christina Crow said by phone Friday. Crow believes the “best evidence of whether Mr. Birchfield breached the contract and failed to follow specifications would be the house,” she said. Efforts to reach Harry Long, the Anniston attorney representing both Birchfield and his company, were unsuccessful Friday, but Long also filed a response this week to the city’s suit. Long’s answer claims a number of legal defenses while neither admitting nor denying the city’s allegations that the dispute between the company and Baker led to the unfinished, rotting house. The court filing argues that while the company, Birch, and Baker had an agreement, the company’s owner, Birchfield, was never involved in that agreement. Baker in his lawsuit seeks to recoup the $103,573 he’d paid to the company, and punitive damages for what he alleges was negligence and a breach of contract. Long has taken the position that Baker breached the contract, and is entitled to no damages. He has said the city’s suit may speed a resolution to Baker’s dispute with Birchfield and his company. Crow on Friday shared that hope. “Mr. Baker wants a house,” she said. “He doesn’t want a lawsuit.” Staff writer Zach Tyler: 256-235-3564. On Twitter @ZTyler_Star.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPad was mysteriously left out in the cold when Apple held its October event. A few models are in need of an upgrade and it was odd Apple didn’t announce anything new. But now we may know the reason why. According to Barclays Research analysts, Apple is prepping refreshed models for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch Pro models along with adding a new 10.9-inch bezel-free model in March. The new 10.9-inch iPad will apparently retain the same physical size as the 9.7-inch model, but the elimination of the bezels will allow for the bigger display. This may also hint at the end of the home button. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh will get the True Tone display and 12-megapixel camera present in the smaller Pro model, Barclays Research said. Each new model will also reportedly sport four microphones and will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack—continuing to make the elimination of the port in the iPhone that much more head scratching. Apple won’t refresh the iPad Mini 4, which last received a minor redesign and spec upgrade in 2015. No word on whether the iPad Air 2 will be refreshed or not. What new iPads means for Apple These are just rumors at this point, but it does give us an understanding as to what direction the iPad line is heading. In the past year, with the introduction of the iPad Pro, Apple began making the shift to sell the iPad as more of a computer replacement than a computer companion. But with a new bezel-free iPad model, Apple may surprise us and reinvigorate its tablet lineup.

The latest batch of predictions from Barclays Research analysts fuel the rumor that the next iPhone will break the bezel barrier and go with a curved screen, according to MacRumors. Sources within Apple's supply chain told the analysts that while the design isn't 100% locked-down, it appears Apple is cutting out all the space on the sides of the screen and also dabbling with a wraparound display, Samsung Galaxy S7-style. The report adds that this means the future iPhone could move up to a 5-inch and 5.8-inch display from the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus without actually changing the size of the handset. Rumors of a curved display go back as far as this spring, alongside reports claiming Apple is looking to Samsung to produce said screens with a sharper, more energy-efficient OLED display. Add other rumored features such as wireless charging, a glass-backed finish, and even an iris scanner, and you've got yourself an Apple device that could be radically different than its predecessors - even if such speculation should always be taken with a grain of salt.

Having issues getting your Macbook Air to boot? Forgot how to reset your iPad Air 2's password? Accessing Apple's customer support is now as quick as ever, as the company launches a dedicated Apple Support app for iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The app - which requires iOS 9.0 or later - lets users look up troubleshooting articles on the fly, chat with a technician for more pressing issues, and even schedule an appointment with a nearby Apple Store or Apple-sanctioned service provider if things go beyond a DIY repair. The app also keeps information for multiple devices, making it easier for you (or a customer representative) to diagnose your device without having to guess which generation of MacBook or iPod Touch you're trying to fix.  At the time of writing, the app appears to be available only through the Netherlands region of the App Store. Given the English description on the page and the fact that the Apple Support app comes in a dozen different languages, it's very likely that it is in the process of rolling out, and could open up to different regions in good time. Until then, we contacted an Apple representative to learn more about the Apple Support's app plans to go global, and will update this story as more details emerge.  Get over $100 off a refurbished iPhone 6S or 6S Plus Via TechCrunch Tags MacBook Air ABOUT THE AUTHOR Parker Wilhelm Parker Wilhelm is a freelance writer for TechRadar.

In honor of 2016 Veterans Day, Tim Cook tweeted out a photo of some of the veterans who work at Apple. The App Store’s “For Those Who Serve” section provided resources on “military news, essential health and wellness info and valuable tools for everyday life” and Apple Music promoted playlists curated by former service members.  The App Store’s special 2016 Veterans Day section provides nearly four dozen cherry-picked apps divided into three distinct categories: News, Resources and Welness.

For instance, the company added a special section to Apple Music, titled “Saluting Our Veterans,” that contains many curated playlists of songs that were specifically cherry-picked by a diverse group of former service members. And lastly, Tim Cook honored former service members who work at Apple. “Proud to work alongside these and many more veterans at Apple. We honor all the brave men and women who sacrificed for our freedom,” he tweeted. Apple’s chief executive accompanied his public message on Twitter with a group shot of some of the veterans who work at Apple, which you can see above.

While Apple has always offered support for devices in its many retail locations, it seems to be looking for ways to create a slightly more hands-off approach. The app includes help articles and tips for your device, possibly with the hope that consumers won't come into the Apple store every time a problem comes up. The support app works across all devices and hardware registered to a users account.

Rory and Lorelai have small-town charm (and caffeine) running through their veins. They rarely leave Connecticut, making them pretty much strangers to the city. Need proof? Just take a look back at this exchange between Rory and Jess when she went to visit him in Manhattan in the second season. “I’m no stranger to the Big Apple.” — Rory “You are if you’re calling it the Big Apple.” — Jess If they ever decided to leave Stars Hollow for a weekend trip -- never a permanent move -- here’s where they’d probably hang out in the city. The Strand Rory would be in heaven. The only thing that would be able to lure the literary maven from the racks would probably be the site of Jess, Dean or Logan walking by. Other than that, Strand Bookstore, 828 Broadway, Manhattan, would be a total time-suck for the Gilmore, especially once she discovered the lower-level record collection.

(Credit: Strand Bookstore) Tom’s We can picture it now: Lorelai singing "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega every time she drops in for a burger or a cup of coffee. Similar to Luke's, it has been family-owned for decades, which would probably be that ounce of small-town charm Lorelai and Rory would cling to. They may even end up liking Tom's, 782 Washington Ave., Brooklyn, better once they experience the freedom of being allowed to use their cellphones in the diner.

(Credit: Netflix) Café Grumpy A Gilmore is never far away from a good coffee backup. If Lorelai and Rory weren't feeling Tom's -- say Lorelai caused a neighborhood uproar of some sort -- they'd grab their fourth cup of the morning at the original Café Grumpy, 193 Meserole Ave. in Brooklyn. The name would remind them of Luke himself, if the coffee alone didn't. (Credit: Café Grumpy) A Gilmore is never far away from a good coffee backup.

But Lane's mom probably had nearly same amount of antiques, just crammed into a much smaller space. The flea market sure would have come in handy when the Independence Inn caught fire. Lorelai may not have had to hire a decorator (and end up fighting with Emily about it) for the Dragonfly with the Fort Greene market's vast vintage selection.

But since their day trip centered around Washington Square Park, it may as well have been Generation Records, 210 Thompson St., Manhattan. Whether she ends up with Jess or not, Rory wouldn't be able to resist heading back down memory lane.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 11, 2016 at 2:37PM iPhone 7 display. Image source: Apple. Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) shareholders, myself included, are no strangers to volatility. OLED display technology has been heralded as the next big thing for easily a decade, thanks to some inherent benefits such as energy efficiency and the possibility for innovative flexible form factors, among others. But the transition has taken quite a while, as weaknesses have had to be addressed over the years. Uncertain adoption has led to heightened volatility for years, but the transition away from traditional backlit LCDs still seems inevitable, even if it's taking longer than expected. Today, shares have surged 8% on no news specific to Universal Display; third-quarter earnings were already reported earlier this month. Well, you've probably already guessed the culprit by now: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here comes the OLED iPhone 8 Plus The iPhone 8 in 2017 has long been expected to finally be when Apple makes the switch to OLED displays in its most important flagship product. A Sharp executive effectively confirmed Apple's intentions earlier this month, albeit without specifying a time frame. This time around, Barclays analysts have put out a research note on what they expect from the iPhone 8 (via MacRumors). Their supply chain research suggests that Apple is looking to remove the display bezel, which will facilitate larger displays in roughly comparable form factors that aren't much larger than the existing models. This bezel-less design could help the company increase display sizes from 4.7-inch to 5-inch on standard models, and 5.5-inch to 5.8-inch on the Plus models. The pertinent part for Universal Display is that only the larger 5.8-inch models are expected to include OLED displays. Apple is expected to tap Samsung and LG Display, which is unsurprising as those two companies are currently the largest OLED display manufacturers (and also Universal Display's largest customers). Sharp should join the mix within the next two years, and as such will likely announce a long-term commercial agreement with Universal Display to secure pricing on OLED materials, which in itself would be a huge win for Universal Display. Never underestimate Apple's marketing department If Apple chooses to make OLEDs an exclusive feature of the Plus models, you can expect the iPhone maker's marketing department to tout all of OLED's benefits. Apple always picks a feature that it reserves for the Plus models in an effort to upsell the Plus. For instance, last year the iPhone 6s Plus got optical image stabilization (OIS), while the 6s did not. This year, the iPhone 7 Plus has a fancy new dual-camera system, which the 7 didn't get (although the regular 7 now gets OIS). We know that iPhone demand is currently heavily concentrated on the 7 Plus, thanks largely to aforementioned dual-camera system, which should push up average selling prices and margins for Apple by shifting the mix toward larger models. If all of this plays out similarly next year with an OLED iPhone 8 Plus, not only will Universal Display enjoy a ton of revenue upside directly, but Apple would likely bring more attention to OLED displays categorically by focusing its marketing efforts on the inherent benefits. While it's true that most of the major Android OEMs have already adopted OLED to some extent, in which case the benefits of incrementally more awareness could be limited, it never hurts to have Apple market your technology. Apple would be the last big player to jump in. It seems increasingly likely that this years-long rumor may finally materialize in the near future.

Without getting into too much detail, Apple issued a prepared statement indicating that the company needed a "a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Recently, an optimistic, albeit sketchy, rumor hinted that Apple might begin shipping AirPods to retail outlets as early as late next week. Unfortunately, the rumor now appears to be off-the-mark in light of a new research report which claims that AirPods production might not even begin until December. And as if that weren't frustrating enough, the initial production run is said to be for just limited quantities. DON'T MISS: Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Citing sources close to Apple's supply chain, analysts from Barclays Research write that AirPods won't even hit the production line for at least another three to four weeks at best. What remains unclear, though, is when in December Apple is hoping to begin production. Apple would ideally like to have AirPods packaged and ready for purchase in time for the holiday shopping season, but that's starting to look less and less likely with each passing week. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if AirPods don't start shipping until early January of 2017. MacRumors reports: Barclays said the initial production run will be "fairly small," totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. All in all, this isn't a good look for Apple. While it's one thing to give users a sneak peek at an upcoming product, promising a launch in October only to delay said launch for as much as two to three months is something that Apple observers used to mock other tech companies for.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Pfizer x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and other big US corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. Tax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Trump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. Bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. "On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach," said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. "There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years." At the heart of the issue is a law that lets US companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying US corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. Corporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. Trump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether US-based multinationals should pay US taxes on future foreign profits. Trump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. Such proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Democrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. The one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in US highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. Infrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. The four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co $104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. The European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other US multinationals and US officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was "a fair rate" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. BUSINESS SUPPORT The House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a "territorial" system that would largely end taxation of US companies' foreign income. Trump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. Some are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. "In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue," said Republican Representative Tom Cole. The House Republican plan has had significant support from business. Kumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc and Cisco Systems Inc to Alphabet's Google Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. "We know what we want," said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a "modern, competitive" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. The House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. Trump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. Business lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.

Immigration 9 Nov, 2016In his campaign Donald Trump promises to stop illegal immigration in United States. Apart from banning Muslims from entering the US, he will suspend immigration from "any nation that has been compromised by terrorism". More number of people should be hired in the Immigration and Customs department to prevent illegal immigration. Bad news for Mexico 9 Nov, 2016Donald Trump will deport an estimated 11 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants and their children — even if they are born in the United States — starting with those who have committed serious crimes. In all probability, he would build a wall along the US-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. Horror for China? 9 Nov, 2016Trump would like to increase tariffs on Chinese imports up to 45 per cent. In one of his tweet he promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He even warns that US will "walk away" from the agreement if it does not get what it wants. Another move would be America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Located in the Jess Ranch Marketplace in Apple Valley, Dickey's opened its doors for a VIP "family and friends" event a day before the eatery opened to the public for the first time on Thursday. “It’s great to be in Apple Valley and we plan to serve our customers the best barbecue they’ve ever tasted,” General Manager Abel Flores told the Daily Press. “Tonight is a soft opening and we plan on having an official grand opening soon.” While Flores continued to share about the store, visitors of all ages feasted on free smoked meat, classic sandwiches, butcher tacos and side orders of cabbage slaw, potato salad, beans and other Southern classics. A large sign inside the store spotlighted the eatery's "hand rubbed" and "hand sliced" meat that is smoked slowly at 225 degrees on site daily. As employees filled customers orders, behind them was a large refrigerator that shows stacks of meat ready to be smoked and culinary experts assembling meals served on metal trays. “We did so well in Victorville that we felt it was time to move into Apple Valley where we could showcase Dickey’s barbecue menu,” Flores said. “Being close to Victor Valley College and Lucerne gives more people the opportunity to try our barbecue.” Assistant Manager Trenell Sandres, who was busy welcoming guests, said the eatery, just north of the Target entrance and near Apple Valley Road, employs nearly 20 people. “We have an awesome crew working here and it’s been great working with Abel,” Sandres said. “I hope that we can put a lot of smiles on a lot of faces.” Flores said a barbershop quartet will perform at Dickey’s from 4 to 8 p.m. every Saturday in November. On Sunday, Dickey’s will offer a free kid’s meal with a $10 adult purchase. Three lucky guests will win free barbecue for an entire year. Guests can enter to win by using #1FreeYearOfBBQ on social media, by placing an order for the new location online or by signing up for the Big Yellow Cup Club. Considered the nation's largest barbecue chain, Dickey’s Barbecue Restaurants was founded in 1941 by Travis Dickey with the goal of preparing authentic slow-smoked barbecue. With the tag line, "We Speak Barbecue," the Dallas-based, family-run company has expanded to more than 560 locations in 43 states. Dickey’s recently won first place on Fast Casual’s “Top 100 Movers and Shakers” and ranked in the top 10 of Franchise Times’ “Fast and Serious.” Dickey’s Barbecue Pit was recognized for the third year by Nation’s Restaurant News as a “Top 10 Growth Chain” and by Technomic as the “Fastest-growing restaurant chain in the country.” For more information, visit www.dickeys.com. The new Dickey’s is located at 19201 Bear Valley Road in Apple Valley.

Up until now hiring of employees necessary for construction of the new campus has been handled through a third-party. New job listings on Apple’s website appear to be offering permanent positions at the facility set to become the company’s headquarters, specifically for staff that will also be needed to facilitate moving in next year. Of note, one job listing is looking for a “Loading Dock Master” to be responsible for all loading dock operations and to manage and train new staff. The role is also responsible for ‘the delivery of materials from the loading dock to campus locations.” Late last month we noted that Apple was preparing for finishing touches at the new campus as it estimated building construction to be complete by the end of this year. Apple’s current general timeline for the project estimates landscaping work to continue into the first quarter of 2017. The company is currently thought to have plans to begin moving into the new location by the end of January 2017, that is at least according to Tim Cook’s latest to employees earlier this year.  On Apple’s website detailing job creation milestones, the company notes that the new campus in Cupertino will support 41,000 jobs in Santa Clara County with 12,600 full-time construction jobs over three-years it will take to complete. In its latest 2015 update, the company said it was “responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs” in total around the globe. The new 176-acre campus will include approximately 2.8 million sq ft of office space and house over 13,000 Apple employees when the company begins the move-in process. It will also be home to a new underground 1000-seat “Apple Theater” auditorium expected to play host to upcoming Apple events and product unveilings.  A report last month noted that Apple had recently rearranged office space in its plans for Campus 2, allowing it to accommodate potentially “thousands” of more employees above its original 13,000 estimate. As always, you can stay up to date with the latest updates for Campus 2 in our ongoing construction progress timeline.

Etsy previously accepted Apple Pay within the Etsy app for iOS devices, but with support for Apple Pay on the web, Apple users can pay with Apple Pay using Safari on any supported Mac or iOS device. Etsy is accepting Apple Pay payments in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Just as it does in Etsy's iOS app, Apple Pay enables buyers to complete their purchases quickly without needing to add their billing or shipping information at checkout. And as with all other Apple Pay transactions, Apple Pay transactions on the web are encrypted using the mobile wallet on the buyer's device. To use Apple Pay on the web while shopping on Etsy, buyers simply select Apple Pay at checkout and then authorize the payment using Touch ID following a prompt on their iOS device.Apple Pay on the web was introduced with iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, giving Apple Pay users an alternative to payment services like PayPal. Since Apple Pay on the web went live, many websites and payment providers have implemented support for the feature, and it is on its way to being widely accepted. With Apple Pay on the web, purchases made on a Mac are confirmed through a connection to an Apple Watch or an iPhone, with the purchase authorized via Touch ID. On iOS devices, making a purchase using Apple Pay on the web is similar to making a purchase within an app. Apple Pay on the web requires iOS 10 or macOS Sierra, along with an Apple Pay-compatible device. On Mac, a purchase needs to be confirmed with an iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE, or Apple Watch, while mobile web payments are available on the above listed iPhones and the following iPads: iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4, and all iPad Pro models.

By Brooke Crothers Published November 11, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print iPhone 7 Plus (Apple) Is the larger iPhone 7 really a meaningful upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus? Read on. The most striking thing about the iPhone 7s Plus— the 5.5-inch Plus is the larger of the two new phones— is just how similar it is physically to the iPhone 6 Plus introduced in 2014. Ditto on the iPhone 6s Plus, introduced last year. In fact, I’m guessing the non-geek, average consumer couldn’t tell the difference between all three— even after using them. I’ve owned all three and recently switched to the 7 Plus. Here are my impressions. Camera: It’s Apple’s best yet. I’ve compared photos from my iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus and the latter produces better photos in low-light. I take most of my photos in low-light or ambient room light and the iPhone 7 Plus camera renders more accurate colors and detail. But I have to look hard. The difference isn’t going to jump out at you. And, again, the average consumer (non-photography buff) probably wouldn’t notice.   APPLE UNVEILS NEW IPHONES: THE IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS I’m trying not to carp. Enthusiasts who obsess about image quality will definitely notice. And it's important to note that camera quality doesn’t improve in big leaps. It’s incremental. So, hats off to Apple for continuing to make its iPhone cameras good enough that most consumers can ditch their stand-alone DSLRs. (I ditched my pricey DSLR when I got the iPhone 5s.) There is one thing that everyone will notice, however, novices and experts alike: the “telephoto” capability that is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus. The telephoto technology uses two lenses (versus one on the smaller iPhone 7).  In short, up to 2X, you get higher-quality zoom. I definitely noticed this right away. The novice will too. No headphone jack: The sole Lightning connector on the iPhone 7 is a game changer. This didn’t hit me until, out of habit, I sat down and unthinkingly tried to plug my old headphones into the iPhone 7 Plus. At that moment, I also realized that I had probably a half a dozen headphones with old-style 3.5mm jacks that I couldn’t use with iPhone 7 Plus without an adapter. And, tangentially, I noticed that using the Lighting headphones with the Lightning port on my iPad Pro doesn’t work for me because it blocks easy access to the home button. That doesn’t bode well for future iPads unless Apple changes the position of the Lightning connector. IS APPLE WORKING ON THE BIGGEST IPHONE GAME-CHANGER EVER? That said, it’s progress. Everyone hates it when technology changes. But after the initial temper tantrum, most people soon forget what all the fuss was about. That will apply to the headphone jack-less iPhone 7 too. Solid-state home button: I welcome the switch to a solid-state home button from the mechanical one on all previous iPhones. And I expect all Apple iOS devices to adopt solid-state buttons. It provides better feedback, is more responsive, and just plain easier to use. Battery life: While I haven’t done exact down-to-the-minute comparisons, generally, after weeks of use, I haven’t noticed a difference – good or bad – between the iPhone 7 Plus and my previous iPhone 6s Plus. And I don’t think the average buyer will be either disappointed by or ecstatic over the iPhone 7 Plus’ battery life. It generally lasts all day unless I’m traveling and using it constantly all day. In the latter case, it needs recharging before the day is out. APPLE OFFERS DEALS ON IPHONES, MACBOOKS, AND MORE Performance: I do notice subtle speed improvements. Though the iPhone 7 packs a new Apple A10 processor, I believe a good chunk of the speed boost comes from the 3GB of RAM in the 7 Plus – that’s 1GB more than the 2GB of the smaller iPhone 7. As anyone who has done a DIY upgrade of a PC knows, if you add RAM, everything gets snappier. That applies to mobile devices too. Water resistance: I have not tested the improved water resistance and will only do so if I’m forced to. Apple doesn't cover water damage under the standard warranty. So, I’m not going to push my luck. But tech sites have done lots of testing so I’ll refer you to in-depth testing. And some tests, by the way, showed that damage did occur. To wrap up, is the iPhone 7 a major improvement over the iPhone 6s? No. And it's not light years ahead of the iPhone 6 either. That said, if you obsess about photo quality, need better water resistance, and insist on having the fastest iPhone, it's worth the upgrade.

Move over Apple and Samsung, China's mobile market is after world domination. By David Gilbert November 11, 2016 18:17 GMT The Chinese smartphone revolution is upon us, below are the biggest brands seeking to take down Apple and SamsungReuters The smartphone market is slowing down. Samsung and its exploding phones are struggling and even Apple is feeling the pinch. As the big names in the market begin to wane, others are threatening to supplant them — and they all come from China. The Chinese smartphone market is a bit of a basket case, with hundreds if not thousands of companies producing smartphones which range from premium flagship devices to budget white label products to be sold in developing countries. Most of these companies we will never hear about and will soon disappear as the market consolidates, but for a handful, they have the chance to become household names, looking to leverage their scale and ability to produce premium devices at a fraction of the price of those from Apple and Samsung. So who are these emerging companies? Huawei The best-known of the cohort is Huawei. Already the world's number three smartphone maker, the company has not been shy about stating its ambitions. "When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy," Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, told Reuters last month. He added that Huawei will overtake Apple as the world's second biggest smartphone maker by 2018, and then set it sights on Samsung. Huawei made its name as the producer of low-priced smartphones, but in recent years has made a significant push into the premium end of the market. While it is already selling its budget Honor brand in the US, last month it announced it would be bringing a flagship smartphone — the Mate 9 — to the American market for the first time. The Huawei Mate 9 sports a crisp 5.9in FHD displayIBTimes UK Huawei still has to overcome some issues related to its brand, but with sales continuing to climb dramatically, it has every chance of meeting its ambitious goals. Xiaomi Xiaomi is best known for being called the Apple of the East, even though the comparison isn't really accurate. The company has made its name selling smartphones in its home country and a handful of other Asian markets. While the company was at one point valued at $45 billion, that valuation has since dropped as the company has struggled to sustain it meteoric sales growth because it does not sell its phones in enough markets. Xiaomi, once hailed as the world's most valuable startup, has seen its fortunes changeReuters The reason? Xiaomi, like many Chinese companies, does not have a robust patent portfolio behind them and expect to be met by lawsuits when they launch in a developed market like the US and western Europe. But, thanks to deals with the likes of Qualcomm and Microsoft that allows access to their respective patents, Xiaomi finally looks set to make a play for the big leagues. Its head of international development, Hugo Barra, who previously ran Android at Google, confirmed last month that Xiaomi was testing its phone on US carrier networks, paving the way for a launch in 2017. Will it succeed? No one really knows. Vivo and Oppo According to IDC, Oppo and Vivo were the world's 4th and 5th biggest smartphone manufacturers in the third quarter of 2016. Both companies are relative unknowns in this part of the world, but we are bundling them together here as they share the same parent company BKK Electronics. OnePlus, another Chinese company which has attracted a lot of attention for its premium smartphones on a budget, is also part of the BKK stable. While these companies have made their name by selling in the sub-£200 market, they are also looking to make themselves stand out by offering unique features, including a unique rapid charging technology and claims to having the world's thinnest smartphone. The OnePlus 3 has been hailed as a budget smartphone beast OnePlus While again China is the main market for these brands (though not OnePlus which has from the start been a global brand), international expansion is now ramping up and we should expect both names to become much more recognisable in the coming 12 months. LeEco The outlier among these companies, LeEco is a company which has made a big splash in the last 12 months, with everything from its own version of Netflix to a self-driving car. Not just smartphones. LeEco is also developing a self-driving electric carLeEco It also sells smartphones and recently held a major launch event in the US to announce its presence, having made its name in China. Its $300 Le Pro 3 smartphone is positioned as competitor to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S7, with the extra appeal of having LeEco's streaming services pre-installed. However, the company's billionaire founder Yueting Jia has just announced that it is running out of cash, so may have to scale back its plans. LeEco clearly has ambitious plans but without the cash to make a major marketing assault on the US or elsewhere, it is hard to see the brand making a significant impact. ZTE One Chinese company which has already made an impact is ZTE. It has been operating in the US and European markets for a few years, having previously operated as a white label manufacturer for carriers. The ZTE Axon 7 is another cheap but powerful smartphone from ChinaZTE It has shrewdly signed marketing deals with sports franchises across the US and Europe while also launching a range of devices in almost all price brackets, including its premium Axon range which competes at the top of the market. ZTE, like Huawei, started life as a manufacturer of networking equipment. It has since built close relationships with carriers around the world, owns a patent portfolio to back up its products and uses a clever marketing strategy — all of which mean it has a much bigger chance of succeeding long term than many of the other Chinese companies which may briefly appear on the bestseller lists, before disappearing just as quickly.

If your main PC is a laptop, chances are you appreciate having more than one power adapter available to charge it with. Typically you'll want a couple at home and one at work if it doubles as your work machine. Apple realizes this, and so with the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro it has decided to eke out a little more profit from sales of power adapters. Is anyone surprised? In order for a 2016 MacBook Pro power adapter to work it requires the power adapter itself, the main cable for insertion into a power outlet, and a USB-C cable to connect it to your laptop. Apple sells a 13-inch model power adapter for $69 or a 15-inch model power adapter for $79. But as 9to5Mac rightly points out, both don't work out of the box because neither includes a USB-C cable. You could argue that Apple already provided a USB-C cable with the MacBook Pro, but that's really not the point. When purchasing a new power adapter, especially one that costs upwards of $69, I expect it to include everything required to charge a laptop. Instead, Apple will happily sell you a USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 meter) for $19, or a 2-meter version for $29. //Related Articles MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? So, if you only want to use official Apple accessories, and who wouldn't after having paid anywhere between $1,499 and $2,799 for a MBP? An extra power adapter with all the cables required to use it will actually cost from $88 up to $108. There are two reasons I can think of why Apple has decided not to ship a USB-C cable with its power adapters. The first is because customers don't want or need the cable. The second is profit. I highly doubt any customers would be upset by having an extra cable to use, so the second reason makes much more sense. If you have other possible reasons, I'd love to hear them. Apple recently (but only temporarily) dropped the prices of its accessories due to complaints. Hopefully similar levels of upset will push Apple to revisit power adapters and add another cable in the box.

In a research note obtained by MacRumors, the analysts said the 10.9-inch model's borderless design will allow for it to be the same physical size as the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That means the display itself will need to have an edge-to-edge design, possibly signaling the removal of the Home button. Multiple rumors have claimed Apple is developing a new iPad in the 10-inch range, but the exact screen size has varied in each report. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will launch in 2017, while Japanese website Mac Otakara said a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro will launch in early 2017. Barclays, like Kuo, expects the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro to be a "low-cost" model alongside the 7.9-inch iPad mini, which the analysts do not believe will be refreshed alongside the larger tablets. Instead, the research note said Apple will continue to produce and sell the iPad mini 4, released in September 2015. Mac Otakara previously said the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a True Tone display like its current 9.7-inch counterpart, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. That report said all three new iPad Pro models will gain quad microphones, compared to the current dual setup, and retain 3.5mm headphone jacks. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also said to gain the 9.7-inch model's same 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera and True Tone flash. More "revolutionary" changes to iPads, including a switch to OLED displays, are expected in 2018, according to Kuo's earlier report.

With no bezel, there’s not “safe” place to grip the device while holding it. The OS will have to determine what’s a deliberite touch vs indiscriminate touch.

Not to mention, we have 3 screen sizes now, but 5 iPad models to choose from, before considering 3/4 colors, 3 capacities, and 2 connectivity options. It's starting to seem a lot like Android devices, except with hardware, not software, fragmentation. Rating: 8 Votes BMcCoy 4 days ago at 09:05 am I always laugh at any story about Apple products that suggests a "low-cost" model..! Rating: 8 Votes BWhaler 4 days ago at 09:21 am I would buy the 10.9 in a heartbeat. I use the iPad at work intensely throughout the day. I've longed for a size between the two Pro models. The 12.9 is just too big and bulky, the 9.7 is perfect to carry and not be obtrusive or rude in meetings. But the 9.7 could use a bit more screen real estate. A 10.9 in the package size of a 9.7 would be heaven. Happy to pay a premium for it. Of course, it's a bummer there's no OLED, which in 2017 is shocking. But this is Tim Cooke's Apple now, and we're going to have to get used to MBAs and their spreadsheets trickling out technology over the years to keep us upgrading. The days of Steve getting on stage showing devices packed with the best Apple could make are over, alas. But my main hope for 2017 is Apple has a serious fork in iOS and Apps for the iPad and gets serious about making the iPad a productivity device. Apple doesn't seem to get that what's holding back the line, and the reason I see more and more Surfaces on planes and in meetings, is the software. It's not the lack of speakers or more microphones or the iPads needs more thinness. It's simply that it's harder to do a lot of productivity workflows with the limits of iOS and their first party apps. Moreover, a serious investment from Apple in iPad software would signal the app ecosystem their commitment.

And while some have rushed to call these accessories obsolete, … The smartwatch market is currently dominated by the Apple iWatch and the Samsung Gear smartwatches. And while some have rushed to call these accessories obsolete, other companies see a bright future in this market. One of them is Vector Watch, the maker of the world’s only smartwatch with a battery life of 30 days. The Bucharest-based watchmaker recently joined forces with BMW to deliver limited edition model inspired by the BMW i sub-brand. The Vector Luna BMW i Limited Edition watch was unveiled this week in a private event. Inspired by the design and materials used inside the BMW i3, the smartwatch comes with a matte black bezel and a special stamp on one of its sides, with the production number of the watch engraved. Since only 150 units will ever be made, the exclusive inscription makes them even more valuable. What sets this limited edition version apart from the rest of the Vector watches are the BMW i3 and BMW i8 inspired watch faces – that can be interchanged – as well as the leather strap that has the BMW i logo stamped and is made of the same leather used for the BMW i3. The same supplier was used by Vector to source the leather and with the agreement of BMW, the BMW i logo was integrated into it. Since both the BMW i3 and the Vector Luna watches are focused on efficiency, the collaboration between the two brands was bound to happen at one point. The watch is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows Phone operating systems and has over 100 different faces and apps available for download online. The phone’s pricing is about 600 Euros and it should be available online on various e-commerce websites starting today, even though sources inside BMW claim all of the 150 units have already been sold. BMWBLOG has also been working with Vector Watch to integrate our daily newsfeed with the watch, keeping you up to date with the latest info from the BMW world. That’s something regular Vector watches can’t do. The app for the BMWBLOG feed is still in beta but a stable version should be available shortly, as the manufacturer assured us. smartwatchVector Luna BMW i Limited EditionVector Watch Previous post The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer Is a Success Nobody’s Talking about Next post BMW 635CSi Group 2 Race Car Up for Grabs for €175,000 RECOMMENDED FOR YOU BMW’s Vehicular Small Cell Technology BMW Vehicular Small Cell will automatically connect all mobile devices inside the vehicle, including smartwatches and other smart devices Gesture control using smartwatch unlocks the BMW i3 Smartwatches and smartphones make it possible to easily use the future BMW i Connected Mobility dashboard on-the-go.

By and large, developers and professionals are unhappy with the fact that they patiently waited for years for a meaningful MacBook Pro upgrade only to see Apple deliver a machine that uses the 'Pro' moniker rather loosely. DON'T MISS: Best Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now That notwithstanding, it is entirely possible that the controversy surrounding Apple's new MacBook Pro is much ado about nothing. Sure, a small minority of pro users who absolutely need 32GB of RAM no questions asked may be unhappy, but for the majority of customers who will end up buying the machine, it would appear that the new MacBook Pro is a lot more compelling than some are giving it credit for. Speaking to this point, professional video editor Thomas Carter recently took to The Huffington Post where he penned a mini-review of Apple's new MacBook Pro and came away rather impressed. For some additional context, Carter said that he's been using Apple's new Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pro for about a week on actual work-related video projects. As for the specs, which some critics have understandably called disappointing, Carter suggests we have nothing to worry about. First off, It’s really fast. I’ve been using the MacBook Pro with the new version of FCP X and cutting 5k ProRes material all week, it’s buttery smooth. No matter what you think the specs say, the fact is the software and hardware are so well integrated it tears strips off “superior spec’d” Windows counterparts in the real world. Of course, what people are mostly interested in is whether or not the vaunted Touch Bar is a gimmick or if it's actually huge step forward in usability. To this point, Carter leans towards the latter in what is the best encapsulation of the Touch Bar's utility I've seen yet. For years we’ve had single mouse inputs on a graphical user interface. Over time we’ve added more buttons and scroll wheels, trackpads with gestures. The Touch Bar takes this step further by allowing multiple inputs at the same time and combines well with the trackpad. The more I’ve used it the more I’ve replaced certain keyboard shortcuts. Why would I use dual-hand/multi-finger shortcuts if the button was there in front of me? And it’s contextual. It changes depending on what I’m doing. I’m editing picture; it shows me relevant trimming shortcuts. I’m editing titles; it shows me font, formatting and colour options. All without the need to open other menus. It works, it’s faster and it’s more productive. So while hardcore developers and professionals who need insanely tricked out machines may be understandably bummed by Apple's new MacBoo Pro, it really looks as if most everyone else will be more than thrilled with the machine. Indeed, Phil Schiller last week said that orders for Apple's new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar are higher than what Apple has seen for "any other pro notebook before.” “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it,” Schiller added.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets E-tailers defy diktat, sell refurbished mobiles Priyanka Pani comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Radu Bercan/shutterstock.com In September, the Environment Ministry had issued a show-cause notice to several e-commerce players for dealing with refurbished phones. Popular mobile brands are being sold at heavily discounted prices Mumbai, November 11:   Despite the government’s diktat to handset makers to not sell refurbished or used phones, these products have made their way into the online channel. Several e-commerce players, such as Amazon, Overcart and eBay, are openly selling used or refurbished phones and the category is only growing. In September this year, the Environment Ministry had issued a show-cause notice to several e-commerce players, including Amazon.in and eBay, for dealing with refurbished and used mobile phones. However, two months since then, it is business as usual for these portals when it comes to selling refurbished phones. In fact, Amazon.in launched its refurbished category in September this year. It has Apple, Lenovo, Motorola, Samsung, Micromax and OnePlus as the most popular brands. The phones are available at heavily discounted prices and with a warranty from the seller and not from the companies. It is also important to mention here that Flipkart, which is an authorised marketplace for Apple, does not deal in used products. The Centre had this year turned down a proposal by Apple to sell refurbished phones in the country as it would clash with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious “Make in India” initiative. Besides, it also would protect the country from being another “dumping ground for e-waste” by cell manufacturers. Apple, meanwhile, was looking at increasing its sales by selling pre-owned phones in the world’s largest mobile market by providing affordable products. While Apple declined any comment on whether the company was aware about the availability of used phones on e-commerce portals, an industry expert said that Apple deals with certified pre-owned phones, which is different from refurbished as Apple completely changes the old phones and converts them into “almost new” phones with a different IMEI number.‘No clear regulation’ “At present there is no clear regulation saying that selling of refurbished phones is illegal. However, the indication is that the government is completely against this,” said Jayanth Kolla, an IT and telecommunications analyst. He further added that while Apple and other companies would not be dealing with this directly, several third-party vendors and distributors, who have access to markets like China and Taiwan would be importing these devices through the grey market or other channels. Pankaj Mohindroo, National President of the Indian Cellular Association, told BusinessLine that while this is not a serious issue, the sellers dealing with refurbished phones require surveillance. Meanwhile, even as the government is yet to come out with clear guidelines with regard to refurbished phones, consumers seem quite happy as they get to use premium products at throw-away prices.Growing sales “The refurbished category has witnessed exponential growth. Within 10 months from December 2015, the category has seen 100X growth,” said Nitin Kocchar, V-P at Shopclues. He added that the refurbished mobiles have emerged as a leading category, not just for revenues but also driving positive margins for the category. On how the marketplaces are selling the refurbished products when they have been termed illegal, ShopClues said the company has been selling them for a year by creating a marketplace for refurbished sellers, who legally buy the used products and refurbish them. “Our unboxed category brands have a brand warranty and refurbished phones have a warranty provided by third-party companies.” Amazon did not respond to mails sent in this regard.

 Apple is still struggling to keep fake apps out of the App Store BI Intelligence Nov. 11, 2016, 10:50 AM 2,031 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Here's what a Trump presidency means for mobile apps and platforms Shifting trends and priorities are set to transform the growing mPOS ecosystem CHATBOTS EXPLAINER: Conversation may power revenues for the next decade This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. After Apple had to purge several hundred malicious fake shopping apps from the iOS App Store earlier this week, the company’s security review process has been called into question. Apple often touts its security review process, which new apps must undergo before they can enter the App Store, as a significant advantage of the iOS ecosystem over its Android competitor. However, Apple does not actually review every single new app, according to The New York Times. This leaves it up to developers and brands to keep a watchful eye for fake apps masquerading as their own, as was the case with the hundreds of fake apps Apple recently removed. Apple told The New York Times that it encourages consumers and developers to report suspicious apps so it can quickly review them. Apple is in the midst of a campaign to review the more than 2 million apps in the App Store to remove malicious and outdated apps. Apple has historically had far less malicious code make its way into the App Store compared with Android’s Google Play store and third-party app stores. However, that has begun to change recently. In addition to the spate of fake retail apps, a number of fake apps related to the Pokemon Go mobile game hit the App Store after the game rose to popularity. This means brands and developers will likely need to be more vigilant going forward around threats to their customers stemming from fake apps. Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is already critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base, and that challenge becomes greater when malicious and fake apps flood the stores. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Apple Is the iPhone 7 Plus better than past generations? By Brooke Crothers Published November 11, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print iPhone 7 Plus (Apple) Is the larger iPhone 7 really a meaningful upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus? Read on. The most striking thing about the iPhone 7s Plus— the 5.5-inch Plus is the larger of the two new phones— is just how similar it is physically to the iPhone 6 Plus introduced in 2014. Ditto on the iPhone 6s Plus, introduced last year. In fact, I’m guessing the non-geek, average consumer couldn’t tell the difference between all three— even after using them. I’ve owned all three and recently switched to the 7 Plus. Here are my impressions. Camera: It’s Apple’s best yet. I’ve compared photos from my iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus and the latter produces better photos in low-light. I take most of my photos in low-light or ambient room light and the iPhone 7 Plus camera renders more accurate colors and detail. But I have to look hard. The difference isn’t going to jump out at you. And, again, the average consumer (non-photography buff) probably wouldn’t notice.   APPLE UNVEILS NEW IPHONES: THE IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS I’m trying not to carp. Enthusiasts who obsess about image quality will definitely notice. And it's important to note that camera quality doesn’t improve in big leaps. It’s incremental. So, hats off to Apple for continuing to make its iPhone cameras good enough that most consumers can ditch their stand-alone DSLRs. (I ditched my pricey DSLR when I got the iPhone 5s.) There is one thing that everyone will notice, however, novices and experts alike: the “telephoto” capability that is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus. The telephoto technology uses two lenses (versus one on the smaller iPhone 7).  In short, up to 2X, you get higher-quality zoom. I definitely noticed this right away. The novice will too. No headphone jack: The sole Lightning connector on the iPhone 7 is a game changer. This didn’t hit me until, out of habit, I sat down and unthinkingly tried to plug my old headphones into the iPhone 7 Plus. At that moment, I also realized that I had probably a half a dozen headphones with old-style 3.5mm jacks that I couldn’t use with iPhone 7 Plus without an adapter. And, tangentially, I noticed that using the Lighting headphones with the Lightning port on my iPad Pro doesn’t work for me because it blocks easy access to the home button. That doesn’t bode well for future iPads unless Apple changes the position of the Lightning connector. IS APPLE WORKING ON THE BIGGEST IPHONE GAME-CHANGER EVER? That said, it’s progress. Everyone hates it when technology changes. But after the initial temper tantrum, most people soon forget what all the fuss was about. That will apply to the headphone jack-less iPhone 7 too. Solid-state home button: I welcome the switch to a solid-state home button from the mechanical one on all previous iPhones. And I expect all Apple iOS devices to adopt solid-state buttons. It provides better feedback, is more responsive, and just plain easier to use. Battery life: While I haven’t done exact down-to-the-minute comparisons, generally, after weeks of use, I haven’t noticed a difference – good or bad – between the iPhone 7 Plus and my previous iPhone 6s Plus. And I don’t think the average buyer will be either disappointed by or ecstatic over the iPhone 7 Plus’ battery life. It generally lasts all day unless I’m traveling and using it constantly all day. In the latter case, it needs recharging before the day is out. APPLE OFFERS DEALS ON IPHONES, MACBOOKS, AND MORE Performance: I do notice subtle speed improvements. Though the iPhone 7 packs a new Apple A10 processor, I believe a good chunk of the speed boost comes from the 3GB of RAM in the 7 Plus – that’s 1GB more than the 2GB of the smaller iPhone 7. As anyone who has done a DIY upgrade of a PC knows, if you add RAM, everything gets snappier. That applies to mobile devices too. Water resistance: I have not tested the improved water resistance and will only do so if I’m forced to. Apple doesn't cover water damage under the standard warranty. So, I’m not going to push my luck. But tech sites have done lots of testing so I’ll refer you to in-depth testing. And some tests, by the way, showed that damage did occur. To wrap up, is the iPhone 7 a major improvement over the iPhone 6s? No. And it's not light years ahead of the iPhone 6 either. That said, if you obsess about photo quality, need better water resistance, and insist on having the fastest iPhone, it's worth the upgrade.

Here’s how to protect yours before it’s too late. Use encryption. by April Glaser Nov 10, 2016, 5:11pm EST tweet share Linkedin Spencer Platt / Getty Images Donald Trump doesn’t like encryption. He threatened to call for a boycott of Apple products because they wouldn’t undermine the encryption on the iPhone. Trump also loves surveillance. When he was a candidate, he said he wanted to place mosques under U.S. surveillance and create a national database to track Muslims. He is also in favor of NSA mass surveillance. And on the topic of hacking his enemies, Trump said, “I wish I had that power. Man, that would be power.” As president, he will have that power. Edward Snowden has revealed that the United States already engages in mass digital surveillance of Americans. But the federal government has gone to great lengths to keep its domestic surveillance operation under wraps, getting broad clearance through secret court orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. Under Trump, that surveillance is likely to be a lot more overt. But the ability to have private conversations, to research controversial topics without fear of government reprisal and to engage in political activism and organizing are all key functions of American democracy. If you’re concerned about expanded surveillance, there are a number of privacy-enhancing tips and products you can try that will help keep your digital footprint under wraps. Texts and phone calls Leaks have shown that the NSA and the FBI are capable of intercepting text message and phone data. To keep your text messages private, use a service that offers end-to-end encryption. Apple’s iMessages does this, but only between iMessage users — if you text someone who’s on an Android phone, those messages won’t have the same protection. Signal, a popular encrypted text messaging app Snowden recommends, and Facebook’s WhatsApp, are other options. And both of them work on Apple as well as Android phones. Like iMessage, both parties of the text conversation need to have the app installed for the encryption to work. Internet search data If you want to keep your internet search queries private, try installing Tor, an internet browser that anonymizes your activity by routing the data through multiple destinations before sending it out onto the worldwide web. There are also tools like HTTPS Everywhere, a browser extension which helps to encrypt connections between websites. Two-factor authentication and updates Passwords are hackable, especially if you reuse the same one over and over, like many people do. Don’t do that. One thing you should do to protect your privacy is enable two-factor authentication for all of your accounts. Most services offer the option to text a code to a phone number on file for your account, so only someone with both your password and your cellphone can access it. Also, make sure all your apps and services are fully updated to take advantage of any recent security improvements. recode_divider In this Storystream Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: Presidential election 2016 Donald Trump says his tweeting as president will be ‘very restrained,’ even as he trolls the New York Times today Trump will be a disaster for online privacy.

Orange Cash offers contactless mobile payments based on a prepaid account with a digital Visa card, issued by Wirecard Card Solutions. The digital card will be provisioned through an app-to-wallet interface directly into Wallet. Customers don’t need to scan a plastic card and run through additional verification processes, thus making the on-boarding process very user-friendly while ensuring high security standards. Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When using a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. Nicolas Lévi, Director Payments and Mobile Financial Services at Orange, said in a statement: “With Wirecard on our side, a leading specialist in the field of mobile payment, we found a strong partner. We are driven by our desire to further expand mobile payment coverage on the market. Our innovative spirit helps us to develop the most useful and advanced services for our customers, we believe Apple Pay is just that.” Orange Cash offers one-tap, real-time loyalty and couponing deals from participating retailers through Wirecard’s Card-Linked Offers platform. “By supporting the launch of Orange Cash with Apple Pay in France, for the first time customers with iPhone 6 and later can also benefit from couponing and loyalty deals while using mobile payments. An easy-to-handle one-tap solution for payment and benefits guarantees Orange customers using iPhone 6 and later a smart shopping experience. Together with Orange we are offering the first app-to-wallet provisioning of an Apple Pay solution with Visa in Europe, which makes us proud,” said Brigitte Häuser-Axtner, Executive Vice President Sales Digital Goods with Wirecard, in a statement. Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and beneﬁts offered by credit and debit cards. In France, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and later, iPhone SE and Apple Watch. Source: Wirecard MacDailyNews Take: Félicitations, France!

Comments Computerworld | Nov 11, 2016 6:54 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac MacOS Computer Hardware Apple MacBook Pro Mac Pro Comments Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar notebooks swiftly surpassed sales of almost every other decent quality notebook in the first five days availability. Early adopters, adopt Apple has raised its part and component orders with its supply chain partners, telling them that it expects strong shipments to continue until at least the end of the year. Apple’s senior VP Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, recently said: “We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there are certainly a lot of people as excited as we are about it." Slice Intelligence notes Apple has struck a chord with early adopters once again with this release. “Those who ordered the new MacBook Pro look strikingly similar to the early adopters who bought the Apple Watch on release,” they say. Touch Bar’s magic touch Interest in the new Macs appears to be driven by the introduction of the new Touch Bar, which is attracting attention among early adopters who are keen to put it through its paces. The Touch Bar replaces the function keys with an OLED MultiTouch glass bar. The bar displays contextual keyboard commands, sliders and other control graphics in response to which application you are in and what you are doing within that application. You may find quick and easy access to image editing tools in Photos or deeply nested commands when working on a Word document, for example. Thomas Grove Carter, a professional video editor who uses Final Cut Pro X at London’s Trim Editing writes: “The more I’ve used [the Touch Bar] the more I’ve replaced certain keyboard shortcuts. Why would I use dual-hand/multi-finger shortcuts if the button was there in front of me? And it’s contextual. It changes depending on what I’m doing. I’m editing picture; it shows me relevant trimming shortcuts. I’m editing titles; it shows me font, formatting and color options.” Love or loathe? Will you like it? There are some who argue that the Touch Bar reflects that many developers insist on hiding controls and options from view, but this has always been the case on every platform. What the Touch Bar enables users to do is to gain an almost instant grasp of how to get things done in almost any application, as commands that may have been harder to find are rendered far more obvious through the contextual device. This means every Mac user should be able to be more productive in any app, thanks to the contextual guide provided by the device. What next? While Apple claims it still remains committed to desktop Macs, it has been over 1,000 days since the company upgraded the Mac Pro. This has generated much concern among Mac users. Given the company’s apparent plan to introduce AR experiences it is worth noting that existing VR systems, such as the HTC Vive demand a lot of computational power. Is it possible future Mac desktops have been delayed as part of the company’s AR deployment plan? I don’t know, but I can easily imagine contextual user interfaces such as the Touch Bar will be very important components of future AR interfaces, as the introduction of contextual computing experiences will need to be matched by depth within the control systems for those experiences. This makes it likely we’ll see external Touch Bar devices for some Macs, I guess. Try it today We don’t have such peripherals yet, but Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek have created an app that creates a kind of virtual onscreen Touch Bar on any Mac. You can download the software at Github. It’s not perfect and installation is a little troublesome, but it does provide a nice insight into what Touch Bar does. In future all user interfaces may be this way. Google+?

The uptick in delayed reporting contributed to almost 3,000 publicly data breaches this year alone -- exposing more than 2.2 billion records. And the year isn't even over yet. Even as we approach December 31, there's no sign of it ending. Let's take a look back at some of the biggest -- and most dangerous -- hacks and leaks so far. THIS YEAR IN HACKS MySpace hack puts another 427 million passwords up for sale A hacker claims to be selling millions of Twitter accounts One of the biggest hacks happened last year, but nobody noticed 171 million VK.com accounts stolen by hackers Hacker puts 51 million file sharing accounts for sale on dark web Ubuntu Forums hack exposes 2 million users Oracle investigating data breach at Micros point-of-sale division Epic's forums hacked again, with thousands of logins stolen Millions of Steam game keys stolen after hacker breaches gaming site Hackers stole 43 million Last.fm account details in 2012 breach Published: November 15, 2016 -- 15:40 GMT (07:40 PST) Photo by: file photo Caption by: Zack Whittaker FBI hacked terrorist's iPhone 5c Should Apple help the FBI unlock a terrorist's phone? Apple said yes, but not at the expense of everyone else's security and privacy. The FBI brought a case against Apple to compel it to help its agents break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, who killed 14 people and injured dozens in the terrorist attack in December. Apple refused to help the feds "backdoor" its own product, arguing that it can't crack the encryption, and lodged a formal appeal. The FBI eventually buckled under public pressure, but not before hiring hackers to break into the phone at the last minute. It set in motion a chain reaction of proposed laws and measures to try to ensure that Apple could never be above the law.

That in part made it the target by one hacker, who inserted a backdoor in the operating system and hacked the project's website to trick users into downloading the malicious version. Hundreds of users downloaded the affected build. The hacker, who goes by the name of Peace (who was instrumental in other hacks) explained how he did it.

After learning how the system worked, the cyberattackers took the bank's SWIFT code and made a series of transaction requests for cash to be sent from the country's New York-based account to entities across Asia. It was shoddy security at its worst, but lessons were eventually learned.

The alleged billionaire's hotel chain was attacked twice in as many years -- including once in April. It's not all surprising given that his organization was using horribly insecure and unpatched systems that dated back more than a decade. Then, Trump's presidential campaign leaked the resumes of prospective interns, including their names, addresses, and in some cases sensitive employment details. Let's hope his cybersecurity strategy is better when he's in office.

LinkedIn was the first of many hack records that was met (and later surpassed) this year. The business networking company was first hit in 2012, but the scale of the attack was only realized this year when the number of records stolen shot up by almost twenty-fold to 117 million accounts. If that wasn't bad enough, most of the passwords were ridiculously bad -- like "123456" and "linkedin." The alleged hacker was eventually caught in the Czech Republic.

It took investigative journalists to discover that more than 65 million accounts were in the dumped database. Tumblr is owned by Yahoo, which later in the year had its own problems to worry about.

But until recently, not many had heard of Myspace in some time. Sadly, for many, it was bad news. A massive hack led 427 million accounts stolen early in the year. The company, now owned by Time Inc., had at the time of the breach, just 50 million visitors per month -- a significant drop from its heyday, but nevertheless a reminder that security can come back to haunt.

US chief spy James Clapper said that the intelligence community believed that "based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized" hacking activities, such as email leaks on the Democratic campaign. Senior Democrats eventually resigned, and Hillary Clinton's email campaign suffered irreparably -- as the election result proved.

Social networking giant VK.com was hit in June with 171 million accounts stolen, then month later its parent company Mail.ru's forums were bitten by a similarly historical hack. Then, Rambler.ru, a separate company but major internet giant, saw almost 100 million accounts taken in a hack that dated back to 2012. Those hacks combined account for double the population of Russia alone.

These tools, which could break through Fortinet and Cisco firewalls, were later auctioned off by the Shadow Brokers, an unknown seller of the exploits. Thanks to a previous leak of Snowden files, reporters confirmed the exploits belonged to the US government.

Oracle said that the hackers responsible for the breach installed malware on the support portal in an effort to scrape usernames and passwords as they were entered. Those account credentials may be used to remotely administer and access point-of-sale devices located in customers' retail outlets. Oracle bought the company in 2014 for $5.3 billion.

They store our passwords, bookmarks, and even our browsing history. When Opera's synchronization server got hacked, all that faith and trust fell apart. The browser maker, with close to 2 million active users affected by the hack, reset user passwords but was overwhelmingly opaque about the breach, leading to many unhappy customers.

Harold Martin, a former staffer, stole 50 terabytes of data from the agency, most of it classified. The breach vastly eclipsed what Edward Snowden stole -- thought to be a little over 50,000 files. Though Wilson was initially charged with mishandling classified information, the scale of his theft bumped the charges up to espionage. How did he get all that data through the NSA? By simply walking out the door, sources said.

Yahoo went even bigger with over 500 million accounts compromised. It couldn't have come at a worse time as Verizon was bidding for the company's assets. Yahoo said a state was behind it, but that was quickly dismissed. An investigation into the breach is ongoing.

 Next year's iPhone is going to have an even bigger screen Kif Leswing Nov. 11, 2016, 9:24 AM 11,693 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/ConceptsiPhone Apple is preparing iPhones with bigger screens for a launch next year.  Although the iPhone 8 design isn't final yet, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn provided some new details about Apple's next iPhone in a note distributed to clients on Friday. The analysts are citing supply chain sources spoken to during a trip to Asia.  "iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope. The IP8 moves to 5" (from 4.7") and the Plus moves to 5.8" (from 5.5")," the analysts write. The mentions of 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones lines up with previous reports from Nikkei and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  The phones may stay the same size while the screens get bigger, thanks to less space around the screen."We believe Apple is looking to increase the screen sizes with zero bezel such that they will still fit in the same size" casings, the Barclays analysts wrote.  "Maybe the low-end moves to 4.7" [screen] with the new larger sizes coming," they continued.  Only the Plus model will have an OLED screen, a newer type of display technology with better color and deeper blacks, the analysts wrote. Most of the OLEDs will come from Samsung and LG, according to the report.  That's because of supply issues, they say, and the industry expects Foxconn's subsidiary Sharp to get its factories up and running in 2018. "By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge," the analysts wrote. The report also suggests that Apple's Force Touch feature may change to a "film-based solution" from the current "flexible PCB" technology that the iPhone 7 uses.  The analysts also had some new iPad predictions based on their trip to Asia. We're expecting Apple's iPhone 8 to be a major redesign to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Barclays' predictions line up with what we've been hearing. The iPhone 8, or iPhone 10, depending on what Apple decides to call it, could have glass casing, wireless charging, and other new features.  SEE ALSO: A top Foxconn exec talked about the iPhone 8 in a public speech SEE ALSO: Expect new iPads in March with 'borderless' screens NOW WATCH: Here's how Donald Trump can function on barely any sleep — and why you shouldn't copy him Loading video...

(Photo: Raya Hristova, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Q: All the news about hacking has started to freak me out. Did the hackers use a sophisticated attack to go after John Podesta’s email? A: No, they did not. These hackers used one of the oldest tricks in the book. Podesta allegedly received an email from Google that alerted him, “Someone has your password.” It was a classic phishing email that enticed him to hand over his new password to the hackers at a bogus site. Emails published by Wikileaks appear to show Podesta was not using two-factor authentication, a security feature available on several platforms including Google and Facebook. Click here for more about the hacking and the steps you should take now, so you don’t become a victim. Q: I have two pre-teens and just purchased an Apple TV. I’m new to this kind of viewing. Is there a way to censor what they watch? A: Yes, you can adjust the settings so that your children aren’t exposed to mature content based on film or age ratings. With Apple TV, it’s simple to set up. From the main menu, go to Settings > General > Restrictions. The system will ask you for a four-digit passcode so that your kids can’t switch it off without you knowing. It’s just as easy to turn off the restrictions when the youngsters are in bed and you have a hankering for Game of Thrones. Many people don’t know that with the right apps, you can turn your TV into a classic art display or earth viewing station. It’s very cool! Click here for three apps that you’ll love on your Apple TV. Q: I finally finished my novel, and I want to test it out as an ebook. I’m thinking of putting it on Kindle, but I’m not sure if it’s a good deal. Any suggestions? A: Many authors are publishing ebooks because they’re economical and easy to distribute. You can often reach a global audience within 24 hours. KDP is Amazon’s ebook self-publishing service, and it’s very powerful. As always, make sure to read the contract carefully, but the deal is pretty good: You can publish through Kindle exclusively and earn up to 70% royalties, or you can publish through Kindle and other services, like Apple’s iBooks, and earn up to 30% royalties. Of course, there is much more to know. Click here for a step-by-step guide to publishing your ebook and making money at it. Q: I love my iPhone, but my husband loves Android. I am in the market for a new car but I only want a car with Apple CarPlay. Who manufactures cars that have Apple CarPlay? A: Apple CarPlay automatically syncs a car with an iPhone. It lets you use certain apps through an in-dash display, rather than on the phone itself. In fact, the system syncs up to the designated phone without having to remove it from your purse or pocket. You can get directions, make phone calls, send and receive messages, and listen to music. Apple CarPlay is included in a slew of cars from Acura to Volvo. Click here for a complete list of cars with Apple CarPlay for you and Android Auto for your husband. Q: I am a tattoo artist. I saw the Facebook Live videos of your show. I would like to show on Facebook live videos of my work. How do I get started? A: Live-streaming is the new way to express yourself and show the world what’s going on in your life. Using a smartphone or tablet, your circle of friends, family, customers, business associates or fans see you in live video and audio over the internet. Open the Facebook app on your smartphone or tablet. Go to your profile and open up the status bar. You’ll see the “What’s on my mind?” prompt and towards the bottom, select “Live Video.” From there, it’s a series of steps that I have written up in detail.

While the initial delivery window for early buyers ranged from November 17 to November 25, we're now seeing reports that Apple is preparing some units for delivery as early as November 11. DON'T MISS: Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals That being the case, we can expect some early adopters to start receiving Apple's revamped MacBook Pro as early as this weekend with many more deliveries expected to arrive on doorsteps before November 17. Over the last few weeks, Apple's new MacBook Pro has been absolutely eviscerated from developers and professionals. From complaints about the device's USB C ports and lack of an SD Card reader to complaints about a 16GB RAM limit and less than impressive internals, one would be forgiven for thinking that Apple's next-gen notebook was destined to be a flop. The reality, though, is that most Mac users appear to be excited for Apple's new Touch Bar MacBook Pro. To this point, Apple's Phil Schiller said earlier this month that Apple has seen "more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before." “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it," Schiller added. On a related note, early figures from Slice Intelligence suggest that the new MacBook Pro is selling like hotcakes. We'll of course no more once Apple releases its earnings report in January, but for now it would appear that the Mac is not only far from dead, but may be thriving.

Nov 11, 2016, 08:45 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Network-1 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NTIP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Network-1 had the largest quarterly revenues in its history with revenue of $34,326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with revenue of $3,008,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $31,318,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements entered into with Apple Inc. and Dell, Inc. during the quarter.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents decreased $232,000 or 14% from $1,658,000 to $1,426,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 had revenue of $59,963,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenue of $10,382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $49,581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements  with Apple Inc., and Dell, Inc. as well as a $17,500,000 settlement of a professional liability claim.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents increased $70,000 or 1% from $8,593,000 to $8,663,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 reported net income of $10,832,000 or $0.46 per share (basic) and $0.43 per share (diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net income of $407,000 or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Network-1 reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $22,882,000 or $0.98 per share (basic) and $0.93 per share (diluted) as compared with net income of $1,717,000 or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  At September 30, 2016, Network-1 had cash and cash equivalents of $57,759,000 and working capital of $50,179,000.  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Network-1 entered into settlement and license agreements aggregating $5,000,000, a portion of which will be recorded as revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Network-1 incurred current Federal, state and local income taxes of $3,817,000 and $26,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase of $3,791,000 in such taxes was related to Network-1's full utilization of NOLs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with significant net income.  In September 2011, Network-1 initiated patent litigation against sixteen (16) data networking equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of its Remote Power Patent. Network-1 has now reached settlement and license agreements with twelve (12) of the original defendants.  The remaining four defendants in the lawsuit are Avaya Inc., AXIS Communications Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and Juniper Networks, Inc. Network-1 seeks monetary damages based upon reasonable royalties.  The litigation is currently scheduled for trial in 2017. The Remote Power Patent relates to, among other things, delivering power over Ethernet cables to remotely power network connected devices including, among others, wireless access points, VoIP telephones and network cameras.  In June 2003, the IEEE approved the 802.3af PoE Standard, which led to the rapid adoption of PoE.  The IEEE also approved the 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE Plus) Standard, which increased the maximum power delivered to network devices to 40-60 watts from the current 15 watts under the 802.3af Standard. Network-1 currently has twenty-five (25) license agreements with respect to its Remote Power Patent, which include, among others, license agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Dell, Inc., Netgear Inc., Alcatel-Lucent USA, Sony Corporation, Shoretel Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and several other data networking vendors. On April 4, 2014 and December 3, 2014, Network-1 initiated litigation against Google Inc. and YouTube, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of several of its patents which relate to the identification of media content on the Internet.  The lawsuits allege that Google and YouTube have infringed and continue to infringe certain of the Company's patents by making, using, selling and offering to sell unlicensed systems and related products and services, which include YouTube's Content ID system.  In December 2014, Google Inc. filed four petitions to institute Inter Partes Review (the "IPRs") at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") pertaining to patents asserted in the litigation. In each of the four IPRs Google sought to invalidate certain claims of the patents at issue within the Cox Patent Portfolio. On June 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in the four pending IPRs finding eighty-six (86) claims "not unpatentable" (valid) and, in total, one hundred and nineteen (119) out of one hundred and twenty-nine (129) or 92% of the challenged claims of the patents have survived Google's challenges in the IPRs.  None of the claims of the patents being asserted in the pending litigations against Google and YouTube were found invalid. On August 18, 2016, Google filed Notices of Appeal to appeal the Final Written Decisions on the IPRs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2015, Google filed a Petition for Covered Business Method Review (CBM) at the PTAB seeking to invalidate claims pertaining to Network-1's U.S. Patent No. 8,904,464, the patent asserted in the Company's litigation against Google and YouTube filed on December 3, 2014 as referenced above.  On October 19, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting the Covered Business Method Review on certain grounds. The oral hearing took place on May 11, 2016.  On October 18, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in favor of Network-1 with respect to the CBM and ruled that Google had failed to show that any of the thirty-four (34) claims of the Company's patent at issue were unpatentable. ABOUT NETWORK-1 TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Network-1 Technologies, Inc. is engaged in the development, licensing and protection of its intellectual property and proprietary technologies.  Network-1 works with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of their patented technologies. Network-1 currently owns twenty-eight (28) patents covering various telecommunications and data networking technologies as well as technologies relating to document stream operating systems and the identification of media content. Network-1's current strategy includes continuing to pursue licensing opportunities for its Remote Power Patent and its efforts to monetize two patent portfolios (the Cox and Mirror Worlds patent portfolios) acquired by Network-1 in 2013.  Network-1's acquisition strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as Network-1 has achieved with respect to its Remote Power Patent.  Network-1's Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue in excess of $100,000,000 from May 2007 through September 30, 2016.  As a result of the acquisition of its Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio in May 2013, Network-1 achieved licensing and other revenue of $47,150,000 through September 30, 2016 with respect to its Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:21AM With the market near all-time highs, it can be tough to find "cheap" tech stocks worth starting new positions in. However, three well-known tech stocks -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- all still trade at steep discounts to the S&P 500's P/E of 23 and their industry averages. Let's take a look at why investors don't seem interested in these three tech giants, and why they could be great long-term plays at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. IBM IBM currently trades at 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the average P/E of 21 for the IT services industry. IBM's 13% gain has outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain this year, but that rally was likely fueled by its 3.7% forward yield in a low interest rate environment instead of any notable strengths in its business. IBM has hiked its dividend, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 44%, for 16 consecutive years. Big Blue's main problem is its lack of revenue growth. Its quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters due to rising competition and sluggish enterprise demand for its aging IT services, software, and hardware. IBM's core strategy is to offset those declines with its higher-growth "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobility, social, and security) businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually to $8 billion last quarter, and accounted for 40% of IBM's trailing-12-month revenue. Unfortunately, that growth didn't fully offset the weakness of its other businesses, which caused its total revenue to dip 0.4% annually. Looking ahead, IBM's painful shift away from older products toward higher-growth ones should eventually pay off. Analysts still expect IBM's revenues to fall through 2017, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and a shift toward higher-margin services -- should improve 3.5% next year. It's a long road back for IBM, but its low multiple and high dividend should set a floor under the stock. Baidu Baidu, China's largest search engine, trades at just 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. Shares of Baidu have slumped 9% this year due to concerns about its spending and new regulations for its ads. To remain competitive in the rapidly evolving Chinese internet market, Baidu has been adding O2O (online-to-offline) features -- like mobile payments, ride hailing, ticket bookings, and restaurant reservations -- to its core app. These investments are expected to cause its earnings to decline 12% this year. Baidu's top line has been weighed down by more strict regulations regarding ads for healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. The sale of its stake in online travel agency Qunar to Ctrip further distorted year-over-year comparisons. As a result,  Baidu's revenue is expected to rise just 6% this year, compared to 35% growth in 2015. But looking further ahead to 2017, Baidu is expected to post 21% sales growth and 33% earnings growth as its O2O investments start paying off. Apple Despite being the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple trades at just 13 times trailing earnings -- a discount to the industry average of 17 for electronic equipment makers. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500, with a 5% gain this year, mainly due to ongoing concerns about sales of the iPhone, which generated 60% of the company sales last quarter. Image source: Apple. Shipments of iPhones, iPads, and Macs all fell annually last quarter, causing Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Apple's response has been to diversify its hardware business with the Apple Watch, and its services business with Apple Music, Apple Pay, and other software platforms. But these businesses still only generate a small portion of the tech giant's overall revenues. But looking ahead, Apple still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends to keep investors interested. New acquisitions could reduce the weight of its hardware business and give Apple new pillars of growth. Buybacks could boost its earnings growth, and its forward yield of 2% (supported by a low payout ratio of 26%) could easily be doubled to attract income investors. It's tough to see what comes next for Apple, but I certainly wouldn't bet against the tech giant's long-term prospects. Patience pays off... Investors should remember that stocks generally have low P/Es because investors aren't eager to buy them. However, investing in companies with sound long-term growth prospects while their stocks are at low multiples could pay off over the long run. There's no guarantee that investors will suddenly fall in love with IBM, Baidu, or Apple again, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks at their current prices.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The search giant removed the feature from the final release of Nougat after giving an early glimpse in a developer preview for Nexus devices as the feature was not completely ready. Now, the 'Night Mode' will reportedly be making its way back to Nexus devices in the upcoming Nougat 7.1 update. After the feature was removed from the final build of Nougat, a thread named "Bring Back Night Mode" was posted on company's issue tracker. Now, the search giant has changed its status to 'Future Release', as pointed out by Phandroid. This indicates that the night mode is likely to come back in a future release, possibly the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat update. Of course users might have to wait for longer if the company decides to push out the feature with a future update.The 'Night Mode' essentially adjusts the screen colour temperature in order to prevent excessive strain on user's eyes. There have always been apps that can help users adjust the screen colour temperature, such as f.lux, but system-level integration makes this feature extremely useful. Regarding the removal of night mode features in the Android N, a team of Google Engineers had earlier revealed that both dark theme and screen tinting had to be abandoned for similar reasons. The team claimed that both these were not going to be ready by the time Android N was launched publicly. Further, the team said that it did not want to leave a "half-working" feature in the platform. The team pointed out that the implementation on an ecosystem-wide scale was difficult, and work on the features was not judged to be a sound allocation of resources.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple improves shipping delivery estimates for some Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro buyers, changes status to “now shipping” in certain cases Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, November 11th, 2016, 05:53 Category: MacBook Pro, News, retail, Touch Bar Tweet The first of the Touch Bar-equpped MacBook Pro units look as if they’re about to ship on Friday, November 11th. A number of users have reported that Apple has started changing the status of several preorders from “processing” to “preparing for shipment”, which typically happens in the days before it ships and delivers orders to customers. Reports from the first preorder customers estimated a ship date of November 11th, while others were quickly notified that their orders had been pushed back 2-3 weeks to 4-5 weeks after the units became available via the Apple online storefront. That means that the first MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models could arrive in customers’ hands as soon as this week in markets where next-day and weekend delivery are available, and for some possibly earlier than originally expected. Users can log into their account on apple.com or through the Apple Store app to view their current order status. Earlier this week we noted that Apple had started charging credit cards for some MacBook Pro orders, signalling that the company will soon begin shipping the device to customers.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: AirPods may arrive come mid-November Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, November 11th, 2016, 05:30 Category: AirPods, Hardware, Hardware, retail, Rumor Tweet Back in late October, Apple delayed the launch of its much-anticipated AirPods, the company stating that it needed “a little more time” before the units were ready for prime time. Since then, the headphones have been listed as “currently unavailable” on Apple’s web site. Previous rumors had the AirPods as arriving in January 2017, suggesting they will not be available in time for this year’s holiday shopping season. Perhaps more optimistically, an employee at Apple reseller Conrad has reportedly told a customer it will receive AirPods stock on November 17, and make them available to purchase by November 18-19. Here’s the quote as it stands: Hello, I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today. According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19. Conrad’s website has the AirPods as becoming available for delivery in 7 to 8 weeks, so this rumor could be correct, albeit there remains some doubt to contend with. It’s a rumor, take it or leave it, but it could portend the AirPods you’ve been hankering for being available that much sooner.

Now that it's an increasing norm, the Mate 9 finds itself the focus of greater attention than its predecessors - and for good reason. After all, the big phone market is in something of a spin: Samsung has crashed out with the Note 7, leaving Apple and Google to cruise along with the respective iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL phones. Both of which are just about as expensive as phones get, priced from £719 a piece. As long-time Mate fans - we used the Mate 8 for months - we had waited with baited breath to see what the Mate 9's play would be. But unlike its predecessors, it's not gone in with a low-blow price point to send the competition scuppering. Instead this €699 handset has nipped and tucked the screen into a 5.9-inch form (but stuck with just a 1080p resolution), ramped up its interior specification, and comes with a dual camera arrangement too. With the price gap shrinking between the big-screen options, however, and Huawei's latest EMUI 5.0 software rolling out with some overzealous app permissions handling, does it have the big features to stand apart from the competition? How big is the Mate 9 design? 5.9-inch 1920 x 1080 resolution display 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9mm metal body, 190g Available in white or silver (black front) in UK At first glance the Mate 9 looks a whole lot like its Mate 8 predecessor from the front. The screen is 5.9-inches across diagonally (rather than the 6-inch of the Mate 8), which means the dimensions are the tiniest bit reduced - but only by a millimetre, so you really won't notice that in the hand. Huawei Mate 9 vs Huawei Mate 8: What's the difference? It's only really when flipping the phone over to reveal its new dual camera make-up that the biggest differences can be seen, though. The new twin cameras - one sensor 12MP colour, the other a 20MP Leica-sourced black and white - are stacked vertically in a single protruding, optically-stabilised unit (so are different to the existing P9 model), with flash and laser autofocus positioned alongside. So the Mate 9 is, in essence, a Mate 8S. Which is fine in one sense, because the full metal body with chamfered edges is well made. But in another sense it's not so fine, because Huawei did something very strange at the Mate 9's global launch: it showed off a special-edition Porsche Design model before its new champion. Which has a 5.5-inch screen, curved edges and, despite its huge €1,395 price tag, looks and feels a lot better than the Mate 9 (and a whole lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, too). Huawei Mate 9 vs Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design: What's the difference? Perhaps the Porsche Design model will be the footing for the Mate's future - or even a different Huawei series. We just don't know. And, right now, we have to ignore that device because the larger pocket-poker Mate 9 is the phone that's been living in our hands and alongside our leg for a whole seven days. How does the Mate 9 perform? Kirin 960 chipset, octa-core (4x 2.4GHz, 4x1.8GHz) Mali G71 MP8 GPU, Vulkan API 4GB RAM, 64GB on-board storage (plus microSD) The Mate 9 does quick-strike with many points of merit. It's got 64GB on-board storage as standard. There's dual-SIM capability, or the second slot can be used for a microSD card to further expand that storage. It's got a great fingerprint scanner that's well positioned on the rear, too, and works as well as - if not better than - the near competition. And it's got up to Cat 12 4G capabilities meaning multiple bands for speedy wireless connectivity. Pocket-lint Now draw breath. But the biggest thing is the boost to its internal processing and graphical power. As the first device on the market to use the HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, with ARM-sourced cores, it's said to be 180 per cent more CPU capable than the earlier Mate 8. You wouldn't think it just looking at the numbers compared ot the 950, but the 960 is nippy. From our point of view, though, it's the latest Mali G71 graphics that really sets the Mate 9 apart from other Huawei phones. Frequently we've bemoaned how games might have the occasional stutter or take a bit too long to load. With this ramped-up GPU on board the Mate 9 hasn't had any such troubles when running titles. From Plants vs Zombies 2, to Candy Crush and beyond. And while those might not sound like the most tasking of gaming apps, plenty of devices will stutter animations between completed levels, or when graphics slide in across the whole screen. Not so the Mate 9. Pocket-lint Which beds the device down well to take-on some of its pricier competition. The one that Huawei really has in its sights is the iPhone 7 Plus. Technically the Mate 9's GPU isn't as proficient as Apple's (even Huawei said this on stage at the Kirin launch in Shanghai), but the company claims the way it interacts with memory and storage makes it faster in almost all cases. We'll hand it to the company: the Mate 9 feels good in use and is consistently quick. What is the Mate 9's software like? Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.0 skin App twin for dual WhatsApp / Messenger Knock Knock knuckle-based commands There's always the "oh, by the way" software point to be made with Huawei though. The Mate 9 comes with Android 7.0 Nougat from launch, with the company's EMUI 5.0 re-skin over the top. By and large it looks and feels like a normal Android operating system, but with some tweaks that serve in both positive and negative ways. Let's preface by saying that, despite the phone telling us it's running EMUI 5.0, that by public release this may be version 5.0.1 or something to fix some of the smaller issues that we've spotted. And there are enough of them, some of which are just scruffy: notifications show as an accumulative number to the top-left corner rather than icons, for example; the battery percentage and 24-hour clock indicators are in different fonts in the default theme. C'mon, details matter. With such a big screen, Huawei has also implemented a system to avoid accidental touches doing things you don't want, such as firing the shutter in camera, for example. We've still managed to shoot pics by accident though. When we've seen it most come into play is when one-handed holding the device and trying to type - the letter "p" tends to stick, not completing the ongoing word when using SwiftKey, for example. The sentiment makes sense, but in practice it's just a minor hindrance. Then there's so-called Knock Knock, which is Huawei's knuckle-based control mechanism to make, say, screen grabs and audio recordings, or write on-screen letters with your knuckle to quick-launch an app. At first sight, back in the (then-called Ascend) P7 era, this tech was terrible. It's come a long way and now, if you remember to use it, it's quite practical. You can switch it on or off if it's too much to manage too. On the positive side, EMUI 5.0 bakes in an App Twin feature that means typically device-locked applications - Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp for UK audiences - can be duplicated, one per SIM. So if you have a business account and a private account both can run simultaneously. It works well. And it's easy to switch off the second SIM if you don't want that part of your life/business active at a given time. There are some additional apps that will thrown themselves into the mix too: Huawei Health, which can track steps and fitness activities to help you achieve goals; HiCare which is a contact service with Huawei if you encounter device issues; HiGame, which, similar to Samsung's implementation, is a pointless secondary receptacle for gaming apps; and Todolist which, like the name says, is a to-do list. How long does the Mate 9's battery last? 4,000mAh battery USB-C charging Average 16-hours life per charge A trait of EMUI software is that it's really critical of battery life. And here's where the software, once again, goes a bit overboard. The app permissions are incredibly demanding by default, limiting all manner of alerts and notifications that you might want active. Pop-up high-level battery use notifications are also commonplace (which happen per application), with repeat dismisses not baking into the phone's memory that you might actually want to see this app each and every time. You can go into permissions manually and make adjustments for individual apps about what they can and can't do - from drawing over other apps, through to closing down when the lock screen is activated - so in that sense there's good granular control, but it's not particularly consumer friendly. Now, the earlier Mate 8's battery life was astoundingly good. The Mate 9 shares the same 4,000mAh cell, but, for a variety of reasons, we've not been getting quite as long a life from it. It'll easily serve a long day, though, we just wouldn't call it a two-dayer. On average, we've been returning around 16-hours of use, which is good going. Examples have differed, such as an office day when out and about - serving 13-hours of mixed use, with two long periods of screen off time. Over a weekend we saw around 21-hours of use from a single charge, with less work-related tasks easing off consumption. One point is that the latest EMUI 5.0 software is brighter, lighter, whiter. It might sound like a toothpaste ad, by ditching the complex colours and themes of earlier software to run with more bright whites, the screen is working harder more often. NFC also seems to be highly impactful on battery life. The new Kirin processor is likely to be more taxing too - it's certainly run hot from time to time. And, of course, dual SIM use will also have an impact - although we haven't used two SIM cards for the duration of this review at all, because we don't run two in everyday life. The Mate 9 isn't going to explode too, right? 4.5V 5A SuperCharge fast-charging Dynamic current adjustment based on source Fortunately fast-charging - which Huawei calls SuperCharge - is on board the Mate 9. By lowering the voltage (to around 4.5V) and upping the current (to 5A) the battery can be charged in double-quick time - some 50 per cent quicker than the Mate 8 - meaning just 30-minutes at the plug could see the Mate 9 have almost 60 per cent charge. Pocket-lint A potential problem here is safety given the increased voltage. We've all heard about Samsung Note 7 phones overheating and exploding into balls of fire. Huawei has put in a dynamic charging mechanism, meaning the Mate 9 can adapt to the source charger and cable used as required - so a shoddy third-party charger will make the phone dynamically lower the current (and slow down charging in the process, but that's fine). A five-gate protection system also checks different points throughout the phone to ensure it's not overheating. That's not to say the phone won't get hot, though, because it can. One of the potential issues with the SuperCharge system is that higher voltage recharging systems are more likely to run down the battery's longevity. Although Huawei denies this will be the case with the battery, it also confirmed the underlying source battery is the same as that in the last-generation Mate 8. Sounds like something is amiss here for all that to add up. But we won't know until after many months of use. Huawei Mate 9 review: What's this born to last stuff about? Intelligent algorithm to improve device longevity Prioritises your favourite apps, based on use One of Huawei's big claims about that Mate 9 is that it is born fast and will remain fast. We've only had the phone for a week, so how true that will be we can't really say. Pocket-lint But here's the background on what the company has done. The new Kirin chipset has been designed to function with a new intelligent algorithm to learn your usage over time and prioritise the importance of apps and avoid slowdown. Before launch Huawei was calling this a very Apple-sounding "iAware" - a name that, unsurprisingly, has vanished from the official product release. This technology is designed to get better over time for an improved life experience that doesn't slow down after a matter of months. Its trio of target areas - smart memory allocation, CPU allocation and storage optimisation - are the basis for its operation. The algorithm, which implements storage defragmentation, doesn't appear to exacerbate any of the pop-up notifications compared to earlier EMUI software. The only way to know for sure that it works is to fast-forward a year into the future or something. Why does the Mate 9 have two cameras? What can dual cameras do? Twin 27mm f/2.2 equivalent rear cameras 12MP colour and 20MP monochrome sensors Optical image stabilisation 4K video (H.265 compression) When Huawei launched the P9 smartphone its headline feature was a dual camera setup - one colour, one monochrome - with a Leica partnership. That relationship continues with the Mate 9, but the arrangement is slightly different. Pocket-lint The two sensors in the Mate 9 are different resolutions: the 12-megapixel full colour one is paired with a higher-resolution 20-megapixel monochrome module. Both peer through 27mm equivalent, f/2.2 aperture lenses, and both offer optical image stabilisation - hence the rear bump on the handset (which is kind of ironic, given how enthused Huawei CEO, Richard Yu, was when unveiling the "no bump" P9). The Leica-partnered software is slightly updated compared to the P9, with a pinch-to-zoom feature that can digitally zoom into the frame. This is Huawei wanting to chase down the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, but without utilising two different lens focal lengths we're not convinced it's a particularly giant leap forward compared to the P9. It does offer a quirky feature though: the 20MP black and white image details can even be utilised by the colour camera to enhance the overall detail in the frame to deliver 20MP colour images. They're still way bigger than you'll need from a phone, though. Pocket-lint Whether you care about a dedicated monochrome sensor or not will come down to your way of thinking. We think proper black and white is fun but not essential, really. We have got some good results out of it. The same can be said for the colour camera. Huawei wants to play with the big boys and this effort - while not the very best out there; the camera app is slower to load than the Google Pixel - is knocking on the door of the best flagships, for sure. Focus is snappy and image processing is well handled. Low-light images don't go overboard with image noise, which is great news, while auto high dynamic range works well. If you want full control - in either colour or mono options - then a swipe up will unveil all the settings you could want. Pocket-lint But while the main camera elements are all good, we find some of the dual camera abilities just gimmicky. The ability to apply a fake bokeh down to f/0.95 in post is often overbearing and just looks plain weird. We get that the cameras can map depth and offset these measurements for relatively convincing results - something Apple, HTC and others have played with (all unsuccessfully) - but it doesn't mean that you necessarily should. Use it subtly, for the right shot, and the fake depth-of-field effect can work. We're just not big fans. How we feel about Mate 9's the cameras largely reflects how we felt about the P9: we think the monochrome sensor is fun, but a rare feature of genuine use; the core camera is handled really well, with point-and-shoot, manual options and even 4K video capture all ticking the boxes; and the post-processing options can sometimes work against what this flagship does so well at a core level. Verdict What might come as a surprise about the Mate 9 is just how much it's like the Mate 8 - and we were expecting bigger changes. It's a big slice of phone and sticks with a not-flagship Full HD resolution screen (1920 x 1080), this time in a 5.9-inch panel. That's good enough, but the also-announced Porsche Design version of the Mate 9 overshadows its standard sibling. With a 5.5-inch screen size and Quad HD resolution (2160 x 1440) it's an entirely different and entirely distracting beauty. Like the Mate flagship we really wanted. Where the Mate 9 clearly differs from its Mate 8 predecessor is with its performance. The latest Kirin 960 processor and GPU runs applications smooth as butter. Battery performance from that 4,000mAh cell is strong for a guaranteed all-day experience and SuperCharge fast-charging is great. But that comes at the expense of the latest EMUI 5.0 software, which can being annoyingly persistent in its strict permissions, excess notifications and alt-Android ways. The Mate 9 also sees a price jump, which at €699 is now knocking on the door of its Apple and Google competitors. It undercuts them slightly, plus delivers headline features such as a decent dual camera. But with that price gap now closing, the Porsche Design model casting a shadow of sorts, and few points of distinction to really set the Mate 9 apart, Huawei is largely banking on Samsung's explosive exit from this market to succeed.

We noted in the report that Japan Display was Apple's leading display supplier. When Apple notified all of the display suppliers that they were switching to OLED, it caught Japan Display off guard. They had committed to new LCD equipment to keep up with Apple's demands and now they were unable to secure new equipment and the Japanese government who was supporting them was was considering to divest because they were too dependent on Apple. A week later we reported on the rumor that Foxconn's Sharp wanted to tag-team with Japan Display in order to become a major Apple OLED supplier in quick order. With the situation becoming dire, the Japanese government is reconsidering a bailout for Japan Display.   It's being reported today by the Wall Street Journal that Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma said Wednesday that the INCJ 'is considering financial support to help us grow,' again. INCJ is the Japanese government-backed fund known as 'Innovation Network Corp. of Japan (INCJ).'   Japan Display is projecting a small operating profit for their full fiscal year which ends in March due to Apple's iPhone 7 orders.   Japan Display wants to invest in OLED for the medium to long term while continuing to improve their LCD technology in the hopes of being able to compete against OLED in different markets.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

One customer who spoke to an employee at Conrad – an Apple reseller in Germany –  was told the headphones will be ready to launch next Friday, November 18. The source told German site Apfelpage.de, “I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today [sic]. “According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19.” Not long now We’ve asked Apple to confirm the release of the AirPods, but the company declined to comment. There’s no guarantee the customer or the supplier is right, but it would make sense as it would be three weeks after the original delay, and a Friday – Apple regularly releases its products on a Friday, so that detail would check out. The reason for the delay isn't currently clear, but Apple did state when the AirPods launched it would only release the headphones when ready for public use.

But the unprecedented win of Republican candidate Donald Trump after such a tumultuous campaign has now prompted Cook to address his employees and the entire company in an effort to unite the people. How To Conduct Business After 2016 U.S. Elections Cook wrote in an email to employees in U.S. and addressed how Apple will conduct business after the result of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections has surfaced. In his staff-wide letter, he quoted Dr. Marthin Luther King, Jr. as he expressed empathy for workers who have been crestfallen by the outcome of the Presidential Race recently. He wrote that the company has a very diverse group of workers including supporters of the candidates on both parties. "Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together," he said. There is no denying the fact that the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race and campaign period was ridden with conflict, so Tim Cook went on to shed light on to his employees that Apple is a profit-seeking company, which must continue trade as usual. "I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: 'If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward,'" he added. Apple And Donald Trump Apple's relationship with Donald Trump has been a frigid one, so far. Trump even publicly called to boycott Apple products because of the company's refusal to develop a GovOS version atop iOS to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) following its denial to crack open an iPhone owned by a terrorist responsible for the San Bernardino attack earlier this year due to breaking its security protocols. In line with Trump's public criticism, Apple responded that it put the company in the hands of other good people. More so, Apple decided to hold back its usual technological and financial support for the GOP convention when it selected Trump as its party candidate. The one thing both public figures have in common, in spite of this, is that they both want to reform tax and make it cheaper for companies to repatriate their overseas earnings. Cook has repetitively called for this move and Donald Trump has actually promised to decrease tax on repatriated revenue to 10 percent from 35 percent.

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 12, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» According to the latest reports, an iOS 10 jailbreak tool is currently working on iPod, iPad, and iPhones. It comes with great features and benefits but the tool doesn’t come from Pangu, it originates from the Unblock-Jailbreak team. People are asking whether this means the end for Pangu and TaiG. The release of the Apple iOS 10 jailbreak means that it comes with many different benefits besides the standard ones. Users can now gain access to Cydia. The benefits will help the users gain access to updates for alifetime, utilize SIM cards from various network providers and also money-back guarantees. Furthermore, it has been assured by the Unblock-Jailbreak team that their newly launched jailbreak tool will not damage the current functions and features of any Apple devices. However, besides the security and safety claims from the team, users are advised to exercise caution before downloading this particular jailbreak tool. Firstly, you must always back up your iPod, iPhone or iPad device before trying to jailbreak your device. The silence from other jailbreak teams like Pangu and TaiG indicates that these hackers have finally surrendered to the stringent security measures of the new iOS 10. Geeky Gadgets reported that the company had released the iOS10.0.2 software update which comes with various performance improvements and bug fixes. Moreover, the new system update will bolster the stability of iOSdevices. The latest move from Apple has left Pangu and TaiG clueless, regarding their next move. Meanwhile, reports from other sources indicate that Pangu has managed to jailbreak IOS 10. Sadly, full information about it is still unavailable. It is possible that Pangu is playing the waiting game with developers from Apple and the jailbreak tool for iOS 10 should be releasedby December. Apple decided to release iOS10.1 just weeks after the release of iOS10. Although it seems like a peculiar move from Apple, this greatly limits the jailbreakers from coming up with another tool within such a short period. As a result, the Chinese team of developers has remained completely silent. As a result, most Apple fans believe that Pangu is playing a waiting game with the iOSdevelopers at the moment. Meanwhile, it is believed that Apple is waiting to release another update titled, iOS10.1.1 to address several issues faced in iOS10 due to the deletion of Apple Health Data along with vulnerability issues faced on 10.1. It is expected that the beta version will arrive anytime soon. Therefore, Apple fans believe that the jailbreak tool should arrive before the holiday season ends. As for a jailbreaker, the first thing that they should do is stay put with iOS10. According to iPhone Hacks, if the user upgrades to 10, he will not be able to downgrade the device to earlier versions if he wants to jailbreak. This is because Apple has stopped providing SHSH blobs for the firmware. The second step that he needs to focus on is use the TinyUmbrella tool to save all the SHSH blobs for downgrading in the future. iPhone Hacks reported that TinyUmbrella is compatible with various iOSversions like iOS 9.3.4 and lower. Since there is no information from Pangu and TaiG, it seems that they may take time developing the tool so as to break all the restrictions imposed by the new iOS. Recently, Apple announced a new application for their Apple TV, and this could entirely change the way in which we stream and view content.

China’s Tech Giants Are Cloning the Apple Store Bloomberg 4 days ago Christina Larson < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > The SZ DJI Technology Co. store stands in Shenzhen, China, on Friday, Dec. 18, 2015. © Bloomberg In September, Chinese drone maker DJI opened a flagship store in Hong Kong’s trendy Causeway Bay neighborhood. On the first floor, in an area cordoned off with black netting, like a batting cage, customers test the machines in flight. The second floor resembles a museum, the walls decorated with framed aerial drone photos of a bamboo forest in Kyoto, Japan; white waves trailing a ship near the Philippines; farm equipment combing fields in the Netherlands. The third floor houses a repair station, where on a recent Wednesday afternoon, three people stood in line waiting for advice. Selling in its own stores in China is new for 10-year-old DJI. While the Shenzhen company is the world’s leading seller of consumer drones, it is, unlike most Chinese tech businesses, more popular elsewhere. About 80 percent of sales come from abroad, more than half from the U.S., where hobbyist interest had been cultivated by decades’ worth of radio-controlled helicopters and other toys. The U.S. also taught DJI the value of brick and mortar, says Michael Perry, DJI’s director for strategic partnerships. A deal with Apple put the company’s new Phantom 4 drone in more than 400 Apple Stores around the world this spring, and the resulting bump in sales led DJI to think harder about expanding its in-store presence. In the past year the drone maker has opened stores in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Seoul, along with the one in Hong Kong. “It’s really important to have a place where consumers can see a drone, where they can fly it for the first time,” says Perry. “We want customers to be able to see, touch, and ask questions.” DJI isn’t alone. In the world’s largest e-commerce market, leading technology companies are paying renewed attention to physical retail. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma surprised shareholders when he wrote in an Oct. 13 letter, “Pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges.” Now that China’s decade-plus of double-digit growth in internet users has flattened, “in the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a reimagined retail industry, driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data,” Ma wrote. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on a Nov. 2 earnings call that the biggest opportunity in e-commerce is working together with retail operations. “Online and offline will be a single seamless experience, not just in consumer interaction, but also in the entire business operation,” said Zhang. Last year, Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20 percent stake in electronics retail chain Suning. Among the potential symbioses, shoppers could use the chain’s 1,600 or so Chinese stores as showrooms, testing merchandise there before deciding whether to comparison shop online. In October the two companies announced plans to invest 1 billion yuan ($148 million) to set up an e-commerce venture designed to manage Suning stores’ presence on Alibaba sites and strengthen the chain’s customer service, among other things. Other Chinese tech brands are investing directly in shopping options modeled loosely on Apple’s retail efforts, stores in which customers can test devices and ask questions of sales staff. The shift is most clearly on display in the smartphone business, where online purchases peaked last fall and manufacturers are looking to diversify retail options, says CK Lu, a China market analyst at researcher Gartner. In the second half of last year, about 30 percent of smartphones bought in China were ordered online; in the first six months of 2016 the figure dipped to a little more than 20 percent, Lu says. Huawei, the No. 3 phone maker in the world behind Samsung and Apple, operates 515 stores across China and has teamed with retail chains. Five years ago its smartphone business barely existed. Colin Giles, executive vice president for Huawei’s consumer-business division, says its brick-and-mortar presence proved to be a big help. “You can’t ignore it,” he says. “Chinese consumers for sure are looking for a premium shopping experience.” Xiaomi, which made its name with online flash sales of its low-cost smartphones, is now looking to retail to boost its brand image and entice Chinese shoppers to splurge on its internet-connected appliances. The company operates 36 Mi Home stores in China, displaying its latest curved-screen smartphones alongside branded smart rice cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, and other electronics. Xiaomi says it will open 1,000 more stores in China in the next five years. “Physical stores are getting more and more important, because they offer a chance to show the value of the product,” says Jessie Ding, an analyst at researcher Canalys. She says Xiaomi’s weakness offline allowed domestic competitors to overtake it. Like Ding, Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, says the maturing of China’s electronics market, and its electronics shoppers, places a heavier burden on companies to distinguish themselves. “It’s an absolute necessity as Chinese consumers develop more refined tastes and are willing to spend a bit more,” Rein says. “They want that personal retail experience. And if they spend more money, they care more about follow-up service.” Huawei’s Giles says his team is using customer surveys and follow-ups to learn as much as possible about what shoppers want more of, both online and off. He, too, recognizes that it’s tougher to stand out in China’s tech market than it used to be. Go to one of China’s big e-commerce sites, like Taobao or JD.com, and “there are probably over 1,000 handsets, all marketed in-site in the same way,” says Giles. “You need to have a brand to cut through.” The bottom line: Several of China’s e-commerce and mobile stars are spending heavily on retail stores to distinguish their customer service.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 may feature truly wireless charging technology Apple iPhone 8 may feature truly wireless charging technology By Bindu Nair - Nov 11, 2016 An intriguing new report attempts to shed some light on the wireless charging technology which the iPhone 8 may adopt when it comes out next year. Unlike standard wire-free docks or pads, Apple may be developing a truly cordless solution. Previous rumors have held that Apple is working with a company called Energous to implement wireless charging in its future iPhones. The latter’s technology requires a chip to be installed inside a device. This chip can connect to a base station located up to 15 feet away. The transmitter would be plugged into an outlet and power up the device without any physical contact. The system appears to be unlike any other charging solution available in the market right now. It would also handily resolve an iPhone 7 owner’s current dilemma of not being able to charge and listen to music at the same time. As for evidence of this happening, BGR reports that Energous recently stated that it is working with a ‘tier 1’ smartphone manufacturer. Also See- iPhone 8 : All you need to know about it This in itself is too vague to directly assume that the manufacturer is indeed Apple. However, further proof arrives with the fact that Dialog Semiconductor and Pegatron, both major Apple production partners, have invested huge sums into Energous. The former is notably a power management solutions company which has sunk in $10 million as a strategic investment. If not Apple, the other possible tier 1 firm being bandied about is Samsung. This seems very unlikely as of now, though only time will tell whether this assumption is accurate or not.

(Reuters/Robert Galbraith) Share Written by Aimee Groth & Alison Griswold Obsession 2016 November 11, 2016 Silicon Valley is slowly conceding the fact that Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. Aside from one divisive and vocal supporter, its leaders threw their support behind Hillary Clinton, who ran a tech-friendly platform. For eight years, the Valley enjoyed the privilege of Barack Obama’s fascination with their industry—the president enthusiastically hosted science fairs and demo days at the White House, toured innovation factories and tested technology on the cutting edge of AI development, and mused on topics like Universal Basic Income with journalists—which translated into support for policies favored by the industry (around Net Neutrality, patent reform, and immigration, for example). How Trump will engage with Silicon Valley and approach technological innovation more broadly are wild cards. His comments around immigration and putting up a wall along the US border are troubling to tech leaders, who heavily rely on drawing engineering talent from abroad. Many startup founders have remained silent on what a Trump presidency means for their companies, but some executives took the opportunity to rally their teams. The morning after the election, Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself watching the results with his daughter, and shared that there’s “work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children.” Apple CEO Tim Cook emailed employees and reminded them that “Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” Facebook and Apple are positioned to weather any sort of storm, of course. Many young founders see the election as a test of their own leadership skills. A few of them shared with Quartz memos that they sent to their teams after election night and weighed in on what a Trump presidency could mean for the industry. * * * Miki Agrawal, a founder of several ventures including THINX, a startup that developed high-tech underwear for women, emailed her 35-person, all-millennial staff, on Wednesday (Nov. 9): Team, Yesterday’s outcome was a wake-up call. As individuals and as a team, we must put our heads together to strive to do even more to raise consciousness, educate people and most importantly, spread love. The angrier we are, the more the wrong people win. Let us come together at 12:30pm today and please, each of you, bring thoughtful answers to the following questions: 1) How do I plan on showing up personally in the next year to come? 2) How can we as a company be agents for positive change during these upcoming tougher times for our greater communities? 3) What can we do differently the remainder of this year (adjust our strategy) with the holidays coming to inspire the people who love our brand and us in a positive way? I am so proud of the people behind this company who care so deeply about issues that bring about equality, so may we now roll up our sleeves even more to create the change we authentically want to see ourselves. We got this ok? We have 3 babies entering the world, we need to plant healthy roots for them! XO M Agrawal’s twin sister Radha Agrawal is a producer for Daybreaker, a community that throws early-morning dance parties popular among startup founders in New York City and San Francisco. On Wednesday morning Daybreaker threw parties that attracted hundreds of entrepreneurs (many of whom campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton) in both cities, followed by a discussion session about how to mobilize their teams after the election. At DoorDash, a food delivery startup headquartered in San Francisco, general counsel Keith Yandell sent a note acknowledging the “surprise, uncertainty, and confusion” expressed by employees in the wake of the election. “I promise to you that DoorDash remains committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture that is accepting of everyone,” he wrote. “We can move forward by executing and living out the values upon which the company was founded: that we stand for anyone that is trying to make it.” Marco Zappacosta, CEO of jobs and home services listing site Thumbtack, wrote in a note to employees that Thumbtack would “continue to be committed to creating an inclusive company where all people are empowered to reach their potential.” But, he continued, “we can all make an impact outside our walls”: Political scientists will study this election for a long time to come, but there is no doubt that yesterday’s outcome highlighted that there are many people across the political spectrum who feel like the hopes and dreams they hold most dear are slipping out of reach. Now, we’re not going to solve that problem, but we can do our part to help. The Thumbtack we’re building should let anyone with the talent, time, and hustle move closer to fulfilling their dreams and creating a better life for themselves. While we’re proud to say that we’ve already enabled tens of thousands of small business owners from all walks of life to do this, we know there’s still plenty of room to grow. To be clear, getting to where we want to be as a platform doesn’t mean hitting some arbitrary revenue or GMV number. It means truly becoming a pathway to a middle class career that everyone can access. Other entrepreneurs were similarly optimistic. Startup founders engage with high uncertainty every day; it’s the nature of their jobs. Many are now choosing to see the reality of Trump presidency as a new opportunity. Meanwhile, venture capitalists are saying that for the time being, it’s business as usual. “From chaos comes opportunity,” said Jake Bronstein, who founded Flint and Tinder, a fashion tech startup acquired by Huckberry in February. Like most of his peers, Bronstein voted for Clinton. “From uncertainty comes even more opportunity.” Alex Abelin, a former Google public affairs manager who co-founded Liquid Talent, a platform for gig economy workers (which has paused operations), was also a strong Clinton supporter but is trying to keep an open mind about Trump. “In some weird analogy, Trump is sort of like a startup founder,” Abelin said. “He was never an elected official. He has no real business being CEO of our country. But he has a founder’s mentality, which is that by passion, by vision—though I don’t see his vision—he has this belief that you can start something from nothing.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging GO Apple working to offer wireless charging on next iPhone Nov 11, 2016 10:58 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  If you’re a long-time iPhone user, you’re probably OK with the charging system that Apple is offering on its flagship product, but if you come from a Samsung, you certainly miss the wireless and fast charging systems that come in super handy on a daily basis. And while at first glance it might seem like Apple is lagging behind rivals here, Cupertino actually has a plan of offering wireless charging on the next iPhone, but not in a way you’re already used to. In the last few months, we’ve seen several hints that Apple might be working on a wireless charging system that would allow the iPhone to charge without a charging plate, as is the case with the existing implementations, but using transmitters that can be plugged in anywhere in a room. The main idea here is that you could be able to charge the iPhone whenever the device is in close range to the transmitter, and it appears that this is exactly what Apple is aiming for right now. Investments for possible partnership According to a report from BGR, Energous, which is the company that Apple has been rumored to be working with on wireless charging systems, has received a $10 million investment from Dialog Semiconductor, another firm that’s currently working closely with Apple. Cupertino is the number one customer of Dialog, whose main activity is the production of power management solutions for a wide variety of consumer electronics, including phones. Energous previously revealed that it was working with what it called a “tier 1” smartphone manufacturer, projecting increased revenues in the coming quarters. Apple is believed to be this manufacturer, although no confirmation has been provided so far. All signs, however, seem to be pointing that Apple and Energous are working on something very innovative for next year. If this is indeed happening, the new iPhone could launch with wireless charging systems built by Energous and allowing the device to charge from distances of 15 feet (4 meters) from a transmitter plugged into a wall socket across the room. This is possible with a small chip placed on the iPhone’s motherboard which would enable wireless charging. Without a doubt, Apple’s new system will be locked, so although it would be virtually possible to charge other electronics using this system, Cupertino will restrict the feature to iPhones exclusively. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#wireless charging subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Father Says iPhone Nearly Caught Fire in His Daughter’s Pocket Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 iPhone 7 Plus Reportedly Explodes After Accidental Drop iPhones Get a Feature to Secretly Call the Police Without Anyone Noticing Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    iPhones could soon get wireless charging as well new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed - Updated more on: iOS 10.2 Beta 3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Reuters/Stephen Lam If reports are to be believed, Apple could be introducing a 15-inch variant for the MacBook Air line. In October, when the Cupertino-based tech giant did not mention the MacBook Air 2017, many tech experts felt that the company may be ending the series. However, many suggested that Apple would do so only after releasing another product, the last of its line. While it is impossible to understand what Apple is actually thinking, rumours suggest that the company will be releasing the Apple MacBook Air in 2017 that will be more compact and even thinner than its predecessor. Recent reports stated that a highly-advanced E-Ink keyboard may also be introduced along with the device. Sonder Design is a well-known manufacturer of these keyboards and Apple has reportedly got into a contract with the company to manufacture the keyboards for Apple. Many believe that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 will get an E-Ink keyboard made by Sonder Design, reported Macworld. There are also reports that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 will drop the USB-A ports in favour of the highly-advanced USB Type-C ports, reports MacRumors. Not much is known about the type of processor the device will be incorporated with. Even if Apple does not use the Kaby Lake processors to keep the price under check, it can go with the Skylake chipsets. Fans want Touch ID support, fingerprint sensor and Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpads in the Apple MacBook Air 2017. The new range of Apple products could also be having the virtual personal assistant Siri. All eyes are on March 2017 when Apple fans would expect a MacBook Air 2017 reveal. The future of the MacBook Air line is uncertain and it is high time for the tech behemoth to reveal some information on the product.

Unfortunately, last month Apple announced it’s giving its 11-inch ultraportable the ax. Moreover, by not upgrading the 13-inch MacBook Air ($999), it’s sentencing all of its sub $1,000 laptops to a slow death. That means that in the near future Apple could make the 12-inch MacBook ($1,299) and the 13-inch MacBook Pro ($1,499) the company’s new entry-level machines, sans entry level prices. Fortunately, the Apple Store offers refurbished MacBook Air, MacBook, and MacBook Pro laptops with prices starting at $929. If the idea of a refurbished laptop makes you hesitate, rest assured that Apple’s refurbs are among the best in the industry and they’re all backed by the same 1-year warranty found in Apple’s newer devices. Below we’ve rounded up a few refurb Apple laptops currently available. MacBook laptops on sale from $170 to $210 off: 11.6-inch MacBook Air for $929 ($170 off): There’s no Retina display and its 11-inch screen may be too small for some users, but at $929 — the 11-inch MacBook Air is the cheapest way to set foot inside the Mac laptop ecosystem. This laptop’s classic design has spawned countless imitators — including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook — and its just 0.3 pounds heavier than the 2-pound 12-inch MacBook. This model has been upgraded to include 256GB of storage space. 12-inch MacBook for $1,182 ($210 off): The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s most forward-thinking device to date. It defines the bleeding edge in PC portability and just like the original MacBook Air inspired dozens of competitors, so will the 12-inch MacBook. At its full price, however, it offers too little for too much money. As a refurb, it presents a more compelling argument, just keep in mind it doesn’t offer the best battery (that would be the 13-inch MacBook Air) nor does it offer the most horsepower, if CPU muscle is what you require. 13.3-inch MacBook Pro Retina for $1,099 ($200 off): This laptop costs $100 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, yet it includes an eye-opening 2,560 x 1,600 pixel Retina Display. This 2015 model may be outdated — when compared to the just-released 13.3-inch MacBook Pro — but in terms of power it leaves the older 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook in the dust.

Spring will follow winter, day will turn to night, and Mac users will wonder how in the heck they’re supposed to right click on their computers. Does that sound like a familiar problem? We’ve got you covered. Here’s how to right click on your own terms, no matter what Apple device you’re using. Read: What’s the best MacBook for your money? On the Apple mouse The Apple mouse isn’t clearly divided into separate click zones and sometimes doesn’t support right clicking out of the box, which can be very frustrating. If you’re a little bewildered by the Apple mouse rules, don’t worry! There are customization options to set the mouse how you prefer it. Let’s look at your options. Press the Ctrl key, and then click your mouse. This is usually the default method of right-clicking with an Apple mouse. The Control key, when held down, switches the mouse to right-click mode. We know that this sounds a little weird, but some people actually prefer this approach. Try using this option for a little while and see what you think. If you can get used to it, great! If you’re still making a yucky face, let’s talk about option two. You can customize your mouse to respond a certain way to match your past habits. Start by heading over to System Preferences in the menu bar, and then select Mouse. For the average Apple mouse, this should open up a window with two tabs. Make sure you are in the Point & Click tab, and look for an option that says Secondary Click. This option should be check-marked. There is a dropdown immediately below this selection that allows you to set the secondary click to the right or left side of the mouse. You probably want to choose the right side—Apple has little videos that show you what the current effects are if this gets confusing. Then exit out and experiment with your mouse! Unfortunately, there’s no option to directly control the sensitivity of these right/left clicks. We suggest you experiment a little and see if the Apple mouse is working for you or if you need to consider a replacement. After all, you don’t have to use any particular mouse.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Since the Apple iPad Air 2 was released on Oct. 22, 2014, there hasn’t been much refreshes on the product. iPad fans have been eagerly waiting for the Cupertino tech giant to reveal some details and specs about the successor, Apple iPad Air 3. Up to now, rumours about the iPad Air 3 have regularly surfaced online and fans have no other choice but to rely on these rumours. According to Tech Times, the Apple iPad Air 3 is expected to sport a 9.7-inch 4K display and will reportedly host the latest A10 processor from Apple. It will also be sleeker than its predecessor. There is a possibility that the device will have a dual-camera setup. The primary camera could be of 8MP whereas the front-facing camera of 2.1MP. The primary camera may support LED flash. A bigger and better battery, a highly-improved display and a 4GB RAM are also expected in the device. A much sharper resolution than the iPad Air 2 is anticipated in Apple iPad Air 3. Some of the features that the device may come with include 3D Touch, fingerprint sensor, waterproof technology and four speakers. Apple will stick to its decision of not including the 3.5mm headphone jack in the device. With the Apple iPad Air 3, Apple may introduce two new colour variants, namely, Rose Gold and Jet Black. There is no concrete information on the Apple iPad Air 3 release date. While some believe the device will be releases in March 2017, other say Apple may choose to end the Air line altogether, writes ValueWalk. It is not known whether the iPad Air 3 will come with Apple Pencil support. Even if the device does support Apple Pencil, it won’t come free with the device. For now, users will have to wait till the first quarter of 2017 to fully understand if there will be an Apple iPad Air 3.

Image: Asif Islam/Shutterstock In the face of a $7.4bn fine, internet giant Google has dismissed the European Commission’s claims that its dominance of the mobile OS market is hurting competition. Google has responded to objections raised by the European Commission (EC) over how it manages Android compatibility and distributes apps. Google said that the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of developers, hardware makers and mobile network operators. “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” said Google senior vice president and general counsel, Kent Walker. ‘The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition’ – KENT WALKER Google launched Android in 2007 as a free, open source operating system. Walker said that because manufacturers don’t have to buy or build expensive operating systems, some Android smartphones can be bought for as little as $45. As a result, globally, Android smartphones represent 87.5pc of all smartphones, compared with 12.1pc of phones that are iOS, according to figures from Strategy Analytics. “Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a ‘one way street’; it’s a multi-lane highway of choice,” Walker said. All is fair in love and competition, says Google Walker said that the EC’s claim that Android and iOS don’t compete is simply not true. “We don’t see it that way. We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89pc of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. “Second, we are concerned that the Commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers and the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem. “Developers – and there were at least 1.3m of them in Europe in 2015 – depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work. Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation – a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian. “When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there’s a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps?” He said Google manages this challenge to make sure there is a minimal level of compatibility among Android devices. “Critically, we give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That’s the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety, while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. “This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple’s iPhone,” Walker said. Pre-installed apps on Android Walker also hit out at the EC’s claims that Google shouldn’t pre-install Google apps such as Mail or Maps as part of a suite. Walker said that Android’s competitors offer less choice in the apps that come with their phones. He pointed out that, for example, on the Galaxy S7 from Samsung with Android 6.0, 11 out of 38 pre-installed apps are from Google; on the iPhone 7 with iOS 10, some 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple; and on the Nokia Lumia 550 with Windows 10, 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps are from Microsoft. “On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device, (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no ‘foreclosure’.” Walker also defended the distribution of Google Search and Play which enables it to offer the suite for free, rather than charge licence fees. “This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone – it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play. “Today’s mobile devices show all the signs of fierce competition with a wide range of business models: from vertically integrated ones like Apple’s iOS, to open-source systems like Android. The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition,” Walker said. Google campus at Mountain View, California.

Rohit KVN   November 11, 2016 14:37 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple iPhone 8 massive leak: iPhone 7 successor tipped to come with game changing battery feature In Picture: Apple iPhone 7Reuters With the new Apple iPhone 7 series reaching to all corners of the world, now the media's attention has shifted to its successor iPhone 8. As 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone launch, Apple is leaving no stone unturned to make the iPhone 8 series epic. This might sound a bit little exaggerated, but going by the recent spate of leaks with regard to the iPhone 8, we come to believe it will definitely give a stiff challenge to rivals for sure.

What's so special about this? readers may ask, as this is already seen in many smartphones for more than two years now. Well, Energous technology allows a phone or any device to get charged wirelessly from across a room, BGR reported. Energous charger chip will make any device literally draw power wirelessly It is believed that Apple intends to incorporate Energous-developed chip on the back of the iPhone 8 to enable wireless charging with up to 15 feet from the charging station. With this, iPhone 8 user will never have to leave the device attached to a power point in the home or office. They can carry it around or sit in a different room while it is continuously getting charged. If this revolutionary wireless charging feature in the iPhone 8 does turn out to be true, Apple will set a new benchmark in the smartphone industry, as it did with the first generation iPhone. As of now, neither Apple nor Energous has made any official comments on this report. That said, Energous in its recent earnings call had mentioned that it is working with a 'tier 1' smartphone company, which many believe it to be Apple. Furthermore, it received $10 million in funds from Dialog Semiconductor, which is also one of the top supply partners for Apple components. Other expected features of iPhone 8 series: From what we have gathered so far, Apple iPhone 8 series is expected to come in three screen sizes — 4.7-inch, 5.0-inch, and 5.5-inch. Except to the display size, all the models will have the same internal hardware and come with A11 Fusion series chipset, which is said be more efficient and powerful, as compared to the iPhone 7 series. Another interesting rumour on iPhone 8 series suggests that it will come with Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED)-based display, a huge improvement over the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen used in the current iPhone 7 series and older devices. And, 3D touch sensor is expected to be integrated right into the OLED screen. Apple's iPhone 8 series is expected to debut in September 2017. Watch this space for more updates.

Updated November 8, 2016 9:48AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple MacBook Pro Cupertino MacBook Air Laptops Enterprise Hardware USB Apple Watch Apple TV Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched -- Apple Watch -- looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does -- they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Now it seems to have lost touch, and others are passing it by. Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, CEO Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The $1,300 computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others -- and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old -- and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell -- you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product -- the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at $1,800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professional want and need. Many potential customers criticized the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the MacBook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products -- and their fans -- haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company. © 2016 San Jose Mercury News syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved. Tell Us What You Think Comment: Name: Silvio: Posted: 2016-11-13 @ 1:26am PT Good article. By trying to look cool, Apple lost its coolness because the VERY act of trying to be cool makes the "trier" uncool. Also how cool one will look with all those adaptors hanging off a machine? Removing essential ports from the Pro line up is extremely dumb. Not to mention eliminating a super cool feature like the magnetic port! Oh wait! Hold on! By not having the cord snap off computers will now either damage the port or charger tip or go straight onto the ground... either way it will need to be repaired! Oh I get it! The keyboard is essentially useless. Touch bar a gimmick, really! And what is this apple fascination with emojis?! Please! The iPhone innovative features have been on Android for ages! The slow and minimal updates in its line up are pathetic. I'm an Apple guy, but have slowly been pushed away. Photos for example are all on Google Photos which Apple's old iPhoto only NOW has features that are similar and carbon copy of Google's. My next phone will be a Nexus and the day someone makes a system as easy as Apple, so will be my computer. All of my friends think the same and many have shifted. Brexit in the U.K., Trump in the White House, Apple users on windows and Google... who would have thought... Michael Crab: Posted: 2016-11-08 @ 11:40am PT "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," I think this is the most telling quote from the article. I believed Apple supporters to be the most die hard when it comes to their mobile devices. I recently met another person that switched to the new Pixel XL from a an iphone 6S plus and was astounded at how easy the process was.

The company is not offering any fabulous deals, but it is throwing in free next-day shipping for in-stock iPhones, including the iPhone 7.  ( Apple ) Advertisement While most of the world is now gearing up for Black Friday deals, Apple is already thinking about Christmas and has launched its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide. Unsurprisingly, the Apple 2016 Holiday Gift Guide recommends an Apple device for everyone. Even less surprisingly, Apple devices are among the most popular holiday gifts each year, so Apple's gift guide might actually come in handy for generous Christmas shoppers looking to lavish their dear ones with expensive gadgets. "There's an art to finding the perfect gift," says Apple. "And nothing can bring to life the passion and creativity of the people on your list like a gift from Apple." The guide contains a number of product recommendations, highlighting its most powerful devices currently available for purchase. The iPhone, MacBook, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, accessories and gift cards are all included in the holiday shopping guide, so basically Apple thinks that all of its devices and products would make great gifts this Christmas. Considering how popular Apple devices generally are, the company is probably right. The latest MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 are already top-selling devices and many Apple fans are likely putting them on their Christmas lists already. That said, Apple is not offering any special deals or perks with this guide, it's simply listing what it has to offer in case you might want to put it under a Christmas tree. iPhone 7 Free Next-Day Shipping The company is offering free shipping on various products, but these vary by country and by product. For interested shoppers in the United States, Apple is offering free next-day shipping for any iPhone, including the latest iPhone 7, if the phone is in stock and the order is placed by 5:00 p.m. local time. Free Two-Day Shipping On Other Apple Products While the much touted iPhone 7 comes with free next-day shipping, other Apple products come with free two-day shipping. This offer is also for U.S. customers who purchase the product by 5:00 p.m. local time, provided the product is in stock. For Canada, all customers will get free standard shipping for all products Apple sells. For the UK, Apple is offering free next-day shipping on products that are in stock, provided the order is placed by 7 p.m. local time. This applies to orders of at least £40. For other Western European countries such as France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, Apple offers free next-day deliver for in-stock products that cost at least €40, provided that the order is placed between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. local time.

(SR) From our archive, 100 years ago The Spokane Daily Chronicle was trying to build anticipation for one of Spokane’s big annual events, the National Apple Show. The opening parade – which the Chronicle called, variously “The Pageant of King Apple,” and “King Pip’s Parade” – was being described in terms nothing short of hyperbolic. “We are going to uncork all of the carnival spirit within hundreds of miles of Spokane for the big celebration Friday,” said the parade chairman. “… King Pip and his royal court will be escorted by a pick bodyguard from each of a number of local organizations and will have a guest of honor King Boreas of St. Paul, who is coming to Spokane with President Louis W. Hill of the Great Northern … “The pageant will move from the Davenport Hotel to the Apple Show grounds along streets brilliantly illuminated with red fire. Every person in the parade will be in costume and the two kings — of Apple Land and the St. Paul Carnival — will be carried in a manner befitting their high rank and dignity.” The Chronicle also announced that it would hold its sixth annual cooking school at the Apple Show. A fancy $90 Arcadian De Luze range would “be given to the woman baking the best apple pie.” Published: Nov. 11, 2016, midnight  Tags: agriculture, apple pie, apples, National Apple Show, This day in history Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The ad and search giant points out in a neat animated GIF that of the 39 bundled apps on an iPhone, all 39 of them stem from Apple; on a Lumia 550, 39 of the 47 apps are from Microsoft; but lovely Google only has 11 of the 38 pre-installed apps on a Galaxy S7. The argument is a little obtuse since the EC's biggest concern is not the percentage of apps but the fact that Google forces all Android-based phone manufacturers to include its full suite of Google apps – everything from Gmail to Maps to Chrome and YouTube – if they want to add the Play Store to the phone. Since the store is critical to finding and installing quality apps, and installing some security patches, and hence allows a device to function as a competent handheld, the EC argues that Google is abusing its power. Google's response amounts to: if you think we're bad, you should see what others are up to. Plus, it says with wide puppy-dog eyes, bundling its other products with the app store means that it can give people everything for free. If it stopped doing that – the pleading look turning to a gentle growl – it may have to start charging fees. "This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone - it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play," Google's general counsel Kent Walker notes. Number three The response is the third by the company to a wide-ranging antitrust investigation by the EC. It looked at five areas of concern with Google: content scraping, maps and localized search, advertising, price-comparison features for online shopping, and Android. The EC lodged formal charges on the latter three and Google is finally responding – after a number of extensions – to the last one. We don't have the full response from Google to Europe but it has produced what we can assume is a version of it arguments in an official blog post, complete with GIFs. As well as pointing out it has fewer pre-installed apps than its smartphone rivals, and that it allows rival apps to be installed, Google also complains that the very fact that the iPhone exists is evidence that it is not abusing its position. "To ignore competition with Apple," writes Walker, "is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape." In fact, Google says, if anything it has made competition possible. "European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world," his post argues. "Android is not a 'one way street'; it's a multi-lane highway of choice." As for Google flexing its muscles on the hardware side, Walker paints its influence as "working with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices." And argues that it gives manufacturers "wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline." Fragile What's more, even though Google is one of the largest companies in the world and that there are well over a billion active Android users, the whole thing is, apparently, incredibly delicate. "Open-source platforms are fragile," Walker warns. "They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms. It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers." To be fair to Google, it does take a lighter touch than other phone companies, and in some cases, its approach seems to be too lax – such as the broken security update approach where some phones sit unpatched for months or simply not at all. But everything that Google says can be true and it can still be abusing its market power. Just because you help an old granny over the road doesn't mean you can kick a dog. Plus, of course, Android devices now account for three-quarters of the smartphone market in Europe, and that share is increasing. If the EC didn't investigate and didn't put pressure on Google to make sure it is not abusing that enormous level of control, the commission wouldn't be doing its job. As to where things will end up, it's hard to tell. The EC has a long history of wielding antitrust measures against US tech companies. In recent years, it has picked fights with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. In some cases, the EC has largely walked away; in others, it has spent years fighting for changes such as when it forced Microsoft to offer Windows without Windows Player. There is of course one additional factor in play now: with president-elect Donald Trump entering the White House in the new year, the extremely cosy relationship between the Obama Administration and Google will come to an end. Without high-level political backing, Google may find its sheen is less bright in political quarters. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 41 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

As Silicon Valley continues to freak out at the national tragedy that is Donald Trump's election, Apple CEO Tim Cook took a moment yesterday to reassure his employees that despite the bigotry and hate that is now our country's official modus operandi, Apple itself will remain a place that welcomes all — regardless of race, country of origin, or sexual orientation. BuzzFeed picked up the letter, written by one of America's most prominent gay CEOs, and it is a stark reminder that an industry historically dependent on skilled foreign workers is going to have some tough years ahead. "I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election," the letter reads. "In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings." And those strong feelings were likely shared by Cook himself. As we noted in June, Apple's decision to not sponsor the Republican Party's Cleveland nominating convention likely signified that Cook did not support Trump. However, perhaps demonstrating a bit of business savvy that looks alternatively smart and craven in retrospect, he did then hold a fundraiser for GOP House Majority Leader Paul Ryan — a decision heavily criticized by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. Regardless of how Cook personally voted at the top of the ticket or down ballot, it is safe to assume that many of his employees are shocked to the core by the election of an alleged sexual predator who has threatened to deport millions of people. "While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed," Cook's letter continued. "Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love." With that message of inclusion, Cook has once again put himself at odds with the president-elect. We hope it's not the last time.

Investors have been warned to brace for more sharp moves on financial markets as uncertainty endures over how Trump’s campaign rhetoric will translate into policies. Related: Dow Jones hits record high on Trump bump, but London market falters - as it happened But after initially struggling to find direction on Thursday the Dow closed up 218 points at 18807, a rise of 1.17%. The S&P 500 also gained slightly, rising 0.2% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped 0.81%. Trump has clashed with Silicon Valley and threatened Apple, Nasdaq and the world’s largest company, over privacy and its overseas manufacturing. Apple dropped 2.79% on Thursday. Markets benefitted from a continuing sense of relief over Trump’s conciliatory tone in his early remarks, including those following his meeting with the US president, Barack Obama. However European shares, including London’s FTSE 100 index, could not hold on to their early gains as worries grew over the president-elect’s coming longer term impact on global growth due to his protectionist policies. The billionaire businessman vowed on the campaign trail to put American jobs first and scrap or renegotiate trade deals. European markets were also hurt by investors moving their money out of shares and into bonds as yields rose on the prospect that the arrival of a big spender in the White House would mean the US had to issue more government debt. A new flurry of bonds coming on to the market would push down the price of bonds, and yields would move inversely to prices. Related: How America's new president will affect the global economy “It has been another interesting day for the FTSE 100, with the index retreating from the morning high, hit by heavy losses for high dividend stocks, which are looking less attractive after the pickup in US bond yields,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading company IG. The FTSE 100 closed down 1.2% at 6827.98, having gained 1% on Wednesday after Trump’s presidential victory was confirmed. Analysts said the FTSE’s change in direction during the day Thursday reflected a sense of confusion over whether Trump would match tough talk during the presidential race with action once in power. “It is perhaps apt that the reaction to Donald Trump’s victory has been so confused, flipping between bombast and baloney much in the same manner as the soon-to-be president,” said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex. “That’s all well and good for the short-term, especially for those traders looking to benefit from the present volatility; one suspects the seemingly rudderless movements may soon wear thin, however.” There were clear winners and losers from Trump’s presidential victory. His vows to ramp up spending on defence and infrastructure boosted stocks in the defence, construction and commodity sector. The prospect of looser regulation lifted shares in banks. Analysts said more muddled days of trading lay ahead as investors continued to weigh the potential impact of a Trump presidency on different stocks, sectors and regions as well as on the global economy as a whole. “Global growth could be somewhat slower in the years ahead if protectionism takes hold. The additional uncertainty will have a negative impact on equity markets but the extent needs to be kept in perspective,” said Glyn Owen at Momentum Global Investment Management. “On balance we believe that markets will drift for a period in the face of the uncertainty and the increased volatility we have seen in recent weeks will be a feature for the year ahead.” On currency markets there was some respite for the pound as it jumped to a six-week high against the euro and rose against the dollar. Traders put the small recovery in the pound – which has tumbled since the UK’s vote to leave the EU – down to political worries now shifting to mainland Europe. A series of elections are due in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too if their government loses a key referendum next month. After Trump’s win there are predictions that populist movements in those countries will gain further ground. Against that backdrop the pound was up 1.5% against a flagging euro, to €1.1537 in late trading. The pound was up 1.4% against the dollar to $1.2578. That in turn put further pressure on the FTSE 100. The internationally diverse stock index has benefited from the pound’s post-referendum weakness because it has flattered the earnings of those component companies that report in dollars.

The company's glasses, dubbed "Spectacles," are currently only on sale in the US, where they cost $130. 2. Nearly every major tech stock was down the day after after Donald Trump was officially elected president. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon were all in the red. 3. Apple CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to employees after Donald Trump was elected president. Cook urged them to "move forward together." 4.

Join For Free Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice Why iOS localization? Business is international and Apple proves it. Reports from a year or two ago (2015) indicated that the company had started to sell more iPhones in China than it was already selling in the US. Of course, Apple also sells its iOS-based products all over the world. For product managers for iOS apps, that means an opportunity and a threat. If you don’t move to address the needs of different international markets, competitors will fill the void, build up their user bases, and attack you in your home market from a position of globally massive strength. On the other hand, to market an iOS app to international markets for bigger market share and higher revenues, you have a head start. iPhones and iPads are multilingual by design, and make it easy for users to select the local language interfaces they favor. In addition, Apple offers tools to help your developers to produce local language versions of your app that make sense to your target users abroad. You may already be thinking that there is more to iOS localization than meets the eye. You’re right! Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice. 1. Thinking You Don’t Need All That IOS Localization What? After our inspiring remarks above, could anybody who has read this far doubt that localization is important, even essential to iOS app commercial success? The point we are making here is rather subtler. Don’t think that localization is simply about translating from one language to another. For instance, if you are an English-speaking person, your point of reference in terms of search engines is probably Google, the 800 pound SE gorilla in the Western world. But not in China (1 billion plus people), where Baidu beats Google. GALA, the Globalization and Localization Association, points out that “Baidu does better than Google because it looks and feels fully native to the Chinese-speaking audience.” The moral of the story is that localization may have to be done at more than one level, and that in some cases an overly shallow approach may not get you any more business benefit than no localization at all. 2. Confusing Internationalization and Localization This is a key point when you’re trying to hammer out release schedules of localized versions with your development team. Full of enthusiasm, you want your Japanese localized version now, and your Spanish version by yesterday. After all, it’s just a matter of handing the app over to translators, right? Not quite. What your development team is probably patiently trying to tell you is that before producing these different localized versions, the software needs to be internationalized. Internationalization essentially ensures that your app can be sensibly localized into any language. It takes care of aspects like number and date formats, changing positions of variables in sentences according to language, and plurals. As an eye-opener, ask your development team how plurals work in Russian and Hebrew, for example, compared to English. Luckily, Apple’s iOS development framework offers developers tools to help get plurals and other tricky issues right the first time for any language. Once the internationalization has been done properly, localization into a specific language is more a matter of handing over a file for translation to a competent translator or translation agency. A decision about whether to add a new localized language can then be as simple as a calculation taking into account the potential additional revenue compared with the translation costs and support effort. 3. Not Distinguishing Between Different Versions of the Same Language Do you think English is the same, wherever it’s used? A quick look at date formats between US and UK English will prove the contrary. If you tell a British native that it’s October 5 using a US date format (10/5), he or she will think you mean May 10. And how about Chinese? GALA suggests that 30 percent of the Chinese population does not speak the country’s national language. Chinese consists of seven different versions or linguistic classifications: Gan (Jiangzinese), Guan (Mandarin), Kejia (Hakka), Min (Hokkien), Wu (Shanghainese), Xiang (Hunanese) and Yue (Cantonese). Mandarin Chinese federates 1.3 billion speakers worldwide, but Cantonese and the Min language are in close second and third position. The equivalent in the US market, for instance, would be to produce different versions of your app for New Yorkers, Texans, Californians, and Alaskans. In the US, this extra effort would be unlikely to make business sense, because standard US English is understood across the country. By comparison, for China, the effort is essential because many people using one version of Chinese will simply not understand people using another version. 4. Missing Or Mishandling Key Localization Aspects Of An App Don’t expect your developers to cover absolutely all the bases when it comes to localization. While they may correctly identify the different user-facing texts in the app, including help and error messages, they may not appreciate other niceties. One example is keyword optimization to help your localized iOS app garner more attention and more users in the Apple App Store. In this case, you cannot even rely on the correct translation of the keywords that work for your iOS app in your home market. The reason for this is that keywords that work for a given market depend on factors specific to that market, such as culture, politics, and national or regional events. For instance, linking your app to a popular presidential candidate in the US could do wonders for take-up in America. Yet it may fall flat in Germany, where they have their own national politics to keep them busy. Localization of a keyword has to be done from the inside out, so to speak, by first finding out which local language keywords are important to potential users of your app within that country and how fierce the local competition is to be ranked on such keywords. 5. Using Automated Translation For understanding the general sense of a text written in a foreign language, automated translation software can be useful. However, for making a favorable impression on end-users, it can leave a lot to be desired. Such software can give very good results in some cases, and very bad results in others, but you’ll never know whether you’re getting the good or the bad. A classic example is the phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak,” ending up translated into other languages as “The wine is ready, but the meat is underdone.” So don’t give in to pressure from your development team to simply run your app’s file for localization through an automated translation system. They may not have developed your superior sensitivity to the far-reaching linguistic and cultural issues at stake (unless you give them this article to read.) While automated systems continue to improve in quality, there is no guarantee they will be able to replace human translation, at least in the foreseeable future. Competent human translation is therefore what you need, with empathy for your targeted end-users for a given localization. 6. Expecting Your Translators to Work “Blind” Context and situation are often vital pieces of information for a good iOS localization. A word in one language may have several completely different possible translations in another. Classic examples in English for iOS and other software applications are words like “run” and “clear.” Only additional information about the context can help a translator understand whether the words in question are nouns, verbs, adjectives, or some other grammatical construct. Checking translations after they have been done requires painstaking verification word by word. Murphy’s Law then says that the one or two incorrect translations that slip through will be precisely the ones that do maximum damage to the credibility and reputation of your app in its localized version. A better way forward is to give information to translators ahead of time, for instance as comments in the files to be translated. Your smarter, more localization-sensitive developers will already understand the desirability of doing this; you may have to gently educate the others. 7. Failing To Use Native Language Speakers to Test the Localized Version You need human translators to produce a localized version of your app. You also need native speaker human beings to check the final result. It is true that Apple gives developers tools to check if localization of words or phrases has been missed, or if translations will cause screen layout problems due to differences in length. These tools are valuable, but they do not replace native speaker capabilities and judgment about the overall quality of a translation, and whether the localization will meet with approval and subscriptions in the market concerned. Conclusion The big takeaway from all this is that successful iOS localization is about seeing things from the point of view of the customer or user in the market you are targeting. This is a simple to say, but not always easy to do. Nevertheless, two important factors can help your iOS localizations to succeed. The first is that the localization tools Apple provides within the iOS framework can help your developers better understand and handle the issues of different languages. The second is that localization tools and local market experts and are available, externally if not internally, to give you an objective appraisal of what works in your localized app and what should be improved. So with these resources to help you, good luck… or rather, good localization!

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo 3/3 By David Morgan | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple (AAPL.O), Pfizer (PFE.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. Tax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Trump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. Bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. "On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach," said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. "There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years." At the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. Corporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. Trump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. Trump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. Such proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Democrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. The one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. Infrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. The four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co (GE.N) ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO). The European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was "a fair rate" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. BUSINESS SUPPORT The House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a "territorial" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income. Trump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. Some are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. "In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue," said Republican Representative Tom Cole. The House Republican plan has had significant support from business. Kumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc (AA.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) to Alphabet's Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). "We know what we want," said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a "modern, competitive" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. The House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. Trump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. Business lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.

The Washington Post 4 days ago Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin © BigStock The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government’s powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy — especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him. But as some prepare to take new high-tech defensive measures against government intrusion, there also is a note of regret: The campaign of Trump’s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, suffered several disruptions when poorly protected emails fell into the hands of Russian hackers, WikiLeaks and, finally, the FBI. Better digital security, including measures long advocated by some experts, might have prevented Clinton’s defeat, they say. These twin forces — fear and regret — are fueling demands for the tech industry to push a new wave of security and privacy upgrades that would build on those adopted by the tech industry in the aftermath of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Such measures could impede criminal hackers and foreign intelligence services but also make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover and collect evidence in authorized investigations. “Everyone is asking about the role of the surveillance state in a Trump presidency,” said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. “People are very worried and urgently trying to figure out what they can do.” In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday’s election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. Hey, no joke, and I'm paraphrasing smarter people. If you plan on opposing Trump: Get Tor. Get Signal. Get a VPN 2FA on your emails. Now. — John Rogers (@jonrog1) November 9, 2016 “My Twitter timeline is off the hook,” said Larry Gadea, founder and chief executive of the start-up, Envoy, which enables businesses to register visitors using iPads. “People are saying to use bitcoin and encrypted messages, etc.” Officials from tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook said that they were watching closely for clues to Trump’s technology policies. During the campaign, Trump vowed to “penetrate the Internet” to prevent the Islamic State from using it to recruit fighters and chastised Apple for refusing to create a back door that would let the FBI unlock an iPhone used by the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings. Lobbyists for Internet companies, including Amazon, Uber and Airbnb, arranged a meeting among themselves for next week and scrambled to publish a position paper on such subjects as immigration and cybersecurity. Officials at the companies said it was difficult to know how Trump would act because his campaign had barely communicated with the tech sector. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Tech companies have raced to protect consumer data from government intrusion since the Snowden revelations. Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Yahoo have all made significant investments in encryption to address customer concerns about privacy invasions. A secure messaging app called Signal was the top trending item Thursday in Apple’s App Store. “A lot of people have been seeing the writing on the wall,” said Moxie Marlinspike, founder of Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal. “It’s immensely clear that things have not generally been in great shape in terms of private communications. … That’s something that everybody is concerned about.” But some efforts have lagged — with unsettling consequences. The hacking of nude celebrity photos in August 2014 revealed weaknesses in Apple’s iCloud service for backing up data. The hack of Sony Pictures a few months later revealed vulnerabilities in server security. And the breach of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account in March 2016 provided the raw material for months of embarrassing disclosures exploited by Trump. Experts say the Podesta hack might have been prevented by a security feature called “two-factor authentication,” which Google has long made available to its users but has not required. “Two-factor authentication” requires users to have both a password and a “second factor” — often a numeric code delivered by a text or authentication app — to access their accounts. The most advanced hackers still might have found a way to access Podesta’s accounts, but it would have been far more difficult, experts say. “The people at the top are just as bad at computer security as regular Americans,” said Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union. “They are sitting ducks for the most basic of attacks.” In a live-stream video appearance Thursday, Snowden also urged Internet users to adopt two-factor authentication. Although some hacks appear to be the work of foreign intelligence services — U.S. officials blamed the Sony hack on North Korea — the election of Trump has revived fear of the U.S. government itself. In the closing days of the campaign, the FBI unexpectedly and publicly reopened its investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server after finding thousands of emails on a computer used by an aide, Huma Abedin. That discovery, which came during an unrelated probe into Abedin's estranged husband, might never have been made, experts say, if Abedin had used a security measure called “end-to-end encryption” that makes it more difficult for anybody other than the intended recipient to access messages or even their routing information. There is even more concern about the reach of the NSA, whose sprawling surveillance apparatus sparked a worldwide backlash after Snowden shared troves of information with The Post and other news organizations. Even some people who defended the NSA under President Obama have expressed concern about how it might be used by Trump. “I have full faith that the appropriate balance of power and constraint exist when people play by the rules. It’s not clear yet that a President Trump would,” said former NSA lawyer Susan Hennessey, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “There’s certainly potential for huge abuse of the national security apparatus, both at the NSA and across the intelligence community.” Andrea Peterson contributed to this report.

One firm the Republican has had public disagreements with is Apple – he once called for a boycott of the company's products. But CEO Tim Cook has called for unity among his employees. Buzzfeed News got hold of an internal memo sent out by Cook, which, while not mentioning Trump by name, refers to the “strong feelings” many people will have following the election result. The Apple chief also talks about the openness and diversity of Apple staff in the US and around the world. “We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” wrote Cook. After Apple refused to help the FBI access the locked iPhone used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, Trump asked “Who do they [Apple] think they are?” before calling for a boycott of the firm's products. The President-elect also said he would force Apple to make all of its devices in the US, if he wins the election - a move that could spell economic disaster for the iPhone maker. Tim Cook isn't the only CEO who’s faced Trump’s wrath in the past; he was also involved in a public feud with Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. Trump accused him of purchasing The Washington Post simply to lower Amazon’s tax bill, and called Bezos out over antitrust issues and the Post’s negative coverage of the Trump campaign. “Believe me, if I become president, oh, do they [Amazon] have problems. They're going to have such problems," Trump said. Here’s Tim Cook’s message in full: Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together!

The trade-in program is only available in the United States, and your qualifying device must be in good working order, with no broken components, its device warranty in place, and with its original chargers/accessories included. The value of your MacBook will be appraised, and you’ll receive a promo code for that amount of money off the price of your new Surface device. This can be done in a Microsoft retail store or through its official online store. It should be noted that the $650 promo code is a best-case-scenario reserved for the newer MacBook models. Switching From Apple to Microsoft Microsoft actually launched this trade-in program on October 27th, with the offer originally pencilled in to end today (November 10). However, as spotted by VentureBeat, for reasons unknown to us, Microsoft has now extended the offer until November 23rd.

A European reseller, however, has just indicated the launch may be much sooner than that. An employee of Apple reseller Conrad told a customer it would receive stock on November 17th and make them available for purchase November 18th or 19th. The store’s website, however, still indicates a longer wait of seven to eight weeks, but the report does provide some hope that the AirPods will be available for the holiday season.

Technology 2 0 0 November 10, 2016 iMac 2017 Release Date And Rumors: Apple’s Kaby Lake Machines To Be Introduced With iPad Pro 2? Simon Alvarez It is no secret that Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac, is long overdue for an innovation. The latest iteration of the iMac that Apple currently sells was unveiled two years ago and simply refreshed last year, which corresponds to a very long time in the tech industry. Prior to the unveiling of the MacBook Pro 2016, numerous rumors emerged stating that Apple would be releasing the next-generation iMac in the event as well. Unfortunately, the iMac was not mentioned at all during the tech giant’s October 27 “Hello Again” event, fueling speculations that the device would be unveiled in early 2017 instead. Considering the delay in the iMac’s release, rumors are high that the next-generation, all-in-one desktop computer from Apple would feature the most advanced technologies currently available in the market today. Most of the rumors about the iMac 2017 are very encouraging, with speculations painting a picture of a powerhouse device that would be quite a match with its biggest and most formidable rival, Microsoft’s Surface Studio. One of the biggest possible reasons behind the considerable delay of the iMac 2017’s release would be Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. While Apple settled on sixth-generation Skylake processors for the MacBook Pro 2016, there is a very slim chance that Apple would do the same strategy for the 2017 iMac. After all, between the two devices, the iMac has traditionally been more powerful than the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2016’s aging Skylake chips are already pretty much maximized by Apple’s latest power laptops. Thus, using Intel’s Skylake chips for the iMac 2017 would simply not work. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] A recent Intel report unearthed by AnandTech found that the premier chip-maker is preparing for the release of 11 quad-core Kaby Lake processors within the first three months of 2017. According to the report, included in Intel’s release would be seven Core i5, three Core i7, and one Xeon E3 v6 processor. These, of course, are the chips that have been rumored for the iMac 2017 for some time now. If the unearthed report proves true, each of the chips in the Kaby Lake family is significantly faster than their counterparts in the Skylake generation. Thus, these upcoming chips would be perfect for Apple’s upcoming flagship all-in-one. As for the release date of the iMac 2017, Apple would definitely need to step up its game, as the all-in-one market just got a lot more competitive with the arrival of the Microsoft Surface Studio. The Surface Studio is leagues above the current iMac right now and features support for the Surface Pen and a new innovative tool called the Surface Dial. The iMac has always prided itself as one of the best productivity and creativity devices in the market, but with the Surface Studio around, Apple’s all-in-one has been thrown far back in the race. With this in mind, speculations are high that Apple would be releasing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2. In a lot of ways, this does make sense, since the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 4-inch iPhone SE were unveiled last March. Considering the cycle of Apple products, a March, 2017, reveal seems very likely. [Image by Brian Kersey/Getty Images] Revealing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2 within the first three months of next year would be beneficial for Apple since both devices are in need of an upgrade. Apple’s iPads have seen a notable decline in sales recently, and the iPad Pro line has not been as successful as the tech giant might have wanted. Thus, March, 2017, would be the perfect time to unveil both the iMac 2017 and the iPad Pro 2. The iMac 2017 would be arriving at the all-in-one market in a position that is far different than before. While all-in-one machines have been around for some time, the iMac has always taken a very notable spot as one of the best productivity machines in the industry. This has caused the device to be embraced by many, despite its relatively high price. With the market more competitive than ever, and with a very formidable rival already being released, Apple’s iMac 2017 would need to surmount a mountain of challenges. Then again, Apple has always had a magic touch with its products. The entry-level iPhone 6S only had 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, but the tech giant’s loyal fans still supported it, allowing the rather underpowered device to outsell its more robust competitors. With the iMac 2017, however, the tech giant would not have the luxury to pull its punches. Apple would need to do everything it can to make sure that true to rumors about the device, the iMac 2017 would be its best all-in-one desktop computer yet. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcoG8hZjNtw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Paralyzed Monkey Walks Again After Implant Now Read This: ‘Pokemon Go’: The Trick To Creating New Pokestops Brings Hope To Rural Trainers Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Simon Alvarez Tags: Apple, iMac 2017, iPad Pro 2 Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘Married To Medicine’ Star Lisa Nicole Cloud Doesn’t Trust Husband After Stripper Scandal? ‘Teen Mom’ Amber Portwood Shows Off Plastic Surgery Results, As Her Fiancé Finally Comes Clean About His Sobriety Olivia Newton-John Launches New Christmas Album With John Farnham, Delights In Daughter Chloe’s Successful Recovery Peru Vs.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple and (Product) Red go back a long way. From iPods to iPhone cases, Apple has made it a regular habit of including a (Product) Red color option for most of its devices, and it is continuing the tradition with some of its Beats products. The Beast Solo3 wireless headphones and Pill+ Bluetooth speaker will soon be available in what Apple is calling Citrus Red color option. It’s more of a bright red, similar to what is available for the iPhone silicone and leather cases. These colors are arriving just in time for Christmas. These are the same Solo3 headphones that also come with the Apple’s new W1 chip, which will make connecting them to your iPhone that much easier. The Solo3 headphones will retail for $299.95 while the Pill+ will cost $229.95. Apple didn’t relay a release date for the (Product) Red options, just stating they’ll be “coming soon.” Apple also announced the Beats Solo3 and urBeats earphones in Ultra Violet. It’s softer and less vibrant than the (Product) Red and looks pretty nice. If you are starting to plan out your Christmas shopping list, these new options might be good for people who prefer a bit of color.

America Write : 2016-11-11 10:06:42 Update : 2016-11-11 13:49:25 Apple overtook Samsung Electronics to take the highest market share in the North American market during the third quarter. According to Strategy Analytics on Friday, Apple seized a 33-point-one percent market share in North America in the July to September period in terms of smartphone shipments. Samsung, which took the number one position in the April to June period at 32-point-seven percent, tumbled by eight-point-three percentage points to 24-point-four percent. The fall of Samsung’s market share is partly attributed to a massive recall and resulting production halt of the Galaxy Note 7. Meanwhile, LG Electronics maintained the position of the third largest smartphone vendor in North America with a market share of 15-point-seven percent, down by zero-point-six percentage points from the previous quarter. The U.S.' ZTE came in fourth at eight-point-seven percent, followed by China's TCL-Alcatel at seven-point-seven percent. China’s Huawei, the third biggest smartphone vendor worldwide, settled for the tenth highest market share in North America at zero-point-five percent.  News List Outflow of Foreign Capital after Trump's Election Victory 2016-11-15 This Year's Rice Production Slips 3% from 2015 2016-11-15 Vice Minister Highlights Mutual Benefits of KORUS FTA 2016-11-15 Samsung to Buy US Auto-Systems Maker Harman for $8 Billion 2016-11-15 Top 3 Shipbuilders Lay Off 3,000 Employees in Q3 2016-11-14 Global Trade Hits 6-Year Low 2016-11-14 Working-level TF on Dealing with Next US Gov't Trade Policies Launches 2016-11-14 KOSPI, KOSDAQ Swing Lower on Monday 2016-11-14 Gov’t Succeeds in Privatizing Woori Bank 2016-11-14 KERI: S.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience. Google uses Chrome's reach to give your phone a better web CNET 4 days ago Stephen Shankland © Provided by CNET A Google Chrome lapel pin The web has taken a beating in the smartphone era. But it's about to start beating back. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.45 +0.74 +0.70% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.70 +0.58 +1.00% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.94 -0.14 -0.68% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.69 +0.32 +1.00% Explosive growth of the web, starting in the 1990s, connected the world's population. In the last decade, though, we all started tapping app icons instead of web hyperlinks to chat with friends, share photos and buy products online. Now Google's Chrome team and browser allies from Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft are putting a new twist on things. It's called progressive web apps, or PWAs. They endow websites with many of the advantages of native apps that run on Google's Android or Apple's iOS. And they can outdo native apps when it comes to fast, hassle-free loading. PWAs are headlining this week at the Chrome Dev Summit, Google's two-day conference in San Francisco for programmers who want to figure out where Google is taking browser technology. Native apps hog the spotlight, but at the conference, Google will reveal a good reason why browsers generally and Chrome in particular also deserve a place on the stage: unbeatable reach. "We have over 2 billion Chrome instances that are active" each month, said Darin Fisher, Google's vice president of Chrome engineering and the conference's opening speaker. That amounts to fewer than 2 billion people, because a single person can use Chrome on multiple devices, but it's still a platform with immense power. That power is essential to making Google's vision a reality. If it succeeds, that browser icon might be the one you reach for on your home screen a lot more often. Success on that front also could help restore the fortunes of the web, the closest the computing industry has come to freeing us from software that works only on one device or another, like a Windows laptop but not an iPhone. In an era when tech giants wield tremendous power, the web levels the playing field and makes it easier for new competitors to join the game. It's no wonder Google is pushing the mobile web. This month, browser usage on tablets and phones for the first time surpassed usage on PCs, analytics firm StatCounter said. App fatigue Apps might get the glory, but the web does a lot of the work already. When we need to interact with a business or service, a website is often our first point of contact. Apps are popular, with millions available in Apple and Google app stores, but it's hard to convince people to install them, and even then, most lie dormant. Among American adults, "almost half...report that they use five or fewer apps at least once per week, and just 16 percent indicate that they use more than 10 apps on a regular basis," a 2016 Pew Research Center study found. And Localytics, which monitors app usage, found that 23 percent of users never reopen an app after the first time and that only about a fifth of people are likely to still use an app after three months. Fisher isn't pronouncing native apps dead, but he thinks PWAs means the web can shoulder more of the load. "It's expensive to get people to install an app," Fisher said, but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers, he said, "there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." There's a place for both apps and websites, analyst firm Gartner believes. "A mobile website is more generic, with wider reach, like your ABC or CBS or Fox or NBC channels," said Research Director Jason Wong, while native apps are akin to "a cable channel like the Cooking Channel or MTV targeted toward a specific segment." Apps are great for people who use a company's services are lot, like the 10 percent or 15 percent of users who come back to an e-commerce site frequently, but websites are crucial for the rest. "The mobile web is unavoidable. Users are using smartphones and tablets to access websites more and more. Google has changed its [search] algorithm to reward mobile-optimized websites," Wong said. "It's imperative companies move to responsive and mobile-optimized websites." Progressive web what? If you're browsing the web, you won't see any fancy label announcing a progressive web app. But done well, you'll like it. The first idea behind a PWA is that websites arrive as fast as possible in basic form so you can get started immediately, then gradually flesh themselves out in the background -- thus the term progressive. Compare that to a typical native app that often requires you to download tens of megabytes of data and wait for an installation before you can get started. They're not for every situation right now -- games, for example. But PWAs can be appropriate for lots of situations with native apps, like social networking, e-commerce, news and streaming video. PWAs also download components so they work offline. And they take advantage of push notification abilities for the web -- for example, Carnival Cruise's site can prompt customers to finalize a reservation before it expires in 24 hours. And PWAs can be placed as a home-screen icon so you're more likely to use them again. The results have convinced companies like the Washington Post, Housing.com in India and Chinese e-commece giant Alibaba. Also, CNET launched its own progressive web app Thursday. Tap this Tech Today link on your phone or tablet if you're curious. When Alibaba moved to a PWA, it found a website visit was 76 percent more likely to convert into a website transaction. Among Android device users, monthly usage increased 30 percent, and for those with iPhones and iPads, monthly usage increased 14 percent. PWAs are particularly popular in developing countries where mobile networks are slow and coverage is spotty, said Alex Komoroske, a Chrome group product manager. Using a cheap, low-end Android phone with an older 3G connection, downloading FlipKart's e-commerce native app took 14 minutes, but the company's progressive web app took 14 seconds, he said. Where's Apple? Google has built into Chrome much of the required supporting technology, including push notifications. Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Edge are on board, too, making it safer for web programmers to bet on PWAs. Apple hasn't joined the party with its Safari browser, but Fisher is optimistic. If 50,000 website developers start using PWA technologies, "you can imagine Safari engineers will see there's a lot of interest," Fisher said. "Developers can have some influence, voting with their feet for what they care about." Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple forbids other browser makers from using their own browser engines on iPhones and iPads, so running Chrome doesn't enable PWAs on those devices. Apple's lack of support is "a real concern for developers," Fisher said, but embracing the PWA approach still boosts performance on Apple's iOS-powered devices. Easier payments And progressive web apps will benefit from web payment technology where Apple is ahead, letting you easily complete a purchase with Apple Pay. A more general technology, the web payments interface, is coming to mobile browsers to connect to Android Pay, a credit card, Alibaba's AliPay service, Apple Pay, or whatever other payment mechanism your phone offers. It all leads to vast improvements over the plodding, hard-to-read websites still common with mobile browsing. "Everybody should be building a progressive web app," Fisher said. "It just makes sense."

Whining, complaining and hypocrisy - I most certainly am not a fan. Tues., Nov. 8, was a pivotal day for this great nation. The expected victor was most surprisingly defeated in one of our country’s most divisive elections to date, and a reality TV star – for all intents and purposes – was chosen to move this country forward. While, I didn’t vote for Barrack Obama, and mocked his policies from time-to-time, nonetheless he was / is President of this great nation. In a couple short months, Donald Trump will be sworn into office, a new day in American politics will begin, and some tech firms are quite curious about what this means – most notably, Apple. Most of us are on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or some form of social media. Many of us have cut ties with people as a result of this vicious election cycle, and the many words and many lines drawn in the sand during that time.  Back in June, Apple drew a line of its own by refusing to support the 2016 Republican National Convention (as a result of Trump calling for a boycott of Apple products back in February), and yesterday, Tim Cook went out of his way to assure Apple employees it is business as usual moving forward. As he references in his memo, this highly contested election left many with “strong feelings,” but as Cook clearly illustrates  -Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed” and the only way to change the world is to move forward. Similar to the standard peaceful transition of power, Cook shared a message of hope and unity – exactly what Trump did Tuesday evening.  While I’m not sure if Cook is more focused on Apple’s bottom line, his employees’ well-being or America, he did what a responsible executive should do. I’m not one to parade around singing the high praises of Apple (full disclosure, I’m definitely not an Apple person), but in this instance, instead of my typical criticisms of Cook’s lack of innovation, all I can do is applaud his efforts. Many Americans are upset – to say the least – as droves of young and old go to the streets to display displeasure. But the fact of the matter is this: That won’t change Tuesday’s election results. The nation can move forward together or continue on its torrid path of division.  Don’t be fooled, I’m not pro-Trump, I’m pro-America. And, lest we forget, if he fails, we ALL fail. It’s time to put down the signs, stop the chants of four-letter and foul words; it’s time to put the pieces back together. Don’t allow partisanship to overpower reason, if you’re angry at the results do something to enact change four years from now, don’t stand in the way of today’s progress – blame the system, blame those that didn’t vote, blame ignorance in the American electorate, but don’t propagate fear and uncertainty in the meantime.   God Bless America. Tim Cook’s complete memo is below: Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together!

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 11, 2016 -- 00:22 GMT (16:22 PST) | Topic: Hardware Walmart's Black Friday ad includes an Apple iPad mini 2 sale and $119 Chromebook deal. The Black Friday ad wars are finally starting to heat up, with Walmart's ad surfacing shortly after Target's. Like its rival, it has more tablet deals than ads leaked earlier in the cycle -- including Apple's iPad -- along with specials on several low-cost laptops. While Target has three different iPad models on sale, Walmart just has one -- not surprisingly, the Apple's cheapest model. The iPad mini 2 is discounted to $199, 79 cents less than what Target is going to be offering it for. Walmart makes up for it with a number of Android tablet specials, including a 7-inch RCA for just $28. It also has the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7-inch slate for $69 (99 cents lower than at Staples, with a $10 Google Play thrown in) and the Lenovo Tab 10 model for $99 ($50 off the regular price). Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Also listed are a trio of tablets with bundled wireless keyboards, including a RCA Cambio 10.1-inch device that runs Windows 10 for $99, though that's only about $10 less than the current price on the Walmart website. There are a pair of Android 2-in-1 deals in the form of a 10.1-inch SmarTab with Intel Atom processor for $72, and a 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro for $98. Given their surging popularity, Chromebooks have been largely unseen in Black Friday ads thus far. Walmart has one, however, at a low price of $119. For that price ($60 less than Samsung is currently selling it for online), the Samsung Chromebook 3 gives you an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, and a 11.6-inch display. If you want a cheap Windows 10 laptop instead, you'll have to pay a bit more ($199) for the HP 15-ba018wm with AMD E2-7110 processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. Walmart has three additional budget notebook listed in Black Friday ad, each with a 15.6-inch displays. These include the HP 15-f222wm with an Intel Pentium N3540 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and touchscreen for $249, and an Acer laptop with Intel Core i5 chip, 6GB of memory, and 1TB hard drive for $299. Finally, for a little more ($349), there's the HP 15-ba051wm with AMD A10-9600P processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and choice of chassis color, along with a wireless mouse, 16GB flash drive, and a sleeve included in the price.

Apple gives each refurbished iPhone a new battery and outer shell, the company says, and it comes with a 1-year warranty. Don't expect bargain-basement prices, though. A 64GB iPhone 6S Plus costs $589, a $110 savings over the new-phone price. A 16GB iPhone 6S model is $80 off, at $449. Apple declined to comment.

"The government disagrees profoundly with the commission's analysis in the Apple state aid case, and our position on all aspects of the case is very well known," the spokesman added. Ireland's appeal comes after the Commission's ruling in August that Apple must pay EUR13 billion ($14.2 billion) in back-taxes, arguing Ireland broke EU state aid rules. The EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the deal Ireland offered Apple allowed the US tech firm to pay a corporate tax rate of 1 percent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 percent in 2014. Immediately after the Commission ruling the Irish government said it would appeal the decision, on the basis that Apple had paid its taxes to the Irish state in full. Dublin also cited the potential impact retrospective penalties could have on its future ability to attract foreign direct investment. Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Noonan said Ireland's reputation had been damaged unfairly by the commission's stance. "We don't believe that Apple owed this money in Ireland at all," he said. "We share the OECD view that whatever they owe they owe to the United States and they paid everything that was due to be paid in Ireland," he said during an address to the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in the European Parliament. Noonan added that Apple is the biggest corporate taxpayer in Ireland on profits generated in the country, where the multinational employs 6,000 people in its Cork city campus.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Craig Timberg and Elizabeth Dwoskin November 10 Follow @craigtimberg Follow @lizzadwoskin (BigStock) The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government’s powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy — especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him. But as some prepare to take new high-tech defensive measures against government intrusion, there also is a note of regret: The campaign of Trump’s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, suffered several disruptions when poorly protected emails fell into the hands of Russian hackers, WikiLeaks and, finally, the FBI. Better digital security, including measures long advocated by some experts, might have prevented Clinton’s defeat, they say. These twin forces — fear and regret — are fueling demands for the tech industry to push a new wave of security and privacy upgrades that would build on those adopted by the tech industry in the aftermath of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Such measures could impede criminal hackers and foreign intelligence services but also make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover and collect evidence in authorized investigations. “Everyone is asking about the role of the surveillance state in a Trump presidency,” said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. “People are very worried and urgently trying to figure out what they can do.” In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday’s election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. Hey, no joke, and I'm paraphrasing smarter people. If you plan on opposing Trump: Get Tor. Get Signal. Get a VPN 2FA on your emails. Now. — John Rogers (@jonrog1) November 9, 2016 “My Twitter timeline is off the hook,” said Larry Gadea, founder and chief executive of the start-up, Envoy, which enables businesses to register visitors using iPads. “People are saying to use bitcoin and encrypted messages, etc.” Officials from tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook said that they were watching closely for clues to Trump’s technology policies. During the campaign, Trump vowed to “penetrate the Internet” to prevent the Islamic State from using it to recruit fighters and chastised Apple for refusing to create a back door that would let the FBI unlock an iPhone used by the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings. Lobbyists for Internet companies, including Amazon, Uber and Airbnb, arranged a meeting among themselves for next week and scrambled to publish a position paper on such subjects as immigration and cybersecurity. Officials at the companies said it was difficult to know how Trump would act because his campaign had barely communicated with the tech sector. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) [How Trump could dismantle net neutrality and the rest of Obama's Internet legacy] Tech companies have raced to protect consumer data from government intrusion since the Snowden revelations. Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Yahoo have all made significant investments in encryption to address customer concerns about privacy invasions. A secure messaging app called Signal was the top trending item Thursday in Apple’s App Store. “A lot of people have been seeing the writing on the wall,” said Moxie Marlinspike, founder of Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal. “It’s immensely clear that things have not generally been in great shape in terms of private communications. … That’s something that everybody is concerned about.” But some efforts have lagged — with unsettling consequences. The hacking of nude celebrity photos in August 2014 revealed weaknesses in Apple’s iCloud service for backing up data. The hack of Sony Pictures a few months later revealed vulnerabilities in server security. And the breach of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account in March 2016 provided the raw material for months of embarrassing disclosures exploited by Trump. Experts say the Podesta hack might have been prevented by a security feature called “two-factor authentication,” which Google has long made available to its users but has not required. “Two-factor authentication” requires users to have both a password and a “second factor” — often a numeric code delivered by a text or authentication app — to access their accounts. The most advanced hackers still might have found a way to access Podesta’s accounts, but it would have been far more difficult, experts say. “The people at the top are just as bad at computer security as regular Americans,” said Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union. “They are sitting ducks for the most basic of attacks.” In a live-stream video appearance Thursday, Snowden also urged Internet users to adopt two-factor authentication. Although some hacks appear to be the work of foreign intelligence services — U.S. officials blamed the Sony hack on North Korea — the election of Trump has revived fear of the U.S. government itself. In the closing days of the campaign, Clinton’s use of a private email server was unexpectedly and publicly raised again by the FBI after the agency found thousands of emails on a computer used by an aide, Huma Abedin. That discovery, which came during an unrelated probe into Abedin's estranged husband, might never have been made, experts say, if Abedin had used a security measure called “end-to-end encryption” that makes it more difficult for anybody other than the intended recipient to access messages or even their routing information. There is even more concern about the reach of the NSA, whose sprawling surveillance apparatus sparked a worldwide backlash after Snowden shared troves of information with The Post and other news organizations. Even some people who defended the NSA under President Obama have expressed concern about how it might be used by Trump. “I have full faith that the appropriate balance of power and constraint exist when people play by the rules. It’s not clear yet that a President Trump would,” said former NSA lawyer Susan Hennessey, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “There’s certainly potential for huge abuse of the national security apparatus, both at the NSA and across the intelligence community.” Andrea Peterson contributed to this report. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens) Photo Credit: AP / Kathy Willens advertisement | advertise on newsday If anyone knows what rookie cornerback Eli Apple is going through right now, it’s Landon Collins. With Apple coming off one of his worst games — he was benched in the third quarter of last Sunday’s 28-23 win over the Eagles — it’s second-year safety Collins that has firsthand experience with rookie struggles. Latest Giants stories Giants’ defense clamps down on Bengals in crunch time Newhouse picks up slack at guard Wade saves four points with jarring hit at goal line Giants manage to keep in step with rest of NFC East Odell Beckham Jr. shines under MNF lights Though Collins was never benched last season, mostly because the Giants were so injury-riddled at safety that they had no choice but to play the second-round rookie, he struggled enough to know that Apple’s difficult NFL indoctrination is to be expected. “Some things, you just have to go through,” Collins said Thursday. “You just have to learn from it. Once you learn from it, it’s like you know what’s going to happen before it happens, so you don’t allow it to happen.” Collins is the ultimate example of a player making a quantum leap from his first year to his second; after a mistake-filled rookie season, Collins has been named NFC Defensive Player of the Week after the Giants’ last two games. He believes Apple will enjoy that eventual success; in the meantime, he’ll just have to go through the rookie growing pains. GiantsGiants’ Collins emerging as leader of secondary And the Giants will give him that chance. While Apple doesn’t want to give away the game plan by saying how much he’ll be playing in Monday night’s game against the Bengals at MetLife Stadium, he offered this much: He’ll play. advertisement | advertise on newsday “Yeah, I’ll be back,” Apple said after Thursday’s practice. “I’ve just got to get back to my form. Just being out [with a hamstring injury that forced him to miss two games and most of another], that kind of stunted things. Just got to get back out there.” Apple said Collins has been an invaluable resource this week. “Anything you do, you’re going to have some bad days,” Apple said. “[Collins] was just telling me his experiences, and trying to help me out with that. He gave me a good insight on things, and he’s someone who’s playing real well right now. Everybody goes through growing pains. It’s just something you have to learn from and move forward.” Collins is there for his teammate. GiantsWho is Eli Apple? “Whatever he needs to ask me, I know the whole defense,” Collins said. “If he needs anything on the defensive side, I’m there.” Giants videos Collins wishes he had someone to lean on during what turned out to be a difficult rookie season. “There was a lot of pressure on me, and I think if I just had a veteran guy next to me, I think it would have been better,” he said. “I had Brandon [Meriweather], but I mean a guy that knew the system [under defensive coordinator Steve Spag nuolo], someone that was here and been in the system and been in the NFL for a while.” Like Antrel Rolle, who was released after the 2014 season? “Yes, Antrel would have helped me out in the long term,” Collins said. “I just had to do it on my own, and it was a big learning curve. It just pushed me to be greater than I was last year.” Subscribe to Newsday’s sports newsletter Receive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events. sign up    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 10, 2016 at 5:18PM Image source: Apple. The new TV app from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a great content aggregator. It collects all of the various video content consumers have access to through iTunes downloads, stand-alone streaming services, and on-demand streaming services that use pay-TV credentials. But there are a couple of major omissions: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those omissions have led many people to criticize the app, since at least 50 million Americans watch some of their television through Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. That severely limits Apple's new app in its ability to find and recommend the best content for each user. What's more, it's unlikely Netflix will ever sign on. Netflix gets a lot of value out of controlling its user experience The big issue with Apple's TV app, from Netflix's standpoint, is that it cedes control of the user experience to Apple. That could be good for stand-alone networks and online pay-TV streaming portals, which generally have poor user interfaces and low adoption. But for Netflix, which has a quality user interface and strong adoption, it's unnecessary and even detrimental to its business. Most egregiously, Apple would take over the content recommendation from Netflix, something Netflix relies on to improve watch time and churn. Earlier this year, Netflix published a paper claiming its recommendation engine saves the company $1 billion per year. "When produced and used correctly," the authors say, "recommendations lead to meaningful increases in overall engagement with the product (e.g., streaming hours) and lower subscription cancellations rates." Additionally, the TV app removes a lot of branding from the user interface. That could have a negative impact on churn for a service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. If it's more unclear where this content is coming from, it's harder for users to justify $10 a month for one of those services. Overall, it's more likely services with a strong brand and user interface such as Netflix or Amazon will see a negative impact from Apple's TV app than the potential positives. Netflix wants its data all to itself On top of the potential detriments to Netflix's user experience, Netflix's participation in the TV app would open up a lot of its data to Apple. Netflix is historically very private about its viewer data, as is Amazon. It won't even share its data with the people responsible for creating its original content. Netflix's viewer data is one of its biggest competitive advantages. It lets it spend its content budget effectively and efficiently. It's also one of the reasons its original series have managed to become so popular. With Apple's increasing interest in producing original video content -- starting with Apple Music exclusives -- Netflix's viewer data would be immensely valuable. On the flip side, for Netflix to let its data fall into the hands of Apple could give rise to another big competitor. Even if the adoption rate of Apple's TV app remains relatively low, Netflix's participation would probably generate a significant increase in adoption. As a result, evaluating the impact of Netflix's inclusion is difficult. Management is best off staying on the sidelines and focusing on drawing consumers to its app. Giving up control of both its user experience and data is too risky, given the huge benefits each provide Netflix.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:10 AM, November 11, 2016 Updated: 3:30 PM, November 11, 2016 WASHINGTON - Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple <AAPL.O>, Pfizer <PFE.N>, Microsoft <MSFT.O> and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. Tax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Trump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. Bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. "On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach," said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. "There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years." At the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. Corporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. Trump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. Trump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. Such proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Democrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. The one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. Infrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. The four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co <GE.N> ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO). The European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was "a fair rate" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. BUSINESS SUPPORT The House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a "territorial" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income. Trump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. Some are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. "In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue," said Republican Representative Tom Cole. The House Republican plan has had significant support from business. Kumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc <AA.N> and Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O> to Alphabet's Google Inc <GOOGL.O>, Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>. "We know what we want," said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a "modern, competitive" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. The House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. Trump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. Business lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.

The letter, released on Wednesday evening, reiterated Apple’s stance on possible issues that would emerge from a Trump presidency, most especially diversity in the workplace. The brief memo, originally obtained by BuzzFeed News, directly addresses the possible feelings of unrest that several of the tech giant’s employees are currently feeling. Since Trump’s decisive win over Democratic bet Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s elections, numerous groups in the United States, composed of immigrants, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, have expressed their reservations about the coming years ahead. In the memo, Cook urged the company’s employees to stand firm and be strong. Quoting one of the most influential men in U.S. history, Dr. Martin Luther King, the Apple CEO urged everyone working in Apple to “keep moving forward” despite whatever circumstances might happen in the future. The CEO also asserted that nothing will change in Apple’s stance regarding issues that might arise after President-elect Trump takes office early next year. Following is the full text of Cook’s company-wide memo to Apple employees. Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: ‘If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.’ This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best, Tim Apple has been a target of Donald Trump’s criticism for a while now, with the president-elect specifically pointing out the tech giant’s outsourcing of labor for its products as one of the biggest causes of problems in America’s labor sector. Over the course of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump has been very firm on his stance of requiring American companies to manufacture their products on American soil. Apple, whose most popular products, such as the iPhone, are manufactured in China, became one of Trump’s biggest targets. [Image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images] This culminated in a fiery declaration back in January, when Trump boldly declared that once he becomes president, he would force Apple to start manufacturing its products in the United States. “We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,” Trump said during a campaign speech last January. In order to enforce this rule, Trump has declared during his campaign that he would force Apple and any other American company that opts to move their manufacturing departments to other countries, to pay a massive 35 percent tax. Just like most of his declarations during the campaign period, however, President-elect Donald Trump has not provided a clear outline as to how his administration would implement the sanctions. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Apple and Trump’s row further escalated when the tech giant took a defiant stance against the Justice Department, which issued a request that the tech firm bypass an iPhone’s security systems. The phone in question, an iPhone 5C, was owned by the San Bernardino shooter, whose 2015 attack claimed the lives of 14 people and injured 22 more. When Apple refused to comply with the Justice Department’s request, Trump was quick to condemn the tech giant’s decision. “But to think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cell phone. Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up,” Trump said in a statement back in February. Trump’s fiery stance against the tech giant would escalate further, eventually culminating in the president-elect calling for a boycott of Apple products. His call for a boycott, which was broadcast through Twitter, was considered by many to be ironic, however, since the tweet was written and uploaded using an iPhone. Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 With Donald Trump now the president-elect of the United States, only time will tell if he would really stand true to his word and take measures against the practices of firms like Apple. For its part, Apple seems set on continuing on its ways. While the letter that Apple CEO Tim Cook released was one of encouragement and hope, it was also a memo with an underlying feeling of defiance. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqrDWqPMwwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Man Runs 1400 Miles To Standing Rock Now Read This: Google To Penalize Fake News Sites That Peddle Misinformation Using Facebook: After 2016 Election Search Engine To Cut Off Ad Network Support To Shady Sites Share 0 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Simon Alvarez Tags: Apple, Donald Trump, Tim Cook Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘Married To Medicine’ Star Lisa Nicole Cloud Doesn’t Trust Husband After Stripper Scandal? ‘Teen Mom’ Amber Portwood Shows Off Plastic Surgery Results, As Her Fiancé Finally Comes Clean About His Sobriety Olivia Newton-John Launches New Christmas Album With John Farnham, Delights In Daughter Chloe’s Successful Recovery Peru Vs.

Third Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. In early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. Through the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. Loeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. Third Point upped its stake in Monsanto Co by 85 percent to 3.7 million shares, while the hedge fund dissolved its share stake in Marathon Oil Corp during the third quarter, filings said. Third Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.

But sitting for Monday night’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals probably would be an even bigger gut punch against the franchise where Hall played the past nine years and the city where he still has a home. “I mean, it would be unfortunate,” Hall said Thursday. “But at the end of the day even going into this week I knew that was a possibility. I mean, it would suck for sure, just as much as it did last week. It would obviously be nice to get out there and make some plays, but we’ll see what happens, how the week pans out and then what happens on Monday night.” Of course, Ben McAdoo has to prioritize wins for the Giants (5-3), and coaches often have to remove emotion to make the decision they feel is best for the team. Even Hall admitted that he hadn’t played well enough in the seven games prior to the Giants’ bye in the slot with rookie corner Eli Apple injured and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie moved to the outside. Giants' Janoris Jenkins has some studying up to do on A.J. Green The Giants’ secondary is now healthy, which led to Hall’s exclusion on Sunday in favor of backup corners Trevin Wade and Coty Sensabaugh and safety Nat Berhe for defensive and special teams purposes. “I think I played decent,” Hall, 31, said honestly. “I missed tackles that I would like to take back. There are obviously plays I would like to take back. Definitely a lot of room for improvement, which is pretty vague, but it’s just reality I guess.” Still, coaches have to have the pulse of their team, recognize situations, and have a feel for what is right. And though this may seem like a small, fringe roster call, if McAdoo is plugged in, he has to know what playing on Monday night would mean to Hall, and the positive message it would send his team taking care of his own. Hall has never even had an opportunity to play against one of his former teams because he never had one, as a Bengal for nine seasons, until he signed with the Giants as a free agent in August. Giants injury report: WR Cruz doesn’t practice with ankle sprain Hall basically said he knew his time was done in Cincinnati, and Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis, whom Hall is close with, said both parties mutually moved on. “We have drafted some young players over the last three or four seasons and at some point, you are trying to clear opportunity and space,” Lewis said Thursday. “We spoke with Leon a number of times and Leon was hesitant to commit to coming back because he was unsure what his role was going to be at that point and so, we thought that we moved on from Leon and Leon moved a little bit away from us, as well. “(But) he was a big part of us, he is a big part of me, you love him, you love his family and I was completely honest with him about what his role was that we perceived it to be and he was looking to be able to carve out maybe a little bit more niche still that way,” Lewis added. Hall found out last Sunday morning, the day of the Eagles game that he would be scratched and admitted surprise. Giants’ best defensive surprise is Landon Collins “A little bit,” he said. “Caught me off-guard a little bit, I can’t lie. It is what it is. Kinda just roll with the punches.” Ravens’ Terrance West rushes against Leon Hall. (Michael Reaves/Getty Images) Taking a punch this Monday night, though, would hurt a bit more. McAdoo should see that. APPLE ON MOM VS. GIANTS: IT’S IN THE PAST Eli Apple told the Daily News Thursday that he spoke to his mom, Annie Apple, regarding what he called “definitely false” accusations that the Giants had leaned on him to control her criticism of the team. But he didn’t want to re-live it and said it’s no longer an issue. Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. “I did (talk to her),” Apple said, “but that’s in the past.” Apple also said his poor play Sunday against the Eagles, which led to a second-half benching, was more due to midseason injuries temporarily derailing him from his comfort zone rather than any pressure he felt from his mom’s accusations – which she still has not recanted, by the way. “That happens sometimes when you’re out for a while,” Apple said. “When you’re doing things over and over again and you get in the routine of things, you get better and better. So it was about building that routine and getting that back. That’s what it’s about.” MOSS THIS, MOSS THAT NFL great Randy Moss was at the Giants practice facility on Thursday, set to interview Odell Beckham Jr. for a piece to run on Monday Night Football. But Beckham said he had plenty of fun as the NFL’s most electric current receiver interviewing the retired phenom Moss who once set the bar. “He started something that even now, he has his own little segment, You Got Mossed,” Beckham said. “The ‘Getting Mossed’ thing inspired a lot of receivers.” Beckham, who has scored 30 TDs in his first 35 career games – one better than Moss – said he “aspire(s) to be like” Moss and talked of how, long before he was making one-handed grabs, he was enamored with Moss’ ability to leap over a corner and pluck the ball away. “You wanted to go up top on someone and you wanted to scoop the ball off his head and run it into the end zone,” he said. “I’ve watched him streak down the field for years. Change his route. Just put his hand up and it’s like, we’re gone and out of here. Just him being able to be here, pick his brain and take whatever I can take from him is good.” Tags: nfl new york giants cincinnati bengals philadelphia eagles leon hall marvin lewis eli apple annie apple randy moss odell beckham jr.

Third Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. In early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. Through the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. Loeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. Third Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings.

Macs & Mac OS X | 10 Nov 2016 | Print  | Comment (14) How to Turn Off Sierra’s Optimized Storage by Adam C. Engst When first introducing macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple made much of Optimized Storage, a marketing term that encompasses various settings and cloud-related technologies for moving data from a Mac’s space-constrained local drive to the cloud. In “Explaining Sierra’s Optimized Storage” (19 September 2016), I tried to lay out what Optimized Storage covers, explain the Storage Management window interface, and give suggestions about what you should or should not enable manually. Since Optimized Storage deletes data from your local drive such that it may not exist in your backups, you should be aware of the implications of turning it on. Unfortunately, because Sierra prompts you to enable Desktop and Documents folder syncing during installation and may enable the associated Optimize Mac Storage checkbox by default as well, many Mac users are unwittingly enrolling important data in Optimized Storage. Worse, reports have started circulating that Sierra may have enabled some previously disabled Optimized Storage features during the 10.12.1 update. That’s not OK. For the record, I don’t believe that Optimized Storage is inherently evil. Some of its options, such as deleting the local copies of watched movies and TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store, have few downsides. However, many people wish to maintain complete control over local storage, so I’ll explain how to disable all of Optimized Storage’s options in this article. iCloud Drive & Desktop and Documents Folder Syncing -- Technically speaking, Desktop and Documents folder syncing isn’t part of Optimized Storage. Its goal is to store your documents in iCloud Drive so you can access them from any of your Apple devices. However, Optimized Storage can apply to all iCloud Drive-based documents and data, including the Desktop and Documents folders if they’re being synced through iCloud. If Optimized Storage does decide to start deleting local files to free up space, those files are most likely to come from your Documents folder. To keep your Desktop and Documents folders out of iCloud, and to ensure that data that is in iCloud is always mirrored locally, open System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options, and deselect both Desktop & Documents Folders at the top of the list and the Optimize Mac Storage checkbox at the bottom. Be aware that turning off Desktop and Documents folder syncing is stressful. When you do so, in System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options, Sierra tells you that all your files will be available only in iCloud, which seems wrong: if you’re turning off syncing, you’re doing so because you want them locally. However, that dialog is followed immediately by another that tells you that you can recover your files from iCloud Drive. In fact, what happens when you turn off that feature is that Sierra recreates empty Desktop and Documents folders in your home folder. You can’t replace those folders, so it’s not possible to drag the old Desktop and Documents folders from iCloud Drive to your home folder. Instead, you must open each folder in iCloud Drive and move (Command-drag) its contents to the new local Desktop and Documents folders in your home folder. You can try to delete the now-empty Desktop and Documents folders from iCloud Drive, but in my experience, iCloud keeps recreating at least the Desktop folder. Photos -- Given the ease of taking and storing photos and videos, your Photos library may occupy more space than anything else — I’m not a prolific photographer and mine is still over 110 GB. If you have multiple Apple devices, using iCloud Photo Library lets you access, edit, and manage your photos from any device, which is great, even if it almost always requires that you pay for additional iCloud Drive space. iCloud Photo Library was one of the first places where Apple dipped its toes into optimizing storage because many Photos libraries are far too large to fit on iOS devices. Plus, it’s not uncommon for someone to have an iMac at home but want to play with photos on a space-constrained MacBook Air while on vacation. My recommendation is to keep Optimized Storage enabled for all iOS devices and secondary Mac notebooks where space is at a premium, but to turn it off on your main Mac so your photos are always included in your backups. To do this, open Photos > Preferences > iCloud, and select “Download Originals to this Mac.” Mail -- If you work with people who send around presentations or videos on a regular basis, Mail is likely consuming a significant amount of drive space. Email messages themselves are small, so there’s no win in deleting them, but attachments are another story. In previous versions of Mail, you could either download all attachments or leave them all on your IMAP server. Sierra’s version of Mail adds a third option to download only recent email attachments. When you open a message whose attachment hasn’t been downloaded, you can click a button to get it. If you want to see how much space you’d save by downloading only recent attachments, launch System Information, choose Window > Storage Management, and click Mail in the sidebar. Apple has bundled these features into Optimized Storage, so if you want to make sure that your local mail archive always contains both messages and attachments, so in Mail, go to Mail > Preferences > Accounts > accountName > Account Information and choose All from the Download Attachments pop-up menu. Make sure to do this for each of your accounts! iTunes -- Video can consume massive amounts of drive space, but it’s also slow to download. If you regularly purchase movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store, you can use Optimized Storage to remove watched videos from iTunes automatically. But what if you’re buying content for a child who wants to watch things multiple times, or you want to ensure you can watch anything again without having to download again over a slow Internet connection? To turn off Optimized Storage in iTunes and ensure that all the videos you purchase from the iTunes Store stick around even after you’ve watched them, navigate to iTunes > Preferences > Advanced and deselect the “Automatically delete watched movies and TV shows” checkbox. Empty Trash Automatically -- All the previously mentioned features of Optimized Storage involve deleting the local copy of a file under the assumption that it can be retrieved from the cloud if necessary. The final aspect of Optimized Storage that you might want to turn off is different — it’s an option in the Finder that automatically deletes files in the Trash after they have been there for 30 days. Frankly, there should be no downside to enabling this option. You should never depend on being able to go into the Trash to bring back a file that you deleted more than a month before. Just don’t delete any file that you might want again. That said, if you want more control over when your Trash is emptied, go to Finder > Preferences > Advanced and deselect “Remove items from the Trash after 30 days.” Manage Storage Manually -- If you’re uncomfortable with Optimized Storage but are still running out of space on your Mac’s drive, you can use the new Storage Management window to identify and delete large files. Open the System Information app, choose Window > Storage Management, and look at all the sidebar categories underneath Recommendations. With a little attention paid to the old versions of apps, unnecessary downloads, and unexpectedly large documents scattered around your drive, you can often clear a surprising amount of space in just a few minutes while retaining complete control over your local storage.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Sierra’s Optimized Storage can free up significant amounts of space on a drive that’s bursting at the seams, but if you aren’t comfortable with the possibility of your data living only in the cloud, you can turn off each of Optimized Storage’s options. Since Optimized Storage can reportedly turn itself on after a macOS update, it’s well worth knowing how to flip those switches back off.

That whole optimization process sounds really dumb, especially for someone who has managed their own files since the Mac Plus. I'm glad the only thing I have in iCloud is my mail. I don't intend to upgrade, but I will need a new computer someday and will have to use the OS that comes with it. So I try to keep informed. Thanks for the article. Reply Norbert E Fuchs   2016-11-11 07:40 Adam writes: "Sierra may have enabled some previously disabled Optimized Storage features during the 10.12.1 update." Motivated by this article I controlled my iCloud settings and noticed that "Keychain" was checked though I do not recall to ever have it checked. I unchecked it. Otherwise, I am not using "iCloud Drive" at all. Reply Simon   2016-11-11 08:45 Turning on new features like this without the user's explicit consent is IMHO dangerous. Turning them back on during the course of an update AFTER the user had already chosen to turn them off is, however, totally unacceptable in my book. Do we have a firm indication this is actually what Apple has done? Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-14 15:09 That's what the 9to5Mac article linked above says: https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/27/opinion-sierra-storage-management-system-nightmare/ I haven't seen it personally, and we believe that Apple's algorithm for enabling Optimized Storage features has a variety of rules underlying it, so it's hard to predict in any given situation. Reply Paul Ellis  2016-11-11 17:47 You avoid all of these problems by signing out of iCloud beforehand and having nothing further to do with it. Simple. For contacts and calendar syncing, which is actually all anyone REALLY needs, use Fruux. For everything else, forgettaboutit. The 'gain' isn't worth the pain. Remember that these 'innovations' are primarily for Apple's benefit, not yours. I'm still on El Capitan, waiting for 10.12.2. Before I 'upgrade' I will COMPLETELY REMOVE any remaining dependencies on iCloud. Job done. Reply Colleen Thompson  2016-11-15 10:08 Maybe *you* don't want to have anything to do with iCloud. It's very useful for a lot of people. While I don't want to have anything to do with Optimized Storage, I do synchronize a lot of stuff. I appreciate articles like this that help us understand the normally impenetrable Apple schema. Reply Grant  2016-11-11 20:00 Thank you, Adam. This is great. I knew about some of the problems but not how to correctly change the settings. You helped me reclaim my Documents folder and my Photos. By accident I had some of the preferences correct. It's too bad the Sierra set up process didn't allow a little more explanation and flexibility with the installation. I can see I may need to keep more and more in the cloud when I get my next MacBookPro, but for now my HD is 3TB and I'd rather own my own data and back it up onsite and offsite as I see fit. Your screen shots and narrative were wonderful! Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-14 15:09 Thanks for the kind words, and I'm glad it was helpful! Reply Paul  2016-11-11 22:57 I like iCloud Drive and the unified Desktop and Documents folders Sierra provides for all my machines. I had Optimised Storage turned on on my MBP due to limited local storage, and it worked perfectly. I always had a very healthy amount of free space. I also did not have any trouble as was reported happening here and there with files getting lost. My MBP is from mid 2010 and has been on 24/7 mostly, so it came as not too big a surprise when my HD died last week. So I put in a 3TB Fusion Drive on Thursday and now I've turned off Optimised Storage and the likes everywhere. Sierra still has to download data from iCloud and it is taking its time for that, still 193GB to go at time of writing. Reply Scott M.   2016-11-14 12:52 Adam writes: "Unfortunately, because Sierra prompts you to enable Desktop and Documents folder syncing during installation and may enable the associated Optimize Mac Storage checkbox by default as well, many Mac users are unwittingly enrolling important data in Optimized Storage.

Sorry, but "That's not OK." is a SIGNIFICANT understatement. The above highlights why I have not upgrade to Sierra to date. I thought I was getting close, but this just scrapped any plans of upgrading to Sierra anytime soon until I am assured that Apple will not hose my setup with some "feature" that I do not want. And this is also why I do not have "automatic" system updates turned on (and basically the same reason why I have no interest in Windows 10 on my Windows machines). I have zero trust in Apple not to screw up my machine. Yes, I get that automatic updates would in theory make my Mac (and Windows machines) more secure, but I don't want them at the risk of completely screwing up my system and my work flow. And this is also why when I do finally do an upgrade or even just a "dot" upgrade, I always update my clone of my Mac (and Windows machines) before doing it. Then if Apple (or Microsoft) does screw something up, I can relatively easily revert to my previous setup. Reply Scott M.   2016-11-14 13:05 Adam writes: "Some of its options, such as deleting the local copies of watched movies and TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store, have few downsides." I disagree. While technically it might have "few downsides", those few downsides could be major. I like to have local copies of my movies and TV shows, even if I watched them. I paid for them after all. And I don't trust Apple to always have them available for me to download again. And I definitely don't trust Apple to consistently stream them to something like an Apple TV. This is because I have had too many times where I try to go stream a movie that I have purchased on my Apple TV only for an error message or for it to take forever (if ever) to load and start streaming. And I have 70+ Mbps cable Internet, so it is not my Internet connection. Where it can be a significant problem is if one does not have a fast Internet connection or has some small data cap. While I don't suffer from either, others do. And if they have their movies and TV shows downloaded and then Apple turns on the iTunes part of Optimized Storage and nukes all those local copies, now that person might have to download all that content again. And that might take a long time due to a slow connection and/or monthly caps. To me, that is not a small downside. Of course, if that person was smart, they had a local backup, but it no longer surprises me how many people do not backup their files. Even if they should have had a backup, however, Apple should not be turning on such potentially destructive features by default, whether intentionally or by accident (i.e. a bug). If they are doing it intentionally, then that is grounds for me to finally punt on using the Mac if I reach the point where I am essentially forced to upgrade to Sierra...as reluctant I as I would be to do that. If it is happening because of a bug, then that tells me that their overall design of this "feature" is flawed as there should be redundancies in the design of the "feature" so that people's data does not get destroyed (i.e. repeated confirmation requests of "are you sure you want to turn this on"). Reply Eric Ladner   2016-11-14 19:52 Hi Adam, I'm sort of confused. I was concerned when I first started reading about this in many sources, especially since having your Documents only in iCloud seems to mean that you cannot access them when you do not have Internet access. But as a test I have turned off WiFi, and found that I still had access to Documents, even though the folder appears only under iCloud. You recommend deselecting both storing Documents and Desktop in iCloud, and Optimize Storage. Can't I have iCloud backups of and access to my documents, and avoid the risk of having them deleted from local storage, if I deselect only Optimize Storage? Many thanks for all the information you provide. --Eric Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-14 21:24 Yes, it's "Desktop and Documents folder syncing" so when you're offline, you simply are working on the local copy and your changes aren't being synced up to iClloud and made available to other devices. And yes, again, you can have Desktop and Documents folder syncing but not have them subject to Optimized Storage, if you deselect Optimize Mac Storage in that iCloud options dialog.

On the first floor, in an area cordoned off with black netting, like a batting cage, customers test the machines in flight. The second floor resembles a museum, the walls decorated with framed aerial drone photos of a bamboo forest in Kyoto, Japan; white waves trailing a ship near the Philippines; farm equipment combing fields in the Netherlands. The third floor houses a repair station, where on a recent Wednesday afternoon, three people stood in line waiting for advice. Selling in its own stores in China is new for 10-year-old DJI. While the Shenzhen company is the world’s leading seller of consumer drones, it is, unlike most Chinese tech businesses, more popular elsewhere. About 80 percent of sales come from abroad, more than half from the U.S., where hobbyist interest had been cultivated by decades’ worth of radio-controlled helicopters and other toys. The U.S. also taught DJI the value of brick and mortar, says Michael Perry, DJI’s director for strategic partnerships. A deal with Apple put the company’s new Phantom 4 drone in more than 400 Apple Stores around the world this spring, and the resulting bump in sales led DJI to think harder about expanding its in-store presence. In the past year the drone maker has opened stores in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Seoul, along with the one in Hong Kong. “It’s really important to have a place where consumers can see a drone, where they can fly it for the first time,” says Perry. “We want customers to be able to see, touch, and ask questions.” DJI’s new Shenzhen store. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg DJI isn’t alone. In the world’s largest e-commerce market, leading technology companies are paying renewed attention to physical retail. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma surprised shareholders when he wrote in an Oct. 13 letter, “Pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges.” Now that China’s decade-plus of double-digit growth in internet users has flattened, “in the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a reimagined retail industry, driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data,” Ma wrote. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on a Nov. 2 earnings call that the biggest opportunity in e-commerce is working together with retail operations. “Online and offline will be a single seamless experience, not just in consumer interaction, but also in the entire business operation,” said Zhang. Last year, Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20 percent stake in electronics retail chain Suning. Among the potential symbioses, shoppers could use the chain’s 1,600 or so Chinese stores as showrooms, testing merchandise there before deciding whether to comparison shop online. In October the two companies announced plans to invest 1 billion yuan ($148 million) to set up an e-commerce venture designed to manage Suning stores’ presence on Alibaba sites and strengthen the chain’s customer service, among other things. Other Chinese tech brands are investing directly in shopping options modeled loosely on Apple’s retail efforts, stores in which customers can test devices and ask questions of sales staff. The shift is most clearly on display in the smartphone business, where online purchases peaked last fall and manufacturers are looking to diversify retail options, says CK Lu, a China market analyst at researcher Gartner. In the second half of last year, about 30 percent of smartphones bought in China were ordered online; in the first six months of 2016 the figure dipped to a little more than 20 percent, Lu says. Huawei, the No. 3 phone maker in the world behind Samsung and Apple, operates 515 stores across China and has teamed with retail chains. Five years ago its smartphone business barely existed. Colin Giles, executive vice president for Huawei’s consumer-business division, says its brick-and-mortar presence proved to be a big help. “You can’t ignore it,” he says. “Chinese consumers for sure are looking for a premium shopping experience.” Xiaomi, which made its name with online flash sales of its low-cost smartphones, is now looking to retail to boost its brand image and entice Chinese shoppers to splurge on its internet-connected appliances. The company operates 36 Mi Home stores in China, displaying its latest curved-screen smartphones alongside branded smart rice cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, and other electronics. Xiaomi says it will open 1,000 more stores in China in the next five years. “Physical stores are getting more and more important, because they offer a chance to show the value of the product,” says Jessie Ding, an analyst at researcher Canalys. She says Xiaomi’s weakness offline allowed domestic competitors to overtake it. Like Ding, Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, says the maturing of China’s electronics market, and its electronics shoppers, places a heavier burden on companies to distinguish themselves. “It’s an absolute necessity as Chinese consumers develop more refined tastes and are willing to spend a bit more,” Rein says. “They want that personal retail experience. And if they spend more money, they care more about follow-up service.” Huawei’s Giles says his team is using customer surveys and follow-ups to learn as much as possible about what shoppers want more of, both online and off. He, too, recognizes that it’s tougher to stand out in China’s tech market than it used to be. Go to one of China’s big e-commerce sites, like Taobao or JD.com, and “there are probably over 1,000 handsets, all marketed in-site in the same way,” says Giles. “You need to have a brand to cut through.” The bottom line: Several of China’s e-commerce and mobile stars are spending heavily on retail stores to distinguish their customer service.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. The stock market rally continued for a second day after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, a reaction few expected. The Dow rose 218 points Thursday and closed at a record high for the second day in a row. And why not? It's fitting that following the most unusual presidential election campaign in recent history, the stock market is also reacting in atypical fashion. Many investors worried that a Trump win would be bad for stocks. In case you haven't heard this before, the market hates uncertainty. And Trump is uncertainty on steroids. What's more, stocks have historically gone down the day after Election Day. It hasn't mattered much if it was a Democrat or Republican winning, if the incumbent party (or president) was re-elected or if the outcome was considered an upset. According to data from Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac , the average decline for the S&P 500 the day after Election Day between 1932 and 2012 was 1.1%. But the S&P 500 rose 1.1% on Wednesday. The market only rallied on 6 of the past 21 post-Election Days. Stocks even fell in 1980, after Ronald Reagan, the hero of the modern Republican Party, defeated Jimmy Carter. And the market dipped nearly 1% after Reagan's landslide win over Walter Mondale in 1984 as well. Stocks plunged 5.3% in 2008 after Barack Obama was elected. Of course, those were unusually tumultuous times for the market and economy. But the S&P 500 also fell 2.4% after he beat Mitt Romney in 2012. The last post-Election Day rally prior to this year was in 2004. The S&P 500 rose more than 1% after President George W. Bush was re-elected, defeating John Kerry. But stocks also rallied after Bill Clinton won a second term in 1996. They fell slightly when he beat the first President Bush in 1992 though. The market usually gets over election jitters pretty quickly though. The S&P 500 has risen an average of 0.2% in the first three days after Election Day going back to 1932. And the market is up more than 1%, historically, between Election Day and the end of the year. So can stocks keep rallying as Trump starts to make Cabinet picks and give more details about his economic and foreign policies? Perhaps. Despite his mercurial nature during this long, nasty election cycle, Trump has already won raves from investors for his more measured acceptance speech. Trump's remarks pleasantly surprised many since he dropped much of the bombast that was a hallmark of his throughout the campaign and pledged to be a president for the whole country. Shares of many banks, drugmakers, oil companies and construction firms all rallied sharply Wednesday and rose Thursday as well. Investors now seem to be betting that Trump, combined with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, may look to unwind some of the regulations on financial services companies put into place during the Obama administration. There are also hopes that Trump will propose plans to boost infrastructure spending, drill more for oil and also push back on some of the attacks against drug and biotech companies for price hikes on key medications. But there are still questions about who Trump may appoint to key slots on the Federal Reserve over his term. That will impact the markets. Who Trump may choose to add to the Supreme Court could also have an effect on stocks. Tough talk from Trump about Mexico and China have also raised some worries that he could start a trade war which could be damaging to the markets, jobs and overall economy. © Distributed by LAKANA.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 10, 2016 at 5:18PM Image source: Apple. The new TV app from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a great content aggregator. It collects all of the various video content consumers have access to through iTunes downloads, stand-alone streaming services, and on-demand streaming services that use pay-TV credentials. But there are a couple of major omissions: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those omissions have led many people to criticize the app, since at least 50 million Americans watch some of their television through Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. That severely limits Apple's new app in its ability to find and recommend the best content for each user. What's more, it's unlikely Netflix will ever sign on. Netflix gets a lot of value out of controlling its user experience The big issue with Apple's TV app, from Netflix's standpoint, is that it cedes control of the user experience to Apple. That could be good for stand-alone networks and online pay-TV streaming portals, which generally have poor user interfaces and low adoption. But for Netflix, which has a quality user interface and strong adoption, it's unnecessary and even detrimental to its business. Most egregiously, Apple would take over the content recommendation from Netflix, something Netflix relies on to improve watch time and churn. Earlier this year, Netflix published a paper claiming its recommendation engine saves the company $1 billion per year. "When produced and used correctly," the authors say, "recommendations lead to meaningful increases in overall engagement with the product (e.g., streaming hours) and lower subscription cancellations rates." Additionally, the TV app removes a lot of branding from the user interface. That could have a negative impact on churn for a service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. If it's more unclear where this content is coming from, it's harder for users to justify $10 a month for one of those services. Overall, it's more likely services with a strong brand and user interface such as Netflix or Amazon will see a negative impact from Apple's TV app than the potential positives. Netflix wants its data all to itself On top of the potential detriments to Netflix's user experience, Netflix's participation in the TV app would open up a lot of its data to Apple. Netflix is historically very private about its viewer data, as is Amazon. It won't even share its data with the people responsible for creating its original content. Netflix's viewer data is one of its biggest competitive advantages. It lets it spend its content budget effectively and efficiently. It's also one of the reasons its original series have managed to become so popular. With Apple's increasing interest in producing original video content -- starting with Apple Music exclusives -- Netflix's viewer data would be immensely valuable. On the flip side, for Netflix to let its data fall into the hands of Apple could give rise to another big competitor. Even if the adoption rate of Apple's TV app remains relatively low, Netflix's participation would probably generate a significant increase in adoption. As a result, evaluating the impact of Netflix's inclusion is difficult. Management is best off staying on the sidelines and focusing on drawing consumers to its app. Giving up control of both its user experience and data is too risky, given the huge benefits each provide Netflix.

SHARE Listen up: Our interaction with sound has changed By David Goe Thursday, November 10, 2016 When Apple announced the iPhone 7 would not have a 3.5 mm headphone jack, my immediate reaction, much like yours, was WTF? I stream music off my phone more than I do on any device, often through a pair of chunky, traditional, over-the-ear studio headphones. How could the company that revolutionized the way people consume music literally cut the chord between users and their devices?  As it turns out, there are smarter ways to stream audio. A 3.5 mm headphone jack serves very little purpose other than sending out audio. Headphone jacks take up a lot of space, you can’t send power through it, you can’t connect other devices through it, you can’t operate the phone through it, and you can’t waterproof it. In other words, in the eyes of the world’s most innovative tech company, 3.5 mm jacks are obsolete. One of the biggest consumer complaints that come with any new device like the iPhone 7 is that upgrading often forces you to update your companion devices as well. After spending hundreds of dollars on a new phone you must also upgrade your chargers, cases and headphones in order to take advantage of the new device’s technology. That’s a luxury that many people struggle to afford, but if you are able to do it, the new wave of wireless artificially intelligent audio headphones available to consumers is nothing short of a revelation. First, let’s start with Apple’s AirPods, the wireless companion earbuds to the iPhone 7. It’s clear from Apple’s new line of products that they firmly believe in a wireless future and also a future where multiple devices sync and communicate with each other. Yes, the AirPods are earbuds, but they do much more than just playback audio. AirPods recognize the user’s voice, allowing you to talk to Siri, Apple’s built-in, AI assistant, without taking your phone out of your pocket or fidgeting with the Apple Watch. With AirPods you can make calls, launch a music playlist, adjust the volume and get directions all through the sound of your voice.    Third-party hardware developers are also brining AI headphone systems to the market with some very cool features. Bragi Dash wireless earbuds will learn your body’s gestures and respond accordingly. For example, nod yes to accept a call, shake your head no to decline it. They are also waterproof and can track your activity level, making them a nice accessory for athletes.    Most impressive is Doppler Labs’ Here One headphone system. At face value Here One gives users much of the same function as Apple’s AirPods. Users can make calls, talk to a device’s AI assistant and stream audio, but the big differences are that Here One can sync with a variety of operating systems and, most importantly, it allow users to tune the audio world around them. What does that mean exactly? Well, think about the last time you were on an airplane. How badly did you want to tune out the overwhelming white noise of air travel and the crying baby one row back? Using Here One’s accompanying app you can literally choose what you want to hear. Remove the chaos around you with a quick adjustment and focus solely on your streaming music. It’s noise cancelation done smartly.  Here One also allows users to EQ the world around them. For example, if you were at a loud concert and felt the snare hits from the drum kit were too loud, using their app you could EQ that frequency out and make a personal audio mix much more tolerable and enjoyable to listen to. These new wireless headphones are meant to be functional, wearable technology that allows us to interface and fine-tune our relationship with technology in a very personal way. As someone who spends the bulk of their day streaming audio, often on the go, shaping sound to fit my needs is enticing. If this kind of technology is available now, I can only image what advancements we will see in the near future.  Regardless, useful wearable technology is here and the way we interact with audio will never be the same. ■ Read more from David Goe at the Music on the Goe blog at GJSentinel.com.

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: A Security Bug Just Made It Risky to Open Links on Your iPhone—Here's How to Protect Yourself Dallas Thomas 4 days ago A Security Bug Just Made It Risky to Open Links on Your iPhone—Here's How to Protect Yourself A new hack has reopened an 8-year-old iPhone security loophole that Apple thought it had fixed back with iPhone OS 2.2. This is not one of those times when a theoretical attack gets identified and blocked quickly by Apple. On the contrary, it's a hack that actually exists right now, and it can have some serious real-world repercussions, so this is something all iPhone users need to be aware of. Don't Miss: 23 Important iOS 10 Privacy Settings Everyone Should Double-Check How the Hack Works As an iPhone user, the main thing you need to know is that this hack can force your phone to dial any number, while locking you out of the in-call UI to prevent you from hanging up, and all of this can happen if you just tap an infected link. The hack exploits a security hole in iOS's WebView, which is what apps like Twitter and Facebook use to render webpages without having to open the link externally in Safari. So basically, if you're using any app that has its own "built-in" web browser, any link you tap could make you fall victim to the attack. 18-year-old iPhone app developer Meetkumar Hiteshbhai Desai was brought up on felony charges in Arizona after allegedly setting up a website that used this exploit. According to the police report, Desai created a website that used this malicious code to make other users' phones dial 911 repeatedly. He then shared the link on Twitter, and after several unsuspecting iPhone users visited the page, the Maricopa County Sheriff's office received over 100 hang-up calls to 911 in just a few minutes. So you can see how this could pose a huge risk to public safety, but the hack has even more sinister potential. Theoretically, an online stalker could set up a link that forced other phones to dial his or her number, then simply use caller ID to associate your online username with your personal phone number. And because the hack can lock you out of the phone interface, you wouldn't be able to hang up before the call went through. It could also be used for charged calls to make a quick buck. What You Need to Do to Avoid This This bug does not affect Safari, Chrome, or any third-party web browser for iOS—just the system WebView. That means that you can safely surf the internet if you stay inside your preferred web browser. The problem comes when you tap a link from within an app that is not a web browser. Some apps might open the link externally in Safari, which wouldn't cause any problems. But other apps use the vulnerable WebView to render pages without opening Safari, so this is where you have to be careful. So if you want to be extra safe, don't tap any links unless you're using Safari. For a more reasonable approach, you could simply avoid tapping links in any non-Safari app unless you trust the person or website who posted the link. You could also press and hold on hyperlinks to the URL, or use 3D Touch to preview it, which can help you determine if a link is legit or possibly malicious. Apple already tried to squash this bug once, but it didn't stay dead, which means we can't assume that a security fix will be pushed out quickly this time. So until we see an iOS update that specifically mentions fixing this bug, we'll just have to be a bit more careful while tapping links in third-party apps.

Apple CEO urges workers to 'move forward together' postelection 0 Share: Tech Industry by Shara Tibken 10 November 2016 8:00 pm GMT @sharatibken by Daniel Van Boom 10 November 2016 8:00 pm GMT @dvanboom Up Next Facebook may have built then ditched an update to fight fake news Apple CEO Tim Cook is trying to steady rattled employees. Photo by James Martin/CNET Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his company the only thing to do after Donald Trump's election is to keep pushing ahead "together." "In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings," he said Wednesday in a companywide memo. "Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together." The political divide is wide in the US: 49 percent of Republicans say the Democratic Party makes them "afraid," and 55 percent of Democrats say the same about the Republican Party, according to Pew Research from June. Related stories Trump's win reveals social media's blind spot Trump's first election victory tweet: 'We will all come together' How Trump's victory disrupts the tech disruptors Cook's memo addressed this division. "Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world -- regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love," he wrote. It's unclear what impact a Trump presidency will have on the technology sector. The president-elect hasn't exactly been friendly to Apple and others in Silicon Valley. Trump has said several times that he would force Apple to build its devices in the US, something that would upend Apple's manufacturing process. He also called for people to boycott Apple's products until the company helped the FBI unlock a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. Apple had resisted the FBI's request, saying it wanted to protect the privacy of its users. The FBI ended up withdrawing its request for Apple's help in that case, but the issue is one that's sure to pop up again. Worry about what a Trump presidency would mean for Silicon Valley caused many in tech to endorse Hillary Clinton. Apple didn't make public comments about the presidential race or run a political action committee, but Cook reportedly held a campaign fund-raiser for Clinton this summer. He had also hosted a fund-raiser for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. Cook, as one of tech's only openly gay CEOs, has made a big push for social justice and diversity (though Apple still has a long way to go in terms of its own diversity numbers). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a similarly measured response while watching the election results. "I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line," he said in a Facebook post. Others in Silicon Valley haven't reacted so calmly. Airbnb and Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said he wants California to withdraw from the United States and become its own nation. Here's the full text of Cook's memo. Team, I've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said 50 years ago: "If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward." This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world -- regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let's move forward -- together!

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Sarcastic Sticker Emojis for iMessage Creative Mischief DALLAS, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Emojis are great for expression, but why did it take so long for Apple to introduce the middle finger Emoji? The demand for it was clearly peppered all over the Internet on forums. Prickmojis wants to increase the capabilities for the sarcastic thirsty texter. Thanks to the most recent update of Apple’s operating system iOS10, expression received an extension and quite the moving upgrade. Welcome animated “Stickers.” Photo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161110/437946 “Stickers” will eventually become more integrated into the text message channel. It essentially opened the door for designers, and programmers armed with a plethora of amazing creative software, to translate their creativity onto the text screen. A texter can add stickers on top of pictures, texts, stretch them out, send individually, and sending them is intuitive with one click away from the keyboard once installed. It allows designers and programmers the ability to add functionality as an extension into iMessages’ native messaging platform. Apple is crowd-sourcing creativity and giving the platform for people to sell all while taking a cut from it. Brilliant move. Prickmojis hopes to be fortunate to understand this opportunity early and cater to like minded texters. Animation, and good (free, for now) animated sarcastic emojis, are the result. Gianni Secchi, Prickmoji’s co-founder, speaks a little bit about how it came around, why it makes sense, and future plans. “My extremely smart business partner, Varghese Mathew, downloaded iOS10 before it was available to snoop around and see if there were any opportunities. He quickly noticed the stickers, and had the coding ability to configure. I’m a nerd with a dated animation hobby in my back pocket armed with a self-deprecating sense of humor. Drooling began. We wanted to make friendly insults more effective, and creative through animation. The group chats that make us smile the most are those with your friends that have a little bit of history together, which you’re making fun of each other. We researched tons of text chats, applying emotions to conversations with ridiculous characters, and tried to add ‘hip’ phrases all these darn kids are saying these days, cause us white boys always trying to stay fresh. We think it’s raw, and put out what we think may be popular with full intention of changing it with our fans guidance. The cool thing is, once we make this our full time operation, we can update new animated emojis daily and make sure it’s keeping our fans laughing. To do so we’ve got to build a bit more steam. We’re looking at it as an obligation. In the end of the day, it’s not what we think is hilarious (even though we are hilarious, duh); it’s what our fans do. “The future of the product and potential capabilities is what gets us the most excited.  We’ve got plans to add audio directly with the stickers, which is hush hush for now. It’s easy to look to future plans, but since these are branded characters the progression of Virtual Reality makes us the most excited. Imagine throwing out a dancing goofball politely passing gas (with audio) as a hologram on your friend’s phone sitting in his living room? That’s cool in my book! Who am I to speak so far ahead though, nor have I ever passed gas, ha! We are just trying to get more people to join the journey with us.  A journey we want our fans, if they think it’s worth being a fan, to have a voice and tell us what animation emojis they want. That’s why we are offering it for FREE for a limited time. It will most likely push the borderline of shock value if I’d put a guess out there, but we hope to see with time. Lastly, if you download it, be sure to snapshot funny text conversations and send it here. We will post it to all our social media accounts (Instagram/Twitter @prickmojis) and give you guys a little anonymous love. Thanks for reading my poor English!” You can check out Prickmojis by simply searching in the Apple App store, and download it free. For now. If you are having issues seeing the Prickmoji app in the iMessage dashboard, be sure to enable the app in the manage tab of the iMessage store.

He stresses that Apple's goal hasn't changed and principles it stands for have not changed. Apple is a company that is open to all and creates products that improve people's lives. "We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates," Cook states in the letter and continues to emphasize the importance of moving forward together by any means possible quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and closes his letter in same tone, "Let's move forward -- together!"
