If so, there’s a good chance that was the right decision, as 2017 has promised to be the year of handsets like the iPhone 8, Google Pixel 2, and even a Galaxy Note 8. In fact, if you believe the rumors, it could be very hard to choose one this year. Here are the rumored smartphones we see being the top five handsets of 2017. Image source: Apple designer – YouTube iPhone 8 Even before the iPhone 7 launched in September, there were rumors about this year’s handset. Some suggested that if Apple was going just to rehash an old iPhone design with no additional features, it shouldn’t bother. Instead, critics hoped the iPhone 8 and the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone launch would spark Apple into action. If you believe the rumors, 2017 will indeed be a big year for Apple, as its next handset is expected to deliver both hardware and design changes which should make it the most advanced iPhone to date. Imagine a handset which looks like it’s made from a single sheet of glass! That’s what Jonny Ive apparently wants, and to get that, it would need an edge-to-edge OLED display. Recent leaks have supported this theory, with Apple’s suppliers already looking to produce the all-glass body. However, in creating an edge-to-edge OLED display, both the Home button and Touch ID would have to be hidden beneath it. Other rumors point towards the handset featuring wireless charging, facial recognition, an A11 Fusion CPU, and an improved camera. Additionally, some rumors suggest 2017 will be a three-iPhone year. Google Pixel 2 According to SlashGear, Google originally wanted to work with Huawei on its Pixel handsets. However, due to Google insisting that only its branding appear on the handsets, Huawei reportedly backed out, and Google turned to HTC for help finishing the design and manufacturing the devices. The process took only nine months from start to finish and was an incredible feat considering how good those handsets are. There is very little information about the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 to share right now. However, with much more time on their side, it’s thought that this time around, the handsets will take on the iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, and Note 8 this year. The only information we have seen comes via micgadget, which predicts dual-camera setups and 4K features. Image Source: galaxynote7info Galaxy Note 8 Even with the Note 7’s demise, it’s possible the phablet series is not dead. Until a couple of days ago, we had only vague rumors that Samsung was going to launch a Galaxy Note 8. But now thanks to one of Samsung’s own suppliers, more meat has been put on to the bones. The supplier reportedly spoke to BusinessKorea, and it seems as though the Korean tech giant will release a no-holds-barred attack on the smartphone market in 2017 in a bid to regain consumer confidence and the business it lost with the Note 7 recall. The features expected/rumored to be making their way to the handset include: a high-definition 4K display, a much-improved AI assistant called Bixby, a 30MP rear camera, Snapdragon 830 CPU, and 6GB of RAM. There is also talk of the handset coming with dual-foldable displays. However, Samsung has been talking about this kind of display technology for years, which means we doubt that will happen. Image Source: DBS Design – YouTube.com Galaxy S8 Unlike the previously mentioned Note 8, Samsung has all but confirmed the existence of the S8. In fact, it is with this handset that many believe Samsung will mount an early challenge to the iPhone 8. As with all of the handsets featured here, the S8 is expected to get a significant facelift compared to its predecessors, with a curved Super AMOLED display expected to take up 90% of its face. If that information is correct, it will point to the handset (like the ones above) ditching the Home button and other manual buttons in favor of embedding them into its screen. Additional rumors of late have suggested that the S8 will offer many enterprise features, such as the Samsung Desktop Experience, which is similar to Microsoft’s Continuum and enables a user to connect a Windows 10 handset to a keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Bluetooth 5.0 is expected to make an appearance and offer increased range and faster transfer rates. Additionally, 8GB of RAM and Qualcomm’s SnapDragon 835 super CPU are being touted as real possibilities for the handset. Image Source: Samir Makwana/Mysmartprice.com LG G6 With the rumor mill focused on the iPhone 8 and Samsung’s handsets, there’s not much room for the LG G6. However, it could be just as capable as any of the above. LG has not confirmed the handset yet, so the information we have is based on rumors. Unlike its predecessor, the well-received LG G5, the G6 isn’t expected to be modular. It appears that the possibility of adding functionality to a handset for an additional fee did not go down well with consumers. However, from experience with this handset, we can also tell you that not many modular add-ons were ever available, so that too could have been a reason for this technology’s demise. Additionally, it appears that LG will use tempered glass for the first time, giving it a more premium feel than the all-aluminum G5. Also there could be an OLED panel, which, unlike the other manufacturers on this list, LG produces itself. It’s still unclear what size it will be, but some rumors suggest 5.3 inches and others 5.5 inches. As for the camera, LG has long been a user of dual-lens setups, and it’s thought that this will appear again on the G6.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | January 4, 2017 -- 20:53 GMT (12:53 PST) | Topic: Tech Industry James Martin/CNET Apple confirmed reports it will invest $1 billion into SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, to be used for large-scale technology investments. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," an Apple spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. Japan-based SoftBank is said to invest at least $25 billion into the fund, to be used in large tech investments. The telecom giant has also been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) for an investment up to $45 billion, according to earlier reports. It's not clear who else will contribute to the fund, or any future companies it may invest in or acquire. US President elect Donald Trump met with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son in New York City in December. There, the duo announced a plan for $50 billion investment in US tech startups, which they said would create 50,000 new jobs. iOS 10.2: 'Power User' tips and tricks SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Tech Industry Chrysler follows Volkswagen's footsteps, accused of trying to cheat emissions laws Tech Industry ​Gartner predicts Australian IT spending to tip AU$85b in 2017 Tech Industry VC activity plunges in final months of 2016 Tech Industry Broadsoft kicks off Brazil operations × Thank You Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription I agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

Both the English and Chinese language apps were removed from the App Store in China on Dec. 23, with Apple being told by Chinese officials that the app “is in violation of local regulations.” The move seems to affect only The New York Times’ apps, as other international publications such as The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal remain available in the Chinese App Store. The Chinese government began blocking The Times’ websites in 2012 following a series of articles on then-prime minister Wen Jiabao, although the government is said to have been struggling in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app. An Apple spokesperson declined to provide any details such as what local regulations were cited, when Apple was contacted and by whom, and whether any legal proceedings were involved, although the New York Times report speculates that the request appears to have been made under a new set of regulations released last June called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services, which prohibit apps that “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others” and that apps cannot publish “prohibited” information. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which is the country’s main Internet regulator, did not respond to faxed inquiries from The New York Times. The Times bureau in Beijing also noted that it has not been contacted by the Chinese government concerning the matter at all, which appears to be between the Chinese government and Apple at this point. The Times has asked Apple to reconsider its decision, according to a Times spokesperson in New York. This is not the first time Apple has removed media apps from its Chinese App Store, although this recent action is the most prominent news app to have been removed. While Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated in the past that Apple complies with all local laws, it’s unclear exactly what process is followed in evaluating requests from Beijing to remove apps, and whether Apple resists such requests in any way. Notably, the Times’ news apps remain available in Apple’s App Stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan, although users must have a credit card with a billing address outside of mainland China to download apps from those stores. The Times’ crossword puzzle and VR apps also remain available throughout China. Comments Why Cook?

There's always been a lot of criticism and griping about anything Apple does (and doesn't do - it can't win) but in 2016 I feel like the tone of the chatter about Apple changed and got a lot more negative. This is worrisome on a number of levels and I've been thinking about it a lot. I'm used to watching people kvetch about the company, but this seems - different. One reason: a lot of the criticisms are correct. Apple, for the first time in over a decade, simply isn't firing on all cylinders. Please don't interpret that as "Apple is doomed" because it's not, but there are things it's doing a lot less well than it could - and has. Apple's out of sync with itself. Here are a few of the things I think indicate Apple has gotten itself out of kilter and is in need of some course correction. This post by Chuq Von Rospach has been widely shared and debated all over the web, and it has some great insights into Apple's 2016. Note that Chuq Von Rospach is a former Apple (and Palm) employee, and certainly has the credentials to talk about these matters.

The outpouring of support allowed the Vision Fund, initiated by Japan’s SoftBank Group in October to reach its $100 billion weeks ahead of schedule. "We've worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple,” Josh Rosenstock, Apple spokesman, said in a statement. The fund has earned the praise of President-elect Donald Trump. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, has been actively courting Trump’s interest for weeks. Last month, Son visited Trump Tower in New York City and pledged to invest $50 billion from the fund into American tech companies with the overall goal of creating some 50,000 jobs. "[Son] said he would never do this had we not won the election!" Trump tweeted after their meeting in early December. Apple has some $200 billion reserved for strategic investments and has not been shy in providing funding for companies across the world, including some that directly compete with American firms. In May, for example, Apple invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-share company Didi Chuxing, a notable Uber competitor. Apple’s share in the fund pales in comparison to many other potential partners, many of which are based in the Middle East. When it announced the fund in October, SoftBank pledged to invest $25 billion over the next five years. Additionally, the bank claimed it was in ongoing talks with Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia about a potential investment of $45 billion, which has not yet been confirmed. Key investors from Abu Dhabi and Qatar have also suggested they will add to the fund.

To be eligible for a free pair of headphones, consumers need to place orders for an iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro (excluding late-2016 models with Touch Bar), MacBook Air, Mac Pro, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s Plus, according to Apple's official Chinese website. The promotion will start at 8.00am on January 6 until supplies are exhausted. Consumers are allowed to make purchases both online and in Apple stores but the offer only stands for the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, as well as Singapore where many ethnic Chinese people share a similar tradition. The latest Beat Solo3 wireless on-ear headphones are priced at 2,288 yuan ($329) in China. Apple has previously offered certain promotions for the Greater China markets ahead of the Chinese New Year in the past. Last year, Apple promised to gift special limited editions of the Apple Watch Sport and Beats Solo2 headphones. Apple has picked red products as gifts as the color is regarded as lucky and prosperous in Chinese culture. Aside from the red-colored headphones, Apple is also showcasing their litanies of red-themed accessories on its website as holiday picks for consumers.

(Neil Godwin/MacLife Magazine via Getty Images) The iPad Pro 2017 is one of the most-anticipated devices for this year. The rumors are surfacing on net saying that the upcoming device is will be packing great and fast features for all Apple fans. A new A10x processor, according to Techno Buffalo, will be part of the new iPad Pro 2 offering. But this could also add in the delay for the release of the device since the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had expressed that they are unable to produce enough of these chips before the expected March 2017 launch. Since a delay in the release of the iPad Pro 2017 is expected, he fans are hoping that Apple could work with other chipmakers also to meet their target release date for the device. There have been really a very few updates on the timeframe for device's release but Apple fans are counting on the expected release date of the device that is the first half of 2017. When it will make debut in this year probably, the iPad Pro 2 is thought to come in various models including a 7.9-inch variant and a 10.5-inch tablet option, reports Trusted Reviews. The upcoming Apple device is also rumored to remove the home button that will give iPad Pro 2 users a bigger screen and display. Along with this, the iPad Pro 2 is also rumored to have OLED displays which will be more power efficient since there is no need for a backlight for the tablet. This feature is also expected to be what Apple is planning to have for the upcoming iPhone 8 next year. iPad Pro 2017 will also feature great cameras,with a 12MP main rear shooter and a 5MP front-facing camera for selfies. Other features include a pink color variant, some new improved keyboard accessory and 4K video recording. According to MacRumors, still it is considered that the possible size of iPad Pro will be ranging between 9.7-inch to 12.7-inch and will launch on January 2017. The new Apple iPad could feature a four-speaker setup and an Apple Pencil support.     © 2017 Enstarz, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Those theaters are dark for reason. Apple may be working on a solution to this problem. Tech insider Sonny Dickson—who’s broken big Apple-related news before—tweeted that a coming iOS 10.3 update will have a “Theater Mode” (controlled with a popcorn icon). He didn’t give any details on what Theater Mode would do, but, as Collider notes, back in 2012, Apple patented a functionality that would “disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater)” or prevent “wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings).” At this point, any type of technology that automatically dims and silences a phone in a theater is just speculation, but, it’s a hopeful sign for annoyed moviegoers forced to deal with screen lights interrupting the middle of movies.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → The Tagalong OS  January 4, 2017January 4, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I’ve been thinking more about the Mac’s place in the world, and there’s more to worry about than “just” the hardware. An Obligatory Look Back Let’s talk about macOS’ release cycle. Here’s when every major version was released, and how long until it was replaced: Release: Date: Time on Market: Public Beta September 2000 6 months 10.0 Cheetah March 2001 6 months 10.1 Puma September 2001 11 months 10.2 Jaguar August 2002 14 months 10.3 Panther October 2003 18 months 10.4 Tiger April 2005 30 months 10.5 Leopard October 2007 22 months 10.6 Snow Leopard August 2009 23 months 10.7 Lion July 2011 12 months 10.8 Mountain Lion July 2012 15 months 10.9 Mavericks October 2013 12 months 10.10 Yosemite October 2014 11 months 10.11 El Capitan September 2015 12 months 10.12 Sierra September 2016 — There are some interesting things here. In the beginning, Apple moved very quickly to get updated versions out the door. This was a necessity, as Cheetah and Puma needed a lot of work. They were slow and prone to crashing. Starting with Jaguar, OS X began to stabilize. As things settled down, the release schedule slowed down. The result was that Jaguar, Panther, Tiger and Leopard where all big releases, chock-full of new features: Jaguar brought Bluetooth support, Rendezvous (now Bonjour), iChat, QuickTime 6, Sherlock 3-powered Finder search and more. In addition to new interface elements, Panther brought an improved Finder, Exposé, Fast User Switching, a much-improved Preview, Xcode and more. Tiger was on the market for 30 months, and was the OS Apple used to transition the Mac to Intel. It boasted Spotlight, Dashboard, iChat AV, Automator, VoiceOver, improved .Mac syncing, a new version of QuickTime and more. Leopard introduced Time Machine, Boot Camp, Back to my Mac, Spaces, Universal Access improvements, Stacks, Podcast Capture and Quick Look. Several of these released were also impacted by the rise of the iPod and the creation of the iPhone. Most notably, Leopard’s launch was delayed as Apple scrambled to finish the iPhone. I’m sure even more of that sort of thing took place behind the scenes. A Shift in Direction In 2009, Snow Leopard shipped with “no new features,” despite packing a lot of work under the hood to modernize Mac OS X. In the fall of 2010, Apple held its “Back to the Mac Event,” and showed off Mac OS X Lion, which was a big departure from Snow Leopard. The philosophy behind Lion was pretty simple, according to Steve Jobs: We started with Mac OS X, and we created from it a version called iOS, which we used in the iPhone. We invented some new things, and we’ve perfected it over the last several years, and it’s now used in the iPad as well. What’d we like to do… We’re inspired by some of those innovations in the iPad and the iPhone. We’d like to bring them back to the Mac. That’s what Lion’s about: Mac OS X meets the iPad. The keynote went on to highlight these features in Lion: Multi-Touch Gestures App Store App Home screens (Launchpad) Full-screen apps Auto save data within apps Resuming apps when launched These features ushered in the current era of macOS. Sierra may not be smothered in linen like Lion was, but almost everything we’ve seen since has been rooted Lion’s idea that macOS and iOS should have a lot more in common than they did initially. The Current Era Starting with Mountain Lion, Apple has been releasing new versions of macOS every year or so: Mountain Lion brought Notification Center, Messages, Notes and Reminders to the mac. Mavericks shipped deeper iCloud integration, Maps and iBooks. It also brought big changes to power management, including App Nap, Timer coalescing and compressed memory. Yosemite is best-known for its sweeping UI changes, merging what was left of Aqua with the iOS 7 aesthetic. Notification Center gained widget support, while Continuity meant passing data and work between the Mac and iOS devices was far easier. CloudKit and Photos.app were also featured. El Capitan was basically a modern Snow Leopard, with much of the work being small refinements. Sierra gave users the option to offload local files to iCloud and added support for Siri, TouchID and Apple Pay within Safari. Notably, iOS 10’s Messages improvements did not make it to the Mac. Role Reversal In looking at that chart and each release’s feature lit, it’s easy to feel that progress on macOS has slowed, despite the faster release cycle.1 In the early days, Apple had the pedal to the floor to get the OS to a point where it was usable for everyday consumers. With the advent of the iPod and then the iPhone, the Mac had to learn how to get along with its new, smaller siblings. Today, Apple isn’t the Mac company. It’s an ecosystem company, and the driving force is the iPhone. In the quest to find common ground between its two very different platforms, both iOS and macOS have seen changes. I think the Mac’s been at the short end of the stick, and Apple has been working to simplify it harder than it’s been working to complicate iOS. From renaming iCal as Calendar to Notification Center widgets, from Continuity to iCloud Clipboard, Apple wants moving from the Mac to iOS and back to be as seamless as possible without actually combining the platforms. (That’s not to mention macOS’ aging AppKit and the empty promise of Photos.app’s UXKit to help unify development across the platforms.) Improvements like Mavericks’ battery improvements or the addition of TouchID are welcome. The engineering it must take to bring features to the Mac and iOS at the same time seems incredible to me. However, it sure feels that most of the new macOS features over the last several years aren’t just about the Mac. Some think Apple doesn’t see macOS development as worthy of the investment it once enjoyed. I think the company views macOS as stable and mature, and doesn’t feel like rocking the boat, and instead wants to focus on making its entire product lineup work better together. To be fair, the Mac had a big headstart on the iPhone and iPad.  Whatever the reasons are, macOS isn’t in the driver’s seat anymore. iOS is, and it’s attempting lugging macOS along with it as the iPhone and iPad mature. I can’t blame Apple for that; they are an ecosystem company. It is focused on the big picture, not just the Mac anymore.  Mac users who don’t understand that will continue to be frustrated with the pace of things. Those who do will still probably be frustrated. Some say that the feature lists have gotten smaller because of the yearly cycle, but I don’t fully buy that. iOS is on an annual cycle, each year, WWDC is full of new features for iPhones and iPads. Secondly, big macOS projects could be planned further in advance than one release. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → RSS Sponsorship: LinkLocker is a lightweight bookmarking service with an emphasis on privacy.

For Apple to keep in touch, and in some cases stay ahead of its competitors, it will have to fully embrace this reality. Apple’s New Year’s resolution should be to start thinking like a media company. Here’s how it can do that. Image credit: Apple 1. Invest in original content for Apple TV Rumours about Apple putting serious money into original content started back in March but never seemed to get much beyond that stage. Netflix and Amazon have begun to prove that investment in original content pays dividends. Apple has the cash; now it needs to spend it wisely or it risks being completely left behind. 2. Secure more exclusive deals for Apple music One of the biggest advantages of Apple Music over Spotify is that Apple have secured exclusivity deals with major artists. With Spotify upping its game by bringing in original content like podcasts, Apple needs to utilise its uniquely powerful position in the music industry. It needs to continue to tie the best artists into its music platform. This gives people a reason to give Apple US$9.99 a month instead of Spotify. 3. Build video publishing platform Thanks to making some of the best consumer and professional level video editing software around, Apple is the leading platform for creating video. However, its rival Google owns the key platform for uploading sharing video. Apple should take the plunge and build a competitor to YouTube to secure itself as the major multimedia brand. 4. Find the next Snapchat In the age of Facebook Live, Periscope, Snapchat Stories and Twitter video, social media and traditional media are increasingly interchangeable. Of course, finding the next big player is easier said than done. Investing in a strong content based startup would not only be good in itself, but also bring in social skills to Apple, an area where it traditionally has been lacking. 5. Launch a streaming service The physical Apple TV is dead. However, that does not mean that Apple could not come up with a Netflix-style on demand service. This is something that the company has previously been rumoured to be working on. It would also tie in nicely with Apple TV, and the my thoughts on original content made in point one. By the end of 2017, the differences between media and tech companies will be even harder to distinguish than they are today. By making the above their new year’s resolutions, Apple can avoid being left behind by the competition.

Wouldn’t hurt to bring feature parity to the desktop to iOS as well. January 4, 2017 at 4:45 EST PM John Q January 5, 2017 Apple blew it in not joining the music streaming service earlier, but it’s making up ground due to its strength in the music industry, relationships with its executives, and millions of iTunes account holders. Apple is repeating the same mistake in not joining the video streaming/OTT game, but this time, it will be much harder if it finally wakes up, and joins after all the competitors have established their user bases. Unlike the music industry, which was hurting when Apple came along as a savior, the TV industry gets along fine without Apple, and won’t kowtow to its demands, as Eddie Cue discovered last year. Apple will have to pay the price, just like everyone else does, and if it doesn’t, AT&T/DTV, Sling/Dish, Sony/Vue, Hulu, and YouTube/Google will. Not to mention the entrenched cable industry which already serves eight in ten TV households. Apple doesn’t have any sway with the TV guys, and now even lacks the ultimate negotiator in Jobs, who was respected in Hollywood. January 5, 2017 at 3:16 EST AM brett_x January 5, 2017 If Apple would just release iMessages for android and windows it own a big part of messaging. Wouldn’t hurt to bring feature parity to the desktop to iOS as well. I think that ship sailed a few years ago when text messages were not unlimited, and Slack was not available.

Problem Solving | 02 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (43) Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2 by Adam C. Engst One of the first problems with macOS 10.12 Sierra revolved around PDFs created by Fujitsu’s ScanSnap scanners (see “ScanSnap Users Should Delay Sierra Upgrades,” 20 September 2016). Those problems turned out to be less severe than initially feared (see “ScanSnap Conflicts with Sierra Easily Avoided,” 3 October 2016), and Apple resolved them in macOS 10.12.1 (see “macOS 10.12.1 Sierra, watchOS 3.1, and tvOS 10.0.1 Mostly Fix Bugs,” 24 October 2016). Now, however, it seems Sierra’s PDF-related problems go deeper, and you should exercise caution when editing PDFs with Preview. The first I heard that Sierra’s PDF-related problems might affect more than ScanSnap scanners came in a comment left on one of those articles on 26 October 2016. Developer Craig Landrum, who founded the document management system company Mindwrap, said: The primary problem with Sierra with respect to PDFs is that Apple chose to rewrite the PDFKit framework in macOS 10.12 and it broke a number of things that PDF-related developers relied upon (I write scan-to-PDF software and know other developers who were impacted). Software that uses third-party PDF libraries probably runs fine, but those of us in the development community who relied upon Apple’s PDFKit library were really slammed — and we have no way to fix the problems ourselves. There have been numerous bug reports sent to Apple on the several serious issues found with PDFKit and we hope Apple addresses them in an upcoming point release. Since Craig Landrum’s comment came after the release of 10.12.1 and the fixes for ScanSnap, I filed his criticism of PDFKit away as something that likely had been true but was no longer. However, throughout the next few months, additional complaints kept surfacing. Eric Bönisch-Volkmann, head of DEVONtechnologies, told me that they’ve spent a significant amount of development time working around Sierra’s PDF-related bugs in DEVONthink. Christian Grunenberg, DEVONthink’s lead developer, characterized the rewritten version of PDFKit in Sierra as “a work in progress,” saying: Apple wants to use a common foundation for both iOS and macOS. However, it was released way too early, and for the first time (at least in my experience) Apple deprecated several features without caring about compatibility. And to make things worse, lots of former features are now broken or not implemented at all, meaning that we had to add lots of workarounds or implement stuff on our own. And there’s still work left to be done. 10.12.2 introduces new issues (it seems that Apple wants to fix at least the broken compatibility now) and of course fixed almost none of the other issues. It’s not only DEVONthink — a lot of other applications (such as EndNote, Skim, Bookends, and EagleFiler) are also affected. In fact, Michael Tsai, developer of EagleFiler, just published a blog post confirming his problems with PDFKit: I ran into a lot of PDF bugs in macOS 10.12.0. None have been fixed, as far as I can tell, and I’ve already filed two Radars for new issues in 10.12.2. It’s sad that basic functionality remains broken for so long — especially given that PDF was an area where Apple used to excel. More concerning, and this is what finally pushed me to track down all these reports and write this article, is that the recently released macOS 10.12.2 has introduced a serious new bug related to PDFKit. Brooks Duncan of the DocumentSnap site published a note from one of his readers that warns that the OCR text layer added to scanned PDFs by Fujitsu’s ScanSnap software will be deleted if you edit the PDF in Preview. Eric Bönisch-Volkmann confirmed this, saying ruefully: 10.12.2 fixes a few bugs but kills the OCR text layer in PDFs. We worked around the earlier bugs in DEVONthink 2.9.8 and will address 10.12.2’s new problems in the upcoming 2.9.9. But yes, as soon as you edit a PDF in Preview the text layer is gone. Our customers are delighted. Although the DocumentSnap reader said that the problem didn’t affect PDFs scanned and OCRed with other solutions, Brooks Duncan was able to reproduce the problem with scans made from both ScanSnap and Doxie scanners; he noted that both rely on the ABBYY FineReader engine. Sonny Software’s Jon Ashwell, developer of the Bookends bibliography app, expressed significant frustration as well, saying: We’ve been trying very hard to work around perfectly good code that was broken in Sierra. Versions 10.12.0 and 10.12.1 were bad, but 10.12.2 was a disaster for us, causing Bookends to crash when displaying PDFs with annotations. We’ve worked around that, but in the process had to shut down PDF annotations while we look for workarounds. I’ve filed a number of radars with Apple, two of which were closed as duplicates. In another case, I was asked to provide our app, but after doing so there has been only silence. I’ve never seen such a sorry case of sloppy code and indifference from Apple. Problems with PDF annotations have plagued other developers as well, to judge from irate posts in Apple’s developer forums. Christian Grunenberg laid the blame for the problems at Apple’s feet: Apple supports only a subset of the PDF specification, and that support has always been buggy. For instance, PDF documents containing Eastern European characters created by the older ABBYY FineReader 8 engine are corrupted by PDFKit after editing. And issues reported by Peter Steinberger (author of the PDF framework PSPDFKit) were simply closed with the response that Apple didn’t intend to fix them. Apps that don’t use PDFKit are immune from these problems, of course, but only to the extent that their PDFs aren’t shared more widely and edited in Preview. Greg Scown of Smile told me that PDFpen operates independently of PDFKit, but bugs in Preview impact PDFpen customers whose document recipients use Preview rather than PDFpen to view or edit them. We have not had reports of PDFpen causing data loss of documents’ OCR layers. Interestingly, Preview itself may suffer less from bugs in PDFKit than third-party apps. Michael Tsai said that some of the bugs he has seen don’t manifest themselves in Preview, suggesting that Apple’s Preview team is aware of the problems and is choosing to work around them rather than getting them fixed in PDFKit itself. It pains me to say this, speaking as the co-author of “Take Control of Preview,” but I have to recommend that Sierra users avoid using Preview to edit PDF documents until Apple fixes these bugs. If editing a PDF in Preview is unavoidable, be sure to work only on a copy of the file and retain the original in case editing introduces corruption of any sort. Smile’s PDFpen is the obvious alternative for PDF manipulation of all sorts (and for documentation, we have “Take Control of PDFpen 8” too), although Adobe’s Acrobat DC is also an option, albeit an expensive one. In the meantime, we’ll be watching closely to see which of these PDF-related bugs Apple fixes in 10.12.3, which is currently in beta testing.

PDFPen is good for OCR though. Reply Dave Kitabjian  2017-01-02 23:26 Actually, you heard at least the speculation from me before you heard it from Craig Landrum, when I posted: "We don't know if ScanSnap used OS X system libraries and APIs to perform their PDF rendering or if they used their own or those of a 3rd party. If the former, it's possible that this problem is not limited to ScanSnap generated PDFs, but will also affect other PDFs created on the Mac (eg, MS Office). But if ScanSnap "rolled their own" PDFs, then the problem may be limited to ScanSnap." http://tidbits.com/article/16810br/> ;-) I had a "bad feeling about this". And Michael Tsai is absolutely right that this is particularly painful because native PDF support was one of the foundational hallmarks of OS X and for the Sierra team to so royally screw this up is very "Apple Maps" of them. Truly unsettling. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-02 22:19 You were right on, as it turns out! Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-01-03 00:14 Sounds like another bit of evidence that Apple no longer cares about Mac users. No updates for desktop Macs, mediocre to dismal updates for MacBooks, increasingly buggy Mac OS software, etc. Reply Eddie  2017-01-03 01:39 Preview is a HORRIBLE application. It has never, in all my years of using Macs, NOT ruined a PDF by making it unsearchable. Also, large documents tend to cause frequent beachballs and crashing. I highly encourage users to NEVER use preview for documents they care about and need to search regularly. (I.e. User guides, technical documents, etc.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 09:57 Preview is far from perfect, but you're overstating the criticisms against it. We pay a LOT of attention to Preview because of our Take Control books (which are long, complex documents where searching is key), and it is generally fine. Long ago, using the Reduce Size Quartz filter would delete bookmarks, but that was fixed. For most people, most of the time, Preview is just a PDF viewer, and for that, it's usually fine. I'm sure there are PDFs out there that it can't handle, but that's not common. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 02:32 Adobe Reader will spin beachballs with even moderately sized documents. With large documents you might as well go brew yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. That said, I prefer Adobe Reader to Preview for reading PDFs because it retains my view preferences. And, of course, with it PDFs are readily searchable. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-01-07 09:41 What do you mean? Preview can also search PDFs. Reply Glenn Marston  2017-01-03 07:17 I wonder if the new PDFKit explains why the ability to fax was removed in Sierra. Some scoff at faxing. However, for many firms in the medical and legal fields, fax is the only electronic transmission accepted. The US Robotics Model 5630 USB fax modem works great through El Capitan. In Sierra, it and other fax modems are unsupported. The menu selection for faxing is "Fax PDF." Is PDFKit the cause for loss of faxing in Sierra? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 09:59 No, I don't think so. We covered that in: http://tidbits.com/article/16826 And several readers dove in even more deeply in the comments. The removal of faxing was related to the removal of other low-level software. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 02:36 Perhaps, but it's of a piece with the dumbing down of PDFKit. Apple has a long tradition of crippling or deleting useful features and software (Aperture). But I'm trying not to rant on TidBITS since I wrote a long e-mail to Tim Cook. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 10:30 There's a telling thread about this problem as it relates to the app Skim. https://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/bugs/1109/ Reply Chris  2017-01-03 11:46 Preview and PDF viewing in general has been a mess since around 10.10, possibly 10.9. Somebody at Apple screwed up on the math that resizes the PDF content in the window in Preview, which made it blurry for 2 years before finally semi-fixing it in 10.12. Notice the blurry text and weird hairline border around the page: https://puu.sh/ktaeN.png It's semi-fixed in 10.12, but it still happens sometimes in places like Quick Look and Safari especially when you try to zoom in: https://puu.sh/ktayf.png I tried filling a PDF form the other day, then Preview crashed and corrupted the PDF with it. Luckily file revisions still work and I was able to use that. It seems Apple keeps wanting to rewrite perfectly functioning code, and they end up introducing bugs in everything they touch. Mail.app, discoveryd, Preview and PDF, various bugs in the Finder and Safari... It's starting to get pretty annoying dealing with new bugs popping up in every release and almost never getting fixed properly. Reply Damon  2017-01-05 06:00 yes has hallmarks of the discoveryd fiasco, doesn't it? Reply Tom Jordahl  2017-01-03 12:32 Tidbits continually ignores the very fine, FREE, Adobe software that is *the* gold standard for viewing PDFs - Acrobat Reader. And for anyone that is editing PDFs for any serious purpose, Acrobat Pro is the clear choice. As the creator of PDFs, Adobe doesn't just throw compatibility to the wind like Apple does. I know Adobe isn't a Tidbits sponsor and other companies are, but IMHO discussions about PDF should not routinely dismiss the Adobe tools (especially the free ones) as too expensive to consider. Full disclosure, I work for Adobe, but not on Acrobat, so I am slightly more than just an Adobe fan. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-01-03 14:03 I gave up on Adobe Acrobat Reader years ago because it was a slow, bloated pig with new security vulnerabilities regularly discovered. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 17:16 The context of noting that Acrobat DC is expensive was in relation to editing PDFs, which Acrobat Reader won't do. And Acrobat DC is in a completely different price ballpark than PDFpen. We do use Acrobat Pro XI for Take Control work, but we need Creative Cloud for InDesign as well. Newer versions of Acrobat won't work for us because essential plugins like Aerialist aren't compatible with Acrobat DC on the Mac, forcing us to stay with the old version. And, I have to say, I find even XI to be a UI step backward from earlier versions, since most of the controls are hidden and have to brought out manually and added to a custom sidebar. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 03:02 I agree. I don't like the UI in the newer versions of Adobe Reader (it hasn't been Acrobat Reader for many years now, guys, but I guess old habits die hard). I try to avoid the Adobe Reader DC versions. For one thing their version numbers are a mess, with DC this and DC that. It's apparently up to version 15 now. I'm using Adobe Reader 11.0.18, which I think is the last pre-DC version. It seems to work find in Sierra. That said, Reader has always required at least a little tinkering in the toolbar, depending on what features you like to use. Compared to you guys, though, my needs are pretty basic, like reading Take Control e-books. TidBITS is good enough to make them available in other formats, ePub for iBooks and Mobi for Kindle. But, like I said, old habits die hard. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, which is sadly not part of either Adobe's or Apple's philosophical tool kit. It seems to me that the DC versions of Reader try too hard to get you to use Adobe's cloud services. But, since I'm not using Creative Cloud, I haven't yet been drawn into their airy-fairy ecosystem. The CS 6 apps work OK in Sierra. Again I'm no longer into fancy document production, which means I can avoid both Adobe's and Apple's cloud briar patches. For now, anyway. Reply Michael  2017-01-03 12:37 PDF Expert has been mentioned in this thread; it's been my default PDF reader on OS X since its release (because of my experience with the iOS version), and I can confirm that editing/annotating and highlighting does not remove the text layer and keeps the PDF file searchable. Reply Vaclav Slavik  2017-01-03 13:24 Rendering of signatures is similarly broken since 10.12.2. Filing radars with Apple has no observable effect. Reply Pavel Sakhatskyi  2017-01-03 14:10 Hi guys, I'm Paul from PDF Expert team. Thanks for mentioning our app. Since I see numerous concerns arising around this issue, I’d love to assure you that there’s nothing to worry about if you use PDF Expert. We don't rely on PDF Kit and have our own file saving mechanics. Your PDFs are in good hands :) Cheers Reply PT  2017-01-03 14:25 Since East European characters are mentioned, I'll jump in by saying that East Asian characters are also not searchable in a pdf if exported in Safari. Selecting them in Preview and you'll only see a series of blocks, rather than the characters themselves. I first notice this problem in Mavericks and Apple never got around to fixing it. Reply John Baxter   2017-01-03 15:29 My Macs are too old for Sierra so I'm still on El Capitan. The Preview I have is version 8.1 (877.7). 1. What Preview version is on up-to-date Sierra machines? 2. Am I worried about PDFs being corrupted? 3. Things like this PDFKit problem will drive me to Windows. (I like Windows 10, so that isn't a problem for me.) I won't make that call until we see what's happening with desktop Macs, but PDFKit makes it more likely. (My Apple ][ serial 537 is in the attic crying at this moment.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 16:43 Sierra's Preview is 9.0. If you're not using Sierra, there's no need to worry, since you're not using the rewritten PDFKit. Reply Paul Clark  2017-01-03 18:16 the only workaround currently is using the adobe app to view / edit Reply Mike C  2017-01-03 21:07 Is it possible to replace the new Sierra PDFKit with an earlier version from El Cap? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 10:26 Technically, yes, but then Sierra's Preview may not work properly. There was discussion of doing this in https://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/bugs/1109/ Reply mnott  2017-01-04 14:27 Actually I documented this - see my link below - and really, the issues you get appear to be much less than the issues you solve. It is not that "Sierra" isn't working properly, the only thing I did observe is that sometimes Preview may refuse to launch. But then I've also included a little script which you can call at runtime to just switch to the newer version of PDFKit. I considered the problems gone after a hot fix, and hence no longer recommended doing that, but apparently they came back. The only "real" drawback is that if you want to keep switching, you need to keep rootless disabled. Well, we didn't have that one for years, so I don't really care. Reply Simon   2017-01-04 01:07 It's not just Sierra Preview that's buggy. I have issues in El Cap Preview as well. For example, in PDF forms for some reason Preview will not display checked boxes. Open the same PDF in Adobe Reader and the checkboxes are checked. But you'd never know judging from Preview. There checkboxes just appear empty. I would have switched to Adobe Reader if it weren't such a pig. A real shame Apple can't get its act together with Preview. Superior PDF handling used to be one of the major OS X advantages. /sigh Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 10:29 This isn't generally true of Preview; when Josh and I wrote "Take Control of Preview," we had no trouble with checkboxes being checked. Try the IRS form 1040, for instance. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf That said, PDF is a rather complex format, and it's entirely possible that some apps (including Preview) get it wrong, either in writing it out or reading it in. So I'm not surprised that Preview might have trouble with some PDFs. Acrobat Reader will be the gold standard for interpreting PDF. Reply Simon   2017-01-04 10:54 Ironically I was having a lot of trouble with checkboxes with a US Government form. I-864 actually. Reply mnott  2017-01-04 14:20 This so seriously sucks, as shown on the Skim forum. Apple is pushing back their most competent developers - perhaps because they're called variants of Christia(a)n? Anyway. Preview already got so much worse in like Yosemite when annotating became a multi click adventure. Now it sometimes just OOMs. And PDFKit breaks about everywhere. Apple appears to get really everything seriously wrong these days. Laptops that for no reason drop ports and battery life, an OS that sucks each version more, etc. - and nobody from Apple seems to care as long as IPhones sell like sliced bread. I've created not really a solution for the PDFKit problem, essentially documenting every single step you need to take if you want to restore an older version. Maybe this helps someone: http://www.mnott.de/how-to-workaround-the-fucked-up-pdfkit-in-sierra/ HTH, M Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 14:41 Thanks for the link to the instructions! Reply Damon  2017-01-05 06:03 Excellent tech journalism, thanks :-) Reply Stussy  2017-01-05 18:57 10.12.3 Beta 2 FIXES all the issues, well the ones that I've tested! I can now view all my exiting PDFs, scan new ones and save them as encrypted and re-open them AND scanning with OCR the invisible text layer is preserved!! Install it now!!! :) Reply Stefan  2017-01-06 08:00 I still can reproduce at least one issue: Open PDF file generated by the ScanSnap software, edit&save it – OCR text is gone. Apple needs to do some more homework. Reply Deanna  2017-01-05 20:37 All of a sudden I can't view real estate documents as pdf. Half the data of the page is missing. I've downloaded Adobe Reader as a partial workaround but this update is a mess! Electronic signing doesn't work, docs can't be viewed...I am hoping for an update soon. From what I read here this is exactly the problem. Reply strumsky  2017-01-09 23:11 I haven't seen anyone here commenting about Safari crashing when using Print function to create/save as a pdf file (rather than printing a document). This has happened ever since Sierra for me and others in our company. Perhaps it's related? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-10 10:55 Seems to work OK here... Reply Tom Robinson   2017-01-10 16:37 10.12.2 broke the display of the table of contents in Preview for me, but only for some PDFs: instead of chapter, etc., titles it now displays strings of garbage. Reply Stussy  2017-01-14 16:15 Beta 3 seems to have fixed ALL the issues! And heck, Beta 4 just came out! Reply Stussy  2017-01-14 17:23 Beta 4 seems fine too Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-14 17:45 The word I heard from a developer was that Beta 3 fixed the problem with Preview deleting the OCR text layer when editing a PDF, but none of the other issues with PDF handling in Sierra. We'll see what happens when 10.12.3 actually ships. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Photo by Josh Miller/CNET It's no secret China has long censored US-based websites and newspapers. And last month the government focused on a new target: The New York Times app. Authorities asked Apple to remove both the English-language and Chinese-language New York Times apps from its Chinese iTunes store, according to the Times. And Apple complied with the request on December 23. "For some time now The New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations," Apple spokesman Fred Sainz wrote in an email. "As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer The New York Times app for download in China." China's government-instituted censorship rules have long kept the country's population from accessing international news, limiting citizens' ability to share information and opinions on sensitive subjects. Popular sites and services such as Gmail, Facebook and Twitter have also been blocked in the country. In the past, Apple has removed other book and news apps in China, including its own News app that aggregates the day's headlines. China began blocking access to The New York Times' website in 2012, according to the newspaper, after it wrote several articles about then prime minister Wen Jiabao. Apps from The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal are still available in the Chinese iTunes Store, however. Update, 2:54 p.m.: Adds comment from Apple spokesman Fred Sainz.

A woman on her smartphone on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Image: Bernd von Jutrczenka/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images By Sasha Lekach2017-01-04 22:53:06 UTC Apple has cut the cord to any China-based New York Times iPhone readers. The Times reported on Wednesday that Apple removed both the English and Chinese-language versions of the newspaper's apps from the iTunes  store on Dec. 23. Other news publications are still available for download. Apple told the NYT that Chinese authorities had flagged the app as a "violation of local regulations."  The puzzling part about the take-down is the lack of communication between the NYT and the Chinese government. Authorities reportedly worked only with Apple, leaving the paper in the dark about the removal. When Mashable reached out to Apple for more information about the app removal Apple spokesman Fred Sainz responded with the same statement given to the NYT.  The statement reads: "For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China." some China-Apple-NYT censorship oddities... China didn't contact the Times, as it has in the past. It worked entirely through Apple — katie benner (@ktbenner) January 4, 2017 The NYT has connected the removal with the timing of a story about the Chinese government getting too cozy with iPhone manufacturing. The government closely monitors media and censors many websites and online platforms. The app was the only way for readers in China to legally access NYT content since 2012 when the paper's website was blocked by the government.

In case U.S. companies needed a reminder, China has served up a bold one in requiring Apple to pull down the New York Times app from its Chinese App Store. Neither Apple nor China publicly specified what local laws the newspaper was breaking, but Apple said it was notified that the app had run afoul of the country’s rules. “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Apple said in a statement. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” Apple declined to comment beyond the statement, however, refusing to say what form the government request took, when it was received or what law the Times’ apps are said to have violated. Google has notably opted not to do certain business in China, but other U.S. tech firms including Yahoo and Microsoft have found the market too big to ignore, forcing them to do all manner of unpleasant things, including providing user information on dissidents. And for Apple, China is huge. It’s one of the biggest markets for all manner of products, including iPhones and the App Store, as well as the place where nearly all of its goods are manufactured. Last quarter, the Greater China region accounted for nearly a fifth of Apple’s $46.8 billion in revenue. The New York Times already has its website blocked by Chinese censors, but a redesigned iOS app allowed customers to bypass the firewall. The New York Times said in its article on the issue that the app will continue to work for those that have it, but that new users will have to find a way to get the app from another country’s App Store (which typically requires having a foreign credit card). The newspaper criticized Apple’s move and asked the company to reconsider its decision. “This is a deeply regrettable decision,” a New York Times representative said in a statement. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country — coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world, including the United States.” Subscribe to Recode Newsletters Recode Daily (Top News) Events Products Go recode_divider More From Recode SpaceX nailed its first launch since last year’s big explosion Note to Tesla owners: Don’t forget your car keys Balaji Srinivasan, who may run the FDA for Trump, hates the FDA.

"We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet told the Journal . The SoftBank Vision Fund, which the Japanese company is hoping to launch next year, could be one of the largest global tech investment funds, with the potential size of the Fund going up to $100 billion. SoftBank itself expects to invest at least $25 billion. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund could become the leading funding partner, with its potential $45 billion investment over five years.

SoftBank, OneWeb and Trump Apple’s investment plans comes after SoftBank announced on Dec. 20 that it had agreed to invest $1 billion in the U.S. tech company OneWeb Ltd., which plans to construct and launch a constellation of hundreds of internet-beaming satellites in low-Earth orbit over the next decade. SoftBank’s plans with OneWeb came just days after the Japanese company’s CEO met with president-elect Donald Trump and vowed to create 50,000 jobs and invest $50 billion in U.S. startups. Trump, meanwhile, went on Twitter and took credit for the deal, saying it would have never happened had he not won the Nov. 8 election.

A large crowd gathered in the Aggieville entertainment district to watch an apple drop at the stroke of midnight. But the crowd was disappointed when the apple remained on top of a pole. Linda Mays, executive director of the Aggieville Business Association, says the winch that drops the apple malfunctioned a few hours before the event and efforts to fix it were unsuccessful. The Manhattan Mercury reports fireworks went off when the countdown to midnight reached zero and Mays says the event was still a success. In New York, Mariah Carey ran into technical problems during her performance at the ball drop celebration in Times Square.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 4, 2017 10:20 pm UTC Enlarge / The iOS version of The New York Times app. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 81 Share this story Further ReadingNYT: China bans Apple’s iBooks and iTunes Movies stores Citing local Chinese regulations, Apple confirmed today to The New York Times that the publication's English- and Chinese-language apps had been removed from the Chinese version of the Apple app store. Apple said that "when the situation changes, the App Store will once again offer The New York Times app for download in China," but it declined to cite the specific regulations violated or who had contacted Apple about it in the first place. The apps were removed from the store on December 23. According to the Times, the Chinese government has been taking steps to block the publication in the country since a series of articles in 2012 highlighted the hidden wealth of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and his family. Legislation called "The Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services" passed in June of 2016 prohibits apps from publishing "prohibited" information among other things, and the Times suspects this is the rule that got its news apps pulled. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” said NYT spokesperson Eileen Murphy. China has become a very important territory for Apple's bottom line in the last couple of years, though 2016's sales were far below the heights of 2015's. The country also plays a large part in the manufacturing of Apple's hardware—the Times detailed last week the billions of dollars in benefits and subsidies that China and the city of Zhengzhou have provided to Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn. These reasons make it beneficial for Apple to play ball with Chinese authorities and make investments in China and Chinese companies. But there have been other censorship-related clashes, like when China shut down the Chinese iTunes movie and book stores just a few months after allowing them to open. Apple has also refused to give its operating systems' source code to the country. When contacted for comment, Apple Director of Corporate Communications Fred Sainz told Ars that Apple had no statements beyond what was already printed in the Times article. Readers in China can still access the Times' reporting using a VPN or other software that circumvents the country's so-called "Great Firewall."

The English-language and Chinese-language versions of the Times app disappeared from Apple's App Store in China Dec. 23, despite other publications with international presence like the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal remaining available. “We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, told the New York Times. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” Apple's spokesperson declined to provide further information on what local regulations the apps had violated. The spokesperson also did not provide any information as to who exactly contacted Apple about the apps and didn't disclose if a court order or other legal document was presented regarding the apps. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's primary internet regulator, also provided the Times with no additional information about the removal. The organization's bureau in Beijing was not contacted by the Chinese government prior to the removal of the apps. Eileen Murphy, a New York Times spokeswoman, said the company has asked Apple to reconsider its decision. Related Stories China Bans 120 Songs For Promoting Violence, Obscenity How Some VPNs Are Getting Around China's Great Firewall The Times theorized the removal request was made under a set of regulations imposed by China in June of last year. The rules, titled the Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services, say apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.” Apps also aren't allow to publish “prohibited” information, according to the cyberspace administration. The removal of the New York Times apps from the App Store is the highest profile instance of Apple's acquiescence to China's efforts to censor certain content. The company even blocked access to its own News app in an effort to meet the requirements of the Chinese government. China previously censored the New York Times website in 2012 following a series of articles on profiteering by the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.  Readers in China can still access information from the New York TImes and other censored publications using virtual private networks (VPNs) that spoof their location to a region that is not restricted, though China has repeatedly cracked down on the use of the software that allows such a workaround.

The earnings report will take a look at iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 sales throughout the holiday quarter, as well as sales of the new MacBook Pro that was introduced in October. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple posted revenue of $46.9 billion and net quarterly profit of $9 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share. That was down from $51.5 billion and net quarterly profit of $11.1 billion, or $1.96 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Apple's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 includes expected revenue of $76 to $78 billion and gross margin between 38 and 38.5 percent. Based on Apple's estimates, Q1 2017 will mark Apple's return to growth following its first annual revenue decline since 2001. Apple will release its quarterly earnings statement at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time), with a conference call to follow at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 pm. Eastern Time). MacRumors will provide live coverage of the results and the call. 25 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) stukdog 2 weeks ago I don't even want to hear about the fabled "product pipeline" this time around.

The past "pipeline" contained the AirPods, for example, a completely unexpected mega-hit that will fuel further growth. [doublepost=1483569298][/doublepost] In 6 years of TC's robotic repetition that Apple has a great product pipeline he was able to come out with ONE truly buzz worthy product -- AirPods. Meanwhile he's practically gutted the Mac line -- its peripherals for sure. The iPad has gets no love, just price hikes. All TC and Shiller can say about it is that it's magical and PC users should buy one. Samsung has pretty much caught up with the iPhone feature-wise, and but-for it's battery woes, it would have likely stifled iPhone sales even more than they already were because, well, Apple has made the iPhone boring and its models irritatingly gimpped unless you want the largest screen. AppleWatch had promise but TC was hypnotized by Ive's insistence it could be the next Cartier for the Rich And Famous and Fashionista crowd by covering it in gold and doing nothing more. This even as it was clear the real market was fitness -- not just faux step counting, but actual sports data monitoring and collection. It took Apple how long to incorporate GPS into the watch? Meanwhile Garmin just announced some fantastic new Fenix models that surpass AW's sports functions (they alway did) but also look like real watches, not an oversized piece of Chiclet gum. Seriously -- TC's signature mark on Apple thus far is paying a lot of money for a headphone company and its top executives and then still not being able to negotiate a TV streaming deal for AppleTV -- the most expensive non-4K streamer on the market today and with limited Siri commands. So please, stop telling us how great Apple is under TC's tutelage until he starts actually releasing amazing, interesting products en masse from this so called vast product pipeline, not one ever 6 years.

"Coming soon...to the nearest Rumor site near you." [doublepost=1483577122][/doublepost] I wonder if the word "Mac" will be even mentioned? Or even "desktop?" If I hear the word "pipeline" again... LOL....I just want Apple to say it that it's done...or it's continuing. No more putting people in limbo status...or sending us to some purgatory place.

Apple joins SoftBank’s Vision Fund with $1 billion investment Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story Toyota’s Concept-i is a vehicle designed to learn about its driver Today, Apple confirmed plans to invest in SoftBank’s massive $100 billion Vision Fund, the international tech fund the telecom giant announced last October. In a statement to TechCrunch, Apple verified its involvement in the fund, a rumor first reported by The Wall Street Journal in mid December: “Apple is planning to invest $1 billion in SoftBank’s Vision Fund. We’ve worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple.” The fund, a joint effort between SoftBank and the government of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), reportedly seeks to invest in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. In December, Apple published a paper detailing its AI research, and its interest in IoT through HomeKit is ongoing. Beyond’s Apple’s $1 billion investment, SoftBank is investing roughly $25 billion in the Vision Fund, with another $45 billion to come from Saudi Arabia. Qualcomm and Oracle are also rumored to be interested. In statements to TechCrunch, both companies declined to comment on their potential interest in the fund. Update: SoftBank confirmed to TechCrunch that Foxconn, Qualcomm, and Larry Ellison’s family office plan to invest in the Vision Fund. The Vision Fund recently became entangled with President-elect Donald Trump, when he claimed credit for Vision Fund plans that pre-dated his election win. Trump appears to have coordinated with SoftBank CEO and Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son, tweeting a misleading boast about his role in creating new jobs. Given SoftBank’s enduring desire to buy T-Mobile, Son’s interest in buttering up the deregulation-friendly incoming president is obvious. With a whopping $100 billion to point toward hot developments in tech, it’s no surprise that a large chunk of the fund will be aimed at American tech companies. Now, through Apple, a sliver of the international fund will originate stateside, as well.

The publication stated that both the English-language and Chinese-language apps were removed on December 23rd, which happened a day after the paper published a piece about a Chinese propaganda video warning about the West’s “devilish claws.” The Times were told by an Apple spokesman that China told Apple the paper was in violation of local rules. “We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” Sainz wouldn’t tell the Times what violations they committed and who had personally contacted Apple. The paper also noted in the piece that their websites have been blocked in China since 2012 and that hackers with potential ties to China later went after the Times’ computer systems. When asked by the BI Times about the story, a Times spokesman told them the following: “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world.” Currently, as highlighted by the NYT, The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal are available in the Chinese app store.

Apple spokesperson Kristin Huguet has given its official statement on the investment (via the Wall Street Journal). “We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple.” She added Apple has worked with the Japanese telecom company for many years. Softbank’s project originated back in October and projects that it will raise $100 billion towards its Vision Fund. While $1B might seem like a lot, it’s nothing compared to $25B from Softbank itself, and $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s government. Investments aren’t a normal thing from Apple. However, spending some of the $200 billion in its cash reserve every once and a while could lead to some smart investments. The company notably invested $1B in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. Tags: investment, Softbank About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

"For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz told The Hill. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” ADVERTISEMENT The app had previously been one of the few ways for Chinese users to read the American newspaper without using software like Tor or VPNs to bypass government censorship walls, reports the Times. China started blocking access to the paper’s website in 2012, after it ran a series of critical stories about the wealth accrued by the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.  The country is Apple’s largest market for sales of the iPhone.  Both the paper's Chinese- and English-language apps were removed from the China App Store on Dec. 23. Apple has removed other media apps in the past.  The tech company, based in Cupertino, Calif., declined to specify which Chinese laws the Times was in violation of. The Times reports that the request to remove its app seems to be the result of a new Chinese regulation passed in June 2016, titled the Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulation reads that apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.” “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said in a statement.

Among the new products is an updated BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Breakaway Cable for the 2016 MacBook Pro, as well as a new USB-A adapter, a car charger, and a wall charger that all use the BreakSafe magnetic connectors. Griffin started selling an older version of the BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Breakaway cable after Apple first released the 12-inch MacBook that used standardized USB-C instead of Apple’s proprietary magnetic MagSafe connectors. But we noted following the introduction of the new 2016 MacBook Pro that also made the switch to USB-C that the Griffin product was only powerful enough to offer 60W of power, not quite enough for the 87W needed to power the larger Pro models at fully. That’s why the updated “Hi-Power” version Griffin is showing off at CES has been designed for a capacity of up to 100 watts. USB-C certainly has many advantages, but losing the magnetic MagSafe safety feature in the process wasn’t one of them. BreakSafe fixes that.  Unfortunately, the new 100W product loses the Apple-like aesthetics of the previous version (as pictured above). The previous version compatible with 12-inch MacBooks– still available for $39-– sports a slimmer design that fits in with Apple’s black and aluminum look of the MacBook. The new Hi-Power BreakSafe USB-C cable won’t be ready until Q2, but Griffin will have a new USB BreakSafe adapter ($19) in the first quarter of this year that adds the magnetic connector to other devices with USB-A and power/data at speeds up to 480 Mbps. BreakSafe Car Charge and BreakSafe Wall Charger (both $39.99) will round out the lineup in Q2. Those will bring the BreakSafe line over to phones and tablets too, allowing support for a large range of tablets and smartphones and power via USB.  Griffin is also showing off a new Connected Coffee Maker ($99.99) and Connected Toaster ($99.99) will both be available Q2 2017. Connected Mirror ($999.99) is scheduled for late 2017.  blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « U.S. Patent Office ordered by Court to reexamine a 2009 Apple Patent they rejected on insufficient Grounds | Main | Two Apple patents surfacing today cover a 3D Mapping Projector & the new Apple Store Glass Door System » January 04, 2017 Gartner Sees 2017 as a Stagnating Year for the Tech Sector   Gartner is the bearer of bad news if their forecast for 2017 plays out. Gartner sees 2017 being a flat year for PC's and Mobile Phones by projecting a total of 2.3 billion units in 2017, the same as it was for 2016.   Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner states in the report that "The global devices market is stagnating. Mobile phone shipments are only growing in emerging Asia/Pacific markets, and the PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline."   This is why Samsung introduced new Galaxy A-series right out the gate to start off the New Year gunning for emerging market customers with excellent specifications for the mid-tier market starting at $400 or about half of what a premium device sells for.   Apple competitors Huawei, Oppo and Vivo all sell mid-tier smartphones with 5" displays in the $250-400 range. Apple's iPhone SE sells for between $400 and 450 with a 4" display. It's been rumored that Apple would attend the Mobile World Congress this year and if so, perhaps we'll see Apple introduce a 4.7" display for the iPhone SE and bump their entry unit to 32GB data to better compete in this important segment serving emerging markets. With Apple pushing into Indonesia this year, this would be the time to beef up their SE model.   If Apple could strengthen their entry iPhone and deliver a hot anniversary model this fall, I think that Apple will be able to beat the stagnation that Gartner is forecasting.   Mr. Atwal added in Gartners report that "Consumers have fewer reasons to upgrade or buy traditional devices. They are seeking fresher experiences and applications in emerging categories such as head mounted displays (HMDs), virtual personal assistant (VPA) speakers and wearables."   It was rumored back in September that Apple may have a Siri-centric Home Automation Device like Google Home and Amazon's Echo in the works for this year. An Apple HMD is also reportedly in the works but no time frame is known at this time.   Finally, the Gartner report notes that "Device vendors are increasingly trying to move into faster-growing emerging device categories. 'This requires a shift from a hardware-focused approach to a richer value-added service approach." .   The services area is one that Apple's CEO has championed at Apple to the dismay of Wall Street. During Cook's opening statement covering their last financial conference in October, this is some of what he said on this topic:   "We had a record setting quarter for services with revenue growth accelerating by 24% reaching 6.3 billion. App store revenue continued to skyrocket where music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music.   We remain very confident about the future of our services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017."   Apple seems to have all the bases covered for 2017 and only time will tell if they'll be able to stand above their competition that will be battling it out to just break even in a very tough year that Gartner is projecting.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Softbank has its hands in robotics, smart vehicles, processors and more. It even invests in other companies, and recently set up the Softbank Vision Fund with the goal of pouring billions of dollars into promising start ups. Now that fund is getting another investor: Apple. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has pledged to invest $1 billion in Softbank's Vision Fund. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," spokeswoman Krisitn Huguet said. Softbank is expected to use the find to invest in smart objects, and IoT connected projects -- an area Apple has mostly stayed away from. It's a good way for Apple to grab some stake in an area of technology it's otherwise left alone, but don't expect a lot more contributions from the company. When Tim Cook first commented on Softbank's fund back in July, he noted an investment might be incoming, but that it won't be "something that you'll see a whole string of from us."

Apple joins SoftBank’s Vision Fund with $1 billion investment Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story Toyota’s Concept-i is a vehicle designed to learn about its driver Today, Apple confirmed plans to invest in SoftBank’s massive $100 billion Vision Fund, the international tech fund the telecom giant announced last October. In a statement to TechCrunch, Apple verified its involvement in the fund, a rumor first reported by The Wall Street Journal in mid December: “Apple is planning to invest $1 billion in SoftBank’s Vision Fund. We’ve worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple.” The fund, a joint effort between SoftBank and the government of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), reportedly seeks to invest in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. In December, Apple published a paper detailing its AI research, and its interest in IoT through HomeKit is ongoing. Beyond’s Apple’s $1 billion investment, SoftBank is investing roughly $25 billion in the Vision Fund, with another $45 billion to come from Saudi Arabia. Qualcomm and Oracle are also rumored to be interested. In statements to TechCrunch, both companies declined to comment on their potential interest in the fund. Update: SoftBank confirmed to TechCrunch that Foxconn, Qualcomm, and Larry Ellison’s family office plan to invest in the Vision Fund. The Vision Fund recently became entangled with President-elect Donald Trump, when he claimed credit for Vision Fund plans that pre-dated his election win. Trump appears to have coordinated with SoftBank CEO and Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son, tweeting a misleading boast about his role in creating new jobs. Given SoftBank’s enduring desire to buy T-Mobile, Son’s interest in buttering up the deregulation-friendly incoming president is obvious. With a whopping $100 billion to point toward hot developments in tech, it’s no surprise that a large chunk of the fund will be aimed at American tech companies. Now, through Apple, a sliver of the international fund will originate stateside, as well.

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr January 5, 2017 4:09 PM PST @darakerr Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son speaks at ARM TechCon 2016.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Apple has said it will invest $1 billion in one of the world's biggest future-tech funds. The iPhone-maker confirmed Wednesday that it plans to invest the money in the SoftBank Vision Fund, according to The Wall Street Journal. The investment fund, created by Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank Group, is scheduled to launch in the next few weeks with a focus on emerging technologies. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," Kristin Huguet, Apple spokeswoman, told the Journal. Apple and SoftBank have a long history of working together. In 2008, Apple made SoftBank its exclusive Japanese iPhone seller, according to the Journal, which helped skyrocket sales. SoftBank has reportedly been working to raise $100 billion for its Vision Fund, making it one of the world's biggest tech funds. SoftBank has invested $25 billion in the fund, which was announced in October, and Saudi Arabia's government is investing $45 billion, according to the Journal. A SoftBank spokesman confirmed that Qualcomm, Foxconn and Larry Ellison's family office also plan to invest in the fund. Earlier this year, SoftBank bought chip designer ARM for about $32 billion. The deal was part of the company's push into the so-called internet of things, the idea of connecting more devices and objects to the web. In May, Apple invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. Apple didn't respond to request for comment. First published January 4, 12:47 p.m. PT.

Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said, “We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple.” She added Apple has worked with the Japanese telecom company for many years. SoftBank aims to raise $100 billion for the fund which will formally launch in a few weeks. SoftBank is investing $25 billion itself, Saudi Arabia is investing $45 billion and other investors could include Qualcomm as well as the sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi. Masayoshi Son, Chief Executive of SoftBank is creating the fund to help put his company and investors at the forefront of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Last month, President Elect Trump announced that SoftBank plans to invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy and create 50,000 jobs.

Buyer's Guide: Everything you need to know Tablets come in all shapes and sizes, from professional slabs to compact pieces perfect for flinging into a backpack. If you’re looking to buy one, where do you start? Odds are you’ll want an outstanding all-rounder, but are you in the market for a work-ready Windows tablet, a premium Android tablet, or one the many members of Apple's growing iPad family? Well, this line-up includes every operating system going – there are iOS, Android, Windows 8.1 and even Amazon Fire OS tablets here – and the winners come in a range of shapes and sizes, not to mention with a rich variety of specifications and key features. Skip through to each page and you'll find short summaries of what makes each tablet so great, a link to our full in-depth reviews, as well as quick links to Amazon so you can take the plunge. Got any questions in the meantime? Then fire away in the comments.  Best tablets of 2017 1. Apple iPad Air 2 Price when reviewed: from £379 inc VAT Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 9.7in 1,536 x 2,048 1.2MP 8MP Triple-core Apple A8X 2GB RAM 16/64/128GB No microSD 12h 46m video playback Apple's iPad Air 2 set the standard in the tablet market when it launched back in 2014. It was the thinnest in the world at the time (yes, time really does pass that quickly), but somehow managed to pack in a fingerprint sensor, a triple-core A8X processor and a stunningly crisp 9.7in display. And yet, despite Apple launching the iPad Pro 12.9in and 9.7in since, the iPad Air 2 remains our favourite tablet. Why? Because it's still great, and the price hasn't skyrocketed. In fact, the iPad Air 2 is £20 cheaper today than it was at launch; the latest iPad Pro 9.7in costs a hefty £549 – and that's without including the keyboard. So, while Apple deigns to keep the Air 2 on sale it's the best tablet you can buy. Subtle screen improvements round off the tweaks, but it's the balance of overall quality and capability that leave the iPad Air 2 on top. The iPad Pro 9.7 might be dramatically more powerful, but if it's all-round excellence for sensible money you're after, then the iPad Air 2 is still the better bet. Click here to read our Apple iPad Air 2 review | Buy the iPad Air 2 now from Apple 2. Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7in Price when reviewed: £400 inc VAT, 32GB Wi-Fi Buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7in now from Amazon Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 9.7in 1,536 x 2,048 2.1MP 8MP Octa-core Exynos 5433 3GB RAM 32/64GB + microSD 12h 09m video playback Imagine an Android tablet that rivals the iPad Air 2 for raw performance, and that matches Apple's tablet pixel for pixel while providing superior image quality. The Galaxy Tab S2 9.7in is that tablet. It's a mere 5.6mm-thin, and weighs 389g (10% lighter than the Air 2), yet feels solid and sturdy in all the right ways. That 9.7in screen is absolutely delicious, too. You might think it difficult to improve on the iPad Air 2's screen, but the Samsung's manages it. It covers a wider, more intense range of colours, and as it uses Super AMOLED technology the contrast is perfect, with black reproduced as a perfect inky nothingness rather than the very dark grey of IPS technology. So, what are the the downsides? Well, you'll be pleased to hear that there aren't many. One of the biggest gripes is that accessories aren't as plentiful as with Apple's well-established iPad. While Apple's tablet has become gloriously multi-talented thanks to a huge array of thid-party cases and accessories that can transform it from a ruggedised tablet into a powerful music-making device, and a whole lot inbetween, Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2 isn't quite so well furnished for options.  The other black mark on the Samsung's copybook is that gaming performance could be better. This is still the best Android tablet by far, though. If you really can't abide by iOS, or you just already have an Android smartphone in your pocket (and a whole bunch of purchased apps and media you don't want to go to waste) then this is an absolutely cracking choice. Click here to read our Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7in review Samsung Galaxy TAB S2 9.7-inch AMOLED Tablet (Gold) - (Octa Core, 3GB RAM, 32GB HDD, Android) £399.99 Buy now 3. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Price when reviewed: from £749 inc VAT Buy the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 now from Amazon Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 12.3in 1,824 x 2,736 5MP 8MP Dual-core Intel Core m3/i5/i7 4/8GB RAM 128/256/512GB + microSD 7h 41m video playback Microsoft describes the Surface Pro 4 as the tablet that can replace your laptop – and it's not far wrong. To say the Surface Pro 4 refines and improves on every aspect of its predecessor probably understates quite how important a leap it's made; it represents another confident step towards the best possible hybrid device. And from a company which, up until not so long ago, didn't make any hardware at all. Make no mistake, it's still not brilliant in every scenario, but it feels considerably less compromised than the previous generations. The kickstand at the rear is now fully-adjustable, which helps to make sure the display is at a comfortable angle, and makes it a little more stable on a lap. And while the Type Cover initially has a disconcerting amount of bounce and flex in it, at least compared to a standard laptop, you soon forget about that once you start typing. As a tablet, the Surface Pro 4 is a delight. The 12.3in PixelSense display is eye-poppingly lovely, and colour-accurate, too, so perfect for everything from tweaking photographs to creating hand-sketched illustrations. The Surface Pen is the killer addition here, as it provides a genuinely convincing pen experience. And Windows 10 is just as adept at hand-writing recognition as ever, which certainly helps. It's not cheap, but even compared to the new pair of Apple iPad Pros, this is one of the only tablets here which genuinely can double as a desktop PC. It's gorgeous. Click here to read our Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Microsoft Surface Pro 4 12.3 inch Tablet with Pen (Intel Core i5-6300U 2.2 GHz, 4 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, Integrated Graphics, Windows 10 Pro) and Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Keyboard - Black/Silver £914.20 Buy now 4. Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch Price when reviewed: From £679 Buy the Apple 12.9-inch iPad Pro now from Amazon Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 12.9in 2,732 x 2,048 1.2MP 8MP Dual-core Apple A9X 4GB RAM 32/128GB 9h 8m video playback Apple has long touted the iPad as being more than just a fashion accessory; more than just a fancy tablet for playing Angry Birds on. And while the naysayers have been content to rule it out as a serious device, one that's capable of doing proper work, Apple has answered those criticisms in its usual fashion: it has launched two of the finest tablets in history.  The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the larger of the two, and it's everything you'd expect: big, beautifully designed, and dramatically more powerful than any iPad that's come before. The big news, though, for most people will be the arrival of the Apple Pencil.  The Pencil is Apple's retort to the Microsoft's Surface Pen. In practice, it works very well indeed, with each stroke and flourish of the Pencil moving in perfect sync with the digital squiggles of ink which appear on screen. Unlike some rivals, the Pencil's nib includes sensors which recognise both the pressure, altitude and angle – whether it's for artistic applications or just written notes, it's a very effective addition to the iPad.  It's Apple's Smart Keyboard which allows the iPad Pro to do a decent impression of a laptop. The 12.9in screen is glorious, and big enough to work on all day, and the Smart Keyboard's small, rounded-off keys feel great for typing, and prove comfy enough for all-day typing. Yes, it's expensive. No, you can't run all the desktop apps you would on a MacBook or Windows device. But the iPad Pro's combination of great all-round design, a lightweight OS partnered with speedy hardware, and good battery life make it a force to be reckoned with. Click here to read the Apple iPad Pro 12.9 review Apple iPad Pro 128GB 3G 4G Gold - tablets (Full-size tablet, IEEE 802.11ac, iOS, Slate, iOS, Gold) £1,116.52 Buy now 5. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 Price when reviewed: from £499 inc VAT Buy the Apple 9.7-inch iPad Pro now from Amazon   Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 9.7in 1,536 x 2,048 5MP 12MP Dual-core Apple A9X 2GB RAM 32/128/256GB No microSD 8h 56m video playback Apple has made the best tablet on the market, full stop. It’s probably the best device Apple has ever made, and given the company’s history that’s saying a lot. It’s also a joy to use – you'll soon forget how much you've spent once you start using it. It's pretty much perfection incarnate. If you’re a business user, the iPad Pro 9.7in is the ultimate "carry about the office" device. It’s brilliant if you spend your time going to meetings, taking notes, managing people, and firing off emails from odd places. If you use OneNote, it’s the most refined experience for note-taking you’ll ever have, and is leagues ahead of anything on Windows.  Yes, it's expensive. No, it's not for everyone. And yes, the iPad Pro 12.9 is still better for people who need a screen large enough to work comfortably on all day. But as do-it-all devices go, you'll have trouble finding better. Click here to read our Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7‑inch Display - Wi‑Fi (32GB, Space Grey) £525.00 Buy now 6. Apple iPad mini 4 Price when reviewed: from £319 inc VAT Buy the Apple iPad mini 4 now from Amazon Screen Camera Processor Storage Battery life 7.9in 1,536 x 2,048 1.2MP 8MP Dual-core Apple A8 2GB RAM 16/64/128GB No microSD 10h 43m video playback In many ways, the iPad mini 4 remains the small tablet to beat. The performance enhancements in this generation keep it ahead of (most) of its competitors, and the quality of third-party applications on iOS make it a superior platform overall (or at least that's what Ian thinks - feel free to disagree with him on the review's comments thread).  If you crave a bigger screen than a big-screened phone can provide, and want most of the power of an iPad Air 2, then the mini is an understandably tempting option. And don't forget: there are quite a few apps, and particularly music-making ones such as iMPC Pro, which are only available on Apple's iPads. In some cases, even the iPhone 6s Plus' king-size smartphone screen just isn't big enough. In tandem with a decent case (or a completely waterproof, ruggedised one such as LifeProof's Fre) the iPad mini 4 makes for a great go-anywhere tablet. Big enough for movies, small enough to carry in a rucksack, and long-lasting enough to survive quite a while without needing to return to a mains socket with annoying regularity. However, the size of the iPad mini is beginning to feel like a compromise. If you want something to carry around with you at all times, and aren't willing to have your trousers professionally altered, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus may be a better option.

Comments Submitted by Mark Lawrence on Sat, 2016-12-24 14:45. I'm extremely surprised that The Nvidia Shield K1 is not in this list, and close to the top. In my opinion it is the best value for money tablet there is as it's only £ 160 GBP and it performs better than a lot of tablets at twice the price. Great battery life, display, stereo sound, and very reliable.

The Wall Street Journal  earlier reported news of the investment. The SoftBank Vision Fund hopes to raise $100 billion in the next five years to become one of the world's largest technology financing funds. SoftBank Group said it planned to invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy and add 50,000 jobs after its CEO, Masayoshi Son, met with president-elect Donald Trump last month in New York. USA TODAY Trump: SoftBank to add $50B, 50K jobs in U.S. Son did not say what specific investments SoftBank would make, though he told the Wall Street Journal they would be part of the previously announced $100 billion tech investment fund. Based in London, the fund was first announced in October as an initial partnership between SoftBank, a Japanese Internet and telecommunications company, and  Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, one of the country's sovereign-wealth funds. Other investors have included the sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, computer chip manufacturer Qualcomm and Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group. The Financial Times reported that Oracle founder Larry Ellison's family office has also invested in the fund. Son has said he wants the fund to be at the forefront of creating new and emerging technologies. 7283 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j5vHWx NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.

Apple Inc unveiled a watch, two larger iPhones and a mobile payments service on Tuesday as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook seeks to revive the technology company's reputation as a wellspring of innovation. Reuters/Jianan Yu The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is arguably the best all-around mobile phone available, thanks to its powerful specs and outstanding battery. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, is the greatest handset Apple has made so far, and it trumps its predecessors in all aspects. Let’s see which flagship offers the utmost convenience to users when it comes to battery longevity and charging speed. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge sports a non-removable 3,600 mAh lithium-ion battery that delivers 74 hours of music play and 27 hours of 3G phone calls. The handset can last a whole day of moderate to heavy use with about 25 percent to 35 percent battery life to spare. While the Galaxy S7 Edge drops cell power pretty fast during intensive tasks like heavy gaming, it makes up for it with outstanding standby time. When left unplugged overnight, the S7 Edge only eats up about 2 percent of its battery with the aid of Android Marshmallow’s Doze feature. The Samsung flagship only takes about 90 minutes to reach the 100 percent level using the packaged power adapter. The Galaxy S7 Edge can also be charged wirelessly. The iPhone 7 Plus also furnishes a non-removable lithium-ion battery, although it packs in less power compared to the Galaxy S7 Edge at 2,900 mAh. It provides up to 21 hours of talk time and 60 hours of music play. The Apple smartphone can reportedly endure a couple days of moderate use. The iPhone 7 Plus also equips the latest energy-efficient A10 Fusion chip, which helps extend battery life. No fast charging feature is available on the iPhone 7 Plus, so users have to wait for a prolonged amount of time before the battery reaches 100 percent from zero. When SuperSaf put the Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 7 Plus to a battery charging speed test, the Apple handset was completely left behind. After an hour of charging, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge had 85 percent battery life while the iPhone 7 Plus only had 36 percent. Just over 29 minutes later, the S7 Edge was fully charged. The iPhone 7 Plus, meanwhile, took almost three and a half hours to reach 100 percent. Both phones started charging at one percent while on flight mode.

An Apple spokesperson said “We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple,” noting that Apple has already been working with SoftBank for many years. SoftBank itself is investing $25 billion into the fund, while Saudi Arabia’s government is investing $45 billion.

Wednesday January 4, 2017 11:51 am PST by Joe Rossignol Amid rumors that Apple will release its first iPhone models with wireless charging capabilities as early as this year, its possible partner Energous has told The Verge that its first truly wireless transmitters will begin shipping by the end of 2017, over two years after it first introduced the technology. Energous CEO Steve Rizzone also dropped yet another hint suggesting its partner is indeed Apple. "One of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world," he said. "I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home." Energous is the company behind WattUp, a truly wire-free, over-the-air charging technology that uses radio frequencies to charge devices from up to 15 feet away. If you walked into a room with a WattUp transmitter, for example, a smartphone with a built-in WattUp receiver would automatically begin charging. Energous today announced that its WattUp technology will be embedded in six products on display at CES 2017 this week, such as the Chipolo Plus Bluetooth tracker and a SK Telesys hearing aid, but these implementations will require small, contact-based, portable transmitters rather than the larger, truly wireless transmitters coming. The company said these early devices integrated with WattUp receiver technology will be able to seamlessly transition from being charged by the contact-based transmitters to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer over-the-air charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet, seemingly by the end of this year. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest Apple and Energous have partnered on wireless charging. Energous has claimed it is working with "one of the top five consumer electronics companies," it has relationships with Apple manufacturers TSMC and Foxconn, and both Apple and Energous are members of ANSI. Energous certification documents dating back to 2014 were also uncovered with an "Apple compliance testing" listing, and Apple supplier Dialog Semiconductor recently made a $10 million investment in Energous. Dialog makes power management chips and is said to get as much as three quarters of its business from Apple. The deal Energous made reportedly gives its mystery partner first dibs on shipping its truly wireless charging technology "inside of phones, laptops, tablets, and certain wearables and accessories," and given the multiple rumors from credible sources, it appears one of those products could be the next iPhone. Given that Apple has removed the headphone jack on iPhone 7 models, leaving the Lightning connector with the double duty of charging and connecting wired headphones, the move towards wireless charging would be appropriate.

And what if any health concerns are there? It doesn't matter how long it takes to charge the device, forget running the phone to 10% and then plugging it in, the idea is you'll trickle charge it ALL the time no matter which room you're in with a transmitter, it should be slow, but just fast enough to continue to charge the phone in a positive manner when in heavy use, thats all thats needed, to keep it topped up, not fast charge it from 0. Radio waves have been around long before humans, there are no health concerns - that doesn't stop people turning their wifi off at night though does it, or refusing to wear bluetooth headphones cos of zapping it straight to their (borderline useless) brains.

The ecobee3 Wi-Fi thermostat can be controlled using Siri on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, and it uses remote sensors to determine temperature and presence around your home to be smarter about automating your HVAC system. Overall, the thermostat itself is rather slick and the software experience behind it holds up well. If you’re curious about HomeKit and in the market for a smart thermostat, the ecobee3 just might be the best option yet … As with any new thermostat, smart or not, there’s a hardware installation process required at setup. You’re mileage may vary depending on conditions and experience, but using a combination of the setup instructions and the geniuses of YouTube, we got our ecobee3 up and running in under an hour. Wiring configuration will vary and this is where it can get complicated, but assuming your setup is already standard and you follow instructions carefully, you likely won’t need the pros to do the job. Once you replace your previous thermostat for ecobee3, the real fun begins. At a distance, ecobee3 displays just the current inside temperature prominently above an icon for the local weather condition next to the current outside temperature. When ecobee3 detects your presence, the display animates to reveal an on-screen target temperature slider, current relative humidity, menu button, full weather report, and quick changes button. Heating and cooling are distinguished by orange and blue bars. While the main view shows you the current outside temperature, you can actually get a detailed weather report right on the ecobee3. This includes a temperature forecast for the next several hours. It’s a small thing and already available on my other devices, but it makes ecobee3 feel smarter knowing and presenting the outside weather next to the inside temperature. You’ll also find a full menu of settings for your temperature preferences and managing ecobee3, but most of these tasks are just easier from the iPhone, iPad, or the web when available. The ecobee3 unit itself has a built-in sensor for detecting presence and current temperature, but you can optionally place additional sensors around your house to more accurately monitor and manage temperature. My kit came bundled with three sensors, bringing the total number to four including the unit. I’ve placed a sensor in my bedroom, living room, and office, and have the ecobee3 located in the center of the home in the hallway. These detect both temperature and presence, making ecobee3 more intelligent when using the system to cool or warm your home. You can buy additional ecobee3 Remote Sensors in 2 packs for $79. As a smart thermostat, you can already control ecobee3 remotely from your iPhone or iPad from the iOS app, but turning on HomeKit enables Siri control and a lot of automation capabilities. Being able to change the temperature and make my home and office cooler or warmer without interrupting my work or watching a TV show is super convenient with the app alone, but being able to use Siri makes it super fast. Siri works from the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch for changing the target temperature or asking where the current temperature is around the house. You can also set target temperatures as triggers and scenes with other HomeKit-compatible accessories. For example, saying “Netflix and chill” to Siri could mean locking the door, dimming the lights, and setting the temperature to be cooler in the summer. ecobee3 lets you set your system to heating, cooling, or automate between both based on target temperatures. Back in December when I first setup ecobee3, configuring HomeKit disabled Auto Mode which lets you set target cool and heat temperatures, which was an interesting limitation. But just last week the iPhone app prompted me to the message above, noting that HomeKit now works with Auto Mode. What would have been a knock just a week earlier turned into a positive that reminded me that smart thermostats only get smarter over time. For Apple Watch owners, ecobee has a nice watchOS 2 app that lets you monitor temperatures and tweak settings. You need to use Siri to set a specific temperature, but the Apple Watch app lets you view the current target temperature as well as what temperature each sensor including the ecobee3’s currently reads. Force Touching within the app brings up options to turn your system’s fan on or off, or manually set ecobee3 to Home or Away mode. There’s also a watch face complication, or widget, which tells you what mode ecobee3 is in as well as current target temperature. For fans of glances, the app has a card that you can swipe up to access from the watch face to view current temperature, target temperature, and mode. The watch app is nice, especially for viewing temperature readers from various rooms, but Siri control from the Apple Watch is my favorite part. The ecobee iPhone app actually looks almost identical to the user interface on the actual thermostat, which is nice because it creates a familiar experience on the unit and on your iPhone. The animations on the iPhone app are noticeably laggy, though, which I hope improves in the future. For the ecobee iPad app, the same user interface is cleverly spread across of grid that requires fewer menus and more features. It feels futuristic and just plain cool controlling and managing the ecobee3 from the modular view on a tablet. Whether you’re using the thermostat, iPhone app, or iPad app, ecobee3 has some handy intelligence behind it. For example, you can set target temperatures for when you’re at home and away then using the motion sensors to track presence. The ecobee system also has alert and reminder options for extreme temperature and humidity levels and maintenance reminders. We changed the air filter at our house when we installed ecobee3, then turned on the three-month reminder to change the filter in the future (which I tend to be terrible about remembering). For me, the ecobee3 thermostat’s appeal is mostly in controlling remotely using Siri and the mobile apps, but the ecobee app also offers insights into system usage over time in the Home IQ section. The iPad app offers some data here, but the web interface shows even more. According to ecobee, my Home Energy Efficiency rating puts me in the top 20% of homes in my state and I should work on lowering my runtimes. During the month of January (my first full month with ecobee), Home IQ says I’ve saved 13 hours of runtime and $4.80 based on my equipment’s runtime and local electricity rates. This should be fun to game over time. Finally, there’s the web interface that you can access from ecobee’s website where you can remotely control the temperature, manage settings, view sensor data, and everything else you can access from the iOS apps. The screenshot above captured in Safari features a nearly identical layout to the ecobee iPad app. This makes accessing and controlling the thermostat from anywhere a familiar experience which I like a lot. Overall, I’ve really enjoyed using the ecobee3 since December and can easily recommend it as a quality HomeKit accessory. Siri control for turning on the heat from my desk is super convenient, especially using the Apple Watch, and using the iPhone app to change the temperature has almost entirely replaced walking over to the thermostat. I also really enjoy seeing the local outside weather next to the current inside temperature, viewing temperatures by room with multiple sensors is helpful, and I appreciate that the user interface is similar from the thermostat to the iPhone app to the iPad version to the website. Round thermostats like the Nest (no HomeKit, reviewed) and new Honeywell Lyric (HomeKit) can’t quite pull this off. Lastly, ecobee’s ability to adjust temperature based on my preferences for when I’m home and away or awake and asleep is really helpful in saving energy. I’m still optimizing my preferences after the first month but also finding new features like the ability to schedule vacation temperature levels in advanced. Being deep in the Apple ecosystem means HomeKit and Siri control enable a lot of the ecobee3 experience, but in general the software and intelligence make it a quality competitor in the smart thermostat space on its own. Aside from HomeKit and Siri, ecobee3 is getting smarter with new connections like the recently added Amazon Echo for voice control. You can grab the ecobee3 Smarter Wi-Fi Thermostat with Remote Sensor (2nd Generation) from $243, or the 3 Sensor Bundle I have from $318. Guides HomeKit HomeKit is Apple's home automation framework that lets you control connected accessories from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and even Siri.

Jeff Benjamin - 11 months ago Reply This makes my Nest look “meh”. That dashboard looks great. Nice review. George Pollen - 11 months ago Reply If you knew thermostats in 2011, the Nest was “meh” from the beginning, and it only got worse when Google acquired the company. Wildcat1 (@Wildcat_1) - 11 months ago Reply I was looking at the Ecobee as well specifically for this but now have the Nest thermostat bridged through to HomeKit with other sensors and the excellent Home app, it is doing everything I was looking for, no need to switch. I do wish thought that Nest would allow their Protects to share temp data and act as remote sensors. Zac Holmes - 11 months ago Reply How did you bridge the Nest to Homekit? I’m having issues doing this. Wildcat1 (@Wildcat_1) - 11 months ago Zac, I’m using Homebridge (from NFarina) with the Nest fork from KraigM which works great, ping me if you want any help. That is a very simple way of doing it. I have also integrated into the mix the SmartThings platform by bridging through SmartThings sensors (and a number of other accessories from that platform) through homebridge into HomeKit that then allow me to trigger or created nested triggers using the excellent Home app in iOS. That way I can have HomeKit read and act on SmartThings temp sensors, adjust the thermostat based on that and then control the other HomeKit native and bridged devices based on characteristics etc, works really well after setting it all up. You can then also use the best of other platforms if you wanted to as well such as Rule Machine smart app in SmartThings and have a rule tied to a virtual switch that you trigger from HomeKit through the bridge and when HomeKit accessories hit certain thresholds. Getting a little deep for a simple reply but just wanted to lay our what was possible. focher - 11 months ago Reply Have it and love it. Brent Schrader (@BrentSchrader) - 11 months ago Reply I’m trying really hard to enjoy this thermostat; it doesn’t recognize when we have left the house and adjust accordingly, and it continues to “lose” and reconnect with the one sensor that is about 35 feet from the thermostat. I also had to take apart and reassemble the sensor because it was manufactured incorrectly. So far, it’s been a sloppy product on the details. Colin McCormick (@Basesnow) - 11 months ago Reply Does the ecobee allow you to control your humidifier too? I like that ability with the nest. Recently though, the nest has been acting up with the last few updates. John Nash - 11 months ago Reply From the docs, yes it does. But I don’t have a humidifier in my home to test. claytonkimball - 11 months ago Reply Does this support geofencing yet? focher - 11 months ago Reply Yes John Nash - 11 months ago Reply Yes it does. John Nash - 11 months ago Reply yup telecastle - 11 months ago Reply replaced, and the new one started disconnecting and reconnecting. I have enough extra sensors that I have two sitting side by side in certain locations, and I know that the sensors that are consistently having issues are not doing so because of the location – since another sensor sitting right next has no issues. As for Siri support, it’s a gimmick. Unfortunately, I’m staring to realize that HomeKit is a gimmick altogether. Besides the fact that Apple never released an official HomeKit app, the ecobee current HomeKit integration is flawed. For example, sensors are not HomeKit compatible whereas the thermostats are. Therefore, the sensor cannot be placed in the HomeKit “room”, and if you name the sensor the same as a “room” in HomeKit, then Siri can no longer query the sensor. For example, if I have a HomeKit “room” named “office,” I cannot assign a remote sensor to this HomeKit “room”. Only ecobee thermostats themselves can be assigned to HomeKit rooms. If place an Ecobee sensor in my office, I have to call it something other than “office”. So, I ended up calling it “study” to be able to query it with Siri. If I name it “office,” Siri cannot see it because it already sees “office” as the HomeKit room. For example, if I say, “List temperature in the office,” Siri will say, “Sorry, I wasn’t able to find any devices in the Office this time”. However, if I say, “List temperature in the study,” Siri will show me the temperature in the office where I placed the Ecobee sensor that I called “study”. Another problem is that if you query the temperature by the HomeKit “room” where the Ecobee thermostat is installed, Siri gives you a range of the temperatures on all sensors (the thermostat itself as well as the remote sensors registered with the thermostat). So, if my thermostat is in the HomeKit room called “hallway,” and my “study” thermostat that’s placed in my office is registered with the Ecobee thermostat located in the hallway, when I ask Siri, “List the temperature in the hallway,” it gives me a range of temperatures on several sensors, including the sensor called “study,” which is in my office. So obviously, this is a complete disaster. Moreover, sometimes, when I say, “List the temperature in the study,” Siri correctly reports the temperature of the sensor located in my office. But other times, the same exact query addressed to Siri results in Siri giving me the range of temperatures among all sensors registered to the same thermostat to which my “study” sensor (located in the office) is registered. So, you may bet the correct response with only the temperature of the sensor you are querying or you may get the response as though you were queuing the temperature in HomeKit “room” where the thermostat is installed. Additionally, if you use a third-party HomeKit app like Home, there are many settings for the Ecobee thermostat that are available in this app with sliders to adjust the settings that all have exactly the same generic name. Some of these settings may not even be available for adjustment from the Ecobee app (or their web portal). I am scared to even open Ecobee thermostats in the Home app because I may accidentally move one of these sliders while scrolling up and down the page. This may have an adverse effect on the operation of my thermostat and may require many hours on the phone with Ecobee to troubleshot the issue, or worse yet, I may not notice any difference but the thermostat will become less efficient in managing my heating and cooling. All in all, this is a awesome device, but I question the usability of its integration with HomeKit and the use of Siri in managing it at this point. The Ecobee apps are great, and you can pretty much control any feature you would ever want via the apps or the Web portal (from within your home network, or while being away). Siri is so finicky that relying on it for controlling complex devices like this thermostat is silly in my opinion. I purchased the HomeKit compatible version of this thermostat, which is $30 more expensive than the version that’s not compatible with HomeKit, but several months later, I see absolutely no reason to use this with HomeKit. I also have other HomeKit compatible smart devices in my house, and after having used them for several months, I’m really disappointing with the lack of progress in the evolution of HomeKit. Apple seems to have abandoned this project like they abandoned iCloud, Maps, Photos, etc. I’m sad about what’s happening with Apple as a shareholder who owns a very considerable amount of AAPL shares. Jason - 11 months ago Reply I installed 2 of these in my 167 year old house about 6 weeks ago. Last week in Boston the temps dropped to -15º (without windchill). My Ecobee warned me that the temp in one part of the house was dropping dangerously low despite the heat being on and I was able to get a space heater in there before any damage occurred. As far as I am concerned it paid for itself that night. Even without that, I love the device. It looks good, was easy to install (I just had to run a new thermostat wire as I didn’t have a C wire – I did this myself in about 2 hours), and the house is much more comfortable. I am not expecting to save money on heating, but we’ll see. homereviewblog - 7 months ago Reply Where I can buy it ? I like the product, beatiful & many features :) Sebastien Prune (@prune998) - 6 months ago Reply read this review as well as the Lyric, still wondering how the external temperature and humidity is gathered ? Is it using a wired or remote sensor or is it using the forecast found on internet ? Or is the forecast computed with the presure change ? Thanks. scapegoat81 - 2 weeks ago Reply About to pull the trigger on this but I had one question that I hope someone can answer. I have 2 4th gen Apple TV’s so controlling this thermostat remotely wouldn’t be an issue. My question is, do either one of my Apple TV’s need to be On in order to control remotely ?

Movie News New Movies Movie Trailers Movie Reviews TV Superheroes MovieWeb Movie News New Movies Movie Trailers Movie Reviews TV Superheroes Sign In Apple to Introduce Theater Mode in Latest iPhone Update? 1.5k Shares ShareTweetShareCommentsEmail Brian Gallagher | 2 weeks ago iPhone users will reportedly get to ring in the new year with the latest Apple iOS update, version 10.3, which is rumored to include a new feature that may affect the usage of cell phones in movie theaters. While no official details about the update, dubbed iOS 10.3, have been released yet, this feature is reportedly called Theater Mode, which users will be able to access through a popcorn-shaped control panel. Apple's iOS 10.3 is rumored to drop on January 10, but that date hasn't been confirmed by Apple yet. The news first surfaced from a Twitter user named Sonny Dickson, who regularly leaks inside information regarding upcoming Apple products. While Sonny Dickson wouldn't elaborate what could be accessed through the "popcorn-shaped Control Center icon", The Daily Mail adds that Apple filed a patent back in 2012, and while it doesn't specifically mention "Theater Mode" by name, it describes technology that would automatically activate this mode when entering a theater, through GPS coordinate. Here's an excerpt from the patent below. "While the user is in the movie theater, the mobile device deactivates its cellular communications interface and/or automatically sets the device to a silent mode. When the user leaves the movie theater, the portable device enables phone communications and/or restores the ringer setting to the setting utilized prior to the device's deactivation." Another report claims this Theater Mode will, "quickly disable sound systems and haptic feedback, block incoming calls and message and reduce initial screen brightness during a movie." It's possible that a dimmer screen could encourage users to use their phones and/or start texting even more during a movie, but it's worth noting that there already is a very common fix for this problem, simply turning one's phone off during a movie, manually. The Alamo Drafthouse New York suggested moviegoers follow this simple advice in a tweet earlier today, in response to news of this iOS upgrade. If this feature is confirmed as part of the new iOS update, it will be interesting to see how movie theaters will respond to this upgrade. Last year, AMC Theatres enlisted a strict no-texting policy, after briefly considering an option of setting aside certain screenings where viewers would be allowed to text and use their phones. The Alamo Drafthouse theaters have long had a no talking/no texting policy in place at all of their theaters. Take a look at the initial tweets that broke the news about the iPhone's upcoming Theater Mode, along with the Alamo Drafthouse's response. iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 Here's another idea: JUST TURN YOUR PHONE OFF FOR TWO HOURS AND WATCH THE MOVIE 📵 https://t.co/q9eMrik1CW— Alamo Drafthouse NYC (@AlamoNYC) January 3, 2017 ShareTweetShareEmail Don't Miss A Story Best of the Web Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Apple is reportedly setting out to solve that problem with an upcoming update to iOS that will introduce Theater Mode. Existing somewhere between Do Not Distrub and a grounded and less restricted version of Airplane Mode, Theater Mode will provide iPhone users with limited access to their device and will dim the screen in a way that won't distract others in attendance. Notifications and incoming calls would reportedly be blocked when the mode, activated by tapping a popcorn-shaped icon, is enabled. Texting, however, would still be allowed thanks to the discrete lighting of the screen. Apple has been sitting on the concept for some time now, filing a patent for the idea back in 2012. The patent, granted to the company in 2014, claimed the feature would kick in when a user is in a movie theater, at which point the device "deactivates its cellular communications interface and/or automatically sets the device to a silent mode. When the user leaves the movie theater, the portable device enables phone communications and/or restores the ringer setting to the setting utilized prior to the device’s deactivation.” Apple might be better positioned to bring this feature to fruition since implementing its Night Shift feature in iOS 9. Night Shift, which cribbed from the popular third-party app F.lux, reduces the blue light emissions from the iPhone's screen, switching to warmer colors that are easier on the eyes—especially at night.

It's hard to imagine a way for the screen to go by completely unnoticed, but Apple's rumored new feature could at least make the device less of a distraction. Theater Mode wouldn't just be a welcome invention for movie goers but for theater owners as well. Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC Entertainment—the second largest theater chain in the United States—once copped to the fact that it's hard to get people to disconnect from their small screens, even when there's something entertaining on the massive screen in front of them.  "When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life,” he said in an interview with Variety last year. Aron floated the idea of text-friendly theaters, but walked it back shortly after following a public outcry against the idea. A beta version of iOS 10.3 is expected to roll out on Jan. 10. If a popcorn-shaped icon is present in the Control Center, we'll know Apple is serious about its attempts to keep people connected even in the theater.

It’s made to work with all sizes of arms and works with both the 38mm and 42mm variants of the smart watch. ActionSleeve is intended to provide those who participate in more rigorous sporting activities a more secure way to wear the Apple Watch when the stock wrist location isn’t ideal, and it does so in a complementary way without sacrificing any of the Apple Watch’s functionality. ActionSleeve comes in both black and red, the two signature colors of Twelve South, and is available in a number of different sizes to accommodate for different arm thicknesses. Those include: 38mm – fits arms up to 15-inches around 42mm – fits arms up to 17 inches around 42mm slim – fits arms up to 13 inches around (black only) At just $29, ActionSleeve offers an affordable alternative to a wrist-mounted Apple Watch. While on the upper arm, the Apple Watch is still capable of tracking your heart rate and fitness activity, and you can still view and interact with the screen as you could if it were on your wrist. Because a lot of sports and workouts often mean battering or flexing your wrists, having the Apple Watch somewhere else on your body can help get it out of the way while still maintaining data on your workout. Because Twelve South expects you’ll be using the ActionSleeve during your most rigorous workouts, it includes built-in bumper protection to keep the edges of your Apple Watch shielded from shock damage. The Apple Watch simply snaps into the bumper in the band, allowing the heart-rate sensor to continue to keep constant contact with your skin. On the side of the bumper, cut-outs for the digital crown and side button are present so you can continue to use the built-in controls. Even the microphone has breathing room. Notably, because the sensor is wide open, you can still charge your Apple Watch while it’s in the ActionSleeve, so you don’t even have to change it back to the stock wrist strap when you’re finished working out, unless you want to. After you snap the Apple Watch in, a velcro strap lets you fasten it to your upper arm with just the right adjustment to fit your arm’s thickness. There are no notches to use, so you don’t have to worry about the strap being too loose or too tight. ActionSleeve looks like it has a lot of potential to solve a common problem for active Apple Watch users. If you’re interested in snagging one to get your game on, you can do so from Twelve South’s website for just $29.99.

According to a Bloomberg report Wednesday, Ford and Toyota have teamed up with a handful of smaller automakers to create auto industry standards for in-vehicle apps and services before Apple or Google gain too much traction. SmartDeviceLink The partnership between Ford and Toyota isn’t new; the two companies have been working together on in-car information and entertainment initiatives, a platform called “SmartDeviceLink,” since 2011. That effort has translated thus far into a functional, if not elegant, platform supporting popular apps such as Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather on more than 5 million vehicles worldwide. With the growing adoption of Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, however, Ford and Toyota have recently sought to expand their consortium in order to speed up development of what they aim to be an open source platform. In response, Mazda, PSA Group (Peugeot), Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru), and Suzuki Motor Corp., as well as a group of auto manufacturing suppliers, have all joined while others, such as Honda, are rumored to be considering it. Control and Access The automakers publicly cite safety as their primary reason for being wary of handing over the in-car experience to Apple or Google. Without a direct hand in the features and capabilities of systems like CarPlay, they argue, they can’t be sure that the experiences won’t be dangerously distracting to drivers and vehicle occupants. The automakers are also concerned about allowing these systems to access vehicle data. More realistically, the automakers are also concerned about losing control over their own vehicles, especially with self-driving technologies fast approaching, making in-car information and entertainment more important than ever. The availability of CarPlay and Android Auto is still relatively limited, allowing the automakers a brief window to present a more appealing (from the manufacturers’ perspective) open source alternative. This doesn’t necessarily mean that systems like CarPlay will be abandoned by automakers, but the hope is to create a compelling manufacturer-driven system that can either win over drivers on the merits or force companies like Apple to adopt the underlying platform for compliance.

That’s it, I just won’t ever buy a car from Ford or Toyota. (looks out the window at the two Prius’s sitting in the driveway) Well, crap. January 4, 2017 at 12:20 EST PM Scott B in DC January 4, 2017 One vehicle has a 3.5mm jack input and the other car only has an AM radio. What more do I need?? (Now get off my lawn! 🙂 January 4, 2017 at 1:51 EST PM marcsten January 4, 2017 Don’t really care what standards or controls the automakers assert, so long as it is NOT the Microsoft S(t)ync system Ford put in my current car. Awful system. January 4, 2017 at 3:43 EST PM d'monder January 4, 2017 One vehicle has a 3.5mm jack input At least that jack worked with whatever you plugged into it. 🙂 IMO the worst possible scenario is a Babel of every manufacturer using their own proprietary infotainment system, all half-baked and poorly supported, with no clear market leader. Every vehicle you hop in is likely to have something different. And sadly that appears to be exactly what’s happening. January 4, 2017 at 5:56 EST PM CudaBoy January 4, 2017 FCA Fiat-Chrysler is jumping ship from QNX to Android for their vaunted UConnect car system. Both Ford and Toyota are behind the curve of electric and definitely autonomous car tech – they have nothing for the Tesla on the drawing boards and none of the 12 Ford announced are close to TODAY’S Tesla’s in well, everything including autonomous. Poor Toyota and Honda bet on Hydrogen and that just ain’t happening..apparently. Just as Disney’s chairman realized at the Parade lo those years ago that 8 out of 10 characters were Pixar and thus they had BETTER buy Pixar or else, so should Apple realize as the VR, AI and IOT “parade” flourishes how long can they remain on the sidelines and not get in the game? Car Play? Apple really can’t finger out anything related to cars apparently. January 4, 2017 at 7:43 EST PM Lee Dronick January 4, 2017 “Don’t really care what standards or controls the automakers assert, so long as it is NOT the Microsoft S(t)ync system Ford put in my current car. Awful system.” I have it our Ford Focus. Half of it is pretty good, but the other half is very MicroSoft. My wife and I have our iPhones synched to it, with hers being the primary one. If we are both in the car, but I want to cennect to mine you run through several hoops; Click on the Phone icon, choose connect phone, click on Lee’s, click on Connect. It should be choose connect phone, click on Lee’s. They finally got Siri by clicking and hold on the steering wheel phone button.

The ActionSleeve is aimed at athletes who may not be able to wear Apple Watch on their wrists, such as kickboxers or weightlifters. Beyond those sports where a wrist-worn device is impractical, Twelve South claims that ActionSleeve may improve the accuracy of Apple Watch’s sensors for all activities: ActionSleeve’s outer frame adds protection from nicks and dings and with tighter, more consistent skin contact, it can even improve heart rate monitoring. To use ActionSleeve, users must first remove their Apple Watch band and then slide the watch body into the sleeve. The sleeve itself is made from neoprene and features a silicon bumper to hold and protect the watch. When worn on the upper arm, the user still has full access to Apple Watch’s touchscreen and digital crown. The ActionSleeve supports both the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models and arm circumferences between 9 and 17 inches. It’s available now in red and black colors directly from Twelve South for $29.99.

While these videos do indeed look great on your TV, wouldn’t it be nice to enjoy them on your Mac as well? Thanks to developer John Coates, you can! The Github project Aerial is a free macOS screen saver that gives you the same Apple TV experience right on your Mac. To use it, head over to the project’s website and download the latest version. Once downloaded, double-click on Aerial.saver to install it. From there, head to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen Saver and you’ll find Aerial listed on the bottom after the built-in Mac screen savers. Click it to see a preview on the right and select Screen Saver Options to configure it. Here’s where Aerial for Mac is arguably even better than the version included on the Apple TV. The Mac screen saver’s options allow you to specify exactly which flyover videos you’d like to see based on location and time of day. If you have multiple displays attached to your Mac, you can also configure Aerial to play a different video on each, turning your desk into a visual delight. Aerial for Mac automatically pulls the latest flyover videos from Apple’s servers, so your experience will remain up-to-date as Apple adds new content. It requires OS X Mavericks or newer, and there’s even a Windows version from Dmitry Sadakov so that you can enjoy the slowly drifting scenery no matter which platform you’re working on.

"We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," the Journal quoted Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet as saying. SoftBank has said it is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and has been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund for an investment that could go up to $45 billion. SoftBank has also said that it plans to make future large-scale investments via the tech fund, rather than on its own. Reuters reported in December, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple had held talks with SoftBank about the investment. Apple told CNBC it is planning to invest $1 billion in SoftBank's Vision Fund. "We've worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," the company said. SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. —CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this report.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Intel Announces Full Lineup of Kaby Lake Processors for iMac, MacBook Pro, and More Intel Announces Full Lineup of Kaby Lake Processors for iMac, MacBook Pro, and More Tuesday, 3 January 2017 (2 weeks ago) At today's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, Intel formally announced its full lineup of 7th-generation Intel Core processors, known as Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake low-power Y-Series and U-Series processors were announced in late August, but today's unveiling covers notebook and desktop chips that could be destined for many future Apple Macs. Intel's 7th-generation processors are built on the "14nm+" process, introducing new optimizations compared to previous 14nm Broadwell and Skylake chips. According to Intel, Kaby Lake will bring "double digit productivity performance increases" of up to 20 percent for gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. With 4K and 360 degree content, customers can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks. Enhanced security, a new media engine, and improvements in VR and gaming are all advertised features. Of the chips announced today, the 28-watt U-Series chips are appropriate for a future 13-inch MacBook Pro update, and we could see the 7267U/7287U/7567U used in 13-inch MacBook Pro machines this year. Those same chips are likely what Apple would use in a Mac mini update, as the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro have traditionally included the same chips. Intel's 45-watt H-Series chips are appropriate for a future 15-inch MacBook Pro update. The 7700HQ would be ideal for entry-level machines, while a mid-tier machine would use the 7820HQ and the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro would use the 7920HQ. There are multiple potential upgrade options for the 27-inch iMac, but the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) are the straight upgrade path from the current Skylake chips used in 27-inch machines. For the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple normally uses chips with higher-end integrated graphics, but Intel has not released Kaby Lake chips that are a clear upgrade for the smaller iMac machines. Apple could choose to use Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake chips for the 21.5-inch iMac, and in that case, would likely adopt the 6585R, 6685R, and 6785R chips, released six months ago. With today's announcement, Kaby Lake chips that are clear upgrades for the iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini will be available to manufacturers in the near future and will be available for Apple's planned 2017 upgrades. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for future MacBook updates are already available. Rumors suggest we will see refreshed iMacs in the spring, which is also when we may see new MacBooks, and in the fall, we expect to see Kaby Lake refreshes for the MacBook Pro lineup.

 Here's one reason why Apple, Google, and Amazon are getting into the music streaming market Eugene Kim Jan. 4, 2017, 1:25 PM 2,576 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Competition in the music streaming space has intensified in recent years, with Apple, Amazon, and Google all launching their own services to compete against upstarts like Spotify. One simple reason for this is the on-demand music streaming market's mind-boggling pace of growth. According to this chart by Statista, based on data from BuzzAngle, the number of on-demand audio consumption jumped a whopping 82.6% year-over-year in 2016 to reach 250 billion total streams. That's a much bigger increase than the total number of on-demand video streams, which went up just 7.5% year-over-year. What's perhaps more interesting is that the streaming growth came at the expense of album and song sales, which each dropped 15% and 24% from the previous year, respectively. Don't expect a slow down any time soon: Streaming will grow to 50% of the global music market by mid-2019 and to 80% in 2025, according to Macquarie.

SoftBank has said it is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and has been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund for an investment that could be as much as $45 billion. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," company spokesman Josh Rosenstock told Reuters. SoftBank has also said that it plans to make future large-scale investments via the tech fund, rather than on its own. Reuters reported in December, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple had held talks with SoftBank about the investment.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Apple Inc (AAPL.O) confirmed on Wednesday its plans to invest $1 billion in a tech fund being set up by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T). SoftBank has said it is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and has been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund for an investment that could be as much as $45 billion. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," company spokesman Josh Rosenstock told Reuters. SoftBank has also said that it plans to make future large-scale investments via the tech fund, rather than on its own. Reuters reported in December, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple had held talks with SoftBank about the investment. SoftBank confirmed that Apple invested, said Benjamin Spicehandler, an outside public relations representative for SoftBank. He added that Foxconn, Oracle founder Larry Ellison's family office and chipmaker Qualcomm also have said they intend to invest in the fund.

The company confirmed its plans with the outlet to invest $1 billion in the SoftBank Vision Fund to help finance new technologies that it could use in the future. “We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple,” Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet told The Journal. She also noted that Apple has been working with SoftBank for several years. The SoftBank Vision Fund hopes to raise over $100 billion and is set to formally launch in the coming weeks. Saudi Arabia’s government is investing $45 billion, and both Qualcomm and the Qatar Investment Authority are discussing similar investments. SoftBank has nabbed a number of tech headlines in recent years, acquiring chip-maker ARM and a controlling stake in US carrier Sprint. This is also par for the course for Apple of late, who just invested $1B in Chinese ride-sharing co. Didi Chuxing.

Since 2007 he’s headed up Merlin, the agency which battles to maximise income for indies from digital services – both through licensing the likes of Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud and the legal pursuit of those sites committing mass piracy. Caldas learnt the ropes of label world at once-imperious Australia distributor Shock, where he spent 16 years working originally in sales and industry relations, then as CEO – as the company enjoyed success with everyone from the Cocteau Twins, Nirvana, The Offspring and many more. The seeds of Merlin, he explains, were sown at German trade show Popkomm – when the likes of Martin Mills (Beggars), Stephan Bourdoiseau (Wagram), Alison Wenham (AIM) and Michel Lambot (PIAS) organised a dinner to discuss a potentially collective approach to digital licensing. “The decision was made that they needed someone to investigate the options, someone who understood their business but was not currently in their businesses,” recalls Caldas. “All the heads turned to my end of the table! He adds: “I spent half my time during that initial phase talking to digital businesses and half my time talking to independent labels so it made sense.” An experimental three-month consultancy soon became a six-month consultancy, which then became almost ten years of service. In that time, Merlin’s annual payouts to indie labels have increased dramatically, up to $232m in the year to March 2016. Its membership, meanwhile, currently stands at 700+ – representing 20,000+ labels and distributors across 51 countries. Here, [PIAS]’s Kenny Gates picks Caldas’s brain on the future for independent businesses in the streaming music space and Merlin’s greatest victories so far… COULD YOU GIVE US AN IDIOT’S GUIDE TO MERLIN: WHAT’S ITS PURPOSE? Merlin was started really because of a concern from independents about how to compete long-term in the digital space. The independents knew they lacked the global scale the majors did. There was a risk that the lack of efficiencies in the independent space meant it would become a secondary tier of business compared to the majors. You could do one deal with Universal, Sony or Warner and get global repertoire through one license. To get the equivalent set of independent rights globally meant hundreds if not thousands of transactions. The other driving principle was that everyone wanted to stay competitive. No-one wanted to create an artificial network where all-of-a-sudden there was an entity that became an uber-distributor. In some ways, competition is what keeps the independent sector alive. “IT’S WELL KNOWN WE HAVE EQUITY IN SPOTIFY – I DON’T THINK ANY INDEPENDENT COMPANY WOULD HAVE OBTAINED THAT ALONE.” So what we decided upon – what Merlin is now – was an central licensing and rights body for independents who want to leverage global efficiency to improve their business. Our members don’t have less opportunity on these platforms than any of the majors. For example, it’s well known we have equity in Spotify alongside the majors which I don’t think any independent company would have obtained alone. We also get other benefits on platforms that we can manage on a global basis that independent labels wouldn’t have got [alone]. And we’ve returned $12m – $15m of anti-piracy litigation money back into the independent sector. In simple terms: Merlin is here to add value to the independent sector wherever we need to be. Otherwise, we stay out of the way and let people compete in their day-to-day business. COULD YOU BE CATEGORIZED AS A DIGITAL DISTRIBUTOR OR AGGREGATOR? No. The difference between what we do and a distributor does is that we don’t touch the content or get between the labels and their music on the services. Merlin’s role is purely to do the deals, help maximise the return for members, do the anti-piracy protection stuff and make sure services are paying according to the rules of our agreement. MERLIN IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS ‘THE FOURTH MAJOR’. ISN’T THAT NEGATIVE PR AMONGST US INDIES? It’s not negative PR. The point of saying ‘the fourth major’ is a way of illustrating the fact that, as the digital services evolve, there’s no argument anymore – especially giving the success independents are having in the marketplace – that independent rights are worth any less than those at a major label. A perception was starting to emerge that if you were signed to a major label, your music was somehow worth inherently more than music which came from independent labels. “MERLIN REPRESENTS ABOUT 12% TO 13% OF THE GLOBAL STREAMING MARKET SHARE.” Agnes Obel’s music isn’t worth any less than Laura Marling’s in a marketplace, and rightly so. Merlin represents about 12% to 13% of the global streaming market share. That’s just about the equivalent of what a Warner would be – the smallest of the three majors. WHAT’S THE MONTHLY TURNOVER OF MERLIN? We’re about to hit $27m a month. HOW MANY STREAMS IS THAT PER DAY? The closest we go to is a month’s streams back in July, which was 4.5bn streams. WHAT WAS THE BIG THREAT WHEN YOU FORMED IN 2007, AND WHAT WAS THE BIG FIRST RESULT? Independents had had their very difficult start with Apple – which resulted in a contentious picketing of their press conference when they announced iTunes in Europe. On the other side, there was the Kazaa and Grokster cases, where [anti-piracy settlement] money was flowing through to the majors but not the independents. And then there was the MTV case, where MTV basically decided to stop paying independents money for playing their videos. I REMEMBER THAT MTV SITUATION VERY WELL. They were paying the majors for their videos, but said that independents should just be happy to have exposure on their platform. MTV is part of Viacom – a global major corporation – and it was those things that were the trigger for Merlin. MySpace Music was our first public fight – a platform built on the diversity and breadth of repertoire from independent musicians and labels, but when it came to turn it into a business it got bought by Rupert Murdoch who turned it into a joint venture with the major labels. They tried to sideline independents, and we felt there was more of that coming. “MTV WERE PAYING THE MAJORS FOR THEIR VIDEOS, BUT SAID THAT INDEPENDENTS SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY TO HAVE EXPOSURE.” Our first big success was our Spotify deal. Weeks after I moved to London I got a call from this Swedish company saying they’d read about the formation of Merlin, they really liked the idea and they wanted to talk to us about licensing this new streaming platform. I met with them – we didn’t really have an idea of what they were! They were a very impressive company and I felt we should be involved. I remember going to my board and the underlying sense I had was: these people have flown me all the way from Australia to launch an organisation to tackle huge corporations like Viacom and the first thing I bring to the table is this little Swedish startup that no-one’s heard of! The issues we had with MySpace were repeated in the future with platforms like YouTube and Rdio, but we also built really positive relationships with services like Spotify who very early on recognised the value in what we did. DID SPOTIFY SAVE THE MUSIC BUSINESS? I don’t really subscribe to the ‘silver bullet’ view of the music industry. But Spotify’s certainly led the way to helping people to understand that there are different ways to monetise these rights. They showed you could marry those disruptive technologies with real commercial opportunities – not just threats. Now if you look at the value Apple Music, Amazon and Google Play is bringing into the streaming business, you’re starting to see that’s shaping what the future of the business will look like. This year pretty much every territory other than Japan – which is still at the point of resisting a lot of these platforms – has returned to growth. It shows that by embracing and looking for the opportunities in these technologies, you can return value to the marketplace. There’s no doubt Spotify was a key moment in showing there were different ways to doing things. THE MARKET IS GROWING – BUT IS IT GROWING FOR EVERYONE? IT SEEMS TO BE VERY LED BY POP HITS. NICHE GENRES PARTICULARLY DON’T SEEM TO BE GROWING MUCH YET… I agree on the genre point, but I also agree when you say ‘yet’. Every year, Merlin does a survey of our members to take the temperature of their business. If I look at the last two years, two thirds of respondents said that even in this time of transition their overall business is growing. So there’s evidence now that these revenues are additive. We look at how our members perform between free services and paid services, and the higher up the value chain you go, our market share on the paid platforms on the paid platforms is 27% higher than it is on the free tiers. So the consumers paying the most for music are also consuming the most independent music. The fact we’re not fighting for shelf space means we have more opportunity to get to consumers. Some genres have done this incredibly successfully. If you look at dance and electronic music turning the brands of DJs and dance labels into successful streaming destinations – that market clearly works for them. “OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS OUR [ANNUAL] REVENUES HAVE GONE FROM $75M TO $130M TO $190M TO $275M – THAT MONEY IS REAL AND IS FLOWING DOWN TO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE.” On the other hand, more ‘adult’ genres like classical, jazz and blues haven’t yet found their space. But we have to understand this is a transition: the initial set of consumers that have come into the streaming space are mostly early adopters; young, tech-savvy people. It’s not yet a truly mainstream product, even though there’s tens of millions of subscribers on these platforms. We were talking before about Merlin turning over $27m a month. Over the last four years our [annual] revenues have gone from $75m to $130m to $190m to $275m – that money is real and is flowing down to more and more people. My view is that once you have enough volume in the marketplace, you’re going to see better products and destinations for those genres emerge. In some ways, it’s like it was in the physical world, where you’d never get Walmart or Our Price to have a very deep jazz section. So you needed specialist destinations for people to go and find that music. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY STREAMING IS NOT MAINSTREAM YET. That’s an important point. When I was younger, I was trying to sell records into HMV in Australia which was the epitome of the mainstream retailer. Let’s be generous and say there were 10,000 titles in that store. If you weren’t in those 10,000 titles you were invisible to the people in that store. Now, the mainstream is whatever is on the services – every bit of music ever released. That’s why independents are front and centre in the market today. We’re not relegated to the specialist retailers or to the back of the shop. WILL THE OVER-INDEXING OF INDEPENDENTS ON STREAMING SERVICES LAST? Yes. And I say that because we’ve seen territories go from low [paid] streaming conversion to a high one; where the majority of users are subscribers and our market share doesn’t change that much. Look into it from a consumer point of view: you can come into an environment like Spotify and what you’re discovering is no longer limited to what you hear on the radio, saw on television or read about in the press. What we call over-indexing today is to me the rightful performance of independent music in the marketplace. The days of ‘if only the record store would stock this record’ have gone. BUT ISN’T THE STREAMING MARKET AT RISK OF BECOMING AT THE MERCY OF BIG PLAYLISTS? PLAYLISTS THE MAJORS WILL DOMINATE? If we’re think about the streaming space being better for independents than the physical space; it must be less advantageous for the three biggest companies. And they’re going to try to do everything they can to regain the advantages they’ve lost. So we have to be vigilant about how these services evolve. On the other hand, there’s always been a mainstream, hits-driven market. When you walked into HMV, if you didn’t sell enough records you wouldn’t be [advertised] on the chart wall. At the end of the year, unless you had a hit with scale you wouldn’t appear on Now! That’s What I Call Music. “STREAMING MUST BE LESS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE THREE BIGGEST COMPANIES THAN PHYSICAL WAS.” But once you scratch that surface, what lies in the layer immediately beneath [pop hits] is where a huge amount of streaming volume is coming from – and that’s where we’re performing the best. We have to be careful in how we do our deals with these services to ensure they’re not constructing that playlist environment, for example, in a way that doesn’t work against us. But in some ways the challenge is ours to ensure we are doing the right things for ourselves to maximise the success of these platforms. THE STREAMING MARKET NOW INCLUDES SPOTIFY, APPLE, PANDORA, DEEZER, GOOGLE, AMAZON. IS THE COMPETITION GOING TO PUSH THE PRICES DOWN? The reason I would say no to that is because the fastest rate of [subscriber] growth we’ve seen in the overall streaming market came after the entry of Apple Music but was actually on other platforms; so the entry of Apple Music stimulated the rest of the market. The more consumers hear about and have access to this kind of product, the more the market grows. ISN’T THE AVERAGE PER-STREAM PAYMENT GOING DOWN? It depends how you look at it. On a global basis, if you put all the streams in one bucket and all the money in another bucket, then yes – the fact streaming is becoming more popular in lower value markets like Mexico, The Philippines and Brazil changes the balance. If you look at it in a more sophisticated way – market by market, region by region – then no, I don’t think streaming rates are going down like people think they are. We also have to look at revenue per user as much as we look at revenue per stream; we’re getting more people to pay for music, which is positive news. EVERYONE IS OUT OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH SPOTIFY AND YOUTUBE AT THE MOMENT. DOESN’T THAT SHOW EVERYTHING IS FRAGILE? Yes. We’re undergoing probably the biggest transition we’ve ever seen in the history of the music industry – from a world of sales to monetising the market in ways we don’t fully understand yet. All of this colour and movement and renegotiation is really difficult. YouTube is a great example of a service that was off to the side of our business – a lot of UGC and video that people were promoting. “ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT [YOUTUBE LICENSING] DECISION LOOKS FAR LESS SENSIBLE THAN IT DID AT THE TIME.” Then they licensed their way into the market to have full catalogue availability. But two years ago the audio streaming world was worth 50% less in value than it is today. So all of a sudden that [YouTube] decision looks far less sensible than it did at the time: YouTube is declining in per-stream rates at the time when the rest of the business is growing much more healthily. We have to look at the relative value of these services. WAS GEMA RIGHT NOT TO ALLOW YOUTUBE IN GERMANY? I think YouTube should be a market segment of its own. The mistake the music industry made with the YouTube deals was agreeing to make all of the music available all of the time for free to all of their consumers. YouTube has not built a compelling subscription business. The increased availability and consumption of music content has driven the per-stream value down. But what’s positive and exciting about YouTube? From a rights-holder perspective it’s allowing you to potentially monetize things you can’t monetize on other platforms – interesting UGC; monetizing visual content that’s not exploitable on other platforms; music videos. There’s a particular market segment YouTube could be amazing at [presenting]. YOU DON’T CONSIDER YOUTUBE THE ENEMY? ‘THE DEVIL’? No, they’re not the devil – but they’re certainly not paying enough for music. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF LYOR COHEN JOINING YOUTUBE? [Long pause]. I haven’t had a chance to meet with him yet, so I’ll answer that when I’ve met with him. APPLE. SPOTIFY. AMAZON. APPLE. GOOGLE. WHO WOULD YOU BET ON TO BE THE WINNER? I don’t think there’s one ‘winner’. In the same way that, in the healthy part of the physical market there was HMV, Virgin and Tower, as well as all the independent stores. We’re starting to see signs of that in streaming. If you look at South East Asia today, there’s KK Box, which is a successful local streaming platform, in Japan you now have LINE and others. The scale of the market is going to encourage new investment, new players and new innovation. The big technology services would like there to be big winners and losers, but not us. ISN’T SPOTIFY VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY’RE FACING COMPETITORS WHO WANT TO USE MUSIC AS LOSS-LEADERS TO SELL OTHER DEVICES? It isn’t the first time we’ve seen this. Selling music to K-Mart was selling music to people who used it as a loss-leader. It didn’t mean we stopped supporting the specialised punk rock, metal or dance retailers. I do think at some point the industry has to reconcile where pure-play music retailers like Pandora and Spotify sit in the market against technology companies. But ultimately the market will become more sophisticated. “APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLE AND POTENTIALLY FACEBOOK – THEY’RE GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN A BATTLE FOR DOMINANCE.” We have to expect that if you look at Apple, Amazon, Google and potentially Facebook – they’re going to get involved in a battle for dominance. What the industry has to be careful of is not becoming pawns in that game and not selling down the value of our music so that it just becomes a peripheral add-on to the tech business. On the other hand, we would all like to see Facebook monetize our music- and YouTube deliver better and higher value, and SoundCloud for that matter. SOUNDCLOUD! HOW COULD WE ALLOW A SERVICE TO BECOME SO BIG WITHOUT HAVING PROPER LICENSING. WAS THAT A MISTAKE? Well it was partly because they had the same [safe harbour] protections under law as YouTube have in terms of UGC. It was partly because artists and smaller labels really loved SoundCloud as a promotional platform. Where SoundCloud sits in the market today is potentially really interesting. To your question about winners and losers; if you go through those services, they are different shades of similar products – all of the music available in one place. What’s interesting about SoundCloud is that it potentially helps us monetise a different demographic; one that might subscribe to SoundCloud as well as subscribing to Spotify. It could become the destination to find remixes and derivative works – things that might not be on the other platforms. We have to embrace innovation, creativity and development of the market other than just letting one winner dominating the market ahead of anyone else. ISN’T IT A BAD SIGN THAT SPOTIFY IS TRYING TO GET BIGGER MARGINS FROM THE INDUSTRY AT THE MOMENT? How these companies become sustainable in the long-term is a challenge for all parts of the industry. It would be very easy for companies the size of Google and Apple to price kill the competition. In the same way that supermarkets have tried to price kill the competition. As rights-holders, we have to take some responsibility for our retailers – where they fit in our business and what we’re willing to do to keep their business healthy. I’m sure [PIAS] loves dealing with FNAC, but not at the expense of other physical retailers. Or the fact you have a relationship with Amazon as a physical retailer doesn’t mean you don’t want to do interesting things with the Rough Trade stores. As someone putting music into the marketplace, you can’t just turn a blind eye and put all your music where you get the biggest return. Because if you did that with your physical business, you would have ended up in a far, far more difficult world. And at some point, we have to reconcile that in the digital space. WILL SPOTIFY IPO? The press certainly thinks so, and the way they’re structuring the company suggests so as well. But getting to an IPO is not an easy thing. As an industry, we have to approach the notion with an element of caution. Where and how do we want a partner like that to look and behave in the market? What are the implications of Spotify as a publicly traded body as a partner? There are big questions around what that means for everyone. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? It could mean all sorts of things. If it’s a successful IPO and it creates a business that continues to grow at the rate that it’s growing now and becomes a significant global retailer that’s sustainable and profitable and a core part of our industry, no-one’s going to complain. If it’s less than successful and the IPO means it has to squeeze its operation in some way or limit the service’s operation only to what is profitable – slowing its growth rate – that’s a concern. You can’t predict these things. It’s an amazing brand and an amazing company that’s built an enormous amount of users in a fairly short period of time, so the instinct is that this should be success. But this is the stock market. And the stock market can go either way for any company. YOU’VE COME FROM AN AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTOR DEALING WITH ALL THE INDEPENDENT LABEL HEADS – AND NOW YOU DEAL WITH THEM ALL IN YOUR ROLE AT MERLIN. THAT’S A LOT OF EGOS TO JUGGLE IN YOUR CAREER! The independent sector is the independent sector for a reason. So the people who run the companies are incredibly strong-minded, opinionated and passionate – but you wouldn’t want it any other way. Sometimes I have to be diplomatic and non-interventionist, but other times I have to assert my own will and opinion. The independent sector wouldn’t be what it is today if you just had a bunch of pen-pushers who were purely financially focused. The pleasing thing for me is that despite the potential for discord, with a board of 15 strong-minded individuals, Merlin is looking almost 10 years down the line now at an organisation that still has its founders involved and has the support of the independent community. WHO’S THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PERSON YOU’VE MET IN THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR – AND WHO’S THE MOST INTIMIDATING AND WHO’S THE MOST INSPIRING? Everyone has their own area of specialty… DON’T BE A DIPLOMAT – I WANT NAMES! Well there’s one person I think everyone would agree about: Martin Mills has for many years been a hugely impressive leader for the independent sector. If I look at our own board, the passionate founders of our world, Michel from [PIAS] – not just in terms of Merlin, but almost in terms of being the Godfather of collective action, his role in the founding of IMPALA. That’s another leader. “MARTIN MILLS HAS FOR MANY YEARS BEEN A HUGELY IMPRESSIVE LEADER FOR THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR.” And other than that, let me put it this way: anybody who is willing to put themselves forward to be on the Merlin board, and dedicate their time and effort to an organization that is not their own business deserves the respect of the community at large. These people are dedicating their own time, resource and in some cases money to the greater good. MERLIN RECENTLY DID A DEAL WITH VK IN RUSSIA. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THAT? The first thing to expect is that we can now manage the availability of content that was once widely available to the market at zero value. In some ways I look at that in the same way I look at SoundCloud. We now have a structure around SoundCloud to monetize, to choose what we can make available. Transitioning services from outside our business to inside our business is never without its challenges, but it’s encouraging to see it happen. YOU’VE JUST OPENED AN OFFICE IN JAPAN. WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF THAT? Two of the biggest dynamics we’ve seen at Merlin this year have been the global growth in members and the global growth in revenues. It’s a totally new market: Mexico is now in our top ten streaming territories. We make more money in Brazil from streaming than we do in France. Japan is probably the slowest major music market to evolve, but now with the launch of Google Play and Spotify, it’s also a market that’s potentially going to become one of the leading digital markets in the world, and one where our membership is growing quickly. “JAPAN IS A MARKET THAT NEEDS LOCAL EXPERTISE ON THE GROUND.” Japan, culturally and language wise, is very different to the rest of the world. It’s a market that needs local expertise on the ground. We’ve tried to be very careful about how we run Merlin – there’s essentially 10 or 11 dedicated people who run the organisation. Merlin runs at a cost of 2% to our members, and even at that cost, we’ve managed to rebate $2m in excess admin fees in the last couple of years. We’re very conscious of value to our members. Japan can fit within that structure – it has zero negative impact on what we charge our members. The next obvious markets [to enter] would be Mexico and Brazil, where we’re starting to generate millions and millions of dollars but which both require local expertise. WHAT WILL THE MARKET LOOK LIKE IN 10 YEARS? My hope is that in 10 years we’ll have a much more defined set of market segments. That will involve physical retail, physical online retail, all you can east streaming services and also a range of different ways of people to consume music we haven’t yet seen. The car is a great frontier. Wearable devices are an opportunity. Messaging apps are an opportunity. Music bundled with other forms of entertainment are opportunities. My hope is that on the label side of the business we’re going see a healthy market that is much more competitive than it is now. The kinds of opportunities that streaming platforms bring to our labels means that independents are going to be better placed than they are today.

"We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," the Journal quoted Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet as saying. (http://on.wsj.com/2iAMXpE) SoftBank has said it is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and has been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund for an investment that could go up to $45 billion. SoftBank has also said that it plans to make future large-scale investments via the tech fund, rather than on its own. Reuters reported in December, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple had held talks with SoftBank about the investment. Apple and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 4, 2017 at 12:20PM Website Fudzilla recently noticed that performance results of the recently announced Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 mobile processor -- the company's latest chip aimed at premium smartphones -- leaked online. Image source: Apple.  The site says that the Snapdragon 835 has "left Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) much quoted peak score of 172,644 for its A10 chipset for dead," with a score of 181,434. I took the opportunity to run the performance test used to compare the two chips -- called AnTuTu -- on my iPhone 7 Plus. And the findings seem to paint the complete opposite picture to what Fudzilla says. The total score my iPhone 7 Plus achieved was 189,105 -- a bit ahead of the supposed results of the new Qualcomm chip. AnTuTu is a test that's made up of many sub-tests, including 3D graphics, CPU, and "user experience." Let's take a closer look at how the A10 chip inside of the iPhone 7 Plus stacks up against these Snapdragon 835 scores -- if they are, indeed, legitimate. Apple's CPUs crush Qualcomm's The A10 contains two sets of custom-designed processors. The "high-performance" cores are called Hurricane while the "high efficiency" cores, which handle less processor intensive tasks, are known as Zephyr. The Snapdragon 835 uses a similar processor configuration, except it has performance and efficiency clusters, each with four processor cores each. AnandTech says that the cores are "semi-custom" cores based on ARM's Cortex A-series designs tailored specifically for Qualcomm's needs. According to the leak that Fudzilla references, the Snapdragon 835 scores 10230 in the CPU Mathematics sub-test, 11924 in the CPU Common Use sub-test, and 15705 in the CPU Multi-Core sub-test. The A10 in my iPhone 7 Plus achieves scores of 19825, 18570, and 14287 in each of these sub-tests, respectively. This means that per-core, Apple's cores are much faster than Qualcomm's, though there are half as many, and in multi-core applications -- ones that can use Apple's two high-performance cores and Qualcomm's four high-performance cores -- Apple's A10 slightly trails the Snapdragon 835. Snapdragon's graphics lead The AnTuTu test also includes two 3D graphics sub-tests -- 3D Garden and 3D Marooned. The leak shows that the Snapdragon 835 scores 29499 and 45330 points in these two sub-tests, respectively. The A10, on the other hand, achieves 29353 and 30206 in these sub-tests, respectively. This suggests that the Snapdragon 835 has a superior graphics sub-system -- not a surprise, as Qualcomm has traditionally been very strong in graphics compared to the co0mpetition. Apple's leads elsewhere Finally, in the RAM, which seemingly tests the performance of the memory subsystem of the chip, the Snapdragon 835 apparently gets a score of 10532, while the A10 achieves a score of 12805. Summing up the "user experience" subtests, the A10 achieves 64059 points; the Snapdragon 835 leak shows a combined score here of 52865. A10 remains a leadership SoC until the A11 comes along Although the Snapdragon 835 is more powerful than the Apple A10 in graphics performance, and although it integrates a gigabit LTE modem -- the A10 doesn't include any LTE modem -- the A10 more than holds its own in CPU performance, memory performance, and "user experience" performance as measured by AnTuTu. This means that buyers of the iPhone 7/7 Plus shouldn't worry about their devices becoming "outdated" from a performance perspective – these will still be best-in-class devices that can hold their own against the many Android-based flagship devices powered by the Snapdragon 835 that are likely to launch in the spring. And when Apple releases the iPhone 7s/8-series smartphones in the fall, I expect Apple's devices to regain decisive performance leadership in graphics while extending Apple's leadership in CPU performance.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Qualcomm.

 Apple will invest $1 billion into the world's largest technology venture fund Kif Leswing Jan. 4, 2017, 12:59 PM 7,738 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim CookGetty Images/Andrew Burton Apple will invest $1 billion into the SoftBank Vision Fund, a spokesperson told Business Insider.  The fund will be the world's largest technology venture fund if it hits its $100 billion goal.  "Apple is planning to invest $1 billion in SoftBank's Vision Fund. We've worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock told Business Insider.  Apple is joining investors such as Saudi Arabia's government fund, which is expected to plow $45 billion into the $100 billion fund. SoftBank has said it will contribute $25 billion. Softbank confirmed that Apple intends to invest in the fund, and other investors include Foxconn, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Qualcomm.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Apple's announcement.  Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, which owns wireless carrier Sprint among other holdings, is expected to use the fund to invest in technologies like artificial intelligence.  In December, president-elect Donald Trump claimed credit for a promise by Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son to invest $50 billion in US companies, bringing 50,000 jobs to the country. Son later revealed that the investment would come from the Vision Fund.  Apple is unusual among tech giants in that it doesn't run its own venture capital wing. It has invested in companies in the past, though, and Apple has done business with Softbank for years.  Most recently, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, the Uber of China. Before that, Apple mostly invested in complementary companies like ARM, which designs the chips used in the iPhone, although it divested its stake years before ARM was sold to Softbank for over $30 billion in 2016.  SEE ALSO: Apple CEO Tim Cook on why he met with Trump: 'You don't change things by just yelling' More: Apple Softbank Masayoshi Son Venture Capital facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple will invest $1 billion into the world's largest technology venture fund Apple will invest $1 billion into the world's largest technology venture fund Apple will invest $1 billion into the SoftBank...

The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara superior county court, relates to an incident that took place on Christmas Eve 2014, when a driver allegedly using the FaceTime video chat application on his iPhone 6 Plus drove into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, along with their daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident, and Moriah later died in hospital from her injuries. In their complaint, highlighted by Courthouse News, the Modisettes claim that Apple should be held accountable for the accident since the smartphone manufacturer had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime designed to prevent people from using the video and voice call application while driving. Despite filing the patent, Apple chose not to introduce the technology to its iPhones. The patent in question, granted in April 2014, describes a lock-out mechanism that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions, such as texting, while driving. The Modisettes allege that Apple’s failure to introduce the patented feature, or warn users that using FaceTime while driving could be dangerous, was a “substantial factor” in causing their injuries and Moriah’s death. The case is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, while checking her iPhone for messages, Ashley Kubiak crashed her truck into another vehicle in Texas, killing its driver and leaving a child paralyzed. The families of the victims also filed a case against Apple, contending the company knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. “Plaintiffs are saying to manufacturers: if your product unnecessarily diverts the driver’s attention away from the road in the moment before a collision, you may be on the hook,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford law professor. “If the plaintiffs were to prevail, the case could have sweeping implications, not just for handheld devices, but for navigation systems, car radios -- potentially even fast food purchased at drive-through windows.” However, it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to show that it was the iPhone that caused the accident when there is another actor -- the distracted driver -- who could be labelled as a “superseding cause”. “A superseding cause breaks the causal chain, and here would relieve the iPhone manufacturer of liability,” Engstrom said. A complicating factor in both of these cases is that the accidents took place in Texas, where it’s mostly legal for drivers to make phone calls while driving and there’s no state-wide ban on texting while driving, although many cities have outlawed the practice. “Ordinarily if a manufacturer is being sued for an illegal use of their product, they shouldn’t be liable,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University school of law. However, if the company knew that its devices could be used illegally and had a way to prevent it, there may be grounds for liability -- although such liability would hinge on whether the technical solution (in this case, the patented lock-out feature) was feasible. “There’s currently no way to determine whether or not the person using the phone is driving. They could be the passenger,” said patent lawyer Mark Terry. “I don’t think they have a sound legal premise. “A tragedy has happened and they are looking for a deep pocket. Apple has a deep pocket so if anyone can find a reason to hit them at all, they will,” he added. Goldman agrees. “This is what personal injury lawyers do,” he said. “They sue not only the person who caused the harm -- the driver -- and then everyone else they can think of who might have contributed to the accident.” That’s not to say that cases like these won’t cause problems for device manufacturers in the future. “The patent proves that Apple knows, and has long known, that phone use and driving is widespread and is dangerous,” said Engstrom. “Apple’s inaction in the face of that knowledge may not trigger liability here. But it may well expose Apple to liability down the road.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Next Article > Anti-Surveillance Clothing Hides Wearers from Facial Recognition By Alex Hern PUBLISHED: JANUARY 07 2017 The use of facial recognition software for commercial purposes is becoming more common, but, as Amazon scans faces in its physical shop and Facebook searches photos of users to add tags to, those concerned about their privacy are fighting back. Berlin-based artist and technologist Adam Harvey aims to overwhelm and confuse these systems by presenting them with thousands of false hits so they can’t tell which faces are real. The Hyperface project involves printing patterns on to clothing or textiles, which then appear to have eyes, mouths and other features that a computer can interpret as a face. This is not the first time Harvey has tried to confuse facial recognition software. During a previous project, CV Dazzle, he attempted to create an aesthetic of makeup and hairstyling that would cause machines to be unable to detect a face. Speaking at the Chaos Communications Congress hacking conference in Hamburg, Harvey said: “As I’ve looked at in an earlier project, you can change the way you appear, but, in camouflage you can think of the figure and the ground relationship. There’s also an opportunity to modify the ‘ground’, the things that appear next to you, around you, and that can also modify the computer vision confidence score.” Harvey’s Hyperface project aims to do just that, he says, “overloading an algorithm with what it wants, oversaturating an area with faces to divert the gaze of the computer vision algorithm.” The resultant patterns, which Harvey created in conjunction with international interaction studio Hyphen-Labs, can be worn or used to blanket an area. “It can be used to modify the environment around you, whether it’s someone next to you, whether you’re wearing it, maybe around your head or in a new way.” Explaining his hopes for how technologies like his would affect the world, Harvey showed an image of a street scene from the 1910s, pointing out that every figure in it is wearing a hat. “In 100 years from now, we’re going to have a similar transformation of fashion and the way that we appear. What will that look like? Hopefully it will look like something that appears to optimize our personal privacy.” To emphasize the extent to which facial recognition technology changes expectations of privacy, Harvey collated 47 different data points commercial and academic researchers claim to be able to discover from a 100x100 pixel facial image -- around 2.5% of the size of a typical Instagram photo. Those include traits such as “calm” or “kind”, criminal tendencies like “paedophile” or “white collar offender”, and simple demographics like “age” and “gender”. Research from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for instance, claims to be able to predict criminality from lip curvature, eye inner corner distance and the so-called nose-mouth angle. “A lot of other researchers are looking at how to take that very small data and turn it into insights that can be used for marketing,” Harvey said. “What all this reminds me of is Francis Galton and eugenics. The real criminal, in these cases, are people who are perpetrating this idea, not the people who are being looked at.” Harvey and Hyphen-Labs plan to reveal details on the Hyperface project this month, as part of Hyphen-Labs’ new work NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism.

The Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm is a smoke alert system you can always count on. Whenever the alarm is set off it sends real-time alerts direct to your smartphone, so you can take action even when miles from home. Enhanced home security If it detects smoke in the house, the Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm triggers an 85dB alarm and sends a real-time alert to the user's smartphone. The user receives a notification identifying the room in which the smoke was detected: "Smoke detected in the kitchen". The user knows at once if there is smoke in their house. They can immediately contact a neighbour or the fire department, to stop the fire spreading; or escape if they’re in the house themselves. The user can install as many Smoke Alarms as they want, and can access them from their Netatmo Security App. Each detector can be named on the basis of its location ("Kitchen Smoke Alarm" or "Kids' Bedroom Smoke Alarm" etc). The 85dB signal, if triggered, can be switched off manually or from the App. Long-life battery and self-check function The Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm is powered by a 10-year battery, which equates to the recommended service life of smoke detectors. The long-life battery guarantees reliable operation for 10 years, so there's no risk of the Smoke Alarm's battery being flat when a fire breaks out. Before the Netatmo Smoke Alarm reaches the end of its recommended 10-year service life, it sends a notification to the user's smartphone reminding them to change it. Thanks to its self-check function, the Smoke Alarm runs on-going checks to make sure it is working properly. It sends weekly reports that can be consulted on the App. Compatible with HomeKit and IFTTT The Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm will be compatible with Apple HomeKit. Apple HomeKit enables an array of connected devices in the home to collaborate with each other. The user controls their connected devices and can view their data via the Apple Home App and on the locked screen of their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. With HomeKit, the user can also create customised scenarios to connect their Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm to other smart home devices. For example, they’ll be able to connect their smart lighting to their Netatmo Smoke Alarm. The lights will turn on in the house if a fire is detected. The family will be alerted and will be able to leave the house quickly. The user can activate these scenarios with a simple gesture on their Apple Home App. The Smoke Alarm is also compatible with IFTTT, a platform that allows the user to connect hundreds of services together. With IFTTT, the user connects the data from their Netatmo Security App – which controls the Smoke Alarm – with other devices, Apps and services. The user can program customised rules or combinations of actions called "Recipes" to automate and control different aspects of their connected home. For example, they can receive an emergency call in the event of fire. Installation and certifications The Smoke Alarm is a wireless device and connects automatically to the home Wi-Fi network via the App. The installation is quick and easy: the Smoke Alarm just needs to be screwed to the wall or ceiling, following the installation recommendations included in the pack. The Netatmo Smoke Alarm is CE and NF certified. In compliance with the applicable regulations, a red LED flashes discreetly every 10 seconds to show that the Smoke Alarm is working properly. If it detects any smoke, it starts flashing more quickly. Availability The Smart Smoke Alarm will be available in the second half of 2017.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Anytime. Anywhere. Apple FaceTime Targeted in Distracted Driving Lawsuit By Olivia Solon PUBLISHED: JANUARY 04 2017 A couple whose five-year-old daughter was killed after a distracted driver drove into their car is suing Apple for failing to introduce an iPhone safety feature it patented in 2014 to discourage people from using FaceTime while driving. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara superior county court, relates to an incident that took place on Christmas Eve 2014, when a driver allegedly using the FaceTime video chat application on his iPhone 6 Plus drove into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, along with their daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident, and Moriah later died in hospital from her injuries. In their complaint, highlighted by Courthouse News, the Modisettes claim that Apple should be held accountable for the accident since the smartphone manufacturer had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime designed to prevent people from using the video and voice call application while driving. Despite filing the patent, Apple chose not to introduce the technology to its iPhones. The patent in question, granted in April 2014, describes a lock-out mechanism that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions, such as texting, while driving. The Modisettes allege that Apple’s failure to introduce the patented feature, or warn users that using FaceTime while driving could be dangerous, was a “substantial factor” in causing their injuries and Moriah’s death. The case is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, while checking her iPhone for messages, Ashley Kubiak crashed her truck into another vehicle in Texas, killing its driver and leaving a child paralyzed. The families of the victims also filed a case against Apple, contending the company knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. “Plaintiffs are saying to manufacturers: if your product unnecessarily diverts the driver’s attention away from the road in the moment before a collision, you may be on the hook,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford law professor. “If the plaintiffs were to prevail, the case could have sweeping implications, not just for handheld devices, but for navigation systems, car radios -- potentially even fast food purchased at drive-through windows.” However, it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to show that it was the iPhone that caused the accident when there is another actor -- the distracted driver -- who could be labelled as a “superseding cause”. “A superseding cause breaks the causal chain, and here would relieve the iPhone manufacturer of liability,” Engstrom said. A complicating factor in both of these cases is that the accidents took place in Texas, where it’s mostly legal for drivers to make phone calls while driving and there’s no state-wide ban on texting while driving, although many cities have outlawed the practice. “Ordinarily if a manufacturer is being sued for an illegal use of their product, they shouldn’t be liable,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University school of law. However, if the company knew that its devices could be used illegally and had a way to prevent it, there may be grounds for liability -- although such liability would hinge on whether the technical solution (in this case, the patented lock-out feature) was feasible. “There’s currently no way to determine whether or not the person using the phone is driving. They could be the passenger,” said patent lawyer Mark Terry. “I don’t think they have a sound legal premise. “A tragedy has happened and they are looking for a deep pocket. Apple has a deep pocket so if anyone can find a reason to hit them at all, they will,” he added. Goldman agrees. “This is what personal injury lawyers do,” he said. “They sue not only the person who caused the harm -- the driver -- and then everyone else they can think of who might have contributed to the accident.” That’s not to say that cases like these won’t cause problems for device manufacturers in the future. “The patent proves that Apple knows, and has long known, that phone use and driving is widespread and is dangerous,” said Engstrom. “Apple’s inaction in the face of that knowledge may not trigger liability here. But it may well expose Apple to liability down the road.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Next Article > Anti-Surveillance Clothing Hides Wearers from Facial Recognition By Alex Hern PUBLISHED: JANUARY 07 2017 The use of facial recognition software for commercial purposes is becoming more common, but, as Amazon scans faces in its physical shop and Facebook searches photos of users to add tags to, those concerned about their privacy are fighting back. Berlin-based artist and technologist Adam Harvey aims to overwhelm and confuse these systems by presenting them with thousands of false hits so they can’t tell which faces are real. The Hyperface project involves printing patterns on to clothing or textiles, which then appear to have eyes, mouths and other features that a computer can interpret as a face. This is not the first time Harvey has tried to confuse facial recognition software. During a previous project, CV Dazzle, he attempted to create an aesthetic of makeup and hairstyling that would cause machines to be unable to detect a face. Speaking at the Chaos Communications Congress hacking conference in Hamburg, Harvey said: “As I’ve looked at in an earlier project, you can change the way you appear, but, in camouflage you can think of the figure and the ground relationship. There’s also an opportunity to modify the ‘ground’, the things that appear next to you, around you, and that can also modify the computer vision confidence score.” Harvey’s Hyperface project aims to do just that, he says, “overloading an algorithm with what it wants, oversaturating an area with faces to divert the gaze of the computer vision algorithm.” The resultant patterns, which Harvey created in conjunction with international interaction studio Hyphen-Labs, can be worn or used to blanket an area. “It can be used to modify the environment around you, whether it’s someone next to you, whether you’re wearing it, maybe around your head or in a new way.” Explaining his hopes for how technologies like his would affect the world, Harvey showed an image of a street scene from the 1910s, pointing out that every figure in it is wearing a hat. “In 100 years from now, we’re going to have a similar transformation of fashion and the way that we appear. What will that look like? Hopefully it will look like something that appears to optimize our personal privacy.” To emphasize the extent to which facial recognition technology changes expectations of privacy, Harvey collated 47 different data points commercial and academic researchers claim to be able to discover from a 100x100 pixel facial image -- around 2.5% of the size of a typical Instagram photo. Those include traits such as “calm” or “kind”, criminal tendencies like “paedophile” or “white collar offender”, and simple demographics like “age” and “gender”. Research from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for instance, claims to be able to predict criminality from lip curvature, eye inner corner distance and the so-called nose-mouth angle. “A lot of other researchers are looking at how to take that very small data and turn it into insights that can be used for marketing,” Harvey said. “What all this reminds me of is Francis Galton and eugenics. The real criminal, in these cases, are people who are perpetrating this idea, not the people who are being looked at.” Harvey and Hyphen-Labs plan to reveal details on the Hyperface project this month, as part of Hyphen-Labs’ new work NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed with Apple on Tuesday that the patent office failed to sufficiently explain why Apple's method for reconfiguring touchscreen icons is unpatentable due to obviousness.   Apple applied for a patent in 2009 on its method of using a sustained touch to activate an icon, which then allows a person to drag the icon to a new location on the screen.   A patent examiner found the claim obvious in light of separate prior inventions on sustained touch and dragging. Combining the two inventions "would be an intuitive way" to rearrange touchscreen icons, the examiner concluded and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirmed.   Apple and its appellate counsel at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe argued that the claims are not obvious—or at the very least that the PTO should have to provide a more reasoned explanation. The Federal Circuit agreed.   Judge Kimberly Moore wrote that "Absent some articulated rationale, a finding that a combination of prior art would have been 'common sense' or 'intuitive' is no different than merely stating the combination 'would have been obvious. Such a conclusory assertion with no explanation is inadequate to support a finding that there would have been a motivation to combine."   Moore ordered the case sent back to the PTO for reconsideration. Judge Evan Wallach concurred. Judge Pauline Newman dissented, saying the PTO should not get a do-over. "On our affirmance that the PTO has not established unpatentability, Apple is 'entitled to a patent,'" she wrote.   Apple's win follows a similar decision last summer, In re Lemay, in which the Federal Circuit found no evidence supporting the PTO's decision to refuse Apple a patent on streaming video display menus. In that case the court fully reversed the PTAB's decision.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

You can download iOS 5 through iTunes 10.5. Let us take you through the key features… iTunes 10.5 iTunes 10.5 is the biggest update of iTunes yet. The most important change is how iTunes can now store your files remotely in the cloud. This means that all your music and movies are backed up outside of your PC, Mac or iPhone but it also means that any purchases will automatically be synced to your other devices which use iTunes. The update also means that you won’t need to connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to a computer to transfer music and movies. All you need is a wi-fi connection and you can sync at speed with no cable based hassles. iTunes Match Apple has launched this service in the US and a UK release is pending. For $24.99 per year, iTunes Match will automatically replace all your music files with high quality versions, direct from the record labels. If you play your music through AirPlay devices and docks or use high quality headphones, you’ll notice the difference. In the past, Apple have offered lower quality downloads by default so that files would be easier to store on Apple devices. With cloud storage and a 64 GB memory option available for iPhone 4S, this is now less of an issue. Notification Centre Swipe down on your iPhone screen and you’ll see all the notifications that you need to know about. You can head directly to apps that have alerts and see calendar and weather updates – it’s all the important stuff at a glance. Weather and Calendar You’ll now get hourly weather info in response to extensive rival apps and notice slight tweaks to the calendar system. iMessage Similar to the BBM service on BlackBerry, iMessage allows you to send text message, photos, videos and files to other iMessage users for free. Crucially, this is a great advantage to anyone on a limited data plan contract and brings the iPod Touch into the Apple communications eco-system. If you’ve got an iPod Touch, you can chat for free – a warning shot to BlackBerry manufacturer RIM. Reminders A simple App which allows you to tick off to-do lists. There’s many similar apps available in the App store but the Reminders app uses your location to link to your tasks. If you’ve set a reminder to clean the house for example, it will tell you when you arrive. If you own a iPhone 4S, you’ll be able to use Apple’s voice-controlled assistant Siri to set reminders and update tasks. Newsstand If you read magazines or newspapers on iPad, you no longer need individual apps for each subscription. Newsstand is essentially an iTunes for magazines and papers – like iBooks. You’ll now get alerts when new issues arrive through this service. It’s simple and makes it easier to browse and buy publications. Twitter Integration If you use the Twitter app, iOS 5 pulls in your friends’ Twitter ID into Contacts, much like Facebook. The clever bit is the new ability to Tweet from within Photos, Safari and more, meaning that the iPhone remains the Twitter phone of choice for social media fans. Camera update The iPhone has always been slower than rivals to take snaps. iOS 5 turns the volume buttons into a shutter button, so you don’t have to awkwardly reach for the on-screen button. You can also use the camera straight from the lock screen.

Much like similar products for iPhones and iPods that some prefer to hold their device during physical activity, the ActionSleeve Armband allows you to attach Apple Watch to your upper-arm or bicep. The company notes that “sports like Kickboxing, Weightlifting and CrossFit often require protective sports gear and full wrist mobility that can rule out the use of Apple Watch on the wrist.” But in addition to being able to use Apple Watch when wearing a watch might not be ideal, the company claims the strap can actually improve the Apple Watch’s performance too… Not only is the Apple Watch fully functionality while attached to your arm inside ActionSleeve, including the Watch’s button, Digital Crown, and touch screen, TwelveSouth says that the strap allows for more consistent skin contact than a traditional watch strap, which means improved heart rate monitoring: ActionSleeve can actually improve Apple Watch’s heart rate tracking. How? When you flex your wrist or your watch band isn’t tight enough, it can cause inconsistent readings or drop outs. ActionSleeve holds Apple Watch tightly and securely to your upper arm – delivering more consistent skin contact and more accurate heart rate tracking. If you’re serious about training or you’ve had trouble with the Apple Watch heart rate monitor in the past, ActionSleeve might just be the ticker-counting ticket you’re looking for. The ActionSleeve also has a built-in outer silicone bumper case to protect the watch during exercise or other strenuous activity. TwelveSouth is selling the ActionSleeve Armband for $29 in black and red with one size available for 38mm Apple Watches and two size options available for 42mm models. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Lenovo Adopts Microsoft Platforms to Challenge Android based Headsets and Tablets in 2017 and beyond | Main | U.S. Patent Office ordered by Court to reexamine a 2009 Apple Patent they rejected on insufficient Grounds » January 04, 2017 Ford and Toyota start Consortium to Sidestep Apple and Google's infotainment Systems   Funny how things can change in the blink of an eye. At CES 2016 Ford announced it was adopting CarPlay for their SYNC connectivity system. At CES 2017 Ford is taking another route.   While Apple and Google have revved up efforts to integrate their smartphone technologies with auto communications systems, Ford and Toyota on Wednesday announced the SDL Consortium which aims to develop an open-source software platform that app developers can use as an alternative to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.   In Ford's press release issued today they noted that "Mazda Motor Corporation, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (FHI) and Suzuki Motor Corporation are the first automaker members of the consortium. Elektrobit, Luxoft, and Xevo join as the first supplier members. Harman, Panasonic, Pioneer and QNX have signed Letters of Intent to join." Harman, of course, translates to Samsung who acquired them in November.   Conveniently Apple competitors are happy, as Pandora, Spotify and iHeartRadio, are already available to Ford AppLink users. For more on this read the full press release here.   The non-profit group's goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming.   Toyota has resisted offering Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the No. 2 U.S. automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple.   Bloomberg noted in their report that "Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow."   It'll be interesting to see how this plays out over time because I think it's a huge gamble on their part. There has to be a really easy one button method to allow CarPlay to be the infotainment system of choice for Apple fans in their brand new vehicles or consortium automakers are going to lose customers. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong. Where do you stand on this?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

According to a report India's Most Reputed Mobile Phone Brands 2017 by media analytics company BlueBytes, in association with business intelligence company TRA Research, Apple's iPhone has the highest positive media appearances in terms of sheer volume. Samsung Mobile had a Brand Rep Score that was 67 percent lower than iPhone, while Micromax - the only Indian brand in the top five - had a Brand Rep Score 94 percent lower than Samsung. China's Xiaomi and Finland's Nokia secured fourth and fifth position respectively. Chinese brands Lenovo, Huawei, and Motorola - now owned by Lenovo - ranked sixth, seventh and eighth respectively. LG (South Korea) and Intex Technologies (India) figure last in the list. Seventy two mobile phone brands were listed from 12 different countries in the report, of which Indian origin brands held 29 positions, China origin brands held 15 positions, while USA origin brands held eight positions. "Reputation can be seen as a currency that the brand can earn through positive action, communication, or sometimes erode due to lack of the same. Reputation has to be consistently maintained, monitored, and enhanced. In a cluttered space like the mobile phone industry, with diverse brands attempting to capture consumer attention, customers buy and recommend on the basis of reputation, making it the most important influencer of buying decisions," said Pooja Kaura, Chief Spokesperson for India's Most Reputed Brands.

In the same week that Apple has announced a ‘big reveal’ on October 4th, Samsung have promised a Google revelation on October 11th at Samsung Mobile Unpacked in San Diego. It’s an event which showcases new phones but this one carries the subtitle ‘Google Episode’. Samsung are thought to be behind the Nexus Prime rather than early Android partner Motorola.Due to the timing of the event, we’re betting it’s an outing of the long awaited Google Nexus Prime and the next instalment of Android – Ice Cream Sandwich. You can see a leaked version of the Android update in action here. The picture to the right is a mock-up of the Google Nexus Prime by designer Federico Ciccarese but shows how a Nexus Prime phone could look. We’ll be lucky if it’s that silm, but it’s not a bad guess. Current thinking suggests a 1.5 Mhz dual core processor, 4.6 inch screen and a 10 megapixel camera. The current launch date for the Google Nexus Prime is expected to be November.   What Mobile Awards 2011: Vote and win!   Home » News » Google Nexus Prime release date, Ice Cream Sandwich leak TagsAndroidGoogle Nexus PrimeIce Cream Sandwich Previous Story Emporia RL1 review Next Story BlackBerry Bold 9900 review About the author What Mobile Website Related Posts Zivix Jamstik+ Smart Guitar Review By Thomas Wellburn The Jamstik+ is an interesting accessory...

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español CNET Appliances Smart Home Incipio CommandKit Wireless Smart Power Strip with Metering Incipio CommandKit smart power strip works with both HomeKit and Amazon Echo January 4, 2017 9:00 AM PST Incipio's new CommandKit Smart Power Strip. Incipio Incipio brought some new smart gadgets to CES, including a new $100 "CommandKit" Wi-Fi power strip that you can control using both Siri and Alexa voice commands. With four automatable outlets that you can can control independent of one another, this thing is basically a four-way WeMo Switch that'll let you automate four things at once. Aside from syncing it up with Apple HomeKit or with one of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices to control it with your voice, you'll also be able to turn the outlets on and off from Incipio's app, or by scheduling them to turn on and off at specific times. That Apple HomeKit compatibility also lets you control the outlets using Apple's Home app on your iPhone or iPad. You can also pin outlets to the Control Center, then swipe up and tap to turn them on and off -- no app needed. 10 Siri runs the smart home with these HomeKit-compatible gadgets (pictures) The power strip's other big trick is that it'll track the energy usage of whatever you're plugging into it. That's a nice little bonus, and an added value if you're looking to cut your consumption. Automation can help with that. At $100 (about £80 or AU$140, converted roughly), this is definitely expensive for a power strip, but it costs a lot less than you'd spend on four switches from iDevices or Belkin WeMo. Provided you've got four things right next to each other that you're ready to plug in and automate, it sounds like it might be a smart buy once it hits the market this summer. We'll keep an eye out for it. Editors' Top Picks See All Amazon Echo Starting at: $179.99 Amazon's smart speaker was arguably the breakout product of 2015. Now, for 2016, we're...

And, following the iPad Air 2's second birthday, is Apple killing off the iPad Air line... or even the entire Air brand, laptops and all? Let's look at the evidence, in our iPad Air 3 release date UK rumour roundup. Latest: reports claim iPad Air 3 will launch in March of this year, and an analyst has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad by David Price | 09 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Poll - How often do you update your iPad? Design Tech specs Price New features wishlist When will the iPad Air 3 come out in the UK? And what design, tech specs, new features and UK price should we expect from Apple's next mid-size (9.7-inch) iPad, whether it's called iPad Air 3, iPad Pro 2, just plain iPad, The New iPad or something else? Finally, is Apple killing off the iPad Air brand - or even the entire Air brand, laptops and all? The most recent mid-size iPad was announced in March 2016, but it wasn't the new iPad Air 3 we had expected; instead, Apple unveiled its 9.7-inch iPad Pro, featuring improved specs, design tweaks and more. Does this mean Apple has finished with the iPad Air line, sticking to Pro branding for both 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPads in future? (And maybe even releasing an iPad Pro mini or iPad Pro 7.9in instead of the iPad mini 5?) Or will it carry on releasing 9.7-inch iPads in both Pro and Air configurations, much as it has done with the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro? Does the iPad Air have a future? In this article we look at rumours about the the iPad Air 3's release date in the UK, and talk about possible new features and design changes to expect. Bookmark this page and check back regularly for the latest information: as rumours circulate and news leaks out, we'll update it with everything you need to know about the new iPad Air 3: design, features, size and specifications, the differences between the next-gen iPad Air 3 and the current iPad Air 2, the iPad Air 3's UK launch date and likely UK pricing, and much, much more. Last updated on 9 January 2017, with a new report predicting 3 new iPad models in March; 15 December 2016, to talk about predictions of a Westworld-style folding iPad; on 6 Dec, to refresh our wishlist of new iPad features; on 29 Nov, to discuss rumours of a new line of iPads with a 10.9-inch screen; on 15 Nov, to adjust our predictions of the iPad Air 3's UK price based on recent changes for other Apple hardware; and on 1 Nov, to discuss the rumour that the iPad Air 3 will launch in March 2017, and be the last ever Air-branded tablet. iPad buying advice: If you're more interested in the current iPad range, read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review, 9.7-inch iPad Pro review and iPad Air 2 review, and our iPad mini 4 review and iPad mini 2 review.

Long, long ago - and wrongly - we predicted an October 2015 launch date for the iPad Air 3. This seemed logical: the iPad Air 2 was unveiled on 16 October 2014; the iPad Air 1 on 22 October 2013. This is Apple's traditional iPad release schedule, and the announcement of iOS 9 at WWDC 2015 on 8 June, same as every year, suggested that things were proceeding as usual. But 2015 was a surprising year for iPad announcements. At the September press briefing, where we would traditionally expect to hear about iPhones, iPhones and more iPhones, Apple gave the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus some company, in the form of the giant iPad Pro, and the petite iPad mini 4. But iPad Air 3 came there none, either at the September event or in October 2015. Apple instead refreshed its mid-size iPad range the following March, and called it the iPad Pro 9.7in. iPad Air 3 release date UK: March 2017 launch - but iPad Air 3 'will be last in Air line' Some pundits - reported by NeuroGadget, among others - are predicting that the iPad Air 3 will be unveiled in March 2017... alongside the iPad Pro 2. Perhaps they're right, but this seems off to us, and appears to go against the strategy Apple has been pursuing with its tablets in recent years. Having a brand-new (presumably 9.7-inch) iPad Air alongside new iPad Pros of the same screen size would be confusing for customers, and it's hard to see how Apple would differentiate the two. Would the iPad Pro 2 be faster than the iPad Air 3? How much faster does it need to be, given that the iPad Pro 9.7-inch is already far quicker than is necessary to run any app on the App Store? Would the iPad Air 3 be slower than the iPad Pro 9.7in? Would the iPad Air 3 be thinner than the Pro 2, when the Pro 9.7in is already only 6.1mm thick? There are surely ways round this, but it would present a headache for Apple's marketing department. The differentiation was easier to maintain for the MacBooks, partly because laptop buyers tend to be tech-savvier on average (and are liable to put in more pre-purchase research) than tablet buyers, but also because laptops have more room for difference in terms of specs and the like. Someone who just wants to read their email can settle for a netbook or Chromebook, while a video editor needs a laptop that's vastly more powerful. But the current iPad range is as fast as anyone could possibly want. Releasing a new tier of products on top, aimed at creative professionals, seems redundant. Releasing a new (slower?) tier of products below, aimed at casual and budget users, would be deeply unlike Apple, which always chases the premium market in any given sector. And seems unnecessary too, given that older iPads are still available. So we're not exactly convinced by this. Apple may choose to release another iPad Air, but to release it at the same time as a new iPad Pro would a branding challenge, to say the least. Separately, those same reports also predict that the iPad Air 3 will be the last Air-branded tablet Apple release. To wait this long, release one more Air tablet, then pack up the brand for good? Seems... strange. Still, we shall see. All of this has been supported by a January 2017 report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has predicted that March 2017 will see Apple announce three new iPad models: a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch "lower-priced model," and an in-between 10-10.5-inch "high-end model" with a narrow bezel design. There was no hint in the report that any of these models would bear the Air branding. It is at least possible that the new in-between size will be the Air 3 if Apple decides it isn't done with the brand just yet, but Kuo has previously that this model would be another Pro, so this seems unlikely at the moment. iPad Air 3 release date UK: iPad Air 2's second birthday It's been well over two years since the iPad Air 2 was first shown off to the world's media. Back in 2014, Apple used to schedule separate iPhone and iPad launch events in consecutive months in autumn, and the iPad Air 2 (and underwhelming iPad mini 3) were revealed on 16 October, just over a month after the iPhone 6. (What an act to follow!) As we discuss above and below, some pundits think a successor to the iPad Air 2 will be launched soon. Perhaps it will. But now that we've passed the two-year anniversary of the Air 2's launch with no word on the iPad Air 3 (and almost no movement on MacBook Air updates), we need to start facing facts: Apple appears to have lost interest in the Air brand. A two-year hiatus is enormous in the world of tablet updates. iPad Air 3 release date UK: The end of the Air brand There are widespread rumours that Apple has finished with the Air line, and will in future focus on the (7.9-inch) mini and (9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) Pro ranges - or even just unite everything under the Pro branding, with the various lines differentiated by size. Our feeling, based on the lack of love shown to the MacBook Air recently, is that Apple is moving towards a twin-brand model for its laptops: a MacBook, and a MacBook Pro. Likewise, we could see a product or line of products called simply 'iPad', to sit alongside the Pro models. iPad Air 3 release date UK: Onsale date rumours When will the iPad Air 3 go on sale in the UK? There's usually a delay of about 10 days between the announcement and the devices going on sale. If the Air 3 launches in late March 2017, for example, then expect it to hit UK shops in early April. There are occasionally shortages when a major Apple product launches, so those who are desperate to get their hands on the Air 3 would be wise to place a pre-order if possible. (Pre-ordering using Apple's own Apple Store app rather than on the website often appears to give you a head start that could make all the difference.)

The iPad Air 3 may arrive in spring, but not every iPad owner will make the upgrade. How often do you buy a new iPad? iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Design Let's look next at the iPad Air 3's physical design. What will the iPad Air 3 look (and feel) like? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Folding iPad Gene Munster - perhaps the most famous Apple analyst out there, albeit mainly for consistently getting it wrong when predicting an Apple television - has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, is based on Apple's recent patent activity; as we've reported in our iPhone 8 rumour roundup, the firm has taken out a number of 'folding device' patents that seemingly apply to the iPhone, but the larger and less portable iPads actually seem more amenable to such a development. Munster may have been influenced by a popular current TV show, Westworld. In this series, which centres around a Western-themed park where realistic android 'hosts' interact with human 'guests' living out their fantasies, the programmers of the hosts all use neat folding tablets. It's actually one of the most remarked-upon elements of the show's aesthetic, and makes a lot of sense (if you can solve the technical challenges). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Smart Connector for Smart Keyboard... It's an obvious logical progression from the 12.9- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro models, but it seems likely that the iPad Air 3 will have a Smart Connector on the lefthand edge for attaching a Smart Keyboard Cover. Most iPad accessories are dependent on their own battery power - even the Apple Pencil has to be recharged, albeit very quickly, when it runs out of charge - but the Smart Connector allows a connected keyboard cover to draw power from the iPad's battery. In the larger iPad Pro's case, that means a very long usage time, since it has a monster battery; hopefully the iPad Air 3 will be able to offer something impressive in that department too. iPad Air 3 design rumours: ...and Apple Pencil compatibility When Apple launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it was the only tablet that was compatible with the Apple Pencil. That made sense at the time - it was a unique selling point for Apple's most expensive tablet. But plenty of iPad Air owners have told us they would dearly love to be able to use the Pencil, one of the best styluses on the market, with their device, and it would be reasonable to add compatibility to a wider range of devices over the coming year. Apple started that process with the 9.7-inch Pro, and we expect Pencil capabilities to diffuse downwards through the range. iPad Air 3 design rumours: 10.9-inch screen An upgrade mentioned in the new features wishlist later in this article, and which sounds like it may happen: a larger screen. More specifically, a screen that's larger than that of the iPad Air 2, but smaller than the 12.9-inch display on the larger iPad Pro model. Barclays Research has predicted that Apple will unveil three new iPad Pro 2 models in March 2017: new 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, and a 10.9-inch version that sits in between. The inbetweener will actually have a chassis that's the same size as the iPad Air 2, while achieving the extra screen space by removing the bezel - which may mean the removal of the Home button. Whether Apple will carry over these changes to the Air line as well remains to be seen. iPad Air 3 design rumours: Thinner than iPad Air 2 Physically, it's rumoured that the next iPad Air will be… wait for it… thinner than its predecessor. It's generally a sound prediction to make, given that the iPad Air 1 was thinner than the iPad 4 and the iPad Air 2 was thinner than the iPad Air 1. The iPad Air 2 is already really thin, mind you, and we do sometimes wonder how much thinner tablets need to get before the compromises start to outweigh the benefits. The Air 2 is sturdy and has stood up to more than a year's heavy and frequent use, but we still recall the nervousness with which we handled it in the early days: it's hard to see an even more slender iPad Air 3 inspiring a great deal of confidence in its ability to withstand bending, chucking on a sofa, holding by one edge etc. (Note that the iPad Pro 9.7in, which improves on the iPad Air 2 in most other respects, is the same thickness.) If batteries are getting smaller, couldn't they just keep it the same size and incorporate a higher-capacity battery unit, and give us a few more hours away from the charger? Indeed, one rumour suggests that the Air 3's thinner chassis will actually mean it has a lower-capacity battery unit than the Air, which seems crazy to us. (Even though improvements in battery technology could mean that this lower-capacity unit actually lasts for a comparable length of time in practice, it seems barmy to consciously choose not to improve battery life when simply keeping the same capacity unit would achieve this.) iPad Air 3 design rumours: 7000-series aluminium body We mentioned above our general nervousness that a thinner iPad Air 3 would also be less robust. But one other change to its physical design could help with that. The Tampa Bay Review thinks the iPad Air 3 is likely to be made of 7000-series aluminium, like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. There's a certain logic to this: spending the extra cash on stronger materials to make the newest iPhones more bend-proof than their predecessors was a popular move after the (possibly overstated) traumas of Bendgate. But it does raise the question of why the iPad Pro (which is more valuable) and the iPad mini 4 (which is more portable, and therefore more likely to get crammed into a pocket) missed out on this upgrade. If the Air 3 is thinner than either of those devices then we have an answer, but that only poses another: what is it about the Air lineup in particular that makes it more deserving of a super-thin body than those other Apple tablets? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Colour options Like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, we'd expect the iPad Air 3 to be available in four colours: silver, gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. Black and Jet Black, the matt and gloss new colour finishes available for the iPhone 7, are also possibilities. Every year someone suggests that the next iPad will come in the bright primary colours of the iPhone 5c and every year that person is disappointed. We don't expect the iPad Air 3 to be particularly colourful (except for the two fairly muted gold finishes). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Concept showcases everything iPad Air 3 should be Although we've not seen many leaks for the iPad Air 3, the latest concept video to hit the Internet showcases everything that the unannounced tablet should feature - Smart connector, a flush camera and, more importantly, 3D Touch support. Apart from that, the concept tablet looks similar to the iPad Pro 9.7in but with smaller bezels at the sides of the display. Take a look at the concept video below: iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Tech specs It's time to look deeper into the iPad Air 3. What do the latest rumours say about the iPad Air 3's specs? iPad Air 3 specs rumours: Processor and speed The iPad Air 2 got a new processor chip, the A8X - a souped-up version of the iPhone 6's A8. This has three billion transistors and offers (Apple says) 40 percent faster performance than the iPad Air 1's A7 chip in most apps and up to 2.5x graphics performance. Read next: Best iPad games | Best free iPad games It would be a big shock if Apple didn't upgrade the processor again when it launches the iPad Air 3, and it doesn't take a genius to predict that the iPad Air 3's chip will be an A9 or an A9X, and very speedy indeed. The iPad Pro 9.7in has an A9X processor. Read next: Apple rumours & predictions for 2017 | iPad mini 5 rumours iPad Air 3 specs: Rear-facing camera gains LED flash The iPad Pro 9.7in is the first iPad in history to feature a flash. This is attached to the rear-facing camera, but the front-facing camera also gets the Retina Flash feature, whereby the entire screen is induced to light up as a sort of substitute flash. We feel that the iPad Air 3 is likely to get one or both of these upgrades too. The genie is clearly out of the bottle when it comes to iPad photography: as annoying as you find it when someone holds up their iPad to video a concert, the iPad range are being used as cameras, and Apple knows this. Just look at the hyperbole and feature list here. And a flash is a big gap to have in a device's photographic armour. iPad Air 3 specs: No 3D Touch Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most famous Apple pundits out there, predicted that 3D Touch wouldn't make an appearance in the iPad Pro 9.7in, and this proved correct. In a research paper, Kuo predicted that the a new iPad would launch in the first half of 2016 but wouldn't get the marquee feature from the flagship iPhones. In the past, Apple has frequently introduced a new feature on the iPhone line and then dispersed it through other iOS devices - Retina displays, Siri, Touch ID - and plenty of analysts have made the obvious logical leap of assuming that 3D Touch will migrate to iPad at some point. Ming-Chi Kuo was the most authoritative voice to doubt this. It would seem strange to allow this popular (if still fairly niche) feature to appear on the iPad Air 3 if it isn't on the iPad Pro, so we assume 3D Touch on iPad will have to wait for a while longer. Read next: 3D Touch tips iPad Air 3 specs: Screen resolution Back in 2014, we wondered if the iPad Air 2 might get a screen upgrade from the Air 1, possibly gaining the Retina HD designation given to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. But its display is largely the same, with the same resolution and size. (One screen modification Apple did talk about was an anti-reflective coating: a nice - if unglamorous - upgrade.) And this idea has been floated again this year. Back in September 2015 the Chinese-language site MyDrivers (link to translation) made some grand claims about the iPad Air 3's specifications. Most eye-catching among these is the unexpected prediction that Apple will increase the resolution and therefore pixel density of the screen on its next mid-size iPad. MyDrivers reckons the Air 3 will get a bump up to 401 pixels per inch (matching the iPhone 6s Plus), which translates on a 9.7-inch screen into a resolution of 3112 x 2334. (This compares to 2048 x 1536 at 264ppi on both the Air 1 and Air 2.) Pixel density is a measure of how tightly pixels are packed on a screen, and increasing it so much would result in an appreciably sharper screen - even though Apple used to maintain that 264ppi was plenty on devices of this form factor. Moving up to 401ppi on the Air 3 would be a major step forward for Apple, which has previously applied its Retina marketing label to 9.7-inch tablets rated at 264ppi on the basis that they are held further away from the eye than smartphones or even mini tablets (the Retina-rated mini 2 and mini 4 both have a pixel density of 326ppi, matching the non-Plus iPhones). There is a simple reason why we don't think this is likely to happen. As well as smashing past the pixel density of half of Apple's smartphones, including the just-released and Retina HD-rated iPhone 6s (326ppi), all of which would be held far closer to the face than the iPad Air 3, it would also show up the iPad Pro, which has a pixel density of 264ppi. And the iPad Pro is a very expensive top-end device that is clearly positioned as Apple's flagship tablet. It's hard to imagine anyone happily paying top dollar for a 264ppi Pro when there's a 401ppi Air 3 for, presumably, about £200 less. Oh, and we dread to think what such a large bump in resolution would do to battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus got round that because its larger size allowed it to include a bigger battery, but we're hearing that the Air 3 will be thinner than the Air 2. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Price We expect it to cost pretty much what the iPad Air 2 cost when it launched - and it launched with a base price of £399. These days the iPad Air 2's UK price starts at £379 for the 32GB model in Wi-Fi only, moving up to £469 for 128GB Wi-Fi. The 3G/cellular models cost £120 more at each configuration: £499 for the 32GB model and £589 for 128GB. (These prices have all dropped since the Air 2 was launched - in stark contrast with the prices of most other Apple hardware, which has gone up since the Brexit vote - and the lowest storage capacities have been phased out.) Mind you, a better comparison point might be the iPad Pro 9.7. That device currently starts at an altogether more intimidating £549, and rises to £849 for the 256GB cellular model. With the iPad Air 3 filling in its predecessors' price points, the iPad Air 2 may drop further in price; the iPad Air 1 is likely to be discontinued. Apple usually tries to keep its range simple. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: New features wishlist So much for the rumours concerning the iPad Air 3's design changes, specs and new features. But what new features would we add to the device if we were in Jony Ive's shoes? Here's our iPad Air 3 feature wish list. Some are brand-new wishes: perhaps ideas triggered by issues with Apple's latest line of iPads. Others are features we've been asking for since before the iPad Air 2 but weren't included in that device. Let us know what features you want to see in the iPad Air 3 in the comments, or let us know on Twitter. iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Larger screen You can never be too rich, or too thin, or have too much screen space. In fact, there would be plenty of negatives attached to increasing the iPad Air 2's screen size from its current 9.7in diagonal: mainly increasing the bulk of the device (and having to incorporate a bigger and heavier battery to power the screen for as long), thereby reducing its fantastic portability. But a bigger screen would make the iPad Air more adaptable as a work device, and more immersive for entertainment, so who cares about practicalities? In fact, since we wrote this wishlist, Apple has unveiled an iPad with a bigger screen; it just isn't called the iPad Air 3. Go and read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review for more on that one. We think the iPad Air line will continue to be based around a 9.7in screen. Chances of happening (on the Air line at any rate): low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Faster processor This too is an obvious one, and something that has happened in essentially every iOS device update: a new, faster processor chip. But is it actually something to be wishing for? The iPad Air 2 is fast enough to run every current app with ease, and on most apps you won't notice any different in performance between it and the iPad Air 1 (iPad Air 1 vs iPad Air 2 comparison). The iPad Air is effectively faster than it needs to be, and apps are trying their best to catch up. The iPad Air 3 (or iPad 7) doesn't need to be any faster. It'll probably get a new chip, and there's a good chance it'll be a bit faster, but maybe Apple will go for greater power-efficiency instead?  Yeah, who are we kidding? You've got to be able to boast about processing speeds at the launch announcement. Chances of happening: nailed on iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved camera The last of our recurring requests that crop up every time. Of course an improved camera would be nice, but we wouldn't cite it as an essential, since the iPad is used less for its camera than Apple's smartphones (less, although tablet camera use is growing all the time), and it's got pretty good anyway. A smartphone needs a great camera; a tablet doesn't. Chances of happening: mid to low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Face recognition Ah, something more interesting! What if the iPad Air 3 uses facial recognition to unlock the device? Face-recognition is already available in the Camera app, but that's facial recognition only in the sense of recognising that something is a face, rather than recognising which one it is - which makes this one a long shot. It does also seem a bit unnecessary, given that Apple has the Touch ID technology, and so does the iPad Air 2. If it wants to do convenient, biometric authentication it can use that.  Chances of happening: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Full Apple Pay This one is slightly complicated. The iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 gained Touch ID fingerprint scanners - one of the components required to use the new Apple Pay online/instore payment service, which allows you to pay for things in shops by scanning your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and touching the fingerprint scanner. And indeed both models can use Apple Pay in the US. (Apple Pay hasn't launched in the UK at time of writing, but it will make its UK launch in July.) But they get only a limited, partial version of Apple Pay: one that doesn't work in shops. Instead they use the online and app-based versions of Apple Pay, which use Touch ID but don't require the NFC wireless antenna component used when scanning the iPhone 6 on an instore receiver. A further complication is the discovery of NFC antennae in both devices when they were disassembled; perhaps these could be activated in future and allow for full Apple Pay. Or perhaps they are intended for some other purpose. Either way, we'd like to at least have the option of instore Apple Pay with the next generation of iPads. Admittedly the average customer is a lot less likely to whip out a full-size iPad at the till, but we thought something similar about iPad photography. Chances of happening: fairly high - especially now that Apple Pay has come to the Mac iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Live multitasking "The fact that you cannot use multiple applications at the same time is a little annoying," said Product Reviews when discussing potential new features for the iPad Air 2, "and it would definitely be a great feature if Apple could add it in. For example you could update your Twitter feed in a sidebar whilst watching a video or check your emails whilst reading an article." We didn't get it in the iPad Air 2, and it still makes sense for the iPad Air 3, although you'd probably need a bigger screen to be able to use this practically. And maybe it's more of an iOS 9 thing. Even as a software update it seems very radical indeed for something that (I think) is a niche requirement. How many people check their emails while continuing to read an article or watch a video? Chances of happening: low UPDATE: Scratch that. Chances of happening: definite. Multitasking capabilities arrived with iOS 9: iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved stylus support "I'd like to see more attention paid to the display sensor technology that allows for the next generation of fine tip electronic styluses to be used more effectively and accurately," wrote MacObserver ahead of the launch of the iPad Air 2. Since then Apple has launched the Apple Pencil stylus alongside the two iPad Pro models - the only devices that are compatible with it. We wouldn't be surprised if the iPad Air 3 gets Apple Pencil support.  Chances of happening: decent (albeit the Apple Pencil) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Subwoofer and other audio/speaker improvements The iPad's audio output could be improved; this is certainly true. (The iPad Air 2 has stereo speaker units, but they are so close together that their output is effectively mono.) Yet there are limits on the richness of the audio a slim and portable unit can produce; I suspect that the average iPad owner would rather buy a separate wireless speaker than add any noticeable weight to the iPad Air's chassis. A touch more bass output would substantially improve the iPad as a games unit, mind you, and it would be great for film fans.  Chances of happening: decent (the iPad Pro models have quad speakers) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Increase the storage baseline "iPads tend to accumulate a lot of stuff," pointed out MacObserver. "Apps, movies and music that make a 16GB iPad an anachronism. Here's hoping..." In fact, Apple phased out the popular 32GB model instead, leaving the iPad Air 2 (and the iPad mini 3 and iPhone 6 handsets) with an oddly lopsided line-up of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. Will Apple phase out the 16GB iPad? It's going to happen at some point - remember the 8GB iPad? - but maybe not quite yet. Plenty of users store work documents and photos in the cloud, rarely game and use a small number of lightweight apps.  Chances of happening: nailed on (Apple has bumped up the storage baselines across its iPad and iPhone ranges. All iPads now start at 32GB, and Pro models top out at 256GB. Hooray!) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Memory card slot We'll say right away: this would be nice in some respects but is highly unlikely. Apple's philosophy embraces the closed box: the complete product experience bought ready-to-use and held apart from user tinkering and upgrades. Without mentioning that this would encourage buyers to go for the lower-capacity iPads and fill the shortfall with removable memory. And it would ruin the iPad's clean lines.  Chances of happening: no way iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Bluetooth mouse support It's been argued that touch is less accurate than mouse (or similar) input, and that Apple's more work-oriented users would enjoy being able to use wireless mice with their iPad Air 3. If we were talking about the Mac OS X-running iPad Pro that some have discussed, this would be a no-brainer, but this would call for a major rethink of how iOS works, and we don't think that's likely.  Chances of appearing: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Wireless charging At the moment wireless charging is big let-down, offering only minor convenience rather than the quantum leap it appears to promise. The Air Voltage Qi Chargers are an example of a (comparatively) recent take on the concept: you buy a case for your device, and a separate charging mat. Simply laying the cased iPhone on the mat starts up the charging process - but it has to touch the mat, and the mat itself has to be plugged in.  If Apple incorporated the technology in the chassis of the iPad so that you don't have to bother with a particular case then it would be far more appealing. If you could increase the range of the charge transmission so that, for example, you just need to be sitting with a couple of feet of the charger for the device in your pocket to start charging - then we'd be talking. Chances of appearing: still seems unlikely, although we're hearing more and more rumours about this appearing on the iPhone 8.

The MacBook Air had an update in 2016, but it was such a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model - that we're looking ahead to the next MacBook Air update. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air lineup be killed off for good? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook deals New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Apple hosted a special event on 21 March 2016, and ahead of the event we (quite naturally) expected new MacBook Air and MacBook models. After all, the spring event represented one year since both were last updated (or one year since it was first launched in the MacBook's case) and before that new Air models arrived in April of 2014. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. Instead, we had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that's only for the 13in model. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years.

After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that a 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We think that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think that Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC any more? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suspect that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011.  Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implimenting the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the current price of the 11in MacBook Air. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. Although with this being said, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? Interface changes Apple TV streaming service Complete guide to 4th-gen Apple TV (2015) When will Apple release the next Apple TV - the 5th-generation Apple TV, or Apple TV 5 - in the UK? And what new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes should we expect from the new 5G Apple TV for 2017? The fourth-gen Apple TV - the first Apple TV device to allow users to install apps - was unveiled by Apple at the iPhone 6s launch event on 9 September 2015, and went on sale weeks later. More than 16 months later, we're eagerly looking ahead to the launch of the next, fifth-gen (5G) Apple TV. Indeed, there are already rumours that a next-generation Apple TV might arrive in 2017: perhaps even a special model to celebrate the Apple TV's 10th birthday. In this article we gather all the evidence related to the fifth-gen Apple TV's release date, as well as reporting on all the rumours and clues about the 2017 Apple TV's new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes. However, if you're still interested in the Apple TV that's available right now, we've got plenty of information about the 2015 Apple TV, including pricing and the best places to buy. And don't forget our Apple TV buying guide 2017. Read next: How to set up the new Apple TV | New Apple TV vs old Apple TV | Apple TV tips UK Updated, 11 January 2017, to discuss the chances of an anniversary update as the Apple TV turns 10; and previously to include the news that the third-gen Apple TV has been discontinued, and what this might mean for the release of the fifth-gen Apple TV. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? We expect Apple to release the next-gen Apple TV in 2017 to tie in with the product's 10th anniversary, but there has. Here's when the four generations of Apple TV launched: 1st-gen Apple TV: January 2007 2nd-gen Apple TV: September 2010 3rd-gen Apple TV: March 2012 4th-gen Apple TV: September 2015 Evidently, Apple updates its Apple TV less often than its iPhones, iPads and Macs: there was a three-and-a-half-year wait between the first and second models, and between the third and fourth. Based on that, it would be reasonable to expect the 5th-gen Apple TV to appear in 2018 or even 2019, and we certainly don't have firm evidence to dispute that. But our instincts tell us that the Apple TV's position and status in the company's portfolio of products has changed. It used to be a sideline and a hobby, but with the growing importance of streaming media and smart-home applications, and with the arrival on the platform of games and its own App Store, Apple TV is moving to centre stage. And we're not the only ones to think Apple is likely to start updating the TV more frequently from now on. A report (link for subscribers only) in DigiTimes last year predicted that the fifth-generation Apple TV would go into trial production as early as December 2015, with volume production starting in the first quarter of 2016. Changes were said to include a dramatically improved hardware performance and new functions "to help it no longer serve only as a set-top box". Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best Apple TV buying guide 2017 Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV Apple has officially discontinued the third-generation Apple TV after being on sale since 2012. The move from Apple forces users to invest in the upgraded fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at £139 compared to the £59 price-tag of the third-gen device. The third-gen Apple TV didn't feature tvOS or the App Store, but was used as a budget option for users that only wanted to stream content to their TVs.   The choice to remove the third-gen Apple TV from the Apple TV lineup suggests, to us at least, that the wheels are in motion and that the fifth-gen Apple TV will be making an appearance sooner, rather than later. Q3 2016 earnings call comments: 'Something bigger' on the way Tim Cook made non-specific but intriguing comments about the future of the Apple TV at Apple's Q3 2016 earnings conference call. He made it very clear that Apple has big plans for its TV division, and plans to build "something bigger" with the product and surrounding ecosystem. Near the end of the hour-long call, a question was posed by Kulbinder Garcha, the managing director of Credit Suisse: "I think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck in the sixties and seventies, and the experience hasn't changed," Garcha said. "I understand that you've got the Apple TV box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something Apple wants to do themselves, do you want to partner, could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity, as opposed to, here's an Apple box and we sell some units but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?" Tim Cook's reply was enigmatic. "The introduction of Apple TV and tvOS in last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall… think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time," he said. "I don't want to be more precise than that but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of." New Apple TV 2017 release date: WWDC 2016 and tvOS 10 Back in spring 2016 we argued that the 5G Apple TV was unlikely to be launched at WWDC 2016, since the event came round less than a year after Apple rolled out the fourth-gen model and none of the previous Apple TVs had launched in summer. Indeed, Apple launched no new hardware at the event whatsoever. But the new version of the Apple TV's operating system, tvOS 10, got considerable stage time. As we often observe when discussing new iPhones and iPads, many of the most significant updates come not from new hardware but from free software updates. Siri gets some big improvements in tvOS's new update: it can now search the Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex queries. It can search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then the name of the channel. There's a new dark mode for Apple TV, which makes the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. And the Apple TV Remote app has been redesigned; it now offers all the Siri remote features and can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic. One last thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been relaxed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote. See: Best Apple TV game controllers. Read our Complete guide to tvOS's new features for more information on the software update. New Apple TV 2017 release date: 10th-anniversary Apple TV Looking again at those launch dates above, we feel like the tenth anniversary of the Apple TV, which we passed on 9 January 2017, might be a tempting occasion for a big update. Apple tends to dislike historical wallowing - famously refusing to build a museum in its new headquarters because "we're focused on the future, not the past" - but there is a precedent for an anniversary product in the form of the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (number 4 in our article The 5 weirdest Macs of all time). Read next: Best Apple TV game controllers | Best Apple TV games | Best Apple TV apps New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours: Apple's 27 October event While many assumed that we would see the introduction of the fifth-generation Apple TV at Apple's October 2016 event, the event focused mainly on the new MacBook Pro. The New MacBook Pro features a Touch Bar, offering contextual controls depending on the app you're using. You can find out more about the 2016 MacBook Pro here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. The Apple TV wasn't completely out of the spotlight, though, as Apple introduced the TV app for the Apple TV and iOS devices. The app looks to integrate streaming content from a number of providers, but is US-only at first. Those in the US can expect the app to appear as part of a software update in December, while those in the UK have no solid release date just yet.  New Apple TV 2017 rumours UK: Interface changes An Apple TV owner's user experience is largely dictated by the software side of things. How will Apple change the Apple TV interface? New cross-provider programming guide interface Apple's next big plan for its Apple TV isn't new hardware: it's a software-based programme guide. That sounds boring, but it's potentially a powerful way of improving user-friendliness for those who are signed up to multiple content providers. The first foundation of this strategy was laid with the announcements of tvOS 10 at WWDC in June. tvOS 10 includes a new feature known as 'single sign in', whereby a user can sign in once, with a single login and password, and tvOS will then automatically sign into a whole raft of services for them: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and so on. Nice and convenient. But for many of us who do use multiple TV and movie services, a bigger issue than multiple sign-ins is simply keeping track of everything that's available to watch. Each service will have its own ways of highlighting new, popular or user-tailored recommendations, but having to open up two, three or even more apps to check out what's on offer when planning an evening's viewing is a slight pain. This is where Apple comes in. The company is really good at stuff like this: forging relationships with content providers and creating a simple and trusted umbrella interface enabling users to browse and access everything they want. That was what iTunes was so good at, and the iOS App Store is successful in that regard too. We just hope the new Apple TV programming guide has strong search. The App Store still has disappointing search, with worthless spammy apps that are good at SEO ranking above legitimate apps on relevant search terms. The two scenarios aren't quite the same - there isn't really such a thing as spam TV - but Apple still needs to find a way to foreground higher-quality content so it isn't drowned out by the volume. For more information about upcoming changes to the Apple TV's interface, take a look at our complete guide to tvOS 10. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple TV streaming service Rumours that Apple will launch a TV streaming service have been around for a while. If you'd like more of an in-depth discussion of this topic, take a look at our separate article about Apple's streaming service plans. Unfortunately for anyone who was looking forward to the launch of the service, it sounds like it will be further delayed as Apple continues to negotiate with the TV networks in the US. The December 2015 report from Bloomberg claims that Apple is putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks are proving resistant to the idea. In fact, Apple may ditch the idea altogether, focusing instead on offering the tvOS platform for media companies to sell their content directly to consumers via the App Store, according to the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg reckons the reason for the resistance is Apple's demand for content at a price the networks aren't happy with. CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has often commented on the rumoured service, has also claimed that Apple has put the streaming service plans "on hold", according to Bloomberg. Previously Moonves had hinted that the rumoured Apple TV steaming service would arrive in 2015. The revelation came during an earlier interview with Bloomberg TV in which he suggested his company would soon come to an arrangement with Apple. Moonves said: "Apple is having conversations with everyone about doing their own streaming services. We have had those conversations, as have the other networks. Do I think something will happen? Probably, but I don't know when." This isn't the first time Moonves has made comments about the rumoured service. Earlier this year he made a similar revelation in an interview at a Re/code conference, giving the impression that he was in ongoing conversations with Apple.

This is what you need to know about the 2016 MacBook update. Advertisement The new MacBook arrived without an update to the 2016 MacBook Pro. Instead Apple focuses on the 12-inch MacBook that is quickly becoming a flagship device for the company. With a new pink MacBook coming to stores this week, this is what you need to know before you buy a 2016 MacBook. The 2016 MacBook release is here. This is what buyers need to know. Apple did not announce the product at a special event, instead the company put the 2016 MacBook up on the website with a press release and is putting the notebook into stores on April 20th. 2016 MacBook Release Date The 2016 MacBook release date is today, but you will be able to find the new MacBook in stores starting tomorrow. Advertisement Right after Apple announced the 2016 MacBook the option to buy the new device online was still not available. We expect to see this change as the company brings the full website back online. If you want the new MacBook faster the company shares that the 2016 MacBook release date in stores starts on April 20th at Apple Stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers. 2016 MacBook Specs What you need to know about the 2016 MacBook specs. Apple upgrades the 2016 MacBook specs with more RAM standard, faster storage, new Intel processors, better graphics and better battery life. Here is a look at the 2016 MacBook specs that really matter. Display 12-inch Retina Display, 2304 x 1440 resolution, 16:10 Aspect Ratio Processor 1.1GHz dual‑core Intel Core m3, 1.2GHz dual‑core Intel Core m5, or 1.3GHz dual‑core Intel Core m7 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz Graphics Intel HD Graphics 515 Storage 256GB and 512GB SSD RAM 8GB RAM Standard Camera 480P FaceTime Camera Battery Up to 10 Hours Wireless Web 41.4 watt-hour lithium polymer battery Software OS X El Capitan, Photos, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, Keynote Design 0.14 to 0.52 inch x 7.74 inches deep x 11.04 inches wide, weighs 2.03 pounds Connections Headphone Jack, 1 USB Type C Extras Adapters sold seperarately to enable video out, USB, Lightining Of course you can choose to upgrade the MacBook and configure options that you need. This new MacBook is more capable than the 2015 model, but it is still not going to replace the 2016 Macbook Pro that many users are waiting for. Advertisement 2016 MacBook Design & Color You can buy the 2016 MacBook in four colors including Rose Gold. Apple finally delivers a pink MacBook. Technically it is a Rose Gold MacBook, but it still fits the bill and brings the MacBook color options in line with the iPad Pro and iPhone 6s. Overall the 2016 MacBook looks a lot like the 2015 MacBook. Both of these devices only include a single USB Type C port and a headphone jack for connectivity. There is no fan and no moving parts. The size and weight of the 2016 MacBook is the same as the 2015 MacBook, so if you’ve been longing for the older model, you already know the size and shape. The 2016 Macbook size and weight match the 2015 model. The MacBook is just over 2 pounds and is 13.1mm thick with a full size keyboard and a 12-inch Retina Display. This still uses the same keyboard as the 2015 MacBook, which means you get a full size keyboard, but there is not a lot of travel. It also uses a ForceTouch trackpad. 2016 MacBook Price The 2016 MacBook price starts at $1,299 for the base model with a 1.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.2 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The 2016 MacBook price starts at $1,299. The other ready to buy option is $1,599 for a 1.2 GHz dual-core Intel Core m5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.7 GHz, 8GB of memory and 512GB of flash storage. Users can also choose to upgrade the processor to a 1.3 GHz dual-core Intel Core m7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz through a custom order that will not likely be in every store. The 2016 MacBook price is the same as the starting price of the current MacBook Pro. 2015 MacBook Price Cut There is no official 2015 MacBook Price cut since the company is no longer making that model. Users looking for a deal should check out the refurbished MacBook deals at Apple that cut the price to $929 for an entry-level model. The higher end 2015 MacBook models may not be worth the savings considering all the upgrades that the 2016 MacBook brings to the table. Best Buy offers $300 off the 2015 MacBook, dropping the price to $999 for the model with 256GB of storage and 8GB RAM.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Look at what happens to a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus after 2 months with no case Zach Epstein BGR NewsJanuary 4, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share I remember my inbox in the weeks following Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch this past September. It was flooded with emails from angry Apple fans who were upset that they were unable to get their hands on the company’s latest and greatest smartphone in the hot new Jet Black color Apple had added to its lineup. On stage, Jet Black looked absolutely incredible. The glossy mirror finish created an effect that appeared as though the phone’s screen had no borders, wrapping all the way around the device. It was gorgeous, and people wanted it desperately. Unfortunately, the manufacturing process was very complex and supply was insanely constrained for months. As a result, many people in search of a Jet Black iPhone refused to wait and instead opted to buy the other new color Apple had introduced on its iPhone 7 lineup. At the time, people were angry. But fast-forward to today, and many of those same people will likely breathe sighs of relief when they see what a Jet Black iPhone looks like after two months of use. Don't Miss: Faraday’s FF 91 feels like the future The best thing about Apple’s new Jet Black color also happens to be the worst thing about Apple’s new color: the finish. Apple made sure to warn people right out of the gate that the glossy finish was prone to scratching, and it even posted the following disclaimer on its website: The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone. Despite the company’s warnings, it seems like many people were unprepared for what would happen to the Jet Black finish over time. Many people refused to hide the new color under a protective case, and earlier this week we took a look at what happens to the Jet Black finish after three months of use with no case. It wasn’t pretty. That post caused a lot of buzz, and we’ve gotten plenty of feedback from Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners who say that their own handsets look the same. Beyond that, another user took to Reddit to share a photo of what his Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus looks like after just two months of use without a case. Redditor “lemonviking” posted a photo on Tuesday that shows his caseless Jet Black phone at the perfect angle to the light so that the scratching and swirling are as visible as possible. Again, it’s not pretty: nzeayngu1uaq6opmo7u_fykfgbr77kdyc00xw-kcnyuMore As the Reddit user noted in his post, the scratching on the Jet Black finish is most visible at certain angles to the light. At other angles and away from bright lighting, the phones still look great. In fact, in ideal lighting and at the right angle, they look like a real-world version of the black hole in Interstellar. Jet Black truly is a gorgeous finish… now, if only Apple can find a way to make it more durable.

The alliance has shared its main goal of creating more choice for connecting smartphones with vehicles, which in turn could create some friction with Google, Apple, and their visions for integrating and controlling the user interface inside of cars. The history of this consortium started about six years ago as Ford and Toyota shared some concerns with how Google and Apple could take over the the in-dash entertainment system along with safety and security features. Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. The other automakers that have recently joined include, Mazda, PSA Group, Subaru (Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.), Suzuki, and Peugeot (PSA Group). All of these manufacturers will have Android Auto on coming soon, while Ford includes the option for Android Auto on all of its 2017 models. Notably, Toyota doesn’t offer Android Auto at all. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. In their joint statement, Toyota and Ford provided a little more detail about their concerns, noting that “by enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data.” There are a few choices for aftermarket Android Auto options, but it seems they are becoming more and more difficult to retro-fit into newer vehicles. It will be interesting to see how this consortium will effect the future of Google’s integration with vehicles in the years to come.

Comments Smartphones offer more than 'traditional' mobile phones, but they can be overly complicated to use, and many of their features may be more hindrance than help if all you want from a phone is the ability to make calls and send text messages. Here's PC Advisor's older person's guide to what to look for in a smartphone. Also see: Best Phone Deals The trouble is that smartphones are very, very popular. There are very few simple feature phones available on the high street right now, and if you need a new phone you may find that a smartphone is the only way to go, with all the expense that entails. But this needn't be bad news: the internet is for everyone, and if you use email, like to browse the web or look at photos on Facebook, the right smartphone will be a brilliant purchase. Here we'll look in detail and what a smartphone is, and how that affects usability. Then we'll suggest some simple things to look for when buying a smartphone. (Being myself firmly ensconced in middle age, I'm going to try to avoid being patronising here, but should I fail in this, do feel free to let me know in the comments at the bottom of the story!) See also: Group test: what's the best smartphone? Smartphone for the elderly: What is a smartphone? A smartphone is in essence a web-connected mobile phone. It will have the ability to send and receive email, browse the web, and install apps - small software programs designed for use on a smartphone or tablet. These offer easy access to things such as news, sport and weather information, as well as fun games with which to waste an idle hour. All smartphones also double as media players, letting you upload music, films and ebooks you already own, and buy downloads from dedicated stores accessed direct form the handset. All smartphones work as compact cameras, too. Smartphones have dedicated operating systems such as Google Android, Windows Phone or Apple iOS. They have larger displays than feature phones, usually at least 4in, and they will have some form of QWERTY keyboard: usually an onscreen touch keyboard, although BlackBerry handsets have small hardware keyboards. They connect to the internet via either cellular or Wi-Fi technology. Cellular technology requires a SIM card, and can be expensive because you have to pay for the data in the same way you pay for calls and text messages. But whenever you are in reach of a wireless network for which you know the password, your smartphone will seemlessly select the free option. Basically, you can do on a smartphone anything you can do on a web connected PC, wherever you can get connected. Some things - email, for instance - may actually be easier to do on a mobile device, although most of the time the smaller screen can mitigate against prolonged use. Smartphone for the elderly: what to look for Now that you are (hopefully) sold on the benefits of joining the smartphone world, here are a few pointers as to what to look for. It's always worth trying out a handset in store, so you can get the feel of the hardware and the operating system interface. The breadth of choice can be offputting, but don't be afraid to take your time and try as many handsets as you like before making a choice: this is a purchase you'll want to make only once every two to three years, so it pays to get it right. 1. A simple interface - because of the massive amounts of functionality smartphones offer over feature phones, they can seem complicated to use. Look for a smartphone with simple, easy to use, intuitive navigation. Think of a few key things you are going to want to do - make a call, send an email, find a phone number - and ask to try them out in the store. Don't be afraid to ask for advice, but if it takes a sales assistant a long time to explain how to undertake such key tasks, this may not be the phone for you. Make sure you spend some time using the onscreen keyboard, too. Most will respond to keypresses by making the letter or number concerned bigger, and even vibrating gently. This can be a huge aid to usability, but not all interfaces are built the same. Apple products are famed for their ease of use, and the iPhone is generally a very simple and intuitive device to get to grips with. Apple is also pretty hot on customer service, should you get stumped. The iPhone has only one hardware button, which does simplify things somewhat, and because you are tied in to iTunes installing apps and buying music and movies is straightforward. This does mean that you pay Apple's prices, though. Most smartphones on the market, however, use Google's Android OS. Android phones tend to be cheaper than the iPhone. Because Android is to some extent open source, however, individual phone handsets have different versions of the interface. The best are iPhone-like in their simplicity, the worst cramped and crowded, ugly to look at, and difficult to use. It's important to try before you buy. Windows Phone has taken great strides, and although the interface is flashy and full of bright colours, it is now the simplest mobile operating system to use. Windows Phones are rarely cheap, and there are few of them about, but they do tend to be high-quality products. Windows Phone is very much a love-it-or-hate-it proposition, however, so make sure you have a good play with it before you commit. BlackBerry was once the undisputed king of the connected smartphone space, but in recent years it has fallen behind the others. With BlackBerry you usually get a physical keyboard. This may be a good thing, you'd think, but the keys are often tiny and may be harder for you to use than a good onscreen touch keyboard. However, if you find a touchscreen interface is too difficult to effectively use - and studies have shown that issues with eye-hand coordination accompany ageing (which is bad news for my already dreadful golf) it may be that a hardware keyboard on a high-end BlackBerry such as a BlackBerry Priv is the way to go. This handset also runs Android, making it a superb cross-over device from old-style keyboard to new software. 2. A large screen - a close cousin of the need for a simple interface is the requirement for a clear, bright LCD screen. Sad fact: as we age we gain wisdom and style, but our eyesight declines. From my observation of parents and parents in law, I think it is fair to say that we also develop a rampant urge to look at photos of things (and things, I mean children we are related to). All smartphones have cameras built in, remember. So in order to get the most use out of a smartphone, a big screen is a must. As I mentioned above virtually all smartphones have at least a 4in display, these days. High end devices such as the Android-running Samsung Galaxy S7 have massive 5in or more displays. The bigger screen the more expensive the phone tends to be, and a large screen will drain battery life. Also, it is worth remembering that not all screens are created equal: the display on the relatively small iPhone SE is sharper than that of some larger phones, for instance. So once again, trying before buying is important. 3. Something easy to carry about - simply because smartphones contain so many features, they have to include a big battery and a proper processer. Add in the large screen and a smartphone can quickly become big, and heavy. Again, this is where it is worth trying out a phone before you commit. The smartphone with the big screen may be easy to look at, but if it is too heavy to carry about it isn't going to much use. Around 150g is about as light as you can expect to go with a smartphone. Such phones as the Doro 8030 and the Microsoft Lumia 650 fit this criteria, and they are happily amongst the cheapest out there. But you'll lose out in other areas, such as screen sharpness and features - so once again, work out what is most important to you and try before you buy. Here are a few handset recommendations if you are after an easy to use, no-frills smartphone. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2017 Doro 8030 RRP: £129.99 Buy from Carphone Warehouse Compare: all Doro 8030 deals Some companies have made the mistake of patronising their target market. Thankfully, Doro strikes the right balance, and the 8030 is a phone that gives a helpfully modified Android smartphone experience for those that need a bit of guidance around the operating system. It is very easy to set up, with on-screen prompts and instructions and once you've set up all your existing email accounts and added contacts, it's simple to find your way around to make calls, send texts and even download apps.  Microsoft Lumia 650 RRP: £149.99 Buy from Microsoft Compare: all Microsoft Lumia 650 deals The Windows 10 mobile operating system lends itself well to a simpler smartphone life. The home screen has 'tiles' that display apps, information and emails very clearly - it is debatably easier to use than Android or iOS. It is also, at the time of writing, available directly from Microsoft for just £109.99, which is about as cheap as smartphones get while still being of an acceptable quality. With a decent sized 5in screen and 8Mp camera, it'll allow you to take and view photos to a good quality too. Here's our review of the Microsoft Lumia 650. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) RRP: £169 Compare: all Motorola Moto G4 (2016) deals Like the Doro 8030, the affordable Moto G4 runs Google's Android software. The G4 is the one for you if you think you need less guidance from the phone as to how to make calls, send messages and download apps. Android is fairly simple if you aren't a heavy user, and it shouldn't be too much trouble if you've used a simple smartphone before. It has an easy to view  Here's our review of the Moto G4. iPhone SE RRP: £379 inc VAT (16GB); £429 inc VAT (64GB) Buy from Apple The iPhone SE is the iPhone we recommend if you are keen to join the Apple revolution but are not familiar with using one yet. Be warned that the learning curve is fairly high, but if you feel up to getting used to using the iOS operating system, this managable 4in screen handset is worth it. There are a wealth of apps available if you want them, but the iPhone set-up instructions are very easy to follow, and simple tasks like making calls, sending emails and checking the weather are intuitive to most.  However, if you struggle to read on a small screen, you may find the text on the iPhone SE too small - you can adjust it to display bigger, though. Also be warned that even though it's the cheapest iPhone, prices start at £379. Our sister site Macworld UK has many helpful iPhone how-to guides also. Click here to view them.

For some they do not understand why they need to switch off their phone, while for others it can ruin their whole movie going experience. There are rumours that Apple is set to release another software update this month for the iOS 10.2, and according to prolific Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, the next iOS update will arrive on January 10, and will include a "Theatre Mode" for using your iPhone in the cinema. The patent , which was filed in 2012, explains that the new mode could disable the ringer, switch off notifications for incoming calls and messages, and dim the screen. The mode could be enabled manually, or activated automatically using GPS coordinates and WiFi base station triangulation to determine the location of the iPhone.

"When the user leaves the movie theater, the portable device enables phone communications and/or restores the ringer setting to the setting utilized prior to the device's deactivation. "Hence, a theater owner or operator may feasibly charge additional in the way of ticket price (or offer as a free incentive) the feature of 'no cell phone interruptions' during certain movies."

We round up the best media-streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017. We round up the best media-streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017 By Chris Martin | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments These days you don't need to go to the expense of a smart TV to access services such as Netflix, Amazon or BBC iPlayer. We round up the best media streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017 that let you stream media to smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops. Also see: Best Gadget Deals See also: Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick. There has been an enormous price crash in the market for media-streaming devices in the past year or so. Devices such as the Sky Now TV Box now cost less than a DVD – the disc, not the player. None of the devices on test here costs more than £99, and it’s now almost a no-brainer to connect one of these devices to your living-room TV instead of stumping up extra for a so-called ‘smart TV’. In fact, even if you have a TV with internet connectivity, it's bound to offer an inferior experience - not to mention a deficit in content - compared to the media streamers we've reviewed here. See also: Best Blu-ray players 2017 The content available through each streamer is the most important factor for most people. This is why it's crucial to check that the services you want are available. It's rare for one device to offer everything, but Roku has the biggest range going with hundreds of apps to choose between. The advantages of having a media streamer are manifold. You can stream films or TV shows from services such as Netflix or the BBC iPlayer without having to plug your laptop into the TV or have a noisy PC whirring away – all of these devices are silent in operation and consume very little power. Smartphone and tablet owners can beam content from their phones to the television wirelessly with many of these devices, so if you want to show the family the video you shot earlier that day, or perhaps play a family game using the Scrabble app, you simply press a button on your phone and beam the picture to the big screen so that everyone can see it instantly. See also: Amazon Prime Instant Video vs Netflix. Some of these media streamers can display content stored on other PCs, laptops and NAS drives connected to your home network, letting you enjoy your music collection in the lounge for family parties or share photo slideshows. Apps for online media services such as Spotify, Flickr and YouTube are also common now: you install those you want, and ignore those you don't. We’ve got two different types of media streamer on test here. Some are traditional set-top boxes that can work independently of any other device. Prices range from just £9.99 to £99, but there’s a huge discrepancy in features and capabilities from top to bottom, so read the individual reviews to see which best meets your needs. Then we have the Chromecast (of which a new version has recently been launched) and its thinly veiled imitator, the EZCast, which have to be used in conjunction with a smartphone, tablet or PC to serve content to them. These dongle-like devices plug straight into the TV and can be practically hidden from sight. The Roku Streaming Stick and Amazon Fire TV Stick are also dongles but come with remote controls and can work without another device such as a smartphone. Content continues below Gaming is a relatively new addition to media streamers. You can play casual games such as Tetris on Roku and Amazon devices as well as the Google Nexus Player, or opt for the Nvidia Shield TV for something a little more console-esque. You can even buy optional game pads if you're serious about wanting a games console experience. Best media streamers 2017 UK 1. Roku Streaming Stick Rating: Reviewed on: 1 October 14 RRP: £49 inc VAT The Roku Streaming Stick is one of the best media streamers around and worth the extra money compared with the Chromecast if you want more content at your fingertips plus the physical remote control and user interface. Read our Roku Streaming Stick review. 2. Roku 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 17 November 15 RRP: £99 inc VAT The Roku 3 is a premium player with a superior feature set to rivals. The wireless headphones are a boon and the UK content selection is superb, although we experienced lip-sync issues and network media playback is too unreliable. Read our Roku 3 review. 3. Google Chromecast 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 November 15 RRP: £30 inc VAT Owners of the original Chromecast have very little reason to upgrade the new model. Google has improved the design with the Chromecast 2 and added better Wi-Fi. We also like the new app and, in general, the device is a bargain at £30. However, the Roku Streaming Stick outclasses it for less than £10 extra with more content available, a remote control and excellent user interface. Read our Google Chromecast 2 review. 4. Amazon Fire TV Stick Rating: Reviewed on: 23 November 16 RRP: £35 inc VAT Thanks to its powerful internals and nice interface, the Fire TV Stick is a great gadget for watching Prime Instant Video, Netflix, and UK catchup TV. The remote may lack a mic, but you can still use voice search in Prime Instant Video using the iOS, Amazon or Android app. We still prefer the Roku for its sheer breadth of content, but if you're a Prime member, this is one of the best ways to watch the Instant Video service. Read our Amazon Fire TV Stick review. 5. Google Chromecast Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 14 RRP: £30 inc VAT A brilliant, low-cost add-on for Android device users in particular, providing a blissfully simple way to beam video from your device to the big screen. People who want to stream their own media collection should look elsewhere. The Chromecast is cheap and easy to use, but there aren’t many apps that support it yet. This situation is bound to change over the coming months, but for now you might find your existing smart TV offers more. Read our Google Chromecast review. 6. Apple TV (2014 - PCA) Rating: Reviewed on: 3 October 14 RRP: £79 inc. VAT From a technical point of view, the Apple TV is as slick and neatly designed as you'd expect from Apple. However, its reliance upon iTunes and Netflix is frustrating for users outside the US, and the Apple TV won't live up to its considerable potential until Apple bites the bullet and opens it up to a wider range of online video services. Read our Apple TV (2014 - PCA) review. 7. Sky Now TV Box (2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 10 February 16 RRP: £14.99 inc VAT For under £15 and various value bundles, the second generation Sky Now TV Box is a great budget media streamer. It not only allows contract-free access to a wide range of Sky content but also a number of other apps including BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub. It's just a big shame that Now TV is limited to just 720p. Read our Sky Now TV Box (2015) review. 8. Amazon Fire TV 4K (2015, 2nd generation) Rating: Reviewed on: 14 November 16 RRP: £79.99 inc VAT The Fire TV is an excellent set-top box which is powerful and well designed. The voice search works well too, and Alexa is coming, which will make it far better. The interface is slick and easy to use, even if it can be confusing working out what you can watch on an Amazon Prime subscription. The Fire TV is one of the best video streamers, but it really makes sense if you pair it with a Prime Instant Video subscription and use Amazon's other services. 4K content at no extra cost is a huge bonus but don't forget that many 4K TVs already have the Prime Instant Video app. This means it's going to appeal to people who want 4K Prime Instant Video (or Netflix) but their TV doesn't have it. If that's you, just double-check your TV has an HDMI port which supports HDCP 2.2, otherwise you'll find 4K videos won't play. Read our Amazon Fire TV 4K (2015, 2nd generation) review. 9. Apple TV 2015 (4th-gen) Rating: Reviewed on: 22 March 16 RRP: 32GB: £129 ($149); 64GB: £169 ($199) For some people - mainly those with iOS devices and no 2nd- or 3rd-generation Apple TV - the new box is a great media streamer and games machine. However, there's no escaping the high price and limited selection of apps. And if you're not interested in gaming, you're just as well off buying a 3rd-generation Apple TV or Roku for less than half the price. Competition from other gaming media streamers is stiff, too, with Amazon's £79 Fire TV offering more UK catch-up TV as well as similar gaming performance, expandable storage and support for 4K content. Ultimately, the 4th-gen Apple TV has potential (Apple may even upgrade the software so it supports 4K at some point) but right now that potential is far from realised. Read our Apple TV 2015 (4th-gen) review. 10. Nvidia Shield TV Rating: Reviewed on: 9 January 17 RRP: £149.99 We’re extremely impressed by the Nvidia Shield both as a media streamer and as a games console. The beautiful UI and game-streaming technology is powered by one of the most impressive mobile processors on the market at the moment, and provides an experience akin to playing a PS4 or Xbox One. The native 4K resolution that supports 60fps playback is better than any other offering in the UK at the moment, with the Fire TV only being able to support [email protected] GeForce Now has been coined as the ‘Netflix for gaming’ and although the library may be a bit sparse at the moment, the experience is great – being able to choose from a library and play it instantly is an intriguing experience and gives us a glimpse at the future of on-demand gaming. The only real disappointment comes with the selection of catch-up TV apps, as we could only install BBC iPlayer, leaving those who want to use the likes of All4, Demand5 or ITV Hub without any option. The Shield is so close to being the perfect media streamer but without access to popular apps like those mentioned, it’ll always fall short. Read our Nvidia Shield TV review. 11. Roku 2 (2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 15 July 15 RRP: £69 inc VAT The Roku 2 is yet another decent media streaming box from the market leader and we like the new Roku Search and MyFeed features. However, these are available on the other Rokus and the slightly high price means you'll want to pay the extra for the better remote which comes with the Roku 3 or save money by getting the similar Streaming Stick. Read our Roku 2 (2015) review. 12. Google Nexus Player Rating: Reviewed on: 29 April 15 RRP: £79 inc VAT The Nexus Player is a decent media streamer, but it’s not an unqualified success. It’s only truly good if you’re pairing it with an Android phone or tablet in order to stream a much wider selection of content. However, if you only want to do that, you may as well buy a Chromecast which costs as little as £20 these days. iOS users are better off with an Apple TV. If you want to play games, it’s a pretty much a toss-up between the Fire TV and Nexus Player. Adding the cost of the Bluetooth gamepad, which is a must, the price shoots up to £115, which is dangerously close to previous-generation games consoles. And we haven't even mentioned the Roku 3, which offers a heck of a lot of content for basically the same price. For those in the UK, the Roku 3 and Streaming Stick are hard to beat. Read our Google Nexus Player review. 13. WD TV Live media streamer Rating: Reviewed on: 23 September 14 RRP: £80 inc. VAT The WD TV Live media streamer supports the streaming of many different video and audio formats, is easy to use and it performs well. Read our WD TV Live media streamer review. 14. Sky Now TV Box Rating: Reviewed on: 25 September 14 RRP: £9.99 inc VAT A perfectly capable media streamer, with dedicated remote control, for only £10 may look an indisputable bargain. It's light on features and obviously geared towards Sky's content, but if you want an inexpensive, fuss-free way of watching the occasional football match or TV series, it would be just the ticket providing Sky sorts out its streaming servers. Read our Sky Now TV Box review. 15. EZCast (M2) Rating: Reviewed on: 24 September 14 RRP: £14.95 inc VAT A poor impersonation of the Chromecast, which fails to get many of the basics right. Streaming video is choppy, screen sharing is awkward and there's no third-party app support. Simply not worth the £15 saving on Google's hardware. Read our EZCast (M2) review.

The Winter Fund Drive: Day Fifteen If we all gave $5, this fund drive would end today. We have a lot of things to stress out about here at Chimp Central. Paying our bills shouldn't be one of them. Remember: this web site is not a hobby. It's a full-time job for the people who run it. Without adequate income, we will have to shut down. That's not a threat - it's reality. Can you spare $5? $1? Because no donation is too small, and we really, really need the money. If everyone reading this message donated only $5.00 right now, we could end this fundraiser today. Think about that. And please help if you can. We thank you! Today's tally: $50 from 1 person. TOTAL TALLY: $3,365.64 from 135 people.

How can you miss what never leaves town? Coming out of the season of merry and bright we'll be coming into the full blast of news about "what Trump will do." One thing he's going to do is drastically lower taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Another thing he'll do is declare a "tax holiday" on corporate profit that's (so-called) "held overseas", the (so-called) "unrepatriated" pile of cash that extremely favorable U.S. tax laws allow corporations to delay paying taxes on. To be fair, Clinton would likely have done the same thing — declare her own version of a "tax holiday" — probably in return for private investment in a public-private "infrastructure bank." Will Trump's sweet deal to corporations take the same shape? It's possible. For example, we find this, the possibility of a huge tax giveaway on "offshore profits" to Silicon Valley high-tech companies, via Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF): Trump Tax Plan Would Let Tech Industry Permanently Dodge Hundreds of Billions in U.S. Taxes High-tech corporations hold 29% of all untaxed offshore profits held by U.S. multinationals WASHINGTON, D.C.—President-elect Donald Trump met with CEOs of some of the most profitable corporations in America today [December 14] and likely promised them a massive tax giveaway on their untaxed offshore profits, which would mean American families have to pick up their tab. A spokesman for Trump said one of the topics of his meeting with high-tech executives would be “access to capital,” which likely referred to the huge tax break he plans to offer U.S. multinational corporations to bring home the untaxed profits they are holding offshore. U.S.-based Fortune 500 companies have $2.5 trillion in profits booked offshore [pdf], mostly in tax havens, on which no U.S. taxes have been paid. Researchers calculate that these companies would owe more than $700 billion [pdf] in taxes if they were to pay what they owe. Trump wants to cut the tax rate on profits held offshore from 35% to just 10%. That would cut their tax bill to just $150 billion, losing $550 billion in revenue [pdf] that could be used to fund education, infrastructure, healthcare, veterans’ benefits or other domestic priorities. Trump’s guests today are all members of the technology and information sector. Technology corporations have 29% of all untaxed offshore profits reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Fig. 9). Just 10 corporations hold 40% of the total untaxed offshore profits, five of them attending today’s meeting with Trump: Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Google and Oracle. As The Los Angeles Times reported, many of the executives invited to today’s meeting are “invested in Trump’s plan to enable corporations to move tens of billions of dollars currently sheltered in off-shore accounts back into the United States by slashing the taxes firms would owe on the money. The overhaul of the tax code Trump envisions would give Silicon Valley a financial boost.” ... ATF smells a deal involving the high-tech portion of those trillions in "offshore" profits. So do I. (Note the estimate of the size of Fortune 500 "offshore" profits — $2.5 trillion.) "Money doesn’t stop at borders. Tax accounting does." But there's a "given" in this discussion — an unexamined assumption — that those trillions in corporate "overseas" profit is, in fact, held overseas. Wolf Richter is here to tells us the assumption is false. A great deal of that money, perhaps most or all, is already in the U.S. Richter (my emphasis): Come on Moody’s, Spare Us These Falsehoods: That $1.3 Trillion “Overseas Cash” Is Already in the US Some falsehoods simply refuse to die. No matter how many times they get stabbed in the heart, and no matter who stabs them, they rise again in their full glory. The falsehood that a vast amount of US corporate cash, including much of Apple’s $250 billion, is “locked away overseas” is one of them. We’ve known since May 2013 from the Senate subcommittee investigation and hearings into Apple’s tax-dodge practices that a big part of corporate “overseas cash” is actually invested in the US. Now Moody’s Investor Services repeats the same falsehood and explicitly lobbies Congress to give our poor, multinational Corporate Titans with their hardscrabble businesses another tax break. Here's the quote from Moody's itself: Most of the cash that companies have is generated and being held overseas. Moody’s estimates that the amount of overseas cash will reach about $1.3 trillion, or 74% of total cash, in 2016. That’s up from an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 72% of total cash a year earlier. Note that Moody's estimate of "$1.3 trillion" is considerably less than the AFT estimate of $2.5 trillion, but Moody's may have an interest in keeping its estimates conservative when it comes to companies that most of us would call "tax cheats." Richter is having none of it, the claim that the most of the "overseas" money is actually overseas: But here’s the thing. In May 2013, Apple got into a pickle because it had decided to fund its stock-buy-back and dividend program by taking on a record $17 billion in debt rather than “repatriating” part of its “offshore” cash and paying income taxes on it. The Senate subcommittee investigation and hearings, chaired by Senator John McCain, showed that Apple had sheltered at least $74 billion from US income taxes between 2009 and 2012 by using a “complex web” of offshore mailbox companies. The investigation found untaxed “offshore” profits of $102 billion held by Irish subsidiaries – which Apple refused to “repatriate” in order to keep that income from being taxed in the US. But according to the Senate report, Apple doesn’t have to repatriate that moolah because it’s already in the US. The Irish mailbox subsidiaries, on whose books this money is for tax purposes, transferred it to Apple’s bank accounts in New York. The money is managed by an Apple subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, and is invested in all kinds of assets in the US. Apple’s accountants in Austin, Texas, keep the books[.] Money doesn’t stop at borders. Tax accounting does. There's much more at the link, but you get the gist. A very large amount of that money is already in the U.S., invested in U.S. assets, held in U.S. banks, and is only nominally held by offshore "mailbox" subsidiaries, since those subsidiaries are free to invest it anywhere in the world, including in the U.S. Will declaring a tax repatriation holiday on "offshore profits" create new investments in the U.S.? It would seem that all of these companies, Apple for example, are already invested in the U.S. to whatever extent they want to be. So to answer the question, No. Bottom line — When you hear Trump (or anyone) claim that "bringing the money back home" will mean "new investments" in the U.S., you're being lied to. You're also being treated like a fool, since Trump knows as well or better than anyone on the planet what hiding assets behind "holding companies" and post office addresses actually means. It means you can do anything you want with your money, send it anywhere at any time in almost perfect secrecy. L'il Abner's goin' fishing for Saddam's WMDs. He's been told exactly where they are. He's also going to hunt for some of Apple's "offshore" money. Let's try not to join him (source). These are just flat lies, that all "offshore" profits are really offshore. Believing them is like believing the Bush lies about WMDs in Iraq. Accept those stories if you like, but they'll call you a rube and a bumpkin if you do, then laugh as they dine on frogs' legs before heading to the bank. Just saying. GP _______ Contributing Editor.

They're white, completely wireless earphones. AirPods are almost identical to Apple's wired earphones except that in lieu of thin cables, small white cylinders extend from the AirPods themselves. When you wear them it looks like you laughed and the milk came out your ears. A few of my friends don't get it. "They're just dorky wireless earphones," they say.  And, they're wrong -- not because they don't look dorky, I'll give them that. They're simply incorrect because they're using the wrong frame for the things that now extend like candy cigarettes below my earlobes.  And, to be fair, it's hard not to use the paradigm of earphones when AirPods are used to listen to things, and well, they do go in your ears. But, they're not just earphones. Or, they're earphones the way a smartphone is just a phone, or a smartwatch is just a watch. In reality, the least interesting thing about a smartphone is that it takes calls. The least interesting thing about a smartwatch is that it tells time. The least interesting thing about AirPods is that they play music, though being able to listen to that music privately without a single wire snagging on sleeves, doorknobs and free weights is pretty great. All that said, here's what my friends don't get. With AirPods you get a little ear butler to talk to. When you tap an AirPod twice you hear the familiar double chime of Siri waiting for a command or question. You can then talk to Siri casually, almost sotto voce actually, and get a response.  I was recently making breakfast by myself listening to a jazz playlist. Here are a few things I asked or requested of Siri with my phone face down on a counter: "What's the weather forecast for today?" "Skip this song." "Play music by John Coltrane." "Set a timer for three minutes." "At 10 a.m. today remind me to email Michelle about my column." "Read me my email." You get the idea. Having that DJ, administrative assistant and weather reporter in your head is like listening to the sound of the future.  And that's exactly what my friends don't get. If all you do is consider AirPods earphones, you limit your ability to think expansively about what they could be, and what they presage.  Worse, if devices like AirPods are shunned by people who have never tried them, and so have no real understanding of their power or importance, then those devices are being rejected from willful ignorance or a misframing, not from rational consideration. In short, they are being dismissed out of ear. Given that artificial intelligence and machine learning have just begun to become truly useful, this is dreadfully shortsighted. And, if you treat AirPods with horror not mockery because, "We'll all be like that sorry-assed guy in the movie Her," then you're just imagining a future you fear, not all possible futures. You are picturing HAL and Scarlett Johansson; not Jarvis and KITT.  All of this seems a bit extreme when we're just talking about gadgets that sit in your ears. It is, unless the AirPods are a metaphor. Not everybody has to have, want or afford what looks like white ear snot on either side of their heads. But when a flake of the future appears, in whatever form, it's best to pay attention... not because it looks funny, but because it has shown itself at all.

The Republican-controlled House voted Tuesday night to pass a rule that would allow lawmakers to be fined up to $2,500 for livestreaming or taking pictures on the House floor. Democrats, led by Reps. John Lewis and John Larson, held symbolic protests amid the vote: some used their phones to take photos or held up copies of the Constitution, while others, like Rep. Barbara Lee, covered their mouths with red tape. Democrats staunchly opposed the rule’s adoption, arguing it would curtail transparency and free speech. Despite concerns about the rule’s constitutionality that were expressed by bipartisan legal experts, the measure moved forward as part of a larger rules package that passed, 234-193. (The rule was updated prior to passage to give those who are fined 30 days to appeal the punishment to the House Ethics Committee.) Story Continued Below — Lewis, a civil rights icon who was beaten during a protest march in the 1960s, gave a fiery speech opposing the new rule. “I'm not afraid. I've been fined before,” he said. “... We cannot and will not be silenced.” The Democratic response to the rule suggested that House minority members wouldn’t acquiesce to majority pressures so easily — perhaps foreshadowing a theme that could resurface in future showdowns in the Republican-dominated 115th Congress. A House floor sit-in by the chamber’s Democrats over stalled gun-control legislation last summer prompted the rule change. POLITICO’s Heather Caygle has a roundup, here. FCC MOVES JANUARY MEETING — The FCC moved its monthly meeting to Jan. 31, to give the Trump administration more time to prepare, Margaret reports. The agency’s meeting was scheduled for Jan. 26, less than a week after Inauguration Day. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler plans to resign Jan. 20, and many expect Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai to be named acting chairman. The commission is required to meet monthly. “The new date provides more time to plan the meeting following the change in administration,” FCC spokesman Neil Grace said. TECH TAKE ON NEW SENATE COMMERCE FACES — The Senate Commerce Committee is getting a new crop of members on the Republican side, including Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, Jim Inhofe, Mike Lee, and Todd Young. The incoming committee members all bring unique sets of tech and telecom expertise to the committee. Capito, long a champion of rural broadband, said she will continue to focus on the issue. Inhofe, formerly chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has done extensive work on policy related to aviation and motor vehicle regulation — both areas that are beginning to see increasing crossover with tech. Lee has been chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee and overseen hearings on AT&T/Time Warner and Google. And Young is newly elected to the Senate from the House, where he has served on the Budget, Armed Services and Ways and Means committees.

THUNE INTRODUCES MOBILE NOW (AGAIN) — Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune re-introduced his MOBILE NOW bill to the newly seated 115th Congress on Tuesday, hoping for a better fate for his latest effort to free up spectrum for broadband networks. The bill is similar to the last version that was passed out of the Commerce Committee in the 114th Congress. Thune tried to get the measure through Congress before it adjourned for the holidays, but it got caught up in the drama surrounding the re-nomination of Jessica Rosenworcel to the FCC. “The MOBILE NOW Act is a gateway to faster and more extensive wireless coverage that empowers more Americans to use technologies requiring a connection to the internet,” Thune said in a release. “This legislation is an early technology priority that I expect the Commerce Committee will send to the Senate floor soon.” WHAT’S NEXT FOR APPLE-SAMSUNG — The long-running Apple vs. Samsung patent battle is now back in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It landed there Monday, after last year’s Supreme Court decision punted it back. The federal court now must take another look at the amount of damages Apple should be awarded. Under a previous lower court decision, the amount of money Apple gained from any patent infringements was based off the full profits of a device, rather than the profits derived solely from the aspect of a device covered by a patent. — A press call is set for today, during which a roundtable of legal and tech experts will discuss the case and its implications for startups and innovation. Making the barrier to full-profit awards too low could spur patent trolls and favor market incumbents, says Carl Cecere, a lawyer who filed an amicus brief supporting Samsung on behalf of several groups. “These increased risks will impose new barriers of entry for startups and chill the development of innovative products,” he says. Cecere will moderate today’s panel, which will also feature Engine Advocacy’s Evan Engstrom and Sarah Burstein, chair of the American Bar Association’s Intellectual Property Law Design Committee, among others. SCHUMER SLAMS IDEA OF ‘TWITTER PRESIDENCY’ — In his first address as Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer called out President-elect Donald Trump’s use of Twitter to set policy priorities. “These issues are too important for mere words; our challenges too entrenched for mere tweeting,” he said on the Senate floor on a day when the fate of detainees at Guantanamo Bay became the latest sensitive matter of policy to become the subject of a Trump tweet. “Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.” Schumer, whose official Senate Twitter account counts just short of 200,000 followers compared with Trump’s 18.5 million, added that he thinks Twitter is an effective channel for reaching the American people but finds it alarming that Trump uses the platform to influence foreign policy. “America doesn’t conduct foreign policy by tweet, least of all by flattering Putin after our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia interfered in our election,” he said. ZUCK’S ROAD TRIP RESOLUTION — Following his 2016 goal to build an in-home AI assistant named Jarvis, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s 2017 resolution involves getting out more. In a Facebook post (natch) Tuesday afternoon, Zuckerberg shared plans to visit and meet people in every U.S. state by the end of the year — indicating that means he will have to travel to 30 states in the next 12 months. These travels will involve road trips with his wife Priscilla, pit stops at colleges and universities and visits to communities across the country. “For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. … We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone,” he writes. MT couldn’t help but notice that both the language of the post, and the resolution itself, held similarities to a politician’s campaign tour — an endeavor Zuckerberg has seemingly shown interest in before. THE PRESSURES FACING KAMALA HARRIS — California’s newest senator, Kamala Harris, arrived in Washington for her swearing in on Tuesday facing a mountain of expectations for her to take on future leadership roles within both Congress and the Democratic Party, POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci reports. She’s already being speculated about as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. As California’s attorney general, Harris handled a series of high-profile tech cases, most recently pressing Uber’s self-driving cars to gain permits before they could be tested on San Francisco streets. She also hit escort website Backpage with charges of money laundering, launched a cyber crime initiative in California and built a team within her office that addressed online privacy. Though she has been hard on the industry at times, Harris also has the potential to be a tech ally given her background in these policy areas, which carries with it its own expectations. Many tech leaders have funded her previous campaigns, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and Napster co-founder Sean Parker. TRADE GROUPS PRESS CONGRESS ON SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION — Congress can help protect small broadband providers from incurring a financial burden from enhanced transparency rules, the Competitive Carriers Association, Wireless Internet Service Providers Association and NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association said in a letter. Addressed to Sens. Steve Daines and Joe Manchin and Reps. Greg Walden and Dave Loebsack, the letter describes how the FCC had established a temporary exemption for small providers that expired in December and may not be renewed by Jan. 17, when the enhanced transparency rules go into place. “Because agency action can be protracted, as evidenced by the fact the FCC allowed the exemption to expire despite seemingly unanimous support for a further extension, our members seek greater certainty,” they write. “We therefore urge Congress to consider resolving this issue immediately to prevent irreversible economic harm to hundreds of small broadband providers.” ITIF SAYS TRUMP’S INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE TECH — The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation says in a report out Tuesday that Trump should look to innovation infrastructure via areas like science and engineering research to help fuel long-term growth even more than investment in traditional infrastructure, like projects built of concrete and steel. The think tank notes support for I.T. advances and updated operating systems could also have a sustainable impact on the economy as well. TRANSITIONS — Mozilla has hired Ashley Boyd as its new vice president of advocacy; she’ll lead Mozilla's campaigns on net neutrality, copyright reform and mass surveillance reform. … Former Facebook and Change.org communications manager Max Burns is leaving Washington to join the New York office of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, per POLITICO Influence. … Michelle De Mooy has been promoted to the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Privacy & Data Project. QUICK DOWNLOADS Ross highlights tech and intellectual property as key Commerce challenges: In his questionnaire submitted to the Senate Commerce Committee, Wilbur Ross, Trump’s nominee for Commerce secretary, said that “integrating technology into the department to improve efficiency” and “improving the protection of intellectual property created in this country” are among the top three challenges the department faces. Qualcomm reportedly contributes to Softbank’s $100 billion goal: The chip maker is investing in the telecom conglomerate’s fund, $50 billion of which is expected to be invested in the U.S. to create new jobs, The Wall Street Journal reports. NCTA joins trade groups filing for reconsideration of FCC’s broadband privacy rules: USTelecom, the Competitive Carriers Association and ITTA had also filed such petitions on Tuesday, which ask the agency to rethink its new privacy regulations for broadband providers. Tesla falls short of 80,000 car goal in 2016: The company said production snafus related to the latest version of autopilot prevented it from delivering 80,000 vehicles 2016, as its guidance had indicated, Recode reports. Apple sued over missing feature to deter FaceTime while driving: A couple whose five-year-old daughter was killed by a driver using FaceTime has filed a suit against the tech company for neglecting to implement a safety feature on the service that would deter use while driving, The Guardian reports.

Technology CES: Apple, Google Car Apps Get Pushback From Ford, Toyota Ford (that's a Ford Focus above) and Toyota aren't about to concede the auto app game to Apple and Google. (EPA/Newscom) REINHARDT KRAUSE 1/04/2017 Reprints Apple's (AAPL) CarPlay and Google's Android Auto are facing a push back from automakers led by Ford Motor Co. (F) and Toyota Motor (TM). Ford and Toyota on Wednesday said four medium-sized automakers — Mazda Motor, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki Motor Corp. — have joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium, which aims to develop an open-source software platform that app developers can use as an alternative to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto. Apple and Google have revved up efforts to integrate their smartphone technologies with auto communications systems. Apple's CarPlay technology is built around its iOS software. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google unveiled an "autocentric" variant of Android N at its Google I/O developer's conference in May. General Motors (GM) and Harman (HAR) have announced plans to build Android-based infotainment systems for GM vehicles. IBD's TAKE: Apple stock has formed a cup pattern with a technical buy point of 118.79. Learn more on Apple at IBD Stock Checkup. Toyota plans to launch a new infotainment system that integrates SDL in 2018, Bloomberg reported. QNX Software Systems, a subsidiary of BlackBerry (BBRY), has also pushed into Web-connected infotainment and telematics systems, along with AT&T (T). Ford and Toyota announced the new consortium members at the CES consumer electronics show, which is going on all week in Las Vegas. Ford stock hit a five-month high, rising 4.6% to 13.17 in the stock market today, helped by solid December U.S. sales. Toyota stock rose 2.2%. Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which have teamed on autonomous-driving technology, on Tuesday said they would expand their relationship to create an in-car infotainment system using Google's software. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) on Tuesday said it will buy a 15% stake in Here, a developer of digital mapping technology for self-driving cars, deepening its ties to German automakers as well as to auto tech firm Mobileye (MBLY). Here's owners include BMW, Daimler (DDAIF) and Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi. Autonomous vehicles and next-generation auto technology again are again taking the spotlight at CES along with the Internet of Things — web-connected consumer and industrial devices. On Wednesday, Mobileye, Intel and BMW announced that they will roll out autonomous vehicles for testing in the second half of 2017 as part of their plan to sell self-driving cars to consumers in a few years.

Apple always release products the day after a major press conference and history tells us that next week will see a scramble to be the first to get an iPhone 5. But how can you increase your chances of getting an iPhone 5 on launch day? Register your interest Scan all network websites from Vodafone to Three to O2 and Orange and see if they have an option to sign up for email alerts, or deals for existing customers. Vodafone Australia launched a teaser campaign last week which urged people to sign up for details as they break. Take the day off work As ever, most launch day iPhone 5 purchases will be made in store, so it’s time to get a coffee and get to your local retailer as early as possible on launch day. Check stock Smaller stores have less stock so if you’re heading out on launch day, ensure you pick wisely. If in doubt, ring up the day before and ask how many iPhone 5 units your local shop will have to sell. There’s no point getting in line if they only have five handsets…. Tag team If you have a friend or family member that can queue outside another store, ask them to do exactly that and double your chances. Visit the Apple store in Covent Garden It’s the biggest store in the country and we’re betting that’s where most of the iPhone 5 handsets are heading on launch day. Along with most customers with tents and camping gear… eBay It’s inevitable that some of the first available iPhone 5 handsets will hit eBay. Our advice: be carefeul, check the seller’s history and do any exchange in person and pay with PayPal. Use your business account Do you have a business account with a network? Put pressure on your network to deliver your iPhone 5 first. Remember, business customers spend more money and are – on paper – more important than first time buyers. Enter a competition Check your local press and websites for iPhone 5 competitions on launch day. As the most desirable gadget of 2011, it’s likely to be the main prize of many competitions from October 5th or even earlier.

We already expect the iPhone maker to release three new handsets this fall, including one model that’ll sport a radical new design and brand new features for the iPhone line. But the leaks keep on rolling out, with the latest one coming from a well-known iPhone insider. Don't Miss: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? Talking to Forbes, Sonny Dickson, who has leaked plenty of iPhone details in the past, revealed two features that are supposedly heading to the 2017 iPhones, and you’re certainly going to like one of them. According to Dickson’s sources, all three 2017 iPhones will support fast charging thanks to a new “Tristar 3, Hydra” chip that will manage the charging port. It’s unclear what kind of fast-charging technology we’re talking about here, or whether it’s compatible with other standards out there. Dickson didn’t mention wireless charging, which is a regularly rumored feature for the iPhone 8 at least. Apple is reportedly moving from metal shells to glass to bring wireless charging to the iPhone. Apple is also rumored to be working on a revolutionary wireless charging technology together with Energous, that will let you charge a phone wirelessly from across the room, though it’s unclear if that tech will be ready for this year’s new iPhones. Dickson also told Forbes that the iPhone 8 is getting an exclusive feature this year: tap-to-wake functionality. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will not get it. Dickson doesn’t explain why, but if you’re familiar with Apple’s products, then you already know the Apple Watch has this tap-to-wake feature. It’s also the only Apple mobile device that’s fitted with an OLED screen. OLED screens conserve power while in use because only the pixels that display colors other than black need to be powered up. That would make tap-to-wake a feature that would be more battery efficient on a device with an OLED screen than on LCD devices. This is just speculation at this point, however. On the other hand, Apple recently introduced a raise-to-wake feature on the iPhone, which is also available on the Apple Watch. Once enabled, it lets you view the contents of the lock screen by simply raising the iPhone. You might not be able to wake the phone by tapping the screen, but you can still quickly glance at notifications just by picking it up.

 The Apple Watch Series 3 is rumoured to launch in autumn this year Hannah Roberts Jan. 4, 2017, 8:56 AM 4,452 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty Images News Apple is rumoured to be launching its next-generation smartwatch — the Apple Watch Series 3 — in the autumn of 2017, according to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report seen by DigiTimes. The report says that the watch will be manufactured by Taiwan-based Quanta Computer and the company's main task will be improving battery efficiency. It sounds like apart from that, the device won't have any radical changes — for the second year in a row. "Its other hardware will not see much change," the report said, according to Digitimes. Digitime's report also said that "Quanta declined to comment on what it called market speculation" (it's not clear whether Quanta declined to comment to Digitimes or to the Economic Daily News, which first reported the rumour). It's worth noting that Digitimes has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple rumours and predictions. But if the report is accurate, an autumn release would make it around a year since the release of the Series 2 in September 2016. It suggests Apple is settling on an annual release cycle for the wearable device, similar to the one it employs for the iPhone. That would be an indicator of a degree of commitment towards the product — given there was an almost 18-month gap between the release of the first and second Watch Series. (The timing would also coincide with the expected launch of the eagerly anticipated iPhone 8.) But this commitment is questionable at a time when estimates of people using wearable technology have been significantly revised down. eMarketer thinks the market grew 24.7% in 2015, versus its previous prediction of 60%. This has weighed on Google's ambitious smartwatch vision, which is failing to materialise as some analysts estimate that Android Wear sales plummeted 40% year-on-year in Q3 2016. And last month, The Verge reported that Android Wear partner Lenovo-owned Moto is pausing its smartwatch efforts "indefinitely." Although neither Google nor Apple provide a breakdown of smartwatch sales, analysts estimate that Apple accounts for nearly 50% of all smartwatch sales.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Domestic manufacturing and the related jobs was one of the pillars of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. Following his victory nearly two months ago, the pressure is now on to deliver to his voters and supporters, even if most of the reasons why U.S. manufacturing has declined are out of his control. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is, and has always been, an easy political target, given its sheer size and the fact that it's common knowledge that iPhones are assembled in China. Trump has vaguely offered Apple incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back, and while Apple and Foxconn are considering the idea, there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. If anything, the company would likely rather kill U.S. manufacturing if it could, including its last vestige of domestic assembly, the Mac Pro. A couple of recent reports further underscore why Apple would be unable to bring iPhone production stateside, at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures (like the Mac Pro was, which is already a financial and operational headache for the company). We built this city on rock and roll (and incentives) Trump may tout that he's the most tremendous dealmaker in the observable universe, but The New York Times published a must-read investigative report detailing how China wooed Foxconn -- and by proxy, Apple -- with incentives worth billions of dollars. The local government in Zhengzhou offers a wide range of ongoing incentives that support Foxconn's iPhone manufacturing facility in the city that churns out half a million iPhones daily, earning Zhengzhou the nickname of "iPhone City." Approximately half of all iPhones are made in the city. The details were discovered through confidential government records that the Times got a hold of. Apple says it knows that the government provides some level of support, but says it doesn't know the specifics surrounding the incentives that Foxconn has scored. Here's a key sentence in the report that might rain on Trump's parade: "As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else." Who's coming with me? A separate report from qq (via DIGITIMES) points out that even if Apple and Foxconn wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S. in any non-trivial sense, many of the suppliers and component manufacturers would not be willing to follow suit. It's well known that the global consumer electronics supply chain is heavily concentrated in Asia, with manufacturing and assembly being but part of the value chain. © Provided by Fool Aapl Supplier Map For these smaller companies, the prospect of expanding in the U.S. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs, operating costs, and regulatory costs given the U.S.'s more stringent environmental regulations. There are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool, with Chinese workers typically being younger than their U.S. counterparts. One of the key benefits of assembling in China is the close proximity to suppliers, which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. It also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. So don't expect Apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. Sorry, Trump.

Take, for example, our embrace of electronic devices as our closest companions and most trusted confidantes. To law enforcement officers and agencies, that makes them valuable sources of evidence. 2016 opened with a high-profile device-related dispute between Apple and the FBI; it closed with one pitting Amazon against a local police department. And though the stakes were far higher in the Apple case, when it comes to headline principles, Apple's refusal to cooperate got public policy right; if Amazon sticks to its guns it will get public policy wrong. In Apple's case, the stakes were particularly high. The FBI believed that an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook—one of the radical Islamic terrorists responsible for the San Bernadino massacre—might reveal useful information about other terrorists planning additional attacks. Unfortunately, Farook—like most people—had password protected his iPhone. Because Apple had equipped all iPhones with a privacy-protecting algorithm that wiped their memories clean if too many incorrect passwords were entered, any FBI attempt to secure Farook's data posed a risk of destroying it, instead. So the FBI tried to force Apple to develop a new "backdoor" technology to make the data accessible. Apple refused. show chapters Hot tech trends for 2017    Thursday, 29 Dec 2016 | 6:49 AM ET | 02:53 The matter implicating Amazon's Echo is prosaic, by comparison. While investigating a homicide committed in a private home in Bentonville, Arkansas, the police noticed that the homeowner—and prime suspect—was something of an electronics junkie. Among his devices was an Amazon Echo, an "always listening" device that, when triggered, records ambient sound and stores the recording on Amazon's cloud. The police thought that selected recordings might help fill some gaps in their investigation. Amazon refused to hand them over. The information available about the Bentonville case suggests two distinct problems. The police request may be overbroad, in which case Amazon is fully justified in refusing to comply until it is narrowed. But Amazon is also reportedly standing on principle, claiming that the privacy rights of Echo users would justify its refusal to comply even with an appropriately tailored warrant. The difference in the principles at stake explains why Apple was right in refusing to help the FBI save lives from a potential, imminent terrorist attack, while Amazon's refusal to help clear an isolated crime whose victim is already dead is a mistake. "The difference in the principles at stake explains why Apple was right in refusing to help the FBI save lives from a potential, imminent terrorist attack, while Amazon's refusal to help clear an isolated crime whose victim is already dead is a mistake." The FBI attempted to seize control of a team of Apple's engineers—the tech-sector's dominant "mode of production." Their motivation was sound—preventing further terror attacks on Americans—but their demand was unreasonable. American capitalism respects and protects private ownership of the modes of production. Commandeering an Apple engineering team is no different from seizing a manufacturing plant—not because the owner did anything wrong, but rather to serve some purpose deemed critical to the national interest. The schools of economic organization under which such seizures are acceptable—even encouraged—are not approaches that we should want to adopt. There have been countries that maintained the illusion of private ownership of productive assets, but in reality only let private parties operate those facilities for the benefit of "the nation." When their governments decided that "the nation" needed to divert their use, the collective good compelled their diversion, and the private "owners" were required to comply. The technical name for such an organization of a nation's industry is national socialism; it helped Mussolini get the trains to run on time and it allowed Hitler to rescue the basket case of an economy he inherited from the Weimar Republic. History has shown, however, that is also has a terrible dark side. When the government is empowered to commandeer and redirect private resources in the name of the common good, freedom and human rights suffer greatly. As unobjectionable—and even laudable—as the FBI's request may have been, it is inconsistent with the cause of freedom. The Bentonville police, on the other hand, are simply asking Amazon to turn over data already in Amazon's possession. Amazon's refusal rests upon its desire to protect its customer's privacy—both as a matter of principle and as a matter of sound business practice. Requests of this sort are hardly unusual. They arise, for example, whenever the police ask a bank to open a safety deposit box. Obviously, it infringes the holder's privacy rights—but were the police never allowed to open these boxes, they would soon overflow with physical evidence of significant crimes. American courts have considerable experience balancing these concerns on a case-by-case basis. If the Bentonville courts decide that disclosure is warranted here, Amazon should comply. The conflict between technology and law is likely to be a defining feature of the twenty-first century. If we are to remain a free society, we must apply the right principles to the resolution of all such conflicts.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. A couple of weeks ago, President-elect Donald Trump summoned the leaders of top tech companies to his New York skyscraper for a meeting. He showered them with praise. “There’s nobody like you in the world,” he said in the public portion of the session, adding, “we’re going to be there for you.” But, during his long campaign, he wasn’t always so friendly or supportive of the tech industry, many of whose executives privately or publicly opposed him. He threatened specific tech companies; called for huge tariffs on China, where many tech products and components are made; strongly sided with the FBI on forcing the decryption of smartphones; and has appointed people to his transition team who have opposed net neutrality. He also suggested “closing up” parts of the internet so ISIS can’t use it. More recently, he has seemed to play down the threat of cyberwarfare, declared that no computer can be made safe, and that the best way to securely communicate is by courier. In general, while Trump has been a master of Twitter, he has shown an aversion to, and ignorance of, technology itself. And he has made comments that put him at odds with at least some of the views and practices of the major tech companies. It’s difficult to know how many of these statements and positions, many of them unscripted and off-the-cuff, will be translated into policy, or make it into law, even with a Republican Congress. But it’s clear that both tech executives and tech consumers will need to be focused on Washington to an unusual degree in 2017, regardless of their politics or their views on particular issues. So, as we start the new year, here’s a rundown of stuff the president-elect has said about tech, at least in public. Computers have complicated our lives Just last week, Trump told reporters: "I think the computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole, you know, age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. We have speed and we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the kind of security you need.” He has also said: "I'll tell you what: no computer is safe.” On more than one occasion, he has boasted that his 10-year-old son is a wizard with computers, implying that they are easy to manipulate by the young, and therefore untrustworthy. But millions of seniors are far more comfortable with technology than Trump seems to be. He certainly has a point about security. No computer or smartphone can ever be considered 100 percent “safe.” We’re all engaged in a perpetual battle with criminals and hostile governments trying to use computers and the internet to steal information and identities. But Trump often seems simply suspicious or hostile to technology and his overall tone about computers is sure to rattle an industry based on its benefits. Nobody expects the president to be a nerdy tech enthusiast, but it’s jarring to hear the next leader of the US dismiss the invention that underpins America’s most dynamic industry, one where America leads the world. Trade with China, US manufacturing A central theme of Trump’s campaign, of course, was his repeated pledge to return manufacturing jobs to the US from low-wage countries — especially China. He even talked about imposing a huge 45 percent tariff on imports from China in some circumstances. While this could have vast inflationary consequences throughout the economy, it would be especially hard on the tech industry. Practically every smartphone, tablet, and laptop is fabricated in a Chinese factory, even if they are designed here. Practically every smartphone, tablet, and laptop is fabricated in a Chinese factory Trump told The New York Times he had talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook about building its products in the US. “I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’” It would be theoretically possible to move the manufacturing, or at least final assembly, of such tech products back to the US. But it would be difficult. An entire supply chain, readily available in China, would have to be replicated. Also, to offset the much higher wages here, any new computer factory would likely be heavily automated, vastly reducing the jobs Trump might hope would be created. As The New York Times recently reported, Apple’s US plants were highly automated as far back as the 1980’s, before the company moved most of its production to China. A new factory would likely have even more robots. Still, the industry could be pressured to open a few US plants, possibly as a condition of a low-rate “tax holiday” that would allow it to repatriate foreign cash holdings at low rates. Threats against tech companies Back in February, Trump called on people to “Boycott Apple” when it said it couldn’t unlock iPhones to help law enforcement agencies search them, because doing so would breach encryption. In May, Trump said Amazon had a “huge antitrust problem” and that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was using The Washington Post, which Bezos — not Amazon — owns, to try and defeat him to avoid that problem. He also accused Amazon of avoiding huge amounts of taxes. Both Bezos and Cook have since met with Trump. They had little choice. As Cook later explained: “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree.” But the president-elect hasn’t retracted those threats. Neither company is perfect, of course, but both are shining exemplars of American capitalism, among the most innovative and important companies of the last 50 years. It’s extraordinary that they were singled out as targets by the next president. Privacy and encryption Which brings us to why Trump threatened to boycott Apple. He was publicly furious that the company, which prides itself on encrypting its iPhones in a way that even it can’t defeat, refused to create a modified operating system for the FBI that would do so. Apple argued that complying with a court order obtained by the Bureau would create code that could potentially fall into malicious hands, threatening privacy and security. It also noted that other countries, including repressive regimes, would demand access to the code. To be sure, the Obama administration also quietly backed the FBI, but it never called for a boycott, and the FBI backed down after saying it had found another way to get into the phone. Next time, under a Trump presidency, Apple and other tech companies may find themselves in a much tougher position. Net neutrality This one is much tougher to nail down, because Trump himself has said little about net neutrality. But he has appointed transition advisers who oppose it, and many telecom and tech experts expect his FCC to abolish or weaken it. That could allow deep-pocketed companies to buy faster or better service for their content at the expense of upstart, poorer competitors. It might also clear away any potential federal bar to “zero-rating,” the practice by which cellular carriers make it possible for customers to stream carrier-owned video and audio without counting against the users’ data caps. Trump did oppose the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger — a possible source of more zero-rating — during the campaign. But there have been some reports suggesting that the companies needn’t worry. “Closing up” the internet Last year, while addressing the issue of ISIS recruiting terrorists online, Trump said: "We're losing a lot of people because of the internet.” His solution: “We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people." the status quo between Silicon Valley and Washington is likely to change This remark was mainly treated in tech circles as a joke, another sign of Trump’s lack of knowledge of how the internet works. And I’m certain Bill Gates would lack the time or inclination to try and “close up” the internet. But I’m not sure it’s so funny. After all, other countries have made it very hard to reach certain websites and online services, or have imposed various other kinds of internet censorship. In the name of fighting terrorism, who knows what a hard-line administration might try? Or where it would end? Bottom Line I don‘t know for sure where President-elect Trump will come down on these and other issues important to the future of technology and the internet. I suspect the tech CEOs don’t either. But one thing is clear: the status quo between Silicon Valley and Washington is likely to change under a president who has shown himself to be alarmingly suspicious of, and uninformed about, the digital world.

(Shutterstock.com/Denys Prykhodov ) After years of trading physical dollars for digital dimes, the music industry is finally seeing a payoff. Subscriptions to streaming music services jumped about 50 percent in 2016, topping 92 million. For the first time since the heyday of CDs, revenue for the largest record labels is consistently rising. But things don’t look as bright for the streaming companies driving this revival. Spotify, the biggest platform, has swallowed huge losses while paying about 70 percent of its revenue to record labels and publishers. It’s attempting to renegotiate those deals before a planned initial public offering this year. Pandora, which has consistently lost money throughout its 15 years, is trying its hand at a pricier subscription model based on technology from Rdio, another struggling service it bought in 2015. Streaming services Rhapsody and Deezer face similar problems, and internet radio company IHeartRadio is trying to stave off bankruptcy. Services from Apple, Amazon.com, and Google are used largely to lure people to the companies’ other businesses. “It is virtually impossible to run a streaming-music service as a profitable business,” says Mark Mulligan, a former dance club DJ who’s the founder of industry analyst Midia Research. “The model is still broken.” (Read also: Indonesian music market has high potential: Yonder Music CEO) No company exemplifies the travails of digital music services better than SoundCloud. Founded in 2007, the Berlin company has attracted about 175 million users with 135 million tracks of easy-to-share remixes, podcasts, and user-generated content. SoundCloud is beloved among artists and fans, and a darling of the European startup scene. It’s also facing an uncertain future. User growth has stalled, ad sales haven’t taken off, and adoption of its nine-month-old paid service, SoundCloud Go, has been weak. (Mulligan estimates fewer than 250,000 people have signed up. The company wouldn’t say.) SoundCloud’s negotiations to sell to Spotify fell apart in recent weeks because the two sides couldn’t agree on a price, says a person familiar with the discussions. Some of the most loyal SoundCloud fans are migrating to similar services, such as Mixcloud. And some prominent DJs have worked out deals to post mixes legally on Spotify and Apple Music. If SoundCloud can’t come up with a sustainable business model, it will have to find another buyer or raise more money, likely at a lower valuation than the $700 million it negotiated when Twitter invested last year. “They are in big trouble,” says Matt Pincus, chief executive officer of Songs Music Publishing, which represents artists including the Weeknd and Lorde. (Read also: Asia’s digital music market flourishes) SoundCloud CEO Alexander Ljung declined to discuss the Spotify talks or the company’s finances beyond saying that subscription and ad revenue are growing. He says his company has a distinct advantage over Spotify and Apple Music because it’s the only service to combine a library of mainstream songs with a massive catalog of tracks created by and for young tastemakers. “There are very few music platforms at this tremendous scale,” Ljung says. “We are one of them.” SoundCloud board member Fred Wilson, an early investor, says digital music has reached an inflection point and most consumers are ready to transition from owning music to streaming it online. Even if record labels continue gobbling the bulk of the revenue, “the platforms that get all the way through to the finish line are going to have great businesses,” Wilson says, citing Amazon and Netflix as examples in other fields. Streaming services can offer artists bigger royalties than their label deals. Major labels get about 1/20 of a cent each time a song is streamed, and the artists get about 15 percent of that, Mulligan says. Last year, singer Frank Ocean dealt directly with Apple Music to release his album Blonde, cutting out Universal Music Group. “That’s very much a sign of what’s coming,” says Stephen White, CEO of music-licensing marketplace Dubset. It remains unclear whether SoundCloud will be able to enjoy the benefits of having pioneered this kind of shift in distribution. In 2014, before Apple Music existed, SoundCloud was preparing to take the fight to Spotify’s $10-a-month paid subscription, developing a $4 monthly service to pair its user-generated content with a library of new releases and pop, according to a former manager involved in the effort. (Read also: Spotify's musical map reveals cities' most popular songs) This bid to become a cheaper Spotify was a bet-the-company moment, the former manager says, and the subscription service’s developers circulated a beta version among employees while waiting for the record labels to buy in. In negotiations with music labels, SoundCloud even began purging user-generated mixes that ran afoul of copyright and sidelining search features to make pirated tracks harder to find. None of it worked. Two of the largest labels, Universal Music Group and Sony Music, withheld support for almost two years. By March, when SoundCloud Go was finally released, it cost $10 a month, not $4, and its library of about 15 million professional tracks was about half the size of Spotify’s and Apple Music’s. By then, several former employees say, they had grown frustrated and left. Wilson, the board member, says SoundCloud doesn’t get enough credit. It’s the first company since YouTube to expand from a platform of user-generated content to become a licensed service. “We had to buckle down and work very hard to overcome a tremendous amount of challenges to get through that,” he says. “I see the company as coming out of a very challenging time, not going into a challenging time.” With rights deals so expensive, it’s tough for even many of the top streaming companies to experiment with business models that might prove sustainable. “The global streaming market is a two-horse race,” says Mulligan. He’s betting on Spotify and Apple. The bottom line: SoundCloud hasn’t been able to transform 175 million users into profit, and its efforts to sell to Spotify have fallen apart.

Apple and Google are drooling over the ever-growing importance of technology in our cars, and if there ever were two companies who know a thing or two about mobile devices, then these are definitely it. Up until now, the two have limited themselves to things such as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto - mere ways of turning the vehicle's display into an extension of the smartphone, with all the computing done inside the handheld device. At this year's CES show, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Google are introducing a Uconnect system concept powered by Android, Google's open-source smartphone operating system. It may not be the first time the Android gets converted into a car infotainment OS, but this time it's done under Google's own personal supervision. Just like it does now with smartphone developers, Google would like to sell its OS to carmakers in the future. On the other hand, car brands would have to invest incredible sums of money and effort to catch up with Google, so working together would make sense for both parties. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” says Chris Barman, Head of Electrical Engineering, FCA. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way,” said Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google. “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” The pioneering software runs on an 8.4-inch Uconnect system inside a Chrysler 300 sedan and can be seen between January 5 and 8 at the CES, in Las Vegas.

Ford and Toyota said that Mazda Motor Corp, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium. The non-profit group’s goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming, Ford and Toyota said in a joint statement on Wednesday. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the No. 2 US automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple. “Encouraging innovation is at the centre of Ford’s decision,’’ said Doug VanDagens, global director of Ford Connected Vehicles and Services. Suppliers Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, Luxoft Holding Inc, and Xevo Inc also joined the consortium, according to the statement. Honda Motor Co. had contemplated the move but wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s announcement. Carmakers, auto industry suppliers and technology companies such as cloud computing specialists are forming a range of partnerships to develop autonomous cars and vehicles that can communicate over the internet. On Wednesday, Peugeot-maker PSA, communications-equipment manufacturer Ericsson AB and French phone company Orange SA said they’ve agreed to try using 5G wireless technology to improve self-driving features and road safety. Updating internet access is crucial in helping autonomous cars gather and exchange information about street conditions and traffic. 2011 deal Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. Ford’s version of the SmartDeviceLink technology is already available on 5 million vehicles globally, and provides drivers with popular apps like Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather. By enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data, according to the statement. “We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers who share our view,” said Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company.

Then buy this $99 gadget By Patrick O'Rourke Jan 4, 2017 8:35 AM EST 27 comments Apple says it has no plans to add touchscreen functionality to its core Mac line, despite the company’s major competitors on the Windows side of the personal computer industry implementing the technology in devices years ago. Whether the stance is correct or not remains unclear, but Apple believes there is a clear division between its touchscreen devices that utilize iOS and its Mac line. In fact, Microsoft’s Windows 10 has been built from the ground up with touchscreen technology in mind, with devices like the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 proving that swiping your computer screen is a viable and intuitive way of controlling your laptop. Those eager to move beyond the new USB-C MacBook’s somewhat limited Touch Bar, can now purchase AirBar, a new, relatively affordable $99 (about $133 CAD) accessory that enabled touchscreen-like functionality on Mac devices. The device emits an invisible light field that allows standard screens receive in put from hand gestures, though it’s unclear if the user actually needs to be touching the laptop’s screen. According to the company, AirBar plugs directly into the laptop via USB and transmits gestures via software commands. Gestures include swiping between windows and pinching and zooming. Neonode, the makers of the AirBar, previously released a version of its touchscreen designed for 15.6-inch Windows devices. Now, the company behind the product is releasing a version of the device that’s compatible with the 13-inch MacBook Air, with shipping set for March.

People don’t actually need to touch the screen. Unorthodox All what Apple wants is you buying more of their products. So instead of “hm, if I bought the touchscreen PC why do I need a tablet”, you’re thinking “Awesome! I have a great PC, and when I need a touchscreen I will also have an iPad!” Mike Apple has enough cash/assets to burn through over 100 years.. Unorthodox I actually want this for my old 27″ display. Homer J. Simpson I used to go “pfft touch screen laptops, so stupid” until I got one myself and have been using ever since. However, 27 inch monitor with touch is a lot of arm work…. I mean, I could be wrong again until I try one myself but… 27 inch sounds tiring. ciderrules Stupid idea. The Surface is useless as a tablet because most software is not optimized for touch. There’s no MacOS software optimized for touch either so this product is a complete failure. Homer J. Simpson Touch on Windows is not meant for dev work, scientific work, any work that requires a significant amount of typing, etc. Touch is meant for browsing web pages, reading ebooks, playing music, playing touch enabled games, etc. The Surface or any touch laptop is meant so that you can do both that and use the device as a regular mouse/keyboard computer whenever you want and however you want. You seem to think that the Surface is meant to make all software touch-enabled and that you should be able to do everything on it. That’s not what it is. Do I want to be coding a Mobile WebApp using touch? No. Do I want to test the Mobile WebApp I built using touch? Yes. Do I want to be typing up a scientific journal using touch? No. Do I want to be reading scientific journals using touch? Yes. It’s simple logic. One you seem to not have. Get that into your tiny pea-sized brain and get the Apple butt plug out of your butt. So now tell me, what are some of these “most software” that’s not meant for touch? If you list out anything that’s not meant as consuming but more for productivity, you need to shove your iPad up your butt. ciderrules Ahhh, did I upset the troll? Nice apology for the fact that touch is USELESS on any Surface. And yes, I’ve used it. I actually bought a SP4 i7 to try out (MS has a very generous return policy so it’s no risk). My daughter tried Toon Boom on it (her primary animation package). We thought the stylus and using in tablet mode would be useful, but it was garbage. She’s faster using a Wacom on her MBP (which runs circles around the Surface for performance considering MS doesn’t use the quad core i7 like Apple does). So tell me, light bulb, is the stylus an accessory only used for consumption? Because MS promotes it as a productivity tool for creatives. It’s garbage without software support. Homer J. Simpson Oh noes, it’s the Toon Boom argument again. You never actually say why it’s garbage every time you say this. You just say it’s garbage? That’s like saying Tesla is garbage, my Honda Civic is better and it runs circles around the Tesla. Seriously, do you even logic? Oh, and also, did Microsoft build Toon Boom? You’re using one sh*tty software dev as your reasoning for not using a device? Lastly, explain what the word “troll” means. And explain how I’m a troll for explaining to you what a Surface is designed for. ciderrules Toon Boom is a sh*tty developer? Do you have any clue what this company produces and who uses it? Showing your ignorance. A Wacom tablet/stylus along with a keyboard for shortcuts is much faster and far more productive than a Surface with a stylus/touch. Something you seem to not want to talk about since MS promotes this as a way to be productive (not consumption). You want to try and separate touch and stylus when we’re really talking about the device as a “tablet” regardless of what input method you use. And the Surface is useless as a tablet. Simply because developers are too lazy to have the layout of their applications change when you’re in tablet mode, instead relying on Windows to handle it for them. So touch “works” but it’s far from “optimized”. Sort of like how Android tablet Apps are mostly garbage because devs don’t bother to take advantage of the larger screen and rely on Android to perform the scaling for them. You are a troll based on previous conversations I’ve had with you. I have no reason to believe you’ve changed so I’ll continue to call a spade a spade. But again, it’s kinda hard to prove since you’re afraid to let people read your post history and keep it private. Why is that, I wonder? Homer J. Simpson Okay let’s break this all down for a second on just how f*cked up you are. You said trying to use stylus on Surface tablet for Toon Boom is horrible (which you’ve still yet to explain how it’s horrible). But let’s assume it is horrible, is that Toon Boom’s fault or Surface’s stylus’ fault? Because Surface stylus works great on note taking apps, midi sequencing apps, and a whole slew of other drawing software. Works fantastic with ArtRage Pro. Yet somehow that’s the fault of Surface when the stylus doesn’t work well with Toon Boom. How is this not a logic fail there? Oh, and you still haven’t explained how it’s not as good as a Wacom tablet. Why? Because you’re full of sh*t. A stylus is an accessory to the surface tablet. A touchscreen is not an accessory. You don’t buy a Surface requiring you to use the stylus. If software are not compatible with the stylus, that sounds pretty normal to me because guess what? It’s an accessory. But let’s not forget that we are talking about touchscreens and “touch” where touch means finger touch. Touchscreens do not mean active digitizers will work. “Surface is useless as a tablet.” There it is again. Fruits are not healthy. The sky is not blue. The earth is not round. There is a god. See I can make statements without reasoning to back it up, too! You do realize that many windows apps have desktop modes and touch mode right? Where the UI actually changes depending on what mode you set it to… right? Something tells me you’re full of sh*t when you said you’ve bought a Surface. Oh look the Android scaling argument, let me guess, you’ve just bought an Android tablet just recently and you’ve tried apps and found out they’re still scaled… right? Welcome to 2017. Where many apps already have different UI layouts. It seems you’re still stuck in 2012. Have you tried Twitter on an Android tablet vs on a phone? Have you tried Facebook on an Android tablet vs a phone? Oh gee you must have, you tried all Android phones and tablets and windows devices and everything. You’re Ciderrules, you’ve tried them all! ciderrules So easy to get you riled up. You can’t even talk without swearing. So you cherry pick a few Apps that work good with a stylus on the Surface and try to extrapolate that to claim the experience is good for most Apps. It’s not. I explained why a Wacom is better. Because anyone who works with software will know all the keyboard shortcuts for popular functions. You can draw with the Wacom stylus in your right hand and used keyboard combinations with your left. Avoids the ridiculously slow method of clicking on menu items with your stylus (and having to move the stylus away from what you’re actually doing – drawing). In Toon Boom, Illustrator and others you can set also up macros and assign them to keys to perform more complex actions without having to, again, go through multiple menu selections. And you can select options WHILE you’re drawing. Seriously, have you EVER watched a professional use Photoshop or any other high end graphical software? Just a second while I scan my SP4 receipt for you. Homer J. Simpson Wait, hold up. You cherry picked one application that was poorly designed for stylus and extrapolated that the Surface hardware is useless. What has this world come to when one nay vote trumps the majority of good votes? Also, why can’t you set up keyboard shortcuts for using the stylus? The surface cover is still a keyboard that you can use while using a stylus. Why can’t you use the keyboard cover to use as shortcuts and still draw on the tablet? Doesn’t that sound better than having yet another accessory? If the keyboard shortcuts don’t work with stylus, then that sounds like poor software development work on Toon Boom’s part, no? I’m seriously lost with your backwared logic here. What is to stop you from plugging in a keyboard and using shortcuts while using a stylus and drawing on the screen? ciderrules Did you seriously suggest to use the type cover for keyboard shortcuts? Hey bright boy, how are you supposed to draw with the stylus in one hand, use the keyboard type cover with the other hand and manage to HOLD your Surface tablet steady? The reason Toon Boom doesn’t waste their time on the Surface is for 2 reasons. One is it just doesn’t sell in any quantities for them to consider it. No developer is going to waste time for a tiny market (lower end models are too slow for graphic intensive work and very few people buy the higher end model). The other, and more important reason, is the workflow is inferior to a Wacom + keyboard. People don’t want to go backwards in productivity by constraining their workflow to a Surface. Toon Boom illustrates the problem with the Surface Pro perfectly. The whole mantra of the Surface is a tablet that runs high-end full-blown Windows software (as opposed to iOS or Android which don’t have nearly the amount of professional software that Windows or Mac do). This is a lie as the truly professional software that people would actually use isn’t optimized for it. Who cares if Facebook, Twitter and a few popular Apps work fine on the Surface? The same holds true for Android, where all the top common Apps are great on tablets. When you want to go deeper then the limitations hit you straight in the face. Even Illustrator for Surface has serious flaws in its workflow, especially when switching between the desktop and touch modes and which features are available in which modes. Which makes me laugh when I read reviews of Illustrator on Surface and people say it’s great and I’m thinking “did you use this for more than 5 minutes, or did you use the stylus on the screen in touch mode for 30 seconds and think it’s the coolest thing you ever saw”? Jeff Innis Wait, wait, wait, so all this time we’re talking about your complaint about problems you created yourself? How does a normal person write on a notepad? How does a normal person draw on sketchbook? Are you telling me you are drawing on your Wacom tablet with one hand while the other hand is holding the Wacom tablet steady? It’s not rocket science to put the Surface tablet down on the table and draw on it while your other hand can use the keyboard. Mindblown yet? It’s like you’re complaining about how heavy a car is to push when normal people just drive the car.. At the end of the day, there is no problem with the Stylus on the surface for Toon Boom. You’re just not normal. Again, a Surface is not meant to make full-blown desktop apps touch friendly. It is meant so that you can run full-blown desktop apps when you want ti to behave like a desktop. How is this not comprehensible to you. A Surface is meant for you to read your ebooks on the bus, show presentation to your colleagues, play some light games on the couch. And when you’re back home in your office, you set it on the table, hook up a mouse to it, and you can write those ebooks, code those game apps, and make the presentation. It is meant to allow you to do both what Android/iOS can do, but still giving you the ability to run full DESKTOP software like you would with your desktop in the same device. Nobody is expecting most software to be optimized for touch just because touch is there for you. Homer J. Simpson So you can’t figure out how to draw with a Stylus on the Surface by putting the tablet down on the table so you can use your other hand for the keyboard. And that is your whole premise of why Surface stylus sucks with Toon Boom. Okay, I’m done here. You’re getting a little too desperate to justify yourself. ciderrules See if this works. Guess it does. Don’t forget to add the h plus tt and ps with the colon and double back slash. My receipt when I returned my SP4. Just as I stated, the expensive i7 model, not a bare-bones core m3 model. Also note the student discount since I always said this was for my daughter. And the td card I listed with matching last 4 digits to the receipt. 1drv. ms/i/s!AputRHLwqJEqa34cDcPbq6k_Y-U 1drv. ms/i/s!AputRHLwqJEqbE9pr8MCtq7sugo Unorthodox I’m in absolute support for this argument. Styluses and professional digitazers have NOTHING to do with usability of touchscreen interface. Brad Fortin “Wish your MacBook had a touchscreen?” Nope. That’s an awful idea. fruvous Now that’s courage. MassDeduction Why is adding an additional, and entirely optional, input method a bad idea. On my PC I use keyboard and mouse, and I use the touchscreen. Repositioning and resizing on a map, I use the touchscreen. Highlighting something in Excel is generally faster with a mouse. Ultimately having the choice is best. Eliminating choice in the interest of making the device a millimetre thinner doesn’t excite me. Brad Fortin Before I explain why it’s an awful idea I want you to hold out your arm as if you’re touching the screen. It’s an awful idea for two reasons: The first is that macOS isn’t optimized for touch, it’s optimized for a keyboard and mouse. The same is largely true of Windows, no matter how much Microsoft says otherwise (a 5 pixel by 5 pixel target is optimized for a 1 pixel by 1 pixel mouse pointer, not a 50 pixel by 50 pixel finger). Having a choice between a highly optimized input method (keyboard & mouse) and an almost completely unoptimized input method (touch) isn’t a good choice. The second reason is something known as “Gorilla Arm”, where after holding up your arm for an extended period of time tires out your arm. Having your arms resting on a desk or your lap is fine, and moving your fingers on the keyboard or mouse doesn’t do much to tire out your arm or your hands. A vertical touch screen, though? Much more tiring, sometimes so much so that it feels like your arm is going to fall off. The thickness of the device is irrelevant. Now that you’ve held your arm out for a short while, how does it feel? Probably a lot more tired than if it had remained on a keyboard or mouse. MassDeduction I use a touchscreen PC every day, so I am not in need of your assistance in knowing what that feels like. Your suggestion also doesn’t accurately reflect all use-cases for a touchscreen. For example, holding a PC by the sides of the screen and idly flicking your thumbs to scroll. Or (as I suggested in my reply to you, but which you did not address at all in your response) using the keyboard and mouse for some tasks, and then switching to the touchscreen for other tasks that are simply better suited to it (such as zooming and repositioning on a map). Your example of “Gorilla Arm” presumes constant input is required for all tasks, which isn’t the way things are. When I’m using a computer I’m often reading or reviewing. Your comments about using Windows with a touchscreen also indicate a fundamental misunderstanding. Windows works much better with a touchscreen than you describe, but that doesn’t matter anyway. You don’t have to use Windows just with a touchscreen, as you can also use keyboard and mouse. You can jump back and forth, depending on what’s better for a given task. I’m curious, since you’re expressing strongly held opinions on the subject, have you used a touchscreen PC extensively over a wide variety of use-cases? I have and my experience is vastly different than what you seem to believe it would be like. Brad Fortin Yes, I have 2 touchscreen computers at work (4 if you count a secondary work area). I only really use the touchscreen when I’m showcasing something on the screen and need to scroll, the rest of the time I find that a keyboard and mouse works better (especially when using Microsoft Office, Chrome, or just about any other app that was never designed with touch in mind). demigod79 Interesting idea, but not a replacement for a touch screen. Apple really needs to drag themselves into the modern era. A touchscreen on a laptop is undoubtedly a great innovation and there is no reason not to include it. On my Surface Pro I usually switch between the touchscreen and trackpad/mouse, depending on the task and mood (I’ve gotten so used to it that I’ve often found myself touching the screen on my old non-touch laptop). MacBook users do not know what they’re missing out on, and it’s a shame that Apple refuses to do something that makes their customers’ lives easier.

Attaching to the underside of the 2016 MacBook Pro, and said to exactly match both the footprint and the aluminum finish of the machine itself, the DEC adds 4TB of storage, an SD card slot, a Gigabit Ethernet port and an unspecified number of USB-A ports. One thing really stands out about the DEC … When you look at the render of the device fitted to a MacBook Pro, the combined unit looks almost comically bulky. I saw a tweet yesterday from one wag who said that OWC had reinvented the PowerBook. Yet the reality is that what OWC has reinvented is a machine a little over four years old. The total thickness is, says the company, exactly the same as ‘the 2012 MacBook Pro.’ Now, that comparison is rather naughty, as it refers not to the Retina model Apple launched in 2012, but rather to the last version of the old classic model, with optical drive. But all the same, it does provide an indication of the portability progress Apple has made in the four years since the pre-Retina model was its top-of-the-range MacBook Pro. Apple has effectively sliced off more than half of the base of the classic model to create the sleek new 2016 version. As someone who made the switch directly from a pre-Retina model, it’s what has struck me most: I’m getting a lot more power in something which is so sleek and portable it has made my 11-inch MacBook Air redundant. Anywhere I used to take the Air I’m now taking my Pro. What will be interesting to see is how many of those pro users upset at the loss of what Apple now considers legacy ports will actually buy the DEC. It doesn’t quite give them what they wanted – surprisingly, there’s no battery-pack in the DEC to extend battery-life, and it lacks HDMI – but with SD slot, Ethernet and USB-A ports, it addresses many of the complaints. Of course, we don’t yet know what the DEC costs. With up to 4TB of SSD, it’s certainly not going to be cheap. Just a 4TB SSD on its own puts it well into four figures. Pro users can justifiably complain that adding the cost of a very expensive accessory to an already expensive Mac makes for a total outlay way beyond what they wanted to pay. Let’s say it costs something in the $1500-2000 range – would you be tempted? Or will you instead just lay out a few bucks on a small number of dongles?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple Watch Series 3 to see improvements in battery life, performance, no radical overhauls in the works Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, January 4th, 2017, 05:05 Category: Apple Watch, Hardware, Rumor, Wearables The rumor mill has spoken and the third-gen Apple Watch won’t see a radical revision, but will apparently focus on battery life and performance. The reports surfaced from anonymous contacts along the supply line and were reported by the Economic Daily News. Apple unveiled the second generation of Apple Watch alongside the iPhone 7 in September. Dubbed Series 2, the device features a brighter display, a better processor in the S2 chip, and water resistance, but kept the same design as its predecessor. After testing, it was noted that the battery lasted much longer than the original model, pushing into a third day on a single charge. The report indicates that Apple is putting a good deal of focus on improving the device’s battery life, albeit it’s that that other areas “will not see much change.” Previous rumors pegged Apple Watch Series 3 for using more energy-efficient micro LED screens rather than OLED. The report also says Apple is eying a fall 2017 release for the new watch and will be manufactured by Taiwan-based Quanta, the same company that handled the duties for the first two models. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Industry Technology Apple is the most reputed smartphone brand in India; Samsung ranks second: report Apple is the most reputed smartphone brand in India; Samsung ranks second: report In a study, it has been found that Apple is the most reputed smartphone brand in India. According to a report by BlueBytes, in association with TRA Reseach, it was found that the Apple iPhone is the most reputed smartphone and had the best media appearances in the country. By: FE Online | Published: January 4, 2017 6:23 PM Samsung secured a distant second with scoring 67 percent less than Apple, and the probable reason is the exploding devices. Notably, Micromax was ranked third which is a great news for the Indian smartphone market. (Reuters) In a study, it has been found that Apple is the most reputed smartphone brand in India. According to a report by BlueBytes, in association with TRA Reseach, it was found that the Apple iPhone is the most reputed smartphone and had the best media appearances in the country. Interestingly, despite the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung secured the second spot in the list of most reputed smartphones in India. However, Samsung secured a distant second with scoring 67 percent less than Apple, and the probable reason is the exploding devices. Notably, Micromax was ranked third which is a great news for the Indian smartphone market. The Indian electronics company, however, scored a whopping 94 percent less than Samsung. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi and Finnish manufacturer Nokia secured the next two spots respectively. The India’s Most Reputed Mobile Phone Brands 2017 research by BlueBytes included 72 smartphone brands with manufacturers from 12 countries. The list also featured 29 Indian mobile phone brands. The study also included 15 Chinese brands and 8 brands from the US. The Chinese brands got the most number of spots in the top ten, which included Lenovo, Huawei and Motorola at the 6th, 7th and 8th spot respectively. At the 9th and 10th rank were companies LG and Intex Technologies, respectively. Also read | Flipkart sells Apple iPhone 6 for under Rs 10,000 in a new exchange offer This research on brand reputation was based on media perceptions and consumer perceptions in major English and Hindi print media. This was conducted across 9 cities in the period November 1, 2015, to October 31, 2016. Pooja Kaura, Chief Spokesperson for India’s Most Reputed Brands said in a statement, “Reputation can be seen as a currency that the brand can earn through positive action, communication, or sometimes erode due to lack of the same. Reputation has to be consistently maintained, monitored, and enhanced. In a cluttered space like the mobile phone industry, with diverse brands attempting to capture consumer attention, customers buy and recommend on the basis of reputation, making it the most important influencer of buying decisions.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

This means it is also pretty dangerous, trying to figure out just which particular accessory is worth your time. Well, with Kanex, they have been known to churn out quality accessories over the years, and this time around for CES 2017, things are no different. Kanex has announced the Magnetic Charging Stand and Portable Keychain Battery which will target Apple Watch owners at this year’s edition of CES. Kanex intends to expand their range of GoPower Apple Watch accessories with a couple more additions. These two devices happen to be the GoPower Watch Stand which is a magnetic charging stand, while the other would be the GoPower Watch Mini, which is a portable keychain battery. Not only that, the company will also showcase its recently introduced GoPower Watch, which is first cordless portable charger from the company for the Apple Watch at this year’s CES. All of the Kanex GoPower Apple Watch accessories are Apple MFi Certified, so you should have no worries about them running right out of the box. First of all, the GoPower Watch Stand is a magnetic charging stand, while the GoPower Watch Mini is a portable keychain battery. Each GoPower device will come with similar magnetic inductive charging connector that is used in the Apple Watch, allowing users to leave their other charger at the office, in the car, or packed for traveling. Capable of displaying both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models, it will also come with an additional USB port that is located on the back that will simultaneously charge an iPhone, iPad, or any other device, and yet doing so while looking sleek and minimalist in its styling which will definitely complement the different kinds of Apple devices that it plays nice with. As for the GoPower Watch Mini, this device will charge up an Apple Watch on-the-go and is totally cord free. Being an ultra-portable magnetic charging disc, it will begin to charge at first contact, making it a convenient little backup battery which is there as and when required. Carrying up to 1,000 mAh of power, it has a lightweight battery that is capable of delivering one full extra charge to the Apple Watch. There is also a LED indicator that shows the current battery level and charge status.

We round up the best smartphones including best Android phones and best iPhones - best phone reviews. Also see: Best new phones coming in 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals When we review smartphones we take into account their build quality and design, ease of use, features, performance and value, although the latter isn’t always such a big deal when it comes to a phone you are most likely to buy on a contract. Generally speaking a flagship phone will cost between £500- and £600, or between £40- and £50 per month on a contract. If you are buying SIM-free then you should also check out our best SIM-only deals. Value becomes more important when you consider older-generation phones. For example, we still think the Samsung Galaxy S6 is better than many of the phones in this chart, especially when you consider that it’s now available under £400 SIM-free. However, we move all older-generation smartphones to our best mid-range phones chart, and you’ll now find the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge sitting at the top of this best phones chart. We also have a best budget phones round-up if you're looking to minimise costs. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 Note that we have removed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from our chart due to Samsung's discontinuation of it following battery problems. Best phone 2017: Android vs iOS vs Windows There are multiple mobile phone operating systems, but really only two worth talking about: Android and iOS. Windows phones account for around 1 percent of all phones sold, so it makes more sense to go with Android or an iPhone. If you do have your heart set on Windows, also see our list of the best Windows phones 2017. (Similarly, for purely Android choices see Best Android phones.) The vast majority of phones available run the Android operating system, with Marshmallow the latest version. While Apple’s iOS platform has a much lower market share, developers always release their apps on iOS so it has one of the best app stores you'll find. For more, see Android vs iPhone. Also, for a more in-depth look at each OS see our Android Marshmallow review, iOS 10 review and Windows 10 Mobile review. If you have an Android phone or and iPhone and want to move to the other type of phone, it's fair easy move your contacts and other data from one to the other. See How to move from Android to iPhone and How to move from iPhone to Android. What you can't move is paid-for apps, so keep this in mind if you're considering a change of platform. Content continues below Best phone 2017: Why you should buy an unlocked phone An unlocked phone is one which is not tied to any particular mobile operator, such as Vodafone or EE. Buying unlocked usually means buying the phone outright without a SIM. The most important point is that an unlocked phone is almost always a better deal than buying a phone on contract. The only real exception to this are Apple's iPhones - because of their traditional popularity, operators do often subsidise the cost of buying an iPhone in order to lock you into a lucrative long-term deal. Generally speaking, however, if you can afford the upfront cost of the handset, you will pay less over the life of your phone by buying unlocked.  More importantly, you are not locked in. If you want a new handset at any time, you can buy one without having to up-purchase your way out of a contract, or commit to another two years.  SIM-free vs unlocked One thing to be sure of when purchasing an unlocked or 'SIM-free' phone is that not all SIM-free handsets are unlocked. The excellent Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is a classic example of this. It is SIM-free, but if you want to use it for any network other than Vodafone you have to first use it for a month with a Voda SIM, and then pay £20 to get it unlocked. EE's own branded phones are similar. In both cases it may well still be better to buy network branded phones and go through the pain of getting them unlocked, than to buy on contract. But you should do your research before you take the plunge. We can help with that with our feature: 'How to unlock any phone'. The right SIM One other thing to consider is the size and shape of the SIM required for your phone. Make sure you get a nano-SIM if a nano-SIM is what your phone requires. If you get that wrong it is easily solvable - every network will gladly send over a different-sized SIM. SIM cards tend to come in all three sizes - you simply pop out the one you need. But that's assuming you are getting a new SIM, and if you're looking for a SIM-free phone or unlocked phone you probably already have one. You can buy adaptors that let you fit a Nano-SIM or Micro-SIM in a Micro-SIM or full-size SIM slot for a very small charge. More important is to make sure that if you want 4G you get a 4G-enabled phone and SIM. Best phone 2017: Smartphone material poll 20 best phones 2017 UK: Reviews Every single phone in our top 20 is here because we think it is an excellent device, with which few people will be disappointed. All are plenty fast for general tasks and gaming (see our benchmark results in What's the fastest phone?), have nice screens and decent photography capabilities. However, subtle differences mark them out in a fiercely competitive market. You can read the full, in-depth review of each of the 20 reviews below by clicking on the link. 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. LG G5 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 May 16 RRP: £529 inc VAT Compare: all LG G5 deals The LG G5 is one of the most radical phones to come along in a while and we’re glad the firm has shaken things up with the modular design. The G5 is innovative and interesting with unique features but it’s a shame the design and build feels unfinished in areas. It’s a top-notch device which can hold its own with the best phones in performance and cameras, but it’s LG’s modular design which is the real selling point here. There is bags of potential but the future of this is unclear so it’s hard to be definite right now. The G5 is one of the best phones around but for completely different reasons to the Galaxy S7. Read our LG G5 review. 4. Apple iPhone 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £599 (32GB), £699 (128GB), £799 (256GB)  The iPhone 7 is an evolution of the 6S, so if you were expecting a revolution you’ll probably be slightly disappointed. However, aside from the underwhelming battery life, it is an excellent phone. It’s waterproof, has fantastic cameras and performance, and the new stereo speakers sound great. There’s now 32GB of storage as a minimum, which helps to mitigate the higher prices. If you have an iPhone 6s, it’s hard to justify upgrading (even for some people with a 6) but if you’re out of contract and want a small phone, it’s the best Apple has made yet. Read our Apple iPhone 7 review. 5. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 6. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 7. Google Pixel Rating: Reviewed on: 9 December 16 RRP: £599 inc VAT The Pixel has plenty going for it: it’s small, well built, speedy and has excellent cameras. It also supports Google’s Daydream VR headset and runs the plain version of Android 7 – complete with Google Assistant - and will get timely updates. But it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have a microSD slot or stereo speakers and we’d have preferred a quad-HD screen for VR use at this price. If those downsides don’t bother you, and the OnePlus 3T is too large, then the Pixel is a fine choice and a great Android phone. Read our Google Pixel review. 8. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 19 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB); £819 (128GB); £919 (256GB)   The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone. It’s Apple’s best yet, but it is also Apple’s most expensive yet, with a huge starting price. In some respects, the upgrades seem to justify this, but at the same time some features are arguably only catching up with what the competition has been offering for a while now – water-resistance for one. Taken as a whole, the performance, battery life, camera quality and stereo speakers are all compelling reasons to upgrade. But our advice remains much the same as for the iPhone 7: if you already own the previous generation, there’s not enough here to justify ditching a 6S Plus, especially if you’re halfway through a two-year contract. Those just coming out of contract on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus would do well to grab a 7 Plus.   Read our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review. 9. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 10. HTC 10 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £569 inc. VAT There's a lot to like with the new HTC 10 including a number of hardware upgrades across screen, camera and audio, plus a Nexus-like stock Android experience. However, we're not totally sold on the design and it's tough at the top these days. While the HTC 10 is a solidly good phone and a respectible upgrade for M9 owners, it doesn't blow the competition out of the water. The features which appeal the most are more niche than mass market. Read our HTC 10 review. 11. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 12. Huawei P9 Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 16 RRP: £449 When comparing the P9 to other flagships, it’s important to remember the £449 price which makes it considerably cheaper than many of its rivals (but not the identically priced Nexus 6P that's also made by Huawei). Overall, we're impressed with the phone: it's well built, feels good and looks good. The cameras aren't the absolute best out there, it doesn't top the charts in game tests and the screen isn't Quad HD, but these minor quibbles are outweighed not only by the price but also because, unlike the Nexus, the P9 lets you stick in a microSD card to expand the storage. If you can afford it, the Galaxy S7 is a better phone overall, but this is a great choice if you can't. Read our Huawei P9 review. 13. iPhone 6s Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £619 inc VAT The iPhone 6S Plus is a remarkable phone, and it's still a fantastic phone 12 months on. The 16GB model has finally been banished and the new minimum storage of 32GB should be workable for a lot of people. 3D Touch can sound gimmicky, but it’s absolutely not. It requires effort to force yourself to use it to begin with, but it quickly becomes second nature and app developers have put it to use in apps and games. Read our iPhone 6s Plus review. 14. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 15. iPhone 6S Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £539 We're really impressed by the iPhone 6s. It's fast, has a great screen and a good main camera. It misses out on some of the 6s Plus's features, including optical stabilisation, but most people won't really notice. In short, the iPhone 6s is a great phone, and it's even better now it's cheaper and the base model has 32GB of storage. Read our iPhone 6S review. 16. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 17. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 18. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539 inc VAT The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 19. iPhone SE Rating: Reviewed on: 11 April 16 RRP: £379 inc VAT (16GB); £429 inc VAT (64GB) Buy from Apple The SE is what many iPhone fans have been asking for, and it's a great upgrade if you're still using an iPhone 5. For 5S owners, things aren't quite as clear cut. If you're not happy with the 5S's performance, the SE should solve that problem. However, unless you really want to shoot 4K videos, you're not going to notice a massive improvement in photo quality. There's a much bigger jump in quality if you're coming from an iPhone 5 (or earlier), however. Make sure 16GB is enough before you order: we'd recommend the 64GB version for most people. Read our iPhone SE review. 20. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 November 16 RRP: £169 Although the new Moto G4 is more expensive than the third-generation, Motorola is offering a Full HD screen, better processor, more storage and memory. Not everyone will enjoy the jump to 5.5in or the lack of full waterproofing but this is still a brilliant phone for under £200. Just bear in mind that the 3rd-gen Moto G is now a great buy at £149 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 offers similar specs for just £125 (albeit SIM-locked). Read our Motorola Moto G4 (2016) review.

Wir werfen einen Blick in die Zukunft und spekulieren, womit im ersten Halbjahr zu rechnen ist. Kann Apple uns 2017 mal wieder überraschen? Im Jahr 2016 gab es bei Apple kaum Überraschungen. Abgesehen vom Macbook Pro (Test), das zahlreiche eingefleischte Apple-Fans enttäuschte, aber dennoch interessante neue Features an Bord hat, hatte das Unternehmen solide Modellpflege betrieben: das iPhone 7 (Test) sieht fast so aus wie die Vorgängermodelle, die Apple Watch Series 2 ist optisch fast identisch mit der ersten Watch-Generation. Immerhin: Sie hat GPS und einen schnelleren Prozessor an Bord, außerdem kann die Uhr nun auch Tauchgänge verkraften. Doch was wird das neue Jahr bereithalten? Werfen wir einen vorsichtigen Blick auf das erste Halbjahr 2017. Eines der 2016er-Highlights: das Macbook Pro mit Touch-Bar. (Foto: Apple) Neue iPad-Pro-Modelle – eins davon mit 10,5-Zoll-Display Eine der ersten Produktreihen, die Apple 2017 womöglich updaten wird, dürften die iPad-Pro-Modelle sein. Gerüchten zufolge soll neben Neuauflagen der 9.7- und 12,9-Zoll-Modelle auch ein neues iPad Pro das Licht der Welt erblicken. Es soll bei einer Displaydiagonale zwischen 10,1 und 10,9 Zoll fast ohne Rahmen um das Display daherkommen. Apple könnte 2017 drei neue iPad-Pro-Modelle zeigen. (Bild: Apple) Das mittlere Modell soll außerdem keinen Hardware-Homebutton besitzen – stattdessen könnte dieser unter das Display wandern. Entsprechende Gerüchte kursieren auch schon über die nächste iPhone-Generation. Das iPad Pro 9.7 könnte nach der Vorstellung des rahmenlosen 10-Zollers als erschwingliches Einsteigermodell fungieren. Wir können ferner davon ausgehen, dass Apple seine Tablets durch weitere Softwareanpassungen mit iOS 11 zu einer noch besseren Alternative zu den hauseigenen Macbooks machen will. Angeblich spielen die Macs bei Apple mittlerweile ohnehin nur die zweite Geige. Wie steht es um die „normalen“ iPads? Der Fokus scheint bei Apple auf den Pro-Modellen zu liegen. Möglich ist, dass das iPad mini 4 von 2015 unverändert weiterverkauft wird – beim iPad Air 2 könnte es sich ähnlich verhalten, zumal bei beiden Varianten der Speicher im September 2016 verdoppelt wurde. Macbook (2017): Mehr Performance, mehr wohl nicht Das 2017er Macbook dürfte sich nicht sehr vom 2016er Modell unterscheiden. (Bild: Apple) Beim 2017er Macbook kann damit gerechnet werden, dass Apple in erster Linie neue Prozessoren mit geringfügig höherer Performance verbaut. Im Unterschied zu den Macbook Pros wird Apple endlich auch auf Intels Kaby-Lake-Architektur setzen. Darüber hinaus ist davon auszugehen, dass der USB-Typ-C-Anschluss Unterstützung für Thunderbolt 3 erhalten wird. Für die Integration einer Touch-Bar, wie sie im Macbook Pro zu finden ist, dürfte es noch zu früh sein – diese gilt bis auf Weiteres als Alleinstellungsmerkmal der Pro-Serie. Beim Macbook Air ist maximal ein kleines Upgrade zu erwarten, denn es hat an Anschein, als würde Apple diese Produktreihe auslaufen lassen. Auf der anderen Seite kursieren Gerüchte über ein neues Air schon seit Juni 2016. Diese besagen, dass wie beim Macbook und dem Pro-Modell auf USB-Typ-C und Thunderbolt 3 umgestiegen und USB-Typ-A und der Magsafe-Adapter gestrichen werden sollen. Neuer iMac mit USB-Typ-C – Magic Keyboard vielleicht mit Touch-Bar und Touch ID Mit dem von Tim Cook angekündigten „großartigen Desktoprechner“ ist womöglich auch schon in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2017 zu rechnen, schließlich hat diese Produktreihe – von Mac Pro über Mac mini bis zum iMac – längere Zeit kein Update mehr genossen. Ob die beiden erstgenannten Desktop-Varianten überhaupt noch aktualisiert werden, ist ohnehin ungewiss. Beim zuletzt im Oktober 2015 erneuerten iMac stehen die Chancen gut. Der Umfang des Upgrades ist allerdings unklar, da Apple den Fokus vermehrt auf iPhone und iPad zu legen scheint. Seit Jahren hat es keine großen Upgrades für die iMacs gegeben. (Bild: Apple) Ob die iMacs ein neues Design erhalten, darf bezweifelt werden – unter der Haube könnte Apple auf Intels Desktop-Chips der siebten Generation setzen, die Anfang 2017 angekündigt werden sollen. Außerdem wird Apple sicherlich auf USB-Typ-C umsteigen, Thunderbolt 3 integrieren und wohl neue Grafikkarten von AMD verbauen. Damit dürften die Macs auch endlich Unterstützung für VR-Brillen wie die Oculus Rift und HTC Vive bekommen. Angeblich basteln Apples Entwickler an neuen Magic Keyboards, die eine Touch-Bar und Touch-ID integriert haben. Laut Macrumors entscheidet Apple aber später, ob die Features verbaut werden sollen - man wolle erst abwarten, wie die Touch-Bar am Macbook Pro aufgenommen wird. Was noch? iOS-11- und macOS-10.13-Vorschau zum WWDC 2017 Google hat Android schon mit VR-Fähigkeiten ausgerüstet – Apple dürfte nachziehen. (Bild: Google) In Sachen Software wird Apple im Juni einen Vorgeschmack auf die nächsten Generationen seiner Betriebssysteme geben. Was iOs 11 und macOS 10.13 mit sich bringen werden, ist ungewiss. Es ist aber davon auszugehen, dass beide Plattformen eine stärkere AI-Unterstützung bekommen werden, außerdem dürfte Apple allmählich ins VR-Rennen einsteigen. Wie es für Apple üblich ist, wird die neue iOS-Version mit einer neuen iPhone-Generation veröffentlicht. Die neuen iPhones – angeblich zwei iPhone 7s (Plus) und ein Premium-Modell, nennen wir es iPhone 8, werden aber erst im September 2017 vorgestellt. An dieser Stelle darf nicht vergessen werden, dass Apple im Jahr 2017 den zehnten Geburtstag des iPhone zelebriert – daher können wir mit etwas Großem rechnen.

Sie haben mit Steve Jobs den wirklichen Visionär verloren. Meiner Meinung nach konzentriert sich Apple schon längst auf ganz andere Dinge und das iPhone und die MAC's laufen nur noch nebenher.

Upmarket London department store Selfridges has closed its Apple Watch store-within-a-store. The dedicated area was part of its Wonder Room, a room devoted to watches and jewellery and described by the store as ‘a unique destination that plays host to the world’s most desirable brands.’ Selfridges told us that the last day of trading was yesterday, with its other staff only informed on the day by email. The news follows rumors that the similar area in the Parisian department store Galeries Lafayette is to close at some point this month, with poor sales said to be the reason. Selfridges did not give a reason for the closure, and said that customers would still be able to buy the Apple Watch – along with other Apple products – from its technology area in the store. Apple told us that the space is an ‘ever-evolving’ one. The Wonder Room at Selfridges is an ever evolving space and our time there wrapped up January 3. We’ve had an incredible experience at Selfridges and we’re excited about serving customers at our recently re-opened store Apple Regent Street. Back in 2015, three iconic department stores around the world opened Apple Watch departments, in London, Paris and Tokyo. In London, the Apple Watch sat alongside designer brands like Cartier, Bvlgari, Tag Heuer, Gucci, Montblanc and Longines. Apple appears to have tempered its luxury watch ambitions somewhat, quietly discontinuing the solid gold Edition that was priced at $10-17,000 and replacing it with a ceramic model starting at $1249. Check out our hands-on with the ceramic model if you’re feeling tempted. Apple has never revealed sales figures for the Apple Watch, but Tim Cook did rebut an IDC report claiming that sales were down 70% year-on-year by stating that the wearable is instead seeing ‘off the charts‘ sales growth.

There's an interesting theory that smartwatches are to the smartphone what wristwatches were to the pocket watch. Picture the way the average gentlemen used to have to rummage through his pocket for his watch prior to the 20th century - now skip forward 100+ years and the average smartphone user still has to dive into his/her pocket to check their phone. Read: The best smartphones: The best phone you can buy in 2017. The kicker now is that your smartphone holds far more information than a pocket watch ever did, yet all of which is still locked into your pocket. The theory behind smartwatches is not for you to make calls with and speak into, although some can do this, but instead they mainly provide a quick and easy way to check what notifications are on your smartphone, so you can decide whether it's worth delving into your pocket or searching around your bag to fetch your smartphone or not. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: What smartwatch do I need? There are two type of smartwatch around at the moment: Those with a colourful touchscreen like would find on your phone, and those which combine a regular analogue watch with smart features - we call them 'semi-smartwatches'. The latter we class as a semi-smart device and normally gives you information via a small LCD screen, LEDs or even smaller hands on the watch face. While a fully-fledged smartwatch can do a lot more, the juice guzzling screen results in a short battery life. Semi-smart watches benefit from longer battery life with some even having separate cells for the watch and smart features. If you're an Android user then an Android Wear smartwatch is the obvious choice but it's not necessarily the best for everyone. Google's OS tweaked for wearables also plays nicely with iOS but with cut down functionality so iPhone owners will get more from the Apple Watch. Others have an entirely different system such as Pebble's range of devices and some even work with Windows Phone like the Vector Watch. Samsung is sticking with its own Tizen, too, so there's something for everyone here. Also see: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear will make all kinds of wearable devices better. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: What makes a good smartwatch? So when testing for what is the best smartwatch, the important factors to consider are how much of your smartphone's functionalities can it perform, and how well does it handle each task, the final attribute is obviously style - it's still bling after all. You'll also want to make sure it's compatible with your smartphone - some are only for iPhone or Android while others support most phones. Note that Android Wear now has iOS support but the experience is cut down in comparison. Some smartwatches use different software such as the Gear S3 which runs Tizen, Samsung's own OS - it's a legitimate alternative to Android Wear. Content continues below See also: Android Wear 2.0 release date and new features. As is stands, you'll need to pick a watch with more limited functionality if you want long battery life while ones which can do all sorts will typically last a couple of days. Fitness fans will want to look for a device with a heart rate monitor and built-in GPS, although the heart rate monitors are often poor. We consider the important factors of a smartwatch to be level of notification detail, battery life, style, water resistance, compatibility with a range of devices/smartphones, plus additional features such as microphones and Wi-Fi support so you don't have to connect to a phone for full functionality. With very similar, if not identical, hardware on offer with many of the Android Wear smartwatches, a large part of the decision will come down to design and price. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: Smartwatch security warning According to a new report titled Friend or Foe? Your Wearable Devices Reveal Your Personal PIN, it isn't at all difficult for a hacker to figure out your PIN or password utilising motion sensor data from your wearable, with researchers getting it right around 80 percent of the time.  Their advice is for us to create a certain kind of noise data, or to input our PINs and passwords using the other hand.

Huawei Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 15 RRP: £289 inc VAT Although it's pricy, the Huawei Watch is best Android Wear smartwatch on the market with its absolutely stunning design and exquisite build quality. There's still work to be done though as the watch lacks GPS, the heart rate monitor doesn't work very well and the charger is bit fiddly. Read our Huawei Watch review. 2. Apple Watch Series 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 September 16 RRP: £369 inc VAT Buy from Currys The new Apple Watch Series 2 takes the main complaints about the original - slow operation, lack of GPS, lack of official waterproofing, short battery life - and solves or at least improves them systematically. If you're into fitness tracking with a sprinkling of notifications and superb integration with the iPhone, this is an almost perfect wearable for you... although, being greedy, we'd still like an even better battery life, and the price remains pretty steep. We thought long and hard about whether to give the Apple Watch Series 2 five out of five, and it was a close-run thing. But those two issues are still, just, keeping it from a perfect score. Great wearable, though, and the only one we've seen that feels like it has any chance at all of taking wearables into the mainstream. Read our Apple Watch Series 2 review. 3. Motorola Moto 360 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 December 15 RRP: From £229 inc VAT Buy from Motorola The new 2nd-generation Moto 360 is a decent smartwatch offering excellent build quality and hardware. The value is good if you avoid the extras on the Moto Maker but they are hard to resist. Battery life is fairly good and performance too apart from the odd moment. All of this is leading to a whole hearted recommendation, if only Motorola had made the one change we wanted – removing that flat tyre from the display. As much as we like the Moto 360, it's hard to look past this, as small as it may seem. Read our Motorola Moto 360 2 review. 4. Samsung Gear S2 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 January 16 RRP: £249 Based on our time with the Samsung Gear S2, we think it's a sleek smartwatch with an attractive design. It offers fairly standard smartwatch features like fitness tracking, but also includes some rather interesting features including a rotating bezel used for navigating the UI and enhanced app capabilities. At £249, it sits itself alongside the likes of the Moto 360 2, and we think the Gear S2 is a great, if not better option for Android users – especially with a custom, intuitive UI. Read our Samsung Gear S2 review. 5. Fossil Q Founder Rating: Reviewed on: 10 March 16 RRP: £259 Buy from Fossil There's no doubt that the Fossil Q Founder is a well-made and good looking Android Wear smartwatch which is also a competitive price. The hardware on offer is good, although some may miss the heart rate monitor and GPS. As much as we love it, the flat tyre effect of the screen is a big drawback stopping it being really great. Read our Fossil Q Founder review. 6. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £349 Buy from Samsung The Gear S2 arrived on a deserved wave of hype, but for some reason we aren’t overly excited about this new Gear S3 Frontier. The only thing it actually adds is GPS, and at a £100 cost it’ll definitely put some people off. The reduced functionality when not using a Samsung phone is also a turn-off, despite the software being easier and more intuitive than Android Wear. The problem isn’t entirely the S3’s fault, it’s in the inherent limitations of smartwatches. You’ll always need a smartphone to finish the majority of tasks, and added to the fact that this is practically a repackaged Gear S2 means not much new ground has been broken. If you want a smartwatch and can afford to spend £349, this is the one to get. It just isn’t essential. Read our Samsung Gear S3 Frontier review. 7. LG Watch R Rating: Reviewed on: 7 November 14 RRP: £225 inc VAT Quite rightly, LG has decided to launch a round screen version of its first Android Wear device in the form of the G Watch R. It adds much needed style and class to the smartwatch and has an excellent round screen which doesn't have a section missing. It's a shame that it's more expensive than the Moto 360 but if you're going to spend £200, £25 isn't much extra. As long as you like the design of it over the Moto 360 which is down to personal taste. Read our LG Watch R review. 8. Asus ZenWatch 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 7 March 16 RRP: From £149 The Asus ZenWatch 2 is a great smartwatch, and is definitely a worthy upgrade from its predecessor. Under the hood, the spec boost definitely makes the difference when interacting with the watch, providing a snappy experience and should compete with watches £100-200 more expensive. Visually, its a huge improvement over its predecessor, with more ‘flavours’ of the smartwatch available with a number of specifically designed accessories. The Asus-branded software brings something different to the smartwatch, especially the FaceDesigner app that lets you create your own custom watch face from scratch. Read our Asus ZenWatch 2 review. 9. Motorola Moto 360 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 14 RRP: £199 inc VAT The Moto 360 is a fantastic smartwatch with excellent build quality, luxurious design and an affordable price tag. However, it's not flawless with one day battery life, a lower resolution screen which is tainted by the black section at the bottom. It will also be too big for some users. Despite the flaws, it's the best smartwatch we've reviewed to date but watch out for the LG G Watch R, Asus ZenWatch and Apple Watch. Read our Motorola Moto 360 review. 10. LG Watch Urbane Rating: Reviewed on: 17 July 15 RRP: £259 inc VAT Buy from LG Mobile There's a lot to like about the LG Watch Urbane with it's handy Wi-Fi connectivity and the welcome new version of Android Wear. Since it's essentially the same device as the G Watch R in terms of hardware, your purchase really hinges on the design. It is expensive and bulky so we can't see it appearing to the masses so the G Watch R is still our recommended choice. Read our LG Watch Urbane review. 11. Sony SmartWatch 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 January 15 RRP: £189 inc VAT The SmartWatch 3's biggest strength is its built-in GPS, but you'll still need a smartphone for driving directions. It's also great to see a standard USB charging port. The transflective screen is a good idea, but in practice battery life is no better than other smartwatches with better-looking screens. Ultimately, unless you're on a fixed budget, the G Watch R is the better choice. If you can't afford that, wait a few months: the price is bound to drop. Read our Sony SmartWatch 3 review. 12. Motorola Moto 360 Sport Rating: Reviewed on: 4 August 16 RRP: £186 inc VAT Available for under £200, the Motorola Moto 360 Sport is one of the best smartwatches for fitness. You get the some of the regular 360 style in a design which is practical for activities like running. The GPS tracking is accurate but it's shame the same can't be said of the heart rate monitor and we still find the 'flat tyre' on the screen an eyesore. A solid effort but hard-core fitness fans might need something which is more in-depth. Read our Motorola Moto 360 Sport review. 13. Microsoft Band 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £199 inc. VAT It is very difficult to score the Band 2, because it is such a specific product with a unique feature set. But let's unpack it: it is definitely good value, as the combination of sensors and features is much greater than any comparable product at this price. And it is well made if not the last word in elegance, nor with perfect battery life. If you are looking for a GPS runner's or cyclist's watch it is a good one at a good price, and it also offers the productivity and sleep tracking. And if you want a smartwatch you will like what the Band 2 does, but you may hanker after the ability to compose and send messages. Simply, I don't. I like to wear my dumb watch, and I like for my phone to stay in my pocket rather than on my wrist. So for me the Band 2 is a winner. Microsoft has now discontinued its Band 2, though you might be able to find a bargain online. Read our Microsoft Band 2 review. 14. Apple Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 8 September 16 RRP: £269 We can't help but think that Apple has tried to do too much with this first generation Apple Watch. There are so many ways of interacting with it and so many different features and elements to get used to that the learning curve is surprisingly steep. It takes a lot of getting used to, and at times it feels counter-intuitive, something we're not use to with Apple devices. That's why we'd struggle to recommend spending the £299 or more it'll cost you to buy this smartwatch. As is often the case, waiting for the second generation of the Apple Watch is likely to be a wise move, because Apple is going to learn a lot from this first generation smartwatch and from the customers and fans that are using it. Read our Apple Watch review. 15. Asus ZenWatch Rating: Reviewed on: 7 April 15 RRP: £199 The Asus ZenWatch isn’t the most impressive smartwatch we’ve ever used, but it’s not the worst either. It’s a very good-looking, stylish smartwatch – something that’s a rarity in the smartwatch industry. The lack of buttons is definitely an issue, especially with the touchscreen input being as frustrating as it currently is. It does however boast a decent battery life and enough sensors for you to shake a stick at. Ultimately though, when you put this up against similarly priced smartwatches like the Moto 360, it can’t compete. The Moto 360 has a button disguised as a crown which is used to turn the display on and off, as well an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts screen brightness dependent on your lighting conditions. Ambient light sensors are a feature that smartwatches need, but very few have. It also has an optical heart rate monitor that periodically checks your pulse in the background without being prompted to, and without a need to physically interact with the watch. With an almost identical RRP, we’d rather go for the Moto 360. Read our Asus ZenWatch review. 16. Pebble Steel Rating: Reviewed on: 23 October 14 RRP: £179 inc VAT The Pebble Steel may not have a high-res and colourful screen and the square design may not be for everyone, but we think it's stylish and the display has a retro charm which also provides excellent battery life. A good alternative to Android Wear if that's not your cup of tea. Read our Pebble Steel review. 17. Fossil Q Grant Rating: Reviewed on: 3 August 16 RRP: £165 inc VAT Buy from Fossil The Fossil Q Grant is easily the best looking and well made 'semi-smartwatch' we've reviewed. It's both stunning and affordable although the plastic back which shows is a shame. Smart features including customised notifications and activity tracking work well but are fairly basic and limited. Our main issue is the connectivity issues with Android. Read our Fossil Q Grant review. 18. Martian Notifier Rating: Reviewed on: 4 July 14 RRP: £129 inc VAT The Martian Notifier is a great choice for those who want a smartwatch within the design of a regular wrist watch. Its affordable but stylish although the rubber strap isn't the most comfortable. It's main skill is notifications but the additional features like remote camera control are handy. Our main issue is the extra cost of shipping it over from the US so we're hoping for a UK launch soon. Read our Martian Notifier review. 19. Vector Watch Luna Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 15 RRP: £299 inc VAT It's good to see a company approaching the smartwatch differently and we like the design and style of the Vector Watch Luna. A month-long battery life is a real standout point but you'll have to be happy with the retro low-res display as a sacrifice. This is all acceptable but the device falls down when it comes to functionality with poor apps, fitness tracking and notification system. Things are improving over time with software updates but that's not really good enough at this price point. Read our Vector Watch Luna review. 20. Guess Connect Rating: Reviewed on: 16 August 16 RRP: £289 (41mm), £299 (45mm) Looks-wise we're not at all keen on the huge, chunky and ostentatious Guess Connect: the Fossil Q Grant has a far subtler and more elegant design, and is less likely to bruise your child's face when you're having a cuddle. But you may disagree, and if you can put up with - or are even charmed by - the Connect's brutal look, there's a strong feature set here to get your teeth into: it feels only a step or two down from a fully fledged smartwatch. With voice commands and the ability to pick up phone calls or have texts read to you, it's head and shoulders above the Fossil for sheer smartness. For features, this is probably the strongest semi-smartwatch we've seen: activity tracking is the only significant chink in its armour. If that's a priority for you, plump for the Fossil Q Grant - which you may want to do anyway because it's also a lot cheaper and (in our view) more attractive. Read our Guess Connect review.

Well, it's one that can do everything - but there isn't just one, here are 18 best laptops By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Lenovo Yoga 710 11in £549 Windows 10, Intel Core M3-6Y30, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 11.6in 1920x1080 display, 40Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Jump straight to our full best laptops chart What's the best laptop? We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Lenovo Yoga 710 and the Asus ZenBook UX310, but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Before you buy any of the MacBooks in this chart, note that Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro on 27 October. We will add the new MacBook Pro to our chart once we have completed our testing. Best laptops 2017: Buying guide As with any product we review, the best laptops are rated on various factors - performance, build quality, features and value for money – along with an overall score, potentially with an award, too. Note that star ratings don't always dictate where a product ranks in the list below, as the score applies to the date it was reviewed. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops in the chart are available to but in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the model listed. There are also often many different SKUs (versions/models) of a laptop so the specs might vary to those on the model we've reviewed (we can't always choose the exact model to review). Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, our best laptops group test also includes the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. Best laptops 2017: How much should I spend on a laptop?  In this chart, there's no cap on how much the device can cost – sometimes the best does come at a steep price. Equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a low resolution screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Content continues below Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £800 and up - and you'll be looking at the best of the best with a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  Best laptops 2017: What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. After all they typically range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops come with a glossy screen but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. Best laptops 2017: How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Best laptops 2017: Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (6th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Core M processor instead. A Core i5 sits nicely in-between so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Best laptops 2017: Ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Best laptops 2017: Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499 inc VAT) The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 3. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 inc VAT The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 4. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 5. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 inc VAT (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 6. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 7. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 inc VAT Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 8. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar) We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 9. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 inc VAT The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 10. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 11. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 12. Apple MacBook (early 2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,049 There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our Apple MacBook (early 2016) review. 13. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 inc VAT (model tested £1499 inc VAT) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 14. Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) Rating: Reviewed on: 9 March 16 RRP: £202 inc VAT Buy from Dell Dell knows what it’s doing when it comes to Chromebooks. This new, rugged model has plenty to offer in terms of speed and durability, but you don’t feel like you’re sacrificing much in return. With the long battery life and unique waterproofing feature it does seem like a device that’s built to last, which is good as you’ll want to keep using it for a long time to come. Read our Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) review. 15. Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. HP Envy 15-as001na Rating: Reviewed on: 13 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The HP Envy 15 doesn't seem like a desperately interesting laptop at first glance. It's too big to be cool, not quite cheap enough to be a stone-cold bargain. However, the longer you use it, the more you realise quite what a sound fit it is for people who want a larger laptop, but one not ugly, chunky or liable to last 90 minutes between charges. Sound performance, a smart trackpad, a respectable display and sensible price make the HP Envy 15 one of the best laptops for those who don't really need a super-performance PC but still want the desktop-replacer feel you get with a 15.6-inch laptop. Read our HP Envy 15-as001na review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 inc VAT (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value. Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review. 18. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 January 16 RRP: From £639 inc VAT A very decent laptop replacement, and an okay tablet, the Surface Pro 3 is undeniably impressive. If you need a single device to do everything we can't think of any better device. And when you consider the cost of buying a discrete laptop, tablet and desktop PC the Surface Pro 3 is priced to shift. The question remains as to whether people want a single device rather than multiple gadgets that are better at their individual tasks. Microsoft's latest results suggest that Surface Pro 3 is winning hearts and minds. Has it won yours? Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review.

Sean Gallagher - Jan 4, 2017 12:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Alexa, how do I create something that combines AI with a creepy 1980s toy? Sean Gallagher reader comments 90 Share this story It's been 50 years since Captain Kirk first spoke commands to an unseen, all-knowing Computer on Star Trek and not quite as long since David Bowman was serenaded by HAL 9000's rendition of "A Bicycle Built for Two" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. While we've been talking to our computers and other devices for years (often in the form of expletive interjections), we're only now beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible when voice commands are connected to artificial intelligence software. Meanwhile, we've always seemingly fantasized about talking toys, from Woody and Buzz in Toy Story to that creepy AI teddy bear that tagged along with Haley Joel Osment in Steven Spielberg's A.I. (Well, maybe people aren't dreaming of that teddy bear.) And ever since the Furby craze, toymakers have been trying to make toys smarter. They've even connected them to the cloud—with predictably mixed results. Further ReadingBearDuino: Hacking Teddy Ruxpin with Arduino Naturally, I decided it was time to push things forward. I had an idea to connect a speech-driven AI and the Internet of Things to an animatronic bear—all the better to stare into the lifeless, occasionally blinking eyes of the Singularity itself with. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tedlexa: a gutted 1998 model of the Teddy Ruxpin animatronic bear tethered to Amazon's Alexa Voice Service. Introducing Tedlexa, the personal assistant of your nightmares I was not the first, by any means, to bridge the gap between animatronic toys and voice interfaces. Brian Kane, an instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design, threw down the gauntlet with a video of Alexa connected to that other servo-animated icon, Billy the Big Mouthed Bass. This Frakenfish was all powered by an Arduino. I could not let Kane's hack go unanswered, having previously explored the uncanny valley with Bearduino—a hardware hacking project of Portland-based developer/artist Sean Hathaway. With a hardware-hacked bear and Arduino already in hand (plus a Raspberry Pi II and assorted other toys at my disposal), I set off to create the ultimate talking teddy bear. To our future robo-overlords: please, forgive me. His master's voice Amazon is one of a pack of companies vying to connect voice commands to the vast computing power of "the cloud" and the ever-growing Internet of (Consumer) Things. Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many other contenders have sought to connect voice interfaces in their devices to an exponentially expanding number of cloud services, which in turn can be tethered to home automation systems and other "cyberphysical" systems. While Microsoft's Project Oxford services have remained largely experimental and Apple's Siri remains bound to Apple hardware, Amazon and Google have rushed headlong into a battle to become the voice service incumbent. As ads for Amazon's Echo and Google Home have saturated broadcast and cable television, the two companies have simultaneously started to open the associated software services up to others. I chose Alexa as a starting point for our descent into IoT hell for a number of reasons. One of them is that Amazon lets other developers build “skills” for Alexa that users can choose from a marketplace, like mobile apps. These skills determine how Alexa interprets certain voice commands, and they can be built on Amazon’s Lambda application platform or hosted by the developers themselves on their own server. (Rest assured, I’m going to be doing some future work with skills.) Another point of interest is that Amazon has been fairly aggressive about getting developers to build Alexa into their own gadgets—including hardware hackers. Amazon has also released its own demonstration version of an Alexa client for a number of platforms, including the Raspberry Pi. AVS, or Alexa Voice Services, requires a fairly small computing footprint on the user's end.  All of the voice recognition and synthesis of voice responses happens in Amazon's cloud; the client simply listens for commands, records them, and forwards them as an HTTP POST request carrying an JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object to AVS' Web-based interfaces. The voice responses are sent as audio files to be played by the client, wrapped in a returned JSON object. Sometimes, they include a hand-off for streamed audio to a local audio player, as with AVS's "Flash Briefing" feature (and music streaming—but that's only available on commercial AVS products right now). Before I could build anything with Alexa on a Raspberry Pi, I needed to create a project profile on Amazon’s developer site. When you create an AVS project on the site, it creates a set of credentials and shared encryption keys used to configure whatever software you use to access the service. The Amazon Developer Console, where you create the configuration for a prototype Alexa device. First, it needs a name. The next step in creating a configuration: the generation of a security profile. These are used to authenticate the device via OAuth with Amazon's Alexa back-end. These source addresses for the device are required to allow local setup details to be passed via OAuth to Alexa. The first set of URLs under each setting here are for the AWS sample app's configuration; the second set (including the third address) are for the AlexaPi code I used on this project. Note they're not HTTPS—something to fix later. Amazon wants some more details on your "product" to finish the configuration profile. Once you've got the AVS client running, it needs to be configured with a Login With Amazon (LWA) token through its own setup Web page—giving it access to Amazon's services (and potentially, to Amazon payment processing). So, in essence, I would be creating a Teddy Ruxpin with access to my credit card. This will be a topic for some future security research on IoT on my part. Amazon offers developers a sample Alexa client to get started, including one implementation that will run on Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi implementation of Debian Linux. However, the official demo client is written largely in Java. Despite, or perhaps because of, my past Java experience, I was leery of trying to do any interconnection between the sample code and the Arduino-driven bear. As far as I could determine, I had two possible courses of action: A hardware-focused approach that used the audio stream from Alexa to drive the animation of the bear. Finding a more accessible client or writing my own, preferably in an accessible language like Python, that could drive the Arduino with serial commands. Naturally, being a software-focused guy and having already done a significant amount of software work with Arduino, I chose…the hardware route. Hoping to overcome my lack of experience with electronics with a combination of Internet searches and raw enthusiasm, I grabbed my soldering iron. Plan A: Audio in, servo out My plan was to use a splitter cable for the Raspberry Pi’s audio and to run the audio both to a speaker and to the Arduino. The audio signal would be read as analog input by the Arduino, and I would somehow convert the changes in volume in the signal into values that would in turn be converted to digital output to the servo in the bear’s head. The elegance of this solution was that I would be able to use the animated robo-bear with any audio source—leading to hours of entertainment value. It turns out this is the approach Kane took with his Bass-lexa. In a phone conversation, he revealed for the first time how he pulled off his talking fish as an example of rapid prototyping for his students at RISD. "It's all about making it as quickly as possible so people can experience it," he explained. "Otherwise, you end up with a big project that doesn't get into people's hands until it's almost done." So, Kane's rapid-prototyping solution: connecting an audio sensor physically duct-taped to an Amazon Echo to an Arduino controlling the motors driving the fish. Enlarge / Kane texted me this photo of his prototype—audio sensor and breadboard taped atop an Amazon Echo. Brian Kane Of course, I knew none of this when I began my project. I also didn't have an Echo or a $4 audio sensor. Instead, I was stumbling around the Internet looking for ways to hotwire the audio jack of my Raspberry Pi into the Arduino. I knew that audio signals are alternating current, forming a waveform that drives headphones and speakers. The analog pins on the Arduino can only read positive direct current voltages, however, so in theory the negative-value peaks in the waves would be read with a value of zero. I was given false hope by an Instructable I found that moved a servo arm in time with music—simply by soldering a 1,000 ohm resistor to the ground of the audio cable. After looking at the Instructable, I started to doubt its sanity a bit even as I moved boldly forward. I need sanity check on this Instructs le: wtf with the soldering? https://t.co/Mc3HlqqNtW — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 Me, after a few hours with a soldering iron. pic.twitter.com/16aaWkI4Em — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 While I saw data from the audio cable streaming in via test code running on the Arduino, it was mostly zeros. So after taking some time to review some other projects, I realized that the resistor was damping down the signal so much it was barely registering at all. This turned out to be a good thing—doing a direct patch based on the approach the Instructable presented would have put 5 volts or more into the Arduino’s analog input (more than double its maximum). Getting the Arduino-only approach to work would mean making an extra run to another electronics supply store. Sadly, I discovered my go-to, Baynesville Electronics, was in the last stages of its Going Out of Business Sale and was running low on stock. But I pushed forward, needing to procure the components to build an amplifier with a DC offset to convert the audio signal into something I could work with. It was when I started shopping for oscilloscopes that I realized I had ventured into the wrong bear den. Fortunately, there was a software answer waiting in the wings for me—a GitHub project called AlexaPi. Page: 1 2 Next → Sean Gallagher Sean is Ars Technica's IT Editor.

Future iPhones and iPads may have 'theatre mode' for use in cinemas Apple leaker says new icon will feature on next iOS update to reduce annoyance caused by smartphones during screenings Andrew Pulver @Andrew_Pulver Wednesday 4 January 2017 06.46 EST Last modified on Wednesday 4 January 2017 07.37 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Future versions of the iPad and iPhone may include a newly designed “theatre mode”, designed to overcome the annoyance caused to filmgoers by cinema patrons checking their smartphones. Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. December 30, 2016 According to serial Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, it will feature in the next iOS update, denoted 10.3, which Dickson says is due to start rolling out on 10 January. Dickson also says that a popcorn-shaped icon will be added to the Apple control centre to operate it. Why the panic about texting in cinemas? Phones can breathe new life into old spaces | Arwa Mahdawi Read more Apple analysts AppleInsider are more sceptical, but suggest the update will be “iPad-centric” and might “disable system sounds and haptic feedback, block incoming calls and messages and reduce initial screen brightness during a movie”. AppleInsider also suggests it could draw on a series of Apple-patented technologies going back to 2012 that allow for the triggering of “customised phone settings automatically based on a phone’s GPS position”. However, AppleInsider backs up Dickson’s claim of a 10 January start-date, saying its own site-tracker has shown a recent spike of visits from devices apparently running iOS 10.3. Mobile phone use inside cinemas has been a bone of contention for years, with the AMC chain suggesting it could allow “texting-friendly” screenings, and a series of cinema-rage incidents such as the widely reported killing of an audience member in Miami during a screening of Lone Survivor in 2014, and a filmgoer being Maced in Los Angeles at a showing of Mr Turner.

Image: Nestor Rizhniak/Shutterstock In what would surely be a very controversial move from Apple, the possible addition of a ‘theatre mode’ option in the next iteration of iOS would allow someone to look at their phone during a film in the cinema. While complaints surrounding the latest versions of iOS rumble on regarding its battery life and other niggling problems, we are already being told about some other possible new features for iOS 10.3. But worryingly for cinemagoers, there is one addition that could make future trips to the local theatre a nightmare if you can’t stand the idea of someone looking at their phone in the cinema. According to Apple insider Sonny Dickson, this latest possible feature will be called ‘theatre mode’ and it will appear on screen as a popcorn icon. Little is known regarding the exact details, but suggestions would indicate something similar to the existing do not disturb feature, with additional darkening of the screen. iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode – will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 While Dickson himself has not commented on what exactly this feature would do, possibilities could be found in a relatively recent Apple patent that was posted in 2012. Fixing the 30pc bug As part of that patent, the feature could be controversially controlled by the cinema itself. The patent reads: “While the user is in the movie theatre, the mobile device deactivates its cellular communications interface and/or automatically sets the device to a silent mode. “When the user leaves the movie theatre, the portable device enables phone communications and/or restores the ringer setting to the setting utilised prior to the device’s deactivation.” The first beta version of iOS 10.3 is expected to be released on 10 January, according to Dickson, but a smaller update is also likely to drop, to fix important issues. The biggest issue for many users is the so-called ‘30pc bug’ that has seen a large number of iPhone users suddenly finding their phone dying, despite it showing 30pc battery remaining.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror Matt Lewis DC Trawler Send a Tip Tech ‘First Billionaire In Hip Hop’ Dr. Dre Celebrates Beats Headphones Sale To Apple [VIDEO] Giuseppe Macri Tech Editor Giuseppe Macri12:20 PM 05/09/2014      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 4183535 After news broke late Thursday that Apple is working on a $3.2 billion deal to buy Beats Electronics, the developer behind the popular headphones of the same name, company co-founder and hip hop producer Dr. Dre, appeared in a video online and declared himself “the first billionaire in hip hop.” Actor Tyrese Gibson was apparently celebrating with Dre in the producer’s studio following the reports, and posted the video to his Facebook page. “They need to update the Forbes list,” Gibson said in the video referencing the magazine’s list of the world’s richest people, and described Dre as having joined the “billionaire boys club.” “In a big way — understand that,” Dre followed up. “The first billionaire in hip hop.” Though the expletive-rich video appears to show Dre celebrating the deal, he doesn’t explicitly reference or confirm the news. The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

It makes for one of the best smartphones on the market today. Here’s our OnePlus 3T review. Five months after the OnePlus 3 comes this better, more expensive sequel - and it's now running Android Nougat By Henry Burrell | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Specifications Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM See full specs Expert's Rating OVERALL BUILD QUALITY FEATURES VALUE FOR MONEY PERFORMANCE Price when reviewed From £399 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   OnePlus From £399 View Price comparision from , and manufacturers OnePlus 3T review OnePlus is a company that doesn’t much like its reputation in the smartphone business as a plucky upstart. Yet that’s what it is, competing as it must with the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google for the crown of best smartphone in the world. The OnePlus 3, launched in June 2016, was a sublime blend of design and performance for just over £300 but nevertheless, here’s our OnePlus 3T review. See also: Best phones 2016. So it’s odd that just five months later OnePlus has ended production of that handset, sticking to it’s motto of ‘never settle’ and released this upgraded version of the same phone, the OnePlus 3T. The company that prides itself on listening to its fans’ reaction to its products has boldly dared to update a handset that people have had for less than half a year. Will the move gain new fans while annoying existing ones, or both? It’s hard not to compare this phone, when reviewing it, to the OnePlus 3. Since there’s only five months between iterative updates to a high-end phone, we have to compare the two to fully understand the reasons why. OnePlus 3T review: Price and where to buy The OnePlus 3T is on sale SIM-free and unlocked directly from OnePlus. Click here to view it – it’ll cost you £399 for the 64GB version and just £40 more for the £439 128GB version. Both are currently available in the Gunmetal colour, which is slightly darker than the Graphite version of the OnePlus 3.  There will be a Soft Gold version of the 64GB OnePlus 3T out in the next few weeks. In the UK you can get the OnePlus 3T from O2 on a 24-month contract deal. Bear in mind that it’s only available on O2’s Refresh tariff that allows you to upgrade your handset more regularly. OnePlus 3T review: Design and build Even the ‘s’ iterations of iPhones have an ‘s’ stamped on the back, but in this case there is absolutely no design change from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T. The only change is in the darker colour option, the grey of which on the rear is a tad darker than the old model. The forthcoming Soft Gold option is exactly the same, and visually indistinguishable from its five month old brother. This reinforces that OnePlus sees the 3T as a small tweak for the line, hoping as it does to not frustrate loyal fans that shelled out for a 3. The 3T happily retains an outstanding design, with build quality to rival any premium smartphone maker in the land. It does what Apple has still failed to do and made a 5.5in screen phone slim, svelte and usable with one hand (just). Apparently carved out of one piece of space-grade aluminium alloy the OnePlus 3T measures 153 x 75 x 7.4mm and weighs 158g. The frame of the handset houses a power/lock button on the right edge, a USB-C port, speaker, mic and 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom and a volume rocker and OnePlus’ excellent Alert Slider on the left, leaving the top edge flat, curved and smooth. With a front facing fingerprint scanner that relies on haptic feedback as opposed to a physical button, this is a phone that screams ‘use me’ from the second you take it out the box. In that box it also already comes with a screen protector pre-applied, handy if you want to use it with one. The only lines that break the dark gunmetal of our review unit are the aerial lines and the OnePlus logo that sits beneath a 16Mp camera that protrudes ever so slightly from the casing. The front facing camera sits next to the earpiece and is also an amazing 16Mp, something we’ll explore later. At the launch event for the OnePlus 3T, co-founder Carl Pei explained that the company is always striving to do better; he used Apple’s design as a benchmark and the phone is one of the best looking handsets on the market, rivalling the matte black iPhone 7 Plus in the looks department, which is no mean feat. It does however remain slightly slippy, and is a phone that could be destroyed with one drop onto the pavement. We recommend one of OnePlus’ subtle but grippy cases that fit both this and the older OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3T review: Specs, hardware and performance Much of the 3T's spec sheet remains the same as its predecssor but there are also some important upgrades. Let's take a look. OnePlus 3T screen Despite initial rumours, the OnePlus 3T has exactly the same display as the OnePlus 3. It’s a 5.5in Optic AMOLED with Full HD (1920x1080) resolution and 401ppi. By its own admission, OnePlus continues to ship a screen that recreates colours more vibrantly than most, but with the Oxygen OS skin of Android that it runs this feels right; the handset and feel of the software that the screen runs is right at home with the popping colours and bright whites. There’s the option to calibrate the colours to your tastes though, and this is one example of the granularity of Android helping the OnePlus 3T more than most become a truly personal device. OnePlus 3T processor, memory and storage The OnePlus 3T’s upgrades are mostly all internal, and while they’re all welcome, it took a fair few days of use to see why it’s come to be. We’ve used the OnePlus 3 for a few months, so can draw decent comparisons – straight off, you need not upgrade for fear of missing out on processor power, speed or battery life if you own the older model. Having said that the 3T is faster, yet only noticeably so if you are really hammering it at full pelt. It joins the Google Pixel and Pixel XL in having Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 821 processor, the current pinnacle of smartphone chips. While only the most graphically intensive games and busiest of multitasking days will make the 820 sweat, the 821 is faster on the OnePlus 3T. Going from the 3 to the 3T, the difference is noticeable if incredibly subtle. In a full week of use we experienced absolutely no lag, slow app changes or overheating. It is truly like using a desktop at some times, and even has more RAM than some of those computers with 6GB on board. Pair that with Adreno 530 graphics and you have an obscenely powerful smartphone in your pocket – alongside your fat wallet full of the money you’ve saved by choosing it. Our benchmarks show the OnePlus 3T runs equal with the best smartphones out there, though remember these benchmarks don’t represent real world use. The phones in this graph are the absolute best you can get right now, and broadly all perform to the same unbeatable standards. The OnePlus 3T is available with 64GB of internal storage, but bear in mind there’s no SD card slot. The fact you only need to spend £30 more to get an impressive 128GB shows you that Apple charging £100 more for that jump in storage for the iPhone 7 is unnecessarily high. For most, spending that extra money will be well worth it. OnePlus 3T fingerprint scanner and other specs The fingerprint scanner is on the front bottom face of the device, which is still where these sensors work best, despite Sony trying the side and Huawei and others the back. The button is non-moving and gives the perfect level of feedback when unlocking the device or using a compatible app like Android Pay to verify your identity. Unlike the iPhone 7, it doesn’t feel like the whole phone is clicking down – it’s way better here. Tapping the same sensor acts as a home button, and is so good that when we try phones with physical buttons it feels wrong. The best devices change our habits for the good, and the OnePlus 3T has the best fingerprint sensor/home button combo of any current smartphone on the market. OnePlus 3T battery life The non-removable battery clocks in at 3,400mAh, a step up from the 3,000 of the OnePlus 3. The internals are exactly the same dimensions but the battery is denser, hence the increase. In general use the phone will last a full working day which is about average. We left the house most days at 8am with 100%, and by the time we rolled in from work at about 6.30pm the OnePlus 3T had about 30% left in the tank. This was when using the device as our primary email sender and using apps like Slack, Spotify, Pocket, WhatsApp, train timetable apps, GPS battery-drainers like Google Maps and several others throughout the day. The battery percentage chugs down at the expected rate, and we didn’t experience any dramatic unexpected fall-off. On one particularly busy Google Maps day out in Barcelona even after 12 hours on the go the battery was sitting at 15%, and that was with the phone used to navigate, take photos and video and more besides. Obviously it depends what you’re doing on the device, but for all but the most intensive users, the OnePlus 3T will last the whole day no questions asked and lighter users should be able to get a decent chunk into a second day with the 3T. Included in the box is OnePlus’ Dash Charger. The brick and cable, only when used together (important to note this point) charge the phone to 60 percent in 30 minutes. This is OnePlus’ claim, and it rings true – Dash Charge is excellent. It means you need not charge your 3T overnight, instead giving it a quick boost when you get up in the morning. There's also a Dash Charger for your car in the shop. Not only does this encourage a better way to charge your phone (sometimes lithium-ion batteries degrade with overnight overcharging) while allowing you to top up very quickly, but also more importantly means you won’t panic about running out of juice for all but the most phone-focussed of days – and that is something that every smartphone user wants, bar none. The slight downside is that this fast charging only works with the included combo of plug and cable. Any other USB-C cable will charge it, but at a slower rate. OnePlus sells the Dash Power Bundle for £27.53. OnePlus 3T cameras The slim casing of the 3T means the camera protrudes slightly. This is an acceptable pay-off for what is an excellent sensor: a 16Mp lens with f/2.0 aperture and an LED flash. It’s also capable of shooting video at 4K resolution or 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. We used the camera extensively in Barcelona, and the results were very impressive. The panorama mode stitched together a mountain view exceptionally well, giving full detail to the scene. A football match in cloudy weather was reproduced well with no blur and in a low-lit church the camera reproduced colour and shadow to a high quality level. The front-facing 16Mp camera is an upgrade on the 8Mp of the OnePlus 3, and is one of the highest resolution selfie cameras on the market, matching as it does the megapixel count of the rear one. It’s an impressive upgrade, but one that only the most ardent of selfie fans will notice. However, it did improve the quality of video calling considerably, and will benefit those into Snapchat stories and similar services. OnePlus 3T review: Software Refreshingly the software update that the OnePlus 3T ships with changes the user experience in all the right ways to represent a clean, intuitive and pleasant to use Android version that is every bit as good as Google’s own version. By basing its Android skin Oxygen OS closely to stock Android Marshmallow 6.0, OnePlus has been able to make small tweaks that don’t completely change the way we used the phone, but enough to notice positive improvements day to day. An update to Android 7.0 Nougat began rolling out for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T at the end of December, ahead of many of its rivals. Note that we have reviewed this phone running Marshmallow, not Nougat. Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is the new version, compared to the 3.2.7 we had installed on the older OnePlus 3 at the time of writing. Nevermind the decimals, here are the differences. Menus, in settings for example, look cleaner with no lines between options, a neater top bar and a bluer default font from the green of the 3. To be honest, they are minor changes, like the layout of the notification bar that you pull down from the top of the screen. In the comparison pictures below you can see the changes (OnePlus 3 on the left, OnePlus 3T on the right). The OnePlus 3T cleverly combines a physical slider with profile changes to quickly switch between modes. Here, the three-position switch goes between Silent, Do Not Disturb and Ring. These are customisable and are useful for putting your phone into a quieter mode for meetings or when you go to bed for example. This is different to how the slider worked on the OnePlus 3, where it went between Silent, Priority Notifications and All Notifications. The functions are basically the same, but again have some software tweaks within the settings menu. All in all, the alert slider is a great idea, improving on Apple iPhone silencer switch, and is a button you’ll miss if you use other phones afterwards. The best thing about these tweaks is the way they simply blend into the OS and are intuitive, thoughtful upgrades. OnePlus confirmed that the 3 and the 3T will both receive updates to Android Nougat 7.0 in December 2016. We hope there is more of the same incremental updates rather than a full overhaul, because Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is very good indeed. Nor would it make sense for OnePlus to work so hard on an upgrade that most users would only see for one month. OnePlus 3T review: Should I upgrade from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T? So it’s crunch time; you bought a OnePlus 3 in June and five months later, do you upgrade? Well, no, you shouldn’t in our opinion. The OnePlus 3T may have, on paper, a better processor, bigger battery and better selfie camera but if you own the 3, it isn’t worth spending another £400 for those features. If you can sell on your old device for a good price then perhaps you’d be tempted, but if the company has done the 3T this fast, it surely can’t be that much longer until we see a OnePlus 4. The OnePlus 3 has, like the newer 3T, 6GB RAM and come December will also run Android Nougat. Sure, we love the changes to the 3T and the Gunmetal colour is awesome, but you can’t even see it with a case on and in everyday use, you can barely notice the difference in speed. You can just about tell the battery life is better though, but it was already excellent on the OnePlus 3. Don’t panic – you don’t need to upgrade unless you want a OnePlus phone with 128GB of storage. OnePlus 3T review: Should I get the OnePlus 3 or the OnePlus 3T? This is a trickier question, and one that ran with a time limit – OnePlus has ceased production, so once they’re gone, they’re gone and the 3T will be the only phone the company still sells. On the day the 3T sent on sale in Europe, the OnePlus 3 was completely sold out on the company's website.  At the time of writing however the OnePlus 3 was still available on contract from O2. We'd wager this is the last way in the UK to get the old model brand new - otherwise, look to eBay. At the RRP, if you only need 64GB and want to save £70, the OnePlus 3 remains an outstanding piece of hardware that will be more than adequate at the high end of the market for at least another year and a half. That £70 could buy you OnePlus’ new Bullets earphones, an official case and a spare Dash Charge Bundle with change to spare.  However, if you want 128GB on board storage, you’ll have to go for the OnePlus 3T, setting you back £439. It’s also the best way to get hold of the Soft Gold colour if you prefer – the OnePlus 3 has sold out of this colour, while the 3T will soon be stocked in it. So you’ll have to wait if you prefer Gold to Gunmetal, but the 3T is the way to go. Yet for all the similarities, we’re still inclined to recommend the OnePlus 3T. It has a bigger battery, lightning fast speeds and a selfie camera that means video calls are actually worthwhile experiences. While nitpicking indeed, the software updates are also commendable, and the overall experience is (just) better than the five month old, soon-to-be-gone OnePlus 3. It’s an odd dilemma to have from a company that had until now made your buying choice very simple. In a few weeks you’ll only be able to get a OnePlus 3T, but for now, there’s a decision to be made for prospective buyers. OnePlus 3T: Specs Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM 16Mp main camera, LED flash, support for videos in 4K and 1080p at 60fps 16Mp front camera 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.2 4G LTE Nano-SIM GPS NFC 3,400 mAh non-removable battery 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm 158g Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM 16Mp main camera, LED flash, support for videos in 4K and 1080p at 60fps 16Mp front camera 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.2 4G LTE Nano-SIM GPS NFC 3,400 mAh non-removable battery 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm 158g OUR VERDICT The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected.

However until then, the lack of traditional ports is pretty frustrating and expensive for early adopters of the technology, but OWC is here to help. The company known for their memory modules for Apple’s computers has announced at CES 2017 the OWC DEC. This is a base addon for your MacBook Pro that will not only include all the ports that Apple removed, but it will also allow users to expand the storage of the laptop, which we guess more or less functions like a massive external hard drive. The ports that will be part of the OWC DEC include an SD card slot, USB Type-A ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and it is made from aircraft grade aluminum and designed to mimic the MacBook Pro so it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. It also boasts an additional 4TB of storage. Granted the end result is a noticeably thicker MacBook Pro, but OWC says that overall the thickness should be the same as the 2012 MacBook Pro models, so we guess it isn’t so bad. No word on pricing but the DEC is expected to begin shipping out to customers in the spring of 2017. Filed in General. Read more about CES, CES 2017, laptops, Macbook Pro and owc.

The iPhone 7 was released without a headphone jack, an unpopular choice that's now been somewhat ameliorated by the launch of the AirPods, and the MacBook Pro has been plagued by battery issues, graphics problems, and complaints about the high price of the device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also saw its first decline in iPhone sales in 2016, but 2017 could potentially turn things around for the company. We're expecting the biggest iPhone revision we've seen since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched in 2014, plus we're also expecting major iPad changes, refreshed desktop Macs, and software improvements. iPhone 8 - September 2017 Rumors about the 2017 iPhone started ramping up before the iPhone 7 was even released, so there's a lot of information out there, and at this point, quite a bit of it conflicts, so it's difficult to get a clear picture of what Apple is planning for the iPhone's 10th anniversary. If you read all of the rumors and suss out some common themes, there are a few concrete details that hint at what likely to see in the next-generation iPhone. We're assuming it's going to be called the "iPhone 8" due to design changes that are more radical than we'd expect for an "iPhone 7s," but it's entirely possible Apple will go with another name. It looks like there's going to be at least three iPhone models, and one of those will have an OLED display. It's sounding like we're going to get one premium OLED iPhone somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 inches, with either a flexible curved display that wraps around the edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or an edge-to-edge display more in line with the current design of the iPhone 7. These seem to be mutually exclusive concepts, but we've heard rumors suggesting both possibilities. A display that wraps around the sides of the phone seems to suggest we'd continue to have some kind of top and bottom bezels, but information coming from sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seems to point more towards a less curved 2.5D edge-to-edge display that does away with bezels entirely. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Of course, it's possible some "edge-to-edge" rumors refer to the removal of the side bezels rather than the top and bottom bezels, but it's not entirely clear. Either way, it seems the iPhone 8 will do away with the Home button, incorporating a Touch ID fingerprint scanner directly into the display. Ambient light sensors, microphone, and camera may also be located under the display for a true single piece of glass look. Along with that OLED model, rumors also suggest we're going to get two other iPhone models, perhaps in standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch configurations. These would presumably be less expensive and would use easier to obtain standard LCD display panels. Either the OLED model or all three iPhone models rumored for 2017 will include a glass body, doing away with the aluminum-style body that Apple has used for several years in a row. The glass back and the display may be housed in an aluminum frame for stability, but the glass itself will mean a significantly different visual aesthetic. A glass body will bring a fresh look, but there's another reason behind the materials switch -- wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be developing long-range wireless charging techniques, which could make their debut in 2017. An aluminum body can interfere with wireless charging speeds, while a glass body offers less interference. It's not entirely clear if Apple is developing its own wireless charging solution or working with a company like Energous, nor do we know exactly how wireless charging will be implemented, but it is looking like a feature we can expect to see in all 2017 iPhone models. Other features rumored for the 2017 iPhone include a faster A11 processor, more advanced biometric features like improved facial recognition techniques or perhaps even iris scanning, and an upgraded Taptic Engine able to create "more complex tactile vibrations." Dual cameras are expected to be offered in some iPhone models, but optical image stabilization could be added to both lenses (instead of just the wide-angle lens) in the next-generation iPhone. Apple is rumored to be considering upwards of 10 different prototypes for the 2017 iPhone, which explains why we may be hearing so many different rumors about the device at this point in time. As we get closer to the September launch date of the 2017 iPhone and as Apple's own plans solidify, we'll get a better idea of what to expect. Read full iPhone 8 roundup iPad Pro - Spring 2017? Apple is working on a revamped version of the iPad Pro, and as with the iPhone, the rumors are all over the place. Apple is said to be planning on introducing three models in 2017: a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new mid-range model with a display that's somewhere between 10.1 and 10.9 inches. The 10-inch iPad Pro is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge nearly bezel-free display much like the iPhone 8, and its actual body size will be identical to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. For that reason, rumors suggest the 10-inch iPad Pro will be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but Apple plans to keep the 9.7-inch iPad Pro around as a low-cost tablet option. The 10-inch and 12.9-inch models will reportedly be the new flagship models, upgraded with faster A10X processors. The exact size of the 10-inch iPad hasn't been sussed out yet. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often reliably predicts Apple's plans, says it will measure in at 10.5-inches. Japanese site Mac Otakara has a more mixed track record and has released two reports pointing towards both 10.9 and 10.1 inches. Rumors out of the Taiwanese supply chain have suggested 10.5 inches, and research conducted by Barclays Research says it'll be 10.9 inches. One rumor from Mac Otakara also suggests Apple will introduce a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Pro to succeed the iPad mini, but that information has not yet been confirmed by another source. With Apple planning to introduce new iPads in 2017, there may also be more of a focus on iPad-specific software during the year. Apple is said to be aiming to enhance the iPad Pro with new hardware and software features that cater specifically to professional users, such as a faster display for smoother on-screen zooming, panning, and scrolling, and expanded iOS support for the Apple Pencil that will allow it to work in more areas. Mac Otakara and Barclays Research have both predicted an early 2017 launch for the new iPads, perhaps in March or April, but if a radical edge-to-edge redesign is in the works, it is questionable as to whether Apple will upstage the 2017 iPhone 8 that's expected in September with an edge-to-edge iPad launching earlier in the year. Read full iPad Pro roundup iMac - Spring 2017 New iMacs didn't debut alongside the MacBook Pro at Apple's October 2016 event, but there's rumored to be an update in the works. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, we will see iMacs in "mid-1H17," which translates to sometime around March or April. A refreshed iMac will likely include Intel's Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics (in models that use discrete graphics options). The iMac is potentially due for a design refresh, but there have been no rumors suggesting anything more than a minor spec update is on the horizon. In fact, information from Bloomberg suggests all we'll see in a 2017 is a shift to USB-C and improved processors. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the iMac are set to come out in late December to early January, perfect timing for a spring release. We could potentially see a new keyboard that could ship alongside an iMac. Apple is rumored to be considering a standalone keyboard that incorporates a Touch Bar much like the keyboard of the MacBook Pro. Such a product might accompany a future iMac. Read full iMac roundup MacBook - Spring 2017 After introducing the 12-inch Retina MacBook in the spring of 2015, Apple launched a refreshed version in the spring of 2016, so it stands to reason we'll see yet another upgrade in the early months of 2017. Low-power Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the MacBook are already available, so that's a safe bet for what we might see in an upgraded machine. No design changes are expected. Read full MacBook roundup MacBook Pro - Fall 2017 New MacBook Pro models with a Touch Bar came out in 2016, and if Apple sticks to a traditional upgrade cycle, we'll see a refresh with upgraded internal components in the fall of 2017. Upgrades could include Kaby Lake processors and slight price cuts, but no external design changes are expected for the next several years. Read full MacBook Pro roundup Mac Pro The Mac Pro is overdue for an update, having last been updated in 2013, and we don't know when it's going to get a refresh. There are no concrete rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and no hints on what a new machine might include. Processors and graphics cards appropriate for an updated machine have long been available, but Apple could be waiting for the latest technology from companies like Intel and AMD before presenting a new Mac Pro. If a Mac Pro is planned for 2017, it could come in the spring alongside refreshed iMacs or, if Apple is waiting for cutting-edge current-generation chips, it could come in the fall. Read full Mac Pro roundup Mac mini Like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini has not seen an update for multiple years, with the last update coming in October 2014. Unfortunately, we've heard no rumors on whether or not we can expect to see an upgraded Mac mini in 2016, but if it does come, it could include Kaby Lake chips, faster SSD options, better graphics, and other improvements that have been brought to the Mac lineup over the last two years. Read full Mac mini roundup MacBook Air - Never With thinner, lighter MacBook and MacBook Pro machines now available, we don't expect to see another MacBook Air update. Apple will likely keep the MacBook Air around for a while as a low-cost option until it's able to cut the price on more expensive machines, but a new MacBook Air probably isn't going to happen. We could, however, potentially see small spec boosts and minor internal upgrades if Apple wants to keep its low-cost machine relevant for a longer period of time. Read full MacBook Air roundup Apple Watch - Fall 2017? If Apple is working on a third-generation Apple Watch for the fall of 2017, it's being kept tightly under wraps. We haven't heard any rumors suggesting a new Apple Watch is in the works for 2017, but if we are going to get one, it could come in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Potential features we could see in a new Apple Watch include the first significant design changes, upgraded processors, and perhaps sensors that Apple was not able to build into the first and second-generation versions. Cellular connectivity, a feature Apple has wanted to incorporate into the watch but hasn't been able to add due to battery life concerns, could also come in a 2017 model. We've also heard rumors of a potential switch to micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch, which can be thinner and lighter with improved color gamut and brightness. At this point, it's too early to tell if we're going to get a new Apple Watch in 2017, so we'll need to wait for additional rumors to surface over the first few months of the year to figure out what's going on with Apple's wearable. Read full Apple Watch roundup Apple TV - Unknown While it's possible Apple could introduce an Apple TV update in 2017, we don't think it's likely to happen. There are no recent rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and there's no real reason for the Apple TV to be updated. Prior to the introduction of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple went several years without introducing a new version of the device, so historically, it is not on an every-year or every-other-year update schedule like Macs and iOS devices. That said, rumors suggest a future Apple TV could include a better processor and perhaps some features that would allow it to compete with products like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, but there are other rumors that make it unclear whether these are features that would go into an Apple TV or another standalone product also rumored to be under development in Cupertino -- a home hub. Read full Apple TV roundup Home Hub - Late 2017? Rumors suggest Apple is working on a connected smart home device that's similar to the Amazon Echo. It would be equipped with a speaker and microphone and powered by Apple's Siri voice assistant. The hub, which has been in development for two years and is in the prototype testing phase, is said to be able to control HomeKit-connected accessories like lights, locks, window shades, and more through voice activation. It may feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology" than the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, products it will compete with. The Amazon Echo Information on the hub is a bit nebulous at this point, and it's not clear if it's going to be a new standalone speaker-only product or something in the AirPort or Apple TV families, both of which are possibilities. Facial recognition capabilities may be built into the device, and Apple is also working on Siri advancements that will allow it to do more. Because the hub is still in the prototyping phase, it's not entirely clear when it will launch. It could come in the later months of 2017, but it may not be ready until 2018. Apple could also scrap the project entirely. iOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Apple introduces a new version of its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads on a yearly basis, and in 2017, we're expecting to see iOS 11. There aren't many details on what will be included in iOS 11, but we've heard some hints suggesting there could be more of a focus on the iPad, with features like improved Apple Pencil support that cater to professional users. Apple is said to be planning on allowing the Apple Pencil to work more widely across the operating system. Apple is also rumored to be developing its own social networking app to compete with Snapchat and Facebook, allowing users to record video, edit video, and add filter and doodles. Such an app, if development continues, could debut alongside iOS 11. Apple has also been exploring augmented and virtual reality with a dedicated AR/VR team, and some kind of augmented reality feature could potentially be introduced in iOS 11. Maps and Photos are two areas where Apple could take advantage of augmented reality with the iPhone's camera, offering features like mapping overlays of real-world views or Snapchat-style photo filters. macOS 10.13 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The next-generation version of macOS (10.13) will come in the fall of 2017, introducing new features and refining the macOS operating system. There's no word yet on what features we might see in macOS 10.13, but details will likely leak out as it gets later in the year. Apple will preview macOS 10.13 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June. watchOS 4 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Alongside iOS 10.11, we're likely going to get watchOS 4, an updated version of the operating system that runs on the Apple Watch. There's no word yet on what new features could be included in watchOS 4, but we'll get our first glimpse of the new software in June. tvOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The final software update we're expecting in 2017 is tvOS 11, a new version of the tvOS software that runs on the fourth-generation TV. Apple is still working to refine the tvOS experience, so we can likely expect to see some interface improvements and other usability changes as the company gets a better handle on how people are using their set-top boxes. tvOS 11, along with macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and iOS 10.11, will be previewed at WWDC ahead of a fall launch.

You will see the the widest range of colors in the entire tech industry. There will be new watch bands that will make YSL envy. Needless to say, all the products will be thinner and thinner as unnecessary ports are removed from the devices. The new emoji collection will have the most comprehensive ethnicity ever created. The number of online orders for each product category will be the largest in Apple's history and will outpace the competition by many folds. The company will continue to make efforts to improve safety and privacy. On top of that, they will continue to make sure we live in a better planet.

I wouldn't hold my breath these days :( I'll be blue by next November Rating: 24 Votes Altivec88 2 weeks ago When I look at what Apple is doing in its entirety, I see a company who is slowly but surely gravitating towards what they believe will be the next big thing. The things we are criticizing Apple for, I feel they are simply growing pains as Apple prepares to leave older markets behind and enter new ones. And I feel we need to be understanding in this area. . As an enterprise customer that has built their entire business on Apple products the past 30+ years, We do not have the luxury of being understanding in this area. Unfortunately, for us pro's, "the next best thing" doesn't put food on our plate. For the time being we must rely on those old things called computers. The point of paying a premium for Apple products is the problem free (well less problem free lately) ecosystem between all products. From our iPhones and iPads, to our Mac mini servers and airport routers, right down to our work horse MacPro's. Allowing us to concentrate on our work rather than the technology more than makes up for the extra costs we pay Apple. The problem is we've been waiting 6 years to update our aging and dying 12 core 2010 MacPro's. We purchased one 2013 MacPro to try out and there was virtually no improvement in rendering speeds, yet they were double the price of our 2010 models. So month by month we kept waiting for a speed bump. Both Dell and HP have updated their workstations twice since 2013 and currently offer 44 core systems. When Apple announced their Mac Event at the end of 2016, we were sure a Mac Pro update was imminent. Nope, not even a mention... That silence was deafening to us and triggered a stop order on all future purchases of any Apple product. We use iPhones and iPads to automatically sync notes and photos to our pro machines. If we have to switch our Mac Pro's to Dell or HP workstations, we have no reason to buy Macbook Pros, iMacs, iPads or iPhones. We will be switching those to surface's and window phones for easier integration and lower cost. I know, windows sucks and we don't want to leave, but as other pointed out, Apple is pushing us out the door by neglecting us. So I get that consumers who are okay with outdated tech and slow updates get upset at seeing all the negativity. Trust me, I use to be a die hard fan boy too. But when your PC using competition is blowing you out of the water because their tech is far far superior to yours and it starts costing you big dollars, you would show a little displeasure too. 2017 is the year that things better start popping out this long dragged out pipeline or I really won't care any more. More specifically, no Mac Pro by March and you can put a fork in it. Thanks Tim for ruining Apple. Rating: 22 Votes BreadofWonder 2 weeks ago No reason to update the Apple TV? Really? I can think of two really good ones: 4K and HDR. Every other streamer has it at this point and I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't do it too before the end of the year.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Science Meet the five eccentric physicists who changed the world of science A quick peek at the quirky side of the game-changers in the world of physics. Ebin K Gheevarghese January 4, 2017 14:40 IST The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do, read an Apple ad. Read: We have tech to destroy world, but nothing to prevent it, warns Stephen Hawking Adam chose the apple over Eden for a reason. Without the apple, the world wouldn't be the same. Apples can topple world orders, drive innovation (just look at a Macintosh) and keep doctors at bay. Today is the birthday of a man who singlehandedly changed the world. And guess what the driving force was: an apple. As we celebrate Sir Isaac Newton's genius, let's take a look at the eccentric side of five physicists who changed the world. Here's to the crazy ones: Sir Isaac Newton Isaac Newton (1643-1727) physicistWikipedia First, the man himself. The force behind the classical mechanics had his fair share of eccentricities. Newton best demonstrated the third law of motion over his fight with Gottfried Leibniz, in what was later called Calculus wars. The English physicist's rivalries with Robert Hooke and Christian Huygens over the nature of light are stuff of legend. Moreover, Newton's apocalypse predictions and occult studies made him a favourite topic of conspiracy theorists. Be that as it may, he changed the course of history and introduced classical mechanics to the world. And hey it's his birthday, so let's cut him some slack. Albert Einstein Albert EinsteinWikipedia/Sophie Delar The best thing since Newton. Undoubtedly, one of the most recognised faces around the world, Einstein launched modern physics with his revolutionary paper on Theory of Relativity. He did physics in his spare time while working as a clerk in a Swiss office before making it big, and boy wasn't he ambitious. He dined with presidents, collaborated with mad geniuses from around the world and wrote the most beautiful poem ever - E = mc squared. And for a scientist of his stature, Einstein believed in god. His quest for a unified theory had its basis on his belief in god as underlined by his famous quip on Quantum theory: God doesn't play dice. But that's just a tip of the crazy iceberg. Einstein had his eyes not just on the curves of space-time; he was an out and out ladies' man. He also married his cousin. Einstein suffered from a speech impediment till he was nine and flunked his college entrance test, but that didn't stop him from coming up with wacky thought experiments to explain the paradoxical nature of time and space. The picture of Einstein with his white, frazzled hair and tongue sticking out came to define the stereotype of 'mad scientist'. Neils Bohr Neils BohrWikimedia commons The perfect antidote to Einstein. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics by Neils Bohr and co. is counter-intuitive as it comes. The strange phenomenon where the observer himself becomes the experiment railed many a physicists at the time and also prompted Einstein to take potshots at him with his 'dice' statement. His repartee was classic: Don't tell god what to do. Bohr made the crazy list purely on the basis of his contributions to the bizarre world of quantum physics. Nikola Tesla Nikola Tesla Tesla was in love with a pigeon. Yes, you read it right. And it didn't stop there; he also believed his feelings were reciprocated. Tesla also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder of the first order. An inventor par excellence, he could rival Edison on the invention front, so much so, that the world's foremost innovative company is named after him. For a man who thrived in the dynamics of electric current, he spent oodles of time generating high voltage lightning. Normal rules didn't apply to him. He spoke ill of dead (launched a tirade on Edison upon his death), had a strange obsession with number 3 and believed in aliens. On a serious note, Tesla was the real inventor of radio, but Marconi beat him into taking a patent and landing a Nobel for the invention. Sabrina Gonzalez Pasterski If building a single-airplane engine from scratch at the age of 14 isn't crazy, I don't know what is. Meet Sabrina, a 22-year-old MIT student, and the latest sensation in physics. Already, the headhunters of Amazon's Blue origin and NASA are after this physics girl, hailed as the next Einstein. As Sheldon Cooper will say, Sabrina is bent on tearing the mask off nature and stare at the face of god. And like Sheldon, she doesn't smoke or drink. Scientists like Stephen Hawking have cited her in his papers. Her work on gravity has already taken the world of science by storm. If she keeps at it, who knows, maybe her name will be mentioned in the same breath as Marie Curie and Henri Becquerel.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Flipkart is offering iPhone 6 16GB for just Rs. 9,990? True, but read the fine print Attractive as it may sound, there is a catch in Flipkart's exchange offer. Read on to find out. Sami Khan   January 4, 2017 14:34 IST iPhone 6 discount on flipkartIBTimes India If you are looking to upgrade to an iPhone but lack the financial resources, here's an excellent offer cut out just for you. Flipkart is offering an irresistible deal for an iPhone 6 16GB variant as part of an exchange offer. Read: What will Apple launch in 2017? Buyers can get up to Rs. 22,000 off on the purchase of iPhone 6, which is currently available at Rs. 31,990 after a Rs. 5,000 off on Flipkart. The offer applies only for the space grey variant, while silver colour will cost you Rs. 36,990 or Rs. 16,990 plus Rs. 20,000 max in the exchange scheme.  In addition to the exchange offer, buyers can get an additional 5 percent off on the phone by using Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. While Apple has launched two upgrades since iPhone 6, it continues to be one of the most desired phones by Apple, especially for those with the budget. At the current price, it competes against the latest handsets like OnePlus 3T. Despite the low specs, iPhone 6 is a solid performer, has a good camera and supports 4G LTE. So if you are convinced with Flipkart's sweet exchange deal and all set to trade in your old smartphone for a brand new iPhone 6, you might be in for a huge disappointment. The exchange value of old smartphones is based on their make and model, so it is highly unlikely to score Rs. 22,000 off on iPhone 6 unless you are trading an iPhone 6S Plus. Even if you are trading your latest iPhone 6s, you only get Rs. 17,840 off on iPhone 6. Why would someone want to trade in their latest-gen handset just to go a generation behind? There are multiple brands listed on Flipkart's exchange offer, and the value for most phones range between Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000. If you are willing to give up your OnePlus 3, you will get Rs. 11,000 off on iPhone 6. Basically, the exchange offer isn't as good as it sounds. Shoppers are advised to exercise caution while making the decision.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     CES 2017: Energysquare Sticker Enables To Wireless Charge IPhones Posted: Jan 4 2017, 2:32am CST | by IANS, in News | CES   EnergySquare   Maybe we do not have to wait for Apple to add wireless charging to the iPhone. A new technology can wireless charge almost any device including those without in-built wireless charging capabilities, such as Apple's iPhone and iPad. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries The wireless charger developed by a French start-up, called Energysquare, was witnessed by CNET during the on-going CES trade show in Las Vegas. Energysquare consists of a charging pad and a sticker that is placed on the back of a device. The sticker sports two electrodes along with a Micro-USB, USB-C or Lightning connector that is plugged into the device's charging port. Once the device is placed on the pad, it starts charging. One of the limitations of the sticker is that it blocks the device's charging port and if you want to charge the device normal way, the sticker needs to be removed -- a flaw the company has acknowledged and promised that the upgraded version will include a port on the backside as well. "Unlike other wireless chargers, which use electromagnetic induction, Energysquare relies on electric conduction. This allows for multiple devices to charge at once and at speeds that are comparable to a normal charge," the report noted. Energysquare is priced at $89 and comes with a charging pad and five stickers. According to a report on CNET on Tuesday, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign in May 2016 and is promising to ship the product in the coming months.

This is likely because of “sluggish” iPhone 7 sales. Last year, eMarketer estimated that there were 90.1 million people in the US who owned an iPhone and used it at least monthly. Ford Halts Plans to Build Plant in Mexico Ford has canceled its plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan and add 700 jobs, Bloomberg reports. President-elect Donald Trump recently criticized General Motors for producing its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico and said he would impose a big border tax on the company, according to Reuters. WeChat Mini-Apps Set to Launch Last week Tencent, the parent company of messaging app WeChat, announced that it would release a new “mini-apps” feature on January 9. The new feature is designed to allow WeChat users to access the features of an app—like buying products and ordering services—without having to download one, all within the WeChat app itself. WeChat recently reported that it had 768 million daily logged-in users as of mid-September 2016. Paytm Gets Permission to Launch Digital Bank Paytm, India’s mobile payments company, got approval from the Reserve Bank of India to launch a digital bank. According to TechCrunch, the development is similar to Alibaba and Financial’s initiative in China where internet companies are dipping their toes into financial services. Tweet Editing a Possibility Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, queried in a tweet what users would like to see improved or created on the platform in 2017. The overwhelming response was the ability to edit tweets. In different follow up tweets, the CEO asked what timeframe users would be amenable to for editing and that such a feature is on the company’s mind. eMarketer estimates that there will be 255.3 million Twitter users worldwide in 2017. Dish DVR Now Compatible with Amazon Alexa Dish announced that it is the first pay TV provider to allow for compatibility with Amazon Alexa. Through all generations of Dish’s Hopper DVR player, customers will be able to give Alexa commands on what they would like to watch. eMarketer estimates that eight in 10 US households subscribe to pay TV services. Google Assistant Now Integrated with Hyundai Hyundai’s Blue Link Agent, its connected car system, will now be integrated with Google Assistant through Google Home. Drivers will be able to instruct Google, from inside their home, to give Blue Link directives such as starting and locking their Hyundai vehicles. Select features are also available on Android and Apple smartwatches. Data from Edmunds.com found that around 70% of US internet users are open to using car shopping personalization tools such as asking questions with voice activation. —Rimma Kats, Rebecca Chadwick, Rahul Chadha New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

The parents of a five-year-old girl who was killed in a car crash in California on Christmas Eve in 2014 are suing Apple for failing to introduce an iPhone safety feature it patented that year to discourage people from using the app whilst driving. The driver, Garrett Wilhelm, allegedly used FaceTime on his iPhone 6 and failed to see the brake lights of the car ahead of him just before his car ploughed into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, who were travelling with daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident and five-year-old Moriah died in hospital. It is alleged that when the iPhone was retrieved from the scene of the accident, the FaceTime app was still running. The Modisettes are taking the case against Apple in Santa Clara superior court. A red flag for all phone and app makers, not just Apple They say Apple should be held accountable because it had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime that was designed to prevent people from using the video and voice calling app while driving. The patent centres around a ‘lock out’ mechanism that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions like video calling or texting while driving. This is the second such case over the involvement of the iPhone in car accidents in the past year. Last year, Ashley Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide for a fatal crash in Texas that killed another driver and paralysed a child because she was checking her iPhone. The legal cases could spur Apple to introduce new safe-driving features in future products. But it could also be the tip of the iceberg for other manufacturers, not just Apple. The entire smartphone ecosystem, from hardware and operating systems to the messaging and video chat apps, could be considered a distraction for drivers. And a new precedent is being set where the onus is clearly landing not only on questionable driver behaviour, but on the makers of the devices too.

Apple iPhone 6 is available for Rs 10,000 (approximately) post an exchange offer of up to Rs 22,000 on the e-commerce website Flipkart. The offer is on Space Grey colour variant of Apple iPhone 6 16GB. The iPhone variant (on which this offer is available) is priced at Rs 31,990. An additional discount of up to 5% too is available if users pay through credit cards from a few selected banks. The e-commerce website is also offering EMI options on the device. There is a list of smartphones that are valid for the exchange offer. Since this discount depends on the model that users exchange with, it is interesting to note that the maximum discount of Rs 22,000 is available on iPhone 6S, a higher-generation model vis-a-vis iPhone 6. This means to avail the maximum discount of Rs 22,000, a buyer needs to exchange his/her iPhone 6S with iPhone 6 (highly unlikely we must say.) There's also a flat discount Rs 5,000 (13%) on the same iPhone 6 model, which is selling at Rs 31,990 against its current price of Rs 36,990. Incidentally, the iPhone model is not available offline at stores that Gadgets Now spoke to. These include some stores of iZenica, IWorld, Jumbo and Reliance Retail. View As Photolist » Planning to buy iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? 9 things to know 110 Planning to buy iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? 9 things to know Apple's new iPhones -- iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- are finally in India. Unveiled last month at a glittering event in San Francisco, the latest iPhones run on new processors, pack powerful camera and have a sleeker design. Apple has also made improvements on display, storage and battery front in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For all those planning to buy the new iPhones, here are the top features of the smartphones. Read on to decide if the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are worth your money... Powerful camera Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have upgraded cameras. iPhone 7 has a 12MP sensor that is claimed to be 60% faster. iPhone 7 also has a quad-LED flash with 50% light output. Both the cameras on iPhone 7 have a different focal length, allowing users to pick between shooting photos with a wide-angle or a telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 Plus users can also be able to do some software tricks using those two different focal lengths. While iPhone 7 features a single 12MP rear camera, the larger-screen variant comes with two 12MP rear cameras with 2x optical zooming capability upto 56mm. Both sport a 7MP FaceTime camera for selfies and video chats. ​ New processor Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are powered by the new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor with 64-bit four core CPU. The processor has two high-performance cores and two high-efficiency cores for a longer battery life. It also has a new 6-core GPU which is 50% faster than the Apple A9 processor. ​Slimmer and lighter Getting rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack has helped Apple make its new iPhones slimmer and boost its battery life. iPhone 7 also weighs slightly less than iPhone 6, while iPhone 6 weighs 143 gm, it is 138 gm for iPhone 7. Water-resistant The new iPhones are the first water-proof smartphones from the company. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus boasts of IP67 rating, which makes them water and dust-resistant. This means the phones can be immersed in water up to 1m depth. A popular feature, waterproofing has been there in rival Samsung's flagship devices for sometime now. Gets 32GB as base storage With iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the company is bidding goodbye to 16GB as base storage. The new iPhones come in three variants -- 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. Here 256GB is the new addition, and as always there is no expandable storage. ​ No headphone jack Yes Apple has ditched 3.5mm headphone jack (as widely rumoured). The company has replaced it with the Lightning port-based connectors. These plugs into the phone's charging port. The company has also bundled an adapter with new iPhones so that older earphones can still be used. According to Apple, analogue headphone jack has been removed for two main reasons, one Lightning is a better connector for audio, two it helps free up space for other components. New home button For the first time ever, since Apple launched iPhones the company has redesigned its Home button. The new home button is now touch sensitive and uses a new Taptic engine for better response. ​Adds two new colours iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 comes in five colours, including the two new colours Black and Jet Black. The other three colours are Silver, Gold and Rose Gold. Apple is discontinuing its Space Grey colour option. ​Longest-ever battery life Apple claims that its new iPhones offer 'longest-ever battery'. According to the company, iPhone 7 gives at least 2 hours more battery as compared to iPhone 6s, while the bigger iPhone 7 Plus offers at least 1 hour more of battery life vis-a-vis 6s Plus. Users can also avail the exchange discounts of up to Rs 20,000 on Apple's latest generation smartphones -- iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Last year, the Cupertino giant, for the first time, tied up with an Indian e-commerce website, Flipkart, for the launch of its new iPhones in India. So far, Apple sold iPhones in the country through distributors like Redington and Rashi Peripherals. Apple iPhone 6 was launched in October 2015 in India.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Data breaches through wearables put target squarely on IoT in 2017 10 AWS security blunders and how to avoid them ARM builds up security in the tiniest IoT chips The high-water line in information security gets higher each year. Just as we think we’ve finally figured out how to defend against attacks, then attackers come up with something new and we are right back to trying to figure out what to do next. For example, ransomware has surged in the last year. Although that kind of malware has been around for years, the current model of encrypting user files to hold data hostage came about just recently. Infections quadrupled in 2016, with the FBI estimating an average of 4,000 attacks a day. A recent IBM survey of 600 business leaders in the United States found that one in two had experienced a ransomware attack in the workplace, and that companies paid the ransom 70 percent of the time. As a result, criminals are on track to make nearly $1 billion this year from ransomware, IBM X-Force said. And there’s been seemingly no end to hackers getting into corporate databases. Just ask Yahoo. Or the Democratic National Committee. Even the FBI was able to find a firm to hack into the Apple iPhone 5c, which for a while seemed unhackable. For IT and security professionals, this endless fire fighting gets exhausting. Old threats come back in new forms, and new attacks keep making the list of things to worry about even longer. Malicious word macros are back. Exploit kits still love Flash. SMS text messages with one-time codes for second-factor authentication proved hackable. It all makes you want to give up and curl up in a dark corner. But 2016 wasn’t all bad news for enterprise security, and there are some wins that give hope for a more secure future. 1. We’re looking at passwords in a better light Authentication, especially how we use passwords, was a recurring theme with every data breach. Yes, password reuse is still a problem and weak passwords like “password1” and “123456” are still a thing, but we are seeing more people use password managers to secure their online accounts and fingerprint sensors to lock their physical devices. “Biometrics will no longer be seen as novel in 2017, but necessary,” said Daniel Ingevaldson, CTO of security company Easy Solutions. There are fingerprint sensors on the market today with security features including TLS 1.2 and 256-bit encryption, anti-spoofing technologies, live-or-dead detection, and match-in-sensor architectures, said Anthony Gioeli, a vice president at Synaptics’s biometrics division. Apple has had hardware-secured fingerprint sensors in its mobile devices for several years, and now in its newest MacBook Pro. Samsung and Google use similar technology in their latest smartphones. And Microsoft has built in support for biometrics in Windows 10 and beefed up the security in this year’s Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is also tackling the problem. The draft version of the Digital Authentication Guideline document includes new guidance on password policies, such as allowing for longer passwords; allowing spaces and other characters; removing special character requirements (such as what combination of letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters must be used); and doing away with password hints. NIST also said in the draft that sending unique passcodes via SMS messages should not be used as part of a two-factor authentication scheme, and that stronger authentication schemes should be adopted. Although the guidance is still in draft form and the official public comment period doesn’t start until early 2017, IT departments can use it to start thinking about how to improve authentication, such as rolling out multifactor authentication and changing password requirements. Another bonus: NIST’s Mary Theofanos said mandatory password changes don’t make sense, so IT departments can now work on alternative methods — and stop torturing users. 2. We may finally be taking IoT security seriously Last year, we could see the ransomware wave coming. This year, it’s internet of things (IoT) security — or the extreme lack thereof — that is clearly on the horizon. The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this fall, which spread through home security cameras, VCRs, and other connected devices, took down the internet and seemed to be the industry wakeup call that finally worked. Made up of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet launched large attacks against French service provider OVH, the website of security blogger Brian Krebs, and networking company Dyn. The last time DDoS was the big story, it was about hacktivists and online pranksters targeting financial websites and other visible targets. This time, botnets are launching large, multivector attacks that can exceed 1 terabit per second — and interrupt internet access for millions.   Security experts have been warning for some time about the millions of devices that are connected to the internet without even the most basic security features, so the Mirai attack shouldn’t have been a surprise. And with Mirai’s source code publicly available, it is safe to assume there are other IoT botnets waiting in the shadows to strike. With all these devices connecting to the internet, we are ripe for an IoT worm, said Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research and development at Tripwire. Fixing the problem will require a lot of coordination, creativity, and persistence, but perhaps people are actually seeing the risks. The silver lining is that the Mirai attack was a “fairly cheap lesson in what a compromised IoT [threat] would look like while there’s still time to do something about it,” said Geoff Webb, vice president of solution strategy at Micro Focus. But IoT vendors need to get serious about security fast — and consumers should avoid their products until they do. 3. We’re getting other benefits on the coattails of new security technology It’s always a good sign when adopting something for security reasons winds up having other benefits. New protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 and HTTP2 will make the web safer, but there are clear performance improvements as well. It’s very likely the uptick in adoption of TLS 1.3 and HTTP2 by web developers will be spurred by the increased speeds the protocols enable, said Ryan Kearny, CTO of networking company F5 Networks. “In 2017, the increase in web speed will spur rapid adoption of TLS 1.3 —- and that will, in turn, make the web more secure,” Kearny said. 4. We’re getting more realistic about security Security was one of those things people never really understood. TV shows and movies didn’t help, with slick graphics and fancy dramatizations of what hacking supposedly looks like. Then, along came the TV show “Mr. Robot,” and the show’s star, Rami Malek, winning an Emmy for his portrayal of Elliott Alderson. “Out of all the attempts that Hollywood has made to tell a compelling story using cyber as the backdrop, Mr. Robot is the most complete,” said Rick Howard, CSO of networking security company Palo Alto Networks. If nothing else, nonsecurity professionals now have a better understanding of just how bad things can get. It’s no longer just that one weak password, one link in an email, or that one old software application that hasn’t been updated. There is no need to oversensationalize the security issues in “Mr. Robot” — the reality is bad enough. That better understanding should help users understand why they need to pay more attention to at least security basics. And why they keep getting breach notices from the likes of Yahoo and Dailymotion. But it doesn’t help that there’s still a culture of silence about breaches among security pros and the companies they work for. No one likes to talk about their failures or to be a headline. But because no one is sharing what mistakes were made, the same breaches keep happening over and over. That’s why the formation of new Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) is a positive — though small — development, a sign of realism creeping into the security professionals’ culture, too. Although existing ISAC and commercial information-sharing platforms are expanding to include more enterprises, they need to become even more widespread. Developers have plenty of places where they can post code snippets and get programming help. IT and security professionals should have forums where they can share their security stories, ask questions without judgment, and learn about what worked for their peers, said Jeannie Warner, a security strategist at WhiteHat Security. “The bad guys have Tor, Reddit, and other social networks to share information and tools. The good guys need to adopt theirs just as freely,” Warner said. It’s easy to see information security as a never-ending stream of attacks. Perhaps the most distressing thing about the year’s outages and breaches is the fact that there is an awful lot happening that IT doesn’t know about. Security experts frequently warn that just because there is no evidence of a breach doesn’t mean there isn’t a breach. That was definitely true at Yahoo: The internet company disclosed two gigantic breaches, but the scariest thing wasn’t the number of victims — it was the fact that they happened years ago and no one even suspected. “We went years with billions of records being sucked out from right under our noses and we didn’t even know it,” wrote security expert Troy Hunt. He called the current mindset “conscious incompetence,” where we know we have a big problem. That’s a better place to be than the previous stage, where the prevailing attitude was, “It won’t happen to me.” The big question is knowing where to go next. “How much more are we going to discover over the next year? Or not discover at all?” Hunt asked. If we’re finally getting real about security, and come out of the shadows, we should finally begin to make real progress. 5. We may finally get security promises we can bank on As consumers, we demand money back when we are not satisfied with a product’s performance or functionality. But IT typically doesn’t get that option with security products. Only 25 percent of U.S. IT security decisionmakers said their primary security vendor is willing to guarantee their product by covering the costs of a breach, including lawsuits and ransoms, according to a recent survey by endpoint security company SentinelOne. But most IT security professionals in the survey said they would like security vendors to offer a guarantee their products would deliver on their promises — and 88 percent claimed they would change providers if a competitor offered such a guarantee. “The industry has reached a tipping point, where security vendors will need to guarantee that their products will hold up against cyberattacks and assume responsibility if they fail to do so,” said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. “Customers are tired of paying additional fees to address security breaches, especially when they have already paid for security defenses in the first place.” There are now a handful of companies that offer security guarantees. SentinelOne’s guarantee covers $1,000 per endpoint, or $1 million per company payout, in the event of a successful ransomware infection after installing SentinelOne’s Endpoint Protection Platform. Cymmetria covers the costs incurred in notifying victims, hiring attorneys, bringing in digital forensics investigators, and repairing the damage in case of an advanced persistent threat gaining unauthorized access, moving laterally through the network, and stealing protected information from compromised systems in organizations that have deployed Cymmetria’s MazeRunner cyber-deception platform. Trusona and WhiteHat Security also have similar product guarantees. As we’ve seen over the past few months, even security products can have vulnerabilities. But in several of the cases, the mistakes seemed fairly basic, even avoidable — not at all at the level of what a security provider should be delivering. Providing product guarantees should wring out such sloppiness from security providers, because they’ll finally pay a real price for their own neglect. “It’s high time people in our industry started putting their money where their mouth is and taking responsibility for what they sell, assuring what they do works,” said Gadi Evron, Cymmetria’s CEO.

(Image: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) The older Apple iPhone 6 is available for as low as Rs 9,990 on Flipkart under exchange offer. Flipkart is offering a massive discount of up to Rs 22,000 for the Space Grey 16GB version of the iPhone 6. Additionally, there is the option of paying through EMI along with other discounts of up to 5% from banks. Interestingly, to avail the maximum discount of Rs 22,000, buyers will have to exchange the newer iPhone 6s Plus. While the exchange offer is 'Flipkart Assured' who would want to exchange the iPhone 6s Plus for a 16GB iPhone 6? Also read: iPhone 7 Plus Review: This iPhone Will Be The Apple Of Your Eye (Image: Screenshot/Flipkart) Last year Apple had introduced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 really does not have much to offer in terms of experience for users to upgrade from the iPhone 6S. The 7 Plus, however, packs a punch. (Image: Screenshot/Flipkart) The iPhone 7 Plus comes in two new colours - the Real Black and the Jet black. If you wish to buy the new iPhone these are the only colours to go for. The bigger iPhone 7 Plus is lighter too at 188 grams, compared to the iPhone 6S Plus, which weighed 192 grams. Apple has tinkered around with the design of the iPhone 7 Plus too. It’s smooth and it no longer has a home button. Also read: Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone7: Should You Buy This Android Phone For Rs 57K?

So when they released a series of short videos that featured comedian Kevin Hart, it was only expected that this would bring in a lot of laughs for the company. The series is entitled “The Man Who Kept Running” and has been posted on Nike’s YouTube channel. The first video out of the bunch is a faux documentary style that documents the comedian excitedly showing off his new Apple Watch Nike+ smartwatch. A few seconds later and the screen reveals a message saying that Hart disappeared the next day. The next time Hart is seen on screen, it’s a different and disheveled version of him complete with a heavily bearded chin. Later, it’s revealed that he has been aimlessly running over 700 miles through the country’s backwoods. Hart has given up his comfortable life back home to a sun-baked desert oracle as he talks to inanimate objects and lives off the land. “I’ve been living out here for months, but my spirit has been out here forever.” says the comedian. “See, running used to be hard for me, but then things changed when I woke up and started to hear this little voice in my head. It was the same question every day, ‘Are we running today.’ Every day. So you know what I started to do? I started to answer that question.” The “little voice in his head” Hart was referring to was actually a unique feature available on the Apple Watch Nike+. With this specific model, the wearer of the smartwatch to run. After the lengthy introductory clip, the series goes on for six more videos that last no more than 38 seconds each. These clips highlight the other functions available on the Apple Watch Nike+ as well as the Apple Watch Series 2 devices. Among the ones that are highlighted include the Nike+ Run Club app, in-app communication, GPS run tracking, and other features that motivate friendly competition against other runners. These clips follow the release of the Apple Watch Nike+ smartwatch when Apple first introduced it to the public together with the Apple Watch Series 2 in September 2016. The device was then launched in late October.

Since then, there have been developments such as Wistron requesting for an expansion in its facility. But it seems like there are fresh impediments that could crop up with Apple’s iPhone making plans in India. According a report in Business Standard, a senior commerce minister has stated that Apple’s growing demands for concessions, something that no other company making in India is asking for, could put some brakes to its plans. In addition to the exemption from local sourcing demand, Apple has requested for tax breaks and concessions with labelling requirements, according to sources. It is said that the finance ministry is looking into the tax-break demand. Other demands are being looked at by an inter-governmental panel made of senior officials from department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) and department of electronics and information technology (DeITY) at a meeting scheduled for later this week. Could set a bad precedent Apple has been identified as a company which brings in ‘state-of-the-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technology. So it has got the exemption from the 30 percent local sourcing rule for the first three years. Thereafter, according to the rules, the following five years the company has to meet the 30 percent local sourcing rule. But Apple, being Apple, wants an indefinite exemption from this domestic sourcing rule. The iPhone 7 Plus. The ‘indefinite’ clause could not bade well for boosting local electronics component manufacturing in the future. Currently, the eco-system of internal smartphone component manufacturers in India is not really in a great shape. There has to be a start somewhere. But if Apple and eventually other companies start demanding indefinite exemption when it comes to local sourcing, then there will be no opportunity for India to be an end to end solutions hub. If special exemptions are made just for Apple, then it is not really fair on other smartphone makers who are already making their phones in India. If the ‘Make in India’ principles are uniform for all the existing smartphone makers, I don’t see why special treatment should be meted out to Apple. Initial reports have hinted that Apple has no plans to make dual SIM phones – which accounts for 80 percent of all phones sold in India. Also the phones made in India will be sold only in India, unlike Samsung who exports products made in India. If such a local demand is nowhere in Apple’s list of priorities for the Indian market, why then should the government offer additional sops? Currently, under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) to promote electronic manufacturing subsidies are provided. There is 20 percent capital subsidy in special economic zones (SEZ) and around 25 percent in non-SEZs. Handsets made locally only pay a 1 percent duty charge as opposed to imported devices which play 12.5 percent duty. In addition, if a smartphone maker purchases battery, adapter and headsets locally, it pays only 2 percent duty instead of 12.5 percent when these components are imported. And many global smartphone makers are fine with these sops and going ahead with their Make in India projects. Apple demanding things over and above this, despite getting a breather with the local sourcing clause for three years, seems like a classic case of asking for too much too soon. Cook’s India focus is evident Tim Cook meets Modi in 2016. Apple CEO Tim Cook in his May 2016 visit to India said in no uncertain terms that India is an important market for the Cupertino based company. He announced Apple’s first development centre in Hydreabad to work on Apple Maps and an app design and development centre in Bengaluru to boost Indian developers working on the iOS platform. He has followed this up with statements concerning exciting developments in India in his earnings call with investors. Apple is focussed on growing in India – it saw a 56 percent uptick in India revenue as compared to a 10 percent dip in China. Bitter fact: Apple needs India, more than India needs Apple The developments that have happened between Apple and India in the last year, clearly point to one fact: Apple needs India more than the other way round. I have been covering technology for many years now, and never had there been a concerted effort to push the brand in India by Apple top management. India is yet to figure in the list of countries where iPhones launch around the same time as their US launch or close to it. Korean and Chinese smartphone makers are making hay in India, with Apple’s rival Samsung enjoying a massive 23 percent market share – which is almost 20x that of Apple share. It has been making products in India for around 20 years now and is quite a popular brand in the country. Chinese smartphone makers have successfully created their own niche and are showing growing sales. Many of them such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Huawei, LeEco, Vivo, Gionee, OnePlus and others have already started assembling operations in India. Taiwanese smartphone makers HTC and Asus have also started making smartphones in India. Then you have a thriving local smartphone makers such as Micromax, Intex, Karbonn, Lava which enjoy the entry level and mid-range markets in the Tier II and Tier III towns. If we talk numbers: there are around 275mn smartphone users, 500mn feature phone users and 370mn internet users. A Morgan Stanley report in May 2016 hinted that India would become the no 2 smartphone market in the world in 2017,  but by October 2016, India had already crossed the US to be the second largest smartphone market. For a country whose population is 1.25bn, these numbers indicate tremendous growth potential. The Morgan Stanley report hinted at Apple acquiring a 5 percent market share in 2017-18, up from 1.1 percent in 2016. I could give more numbers, but I think the point is clear. India is a very different market from other developed markets such as the US and Europe. By his own admission, Cook has mentioned that India is today where China was seven years ago. Post that statement, if Apple makes demands which do not add value to the local manufacturing eco-system in India, then that is not really fair and defeats the purpose of Make in India. Since Apple has no plans to sell smartphones globally, from the ones which it makes in India, a three-year time frame to gather 30 percent local sourcing partners, isn’t that tough a task for Apple.

Photo: Reuters Taipei: To open single-brand stores, foreign companies must buy 30% of their components in-country. Round one of the Apple-India tussle ended with victory for the visitor when officials announced a three-year grace period on that stipulation back in June. Now round two is underway, with Apple seeking tax concessions, including lower import and manufacturing duties, Shruti Srivastava of Bloomberg News wrote last week. India doesn’t look eager to give more ground because of the precedent it would set, Srivastava wrote Tuesday. That puts the ball back in Apple’s court, with the world’s largest company able to trade its three major assemblers—Foxconn Technology Group, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp.—off against each other. Whichever of the Taiwan trio is most eager and able to take one for the team in India would secure itself huge brownie points in Cupertino. According to The Times of India, Wistron looks set to be that company and will fly the Apple flag when it starts “Make in India” iPhone assembly in April. With most of the supply chain still in China, and manufacturers facing dozens of challenges to operate in India, my sense is that Wistron would employ what I call the Brazil Solution. Instead of a fully fledged soup-to-nuts manufacturing operation, Foxconn (aka Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.) helped Apple get around Brazil’s import tariffs by shipping partially assembled iPhones to the South American nation for local workers to slot together like Lego. Assuming The Times of India report is correct, it’s possible that Apple agreed to pay for some or all of the equipment to be installed by Wistron, a strategy the California company has deployed on and off for more than a decade. In return, such facilities cannot be used to make products for competitors. Given the iPhone’s annual cycle, this could result in a lot of idle time for Wistron in a country where laying off workers is extremely difficult. As the smallest of the three iPhone assemblers, Wistron can least afford the cost of setting up a dedicated Apple plant in India because electronics manufacturing is all about economies of scale (I doubt Foxconn’s Brazil operation made much money). Yet it’s also got a lot to gain by being the most eager to take on the task. The terms of the contract between Apple and Wistron—and what was offered to other partners—will be one of the industry’s best-guarded secrets. Whatever the deal, such a move is just the kind of concession from Apple that Indian officials need to take back to their constituents so they can give ground elsewhere, including on tax breaks and product-labeling requirements. After years of doing business in China, Tim Cook has learned a lot about giving and saving face. Now it looks like he’s deploying those lessons in India.

By: PTI | Beijing | Updated: January 4, 2017 12:18 pm China should focus on upgrading its manufacturing amid rising competition from India which with its labour advantage has become an attractive destination for multinational firms like Apple, Chinese official media said. As US President-elect Donald Trump pledges to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and China’s competitors seem to be further expanding as an Apple manufacturing partner is working to build an assembly facility in India, an article in the state-run Global Times said today. WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS “Apple’s possible supply chain transfer to the South Asian country adds further pressure on China as its domestic manufacturers show a growing interest in offshore production to low-cost countries,” it said. “Whether India is ready to embrace the supply chain transfer and replicate China’s success as a manufacturing powerhouse is another story. But the evolving landscape highlights the need for China to design a strategy to retain manufacturing jobs and upgrade its manufacturing industry to maintain competitiveness,” it said. Despite Apple’s bumpy journey to expand operations in India when its application to open stores was rejected because at least 30 percent of mobile parts production was not localised, an opportunity seems to have opened up as senior Indian officials have softened their stance, it said. “And it won’t be difficult for Wistron to make a large investment or generate jobs. Apple’s partner Foxconn has displayed the potential for job creation in India,” it said. “If Apple expands in India, more global tech giants may follow suit and China is likely to see a further transfer of the supply chain given India’s abundant supply of working-age labourers and low labour costs. “China cannot afford to lose manufacturing jobs while it has not made a major breakthrough in upgrading its industry and while Trump plans to draw manufacturing jobs back home,” it said. “Industrial competition between China and India comes down to the labour force, where costs and the level of skills are two major factors that influence business decisions. Although China has an edge having nurtured skilled workers over past decades, a majority of Indian states have an absolute labour cost advantage over China,” it said. “The situation requires China to seriously consider how to plug in the hole if manufacturers continue to move elsewhere,” it said. The country should also speed up its manufacturing upgrade through restructuring and reorganisation of technologies, talents, capital and other resources,” it said, adding that these options could create investment opportunities and generate jobs.

Subscriptions to streaming music services jumped about 50 percent in 2016, topping 92 million. For the first time since the heyday of CDs, revenue for the largest record labels is consistently rising. But things don’t look as bright for the streaming companies driving this revival. Spotify, the biggest platform, has swallowed huge losses while paying about 70 percent of its revenue to record labels and publishers. It’s attempting to renegotiate those deals before a planned initial public offering this year. Pandora, which has consistently lost money throughout its 15 years, is trying its hand at a pricier subscription model based on technology from Rdio, another struggling service it bought in 2015. Streaming services Rhapsody and Deezer face similar problems, and internet radio company IHeartRadio is trying to stave off bankruptcy. Services from Apple, Amazon.com, and Google are used largely to lure people to the companies’ other businesses. “It is virtually impossible to run a streaming-music service as a profitable business,” says Mark Mulligan, a former dance club DJ who’s the founder of industry analyst Midia Research. “The model is still broken.” No company exemplifies the travails of digital music services better than SoundCloud. Founded in 2007, the Berlin company has attracted about 175 million users with 135 million tracks of easy-to-share remixes, podcasts, and user-generated content. SoundCloud is beloved among artists and fans, and a darling of the European startup scene. It’s also facing an uncertain future. User growth has stalled, ad sales haven’t taken off, and adoption of its nine-month-old paid service, SoundCloud Go, has been weak. (Mulligan estimates fewer than 250,000 people have signed up. The company wouldn’t say.) SoundCloud’s negotiations to sell to Spotify fell apart in recent weeks because the two sides couldn’t agree on a price, says a person familiar with the discussions. Some of the most loyal SoundCloud fans are migrating to similar services, such as Mixcloud. And some prominent DJs have worked out deals to post mixes legally on Spotify and Apple Music. If SoundCloud can’t come up with a sustainable business model, it will have to find another buyer or raise more money, likely at a lower valuation than the $700 million it negotiated when Twitter invested last year. “They are in big trouble,” says Matt Pincus, chief executive officer of Songs Music Publishing, which represents artists including the Weeknd and Lorde. SoundCloud CEO Alexander Ljung declined to discuss the Spotify talks or the company’s finances beyond saying that subscription and ad revenue are growing. He says his company has a distinct advantage over Spotify and Apple Music because it’s the only service to combine a library of mainstream songs with a massive catalog of tracks created by and for young tastemakers. “There are very few music platforms at this tremendous scale,” Ljung says. “We are one of them.” SoundCloud board member Fred Wilson, an early investor, says digital music has reached an inflection point and most consumers are ready to transition from owning music to streaming it online. Even if record labels continue gobbling the bulk of the revenue, “the platforms that get all the way through to the finish line are going to have great businesses,” Wilson says, citing Amazon and Netflix as examples in other fields. Streaming services may also benefit by helping artists sidestep labels to directly distribute music. Major labels get about one-quarter of a cent each time a song is streamed, and the artists get about 15 percent of that, Mulligan says. Last year, singer Frank Ocean dealt directly with Apple Music to release his album Blonde, cutting out Universal Music Group. “That’s very much a sign of what’s coming,” says Stephen White, CEO of music-licensing marketplace Dubset. It remains unclear whether SoundCloud will be able to enjoy the benefits of having pioneered this kind of shift in distribution. In 2014, before Apple Music existed, SoundCloud was preparing to take the fight to Spotify’s $10-a-month paid subscription, developing a $4 monthly service to pair its user-generated content with a library of new releases and pop, according to a former manager involved in the effort. This bid to become a cheaper Spotify was a bet-the-company moment, the former manager says, and the subscription service’s developers circulated a beta version among employees while waiting for the record labels to buy in. In negotiations with music labels, SoundCloud even began purging user-generated mixes that ran afoul of copyright and sidelining search features to make pirated tracks harder to find. None of it worked. Two of the largest labels, Universal Music Group and Sony Music, withheld support for almost two years. By March, when SoundCloud Go was finally released, it cost $10 a month, not $4, and its library of about 15 million professional tracks was about half the size of Spotify’s and Apple Music’s. By then, several former employees say, they had grown frustrated and left. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

It’s the first company since YouTube to expand from a platform of user-generated content to become a licensed service. “We had to buckle down and work very hard to overcome a tremendous amount of challenges to get through that,” he says. “I see the company as coming out of a very challenging time, not going into a challenging time.” With rights deals so expensive, it’s tough for even many of the top streaming companies to experiment with business models that might prove sustainable. “The global streaming market is a two-horse race,” says Mulligan. He’s betting on Spotify and Apple. The bottom line: SoundCloud hasn’t been able to transform 175 million users into profit, and its efforts to sell to Spotify have fallen apart.   (Updated ninth paragraph to correct Mulligan's estimates on royalties.)

BENGALURU: With the upcoming Bengaluru assembly plant of Apple, India will become only the third country to do the final assembly of iPhones -an indication of how important the country has become for the world's most-valued company .Apart from one assembly facility in Brazil, all of Apple's assembly units for its bestselling product are in China. Apple uses a global and fairly complex supply chain. The parts for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac are manufactured, mostly by third parties, across 28 countries. It has 766 suppliers, of which 346 are based in China, 126 in Japan, and 69 in the US. There is one in India -in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. That's a unit of Flextronics. But it's not clear what the unit makes. Some parts made by these suppliers are sub-assembled in certain locations. All the sub-assembled units and other parts are brought together for final assembly in either China or Brazil in the case of iPhones. For the Apple Mac, the final assembly happens in China, US, and Ireland -the last of these is Apple's own facility --and for the iPod, China is the only final assembly location. With India becoming one of the world's biggest smartphone markets and one of iPhone's fastest growing markets, Apple has decided to assemble the iPhone here. As TOI reported last week, Taiwan's Wistron, one of Apple's suppliers and assemblers, will set up a facility in Bengaluru's industrial hub of Peenya for the purpose. The products from this facility are expected to be available in the domestic market towards the end of next year . Wistron has three supply facilities for Apple and an iPhone final assembly unit in China. “An assembly unit does not require big investments,“ said Jaipal Singh, market analyst at research firm IDC. He said this has been a strategy that all Chinese handset manufacturers have followed in India over the past couple of years. “Labour in India is cheaper than in China. It makes sense to grow the Indian market by establishing a domestic plant,“ he said. Analysts said the unit would also manufacture for exports over time. Data from Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research showed Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, arise of more than 50% over the year-ago period.

Superstar Rajinikanth with his daughters Aishwaryaa and Soundarya. Image from Twitter The answer is one Rajinikanth's elder daughter Aishwaryaa R Dhanush attempts to answer in her book, Standing on an Apple Box. Being born in a superstar's house didn't make much of a difference to Aishwaryaa as she, along with her sister Soundarya, were kept away from all the glamour and glitz of the movie world. "My father never behaves like a superstar at home. For that matter he doesn't behave like one anywhere, except in his movies," she writes. She had a very normal childhood like any other kid and the credit goes to her "Amma", Latha Rajinikanth, who brought them up "without any visible signs" of Rajinikanth's stardom. Shweta Bachchan Nanda, the daughter of Amitabh Bachhan, has written the foreword of the book. (Shweta met Aishwaryaa for the first time at a football match.) Shweta writes about the book: "Very often we watch our idols on screen and they take on the superhuman qualities of the characters they portray. What Standing on an Apple Box does, is lift the curtain and give you a peek at the men and women behind the make-up and the family units that helped to make them what they are." Apple boxes are an integral part of movie sets. Hence, the title. "Used as a prop, these boxes are used to increase the height of the camera stand, to support heavy equipment, to make short actors look tall, sit on between shots, to serve tea and coffee. Come to any movie shoot and the light man can be heard shouting for it," Aishwaryaa writes in the book. Like any other child, she used to visit places accompanied by her mother, away from the paparazzi. She remembers how she "played at Marina beach almost every second day and visited the temples at Adyar and Santhome every week". The book takes one down memory lane as an introvert Aishwaryaa recollects several fond memories with Rajinikanth. She recalled her 18th birthday. She was excited to learn about a club which had opened in "orthodox Madras" but had to overcome "a huge hurdle, My Appa". To her surprise — and worse than an "outright No" — Rajinikanth himself agreed to take her there. Aishwaryaa also recollects that while she and her family were on a trip to Paris, she lost her bag. It was her father who came to her rescue and offered her his lungi to wear. When it comes to food and eating habits she writes: "Appa would help himself to only one dish, irrespective of the number of dishes placed before him." Rajinikanth also supported his daughters when it came to adopting a pet, whom they named "Tiger Rajinikanth". The book is also filled with moments she had with special people in her life, her life-support, and pillars of strength — grandparents in Bengaluru and the days with them, her sister, friends and not to forget her love, actor Dhanush, whom she married at a young age. She mentions a few incidents when Dhanush impressed her with his outlook, especially when Aishwaryaa wanted to pursue further education. However, the book is a disappointment if a reader is looking for gossip or controversial moments from the superstar's life. She does draw a sketch of two incidents without directly indicating the protagonist. There's a love story of a married actor and young actress and a producer's quest to become a successful director.

The bond they share is special. But how does it feel to have one of the real superstars as a father? How different would the lives of superstar children be? Would they miss having normal lives? The answer lies in the book “Standing on an Apple Box” written with disarming honesty by Rajinikanth’s elder daughter Aishwaryaa, who brings out her bond with her father — who is looked upon no less than a deity in South India. Being born in a superstar’s house didn’t make much of a difference to Aishwaryaa as she, along with her sister Soundarya, were kept away from all the glamour and glitz of the movie world. “My father never behaves like a superstar at home. For that matter he doesn’t behave like one anywhere, except in his movies,” she writes. She had a very normal childhood like any other kid and the credit goes to her “Amma”, Latha Rajinikanth, who brought them up “without any visible signs” of Rajinikanth’s stardom. Shweta Bachchan Nanda, who she thinks shares a similar bond with Amitabh Bachhan as she does with her father, has written the foreword of the book. Shweta met Aishwaryaa for the first time at a football match. She writes about the book: “Very often we watch our idols on screen and they take on the superhuman qualities of the characters they portray. What ‘Standing on an Apple Box’ does is lift the curtain and give you a peek at the men and women behind the make-up and the family units that helped to make them what they are.” Apple boxes are an integral part of movie sets. Hence, the title. “Used as a prop, these boxes are used to increase the height of the camera stand, to support heavy equipment, to make short actors look tall, sit on between shots, to serve tea and coffee. Come to any movie shoot and the light man can be heard shouting for it,” she writes. Like any other kid she used to visit places accompanied by her mother, away from the paparazzi. She remembers how she “played at Marina beach almost every second day and visited the temples at Adyar and Santhome every week”. The book takes one down memory lane as an introvert Aishwaryaa recollects several fond memories with Rajinikanth. She recalled her 18th birthday. She was excited to learn about a club which had opened in “orthodox Madras” but had to overcome “a huge hurdle, My Appa”. To her surprise — and worse than an “outright No” — Rajinikanth himself agreed to take her there. Aishwaryaa also recollects that while she and her family were on a trip to Paris, she lost her bag. It was her father who came to her rescue and offered her his “lungi” to wear. When it comes to food and eating habits she writes: “Appa would help himself to only one dish, irrespective of the number of dishes placed before him.” Rajinikanth also supported his daughters when it came to adopting a pet, whom they named “Tiger Rajinikanth”. The book is also filled with moments she had with special people in her life, her life-support, and pillars of strength — grandparents in Bengaluru and the days with them, her sister, friends and not to forget her love, actor Dhanush, whom she married at a young age. She mentions a few incidents when Dhanush impressed her with his modern approach, especially when Aishwaryaa wanted to pursue further education. However, the book is a disappointment if a reader is looking for some gossip or controversial moments from the superstar’s life. She does draw a sketch of two incidents without directly indicating the protagonist. There’s a love story of a married actor and young actress and a producer’s quest to become a successful director.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Patent Suggests Apple Might Still Be Working On A Digital Crown For The iPhone By Ali Salman Posted Dec 31, 2016 14Shares Share Tweet Submit The Apple Watch is a very capable device, providing users with a much more personalized way of how they interact with their device. Even though Apple’s wearable is a complementary product to go with the iPhone, it does boast a unique interactive tool to control the device – the Digital Crown. Well, according to a new patent, Apple wants to move ahead with the Digital Crown. The company is working to bring the technology to the iPhone and iPad. Apple Could Potentially Implement An Apple Watch-Like Digital Crown On An iPhone Or iPad The Digital Crown is an outward level rotary that controls scrolling and much more. In addition to this, it also acts as a button with specified functionality. It’s true that Apple files a lot of patents and it’s definitely not necessary that the company will fill all of its patented technology in its upcoming device. So do take the news with a pinch of salt. The patent is labelled with the number 20160378187 and 20160378189 and explains the device as “an exemplary rotary input that can rotate in a rotational direction as well as be displaced in a direction orthogonal to the rotational direction”. As can be seen in the illustrations, the device on which an Apple Watch-like Digital Crown is explained looks more like an iPhone or iPad. The patent is explained in the form of an extension to the previous patent which was filed back in July of this year. This time around, the company details how a mechanical interface will be advantageous on devices apart from the Apple Watch. This will allow for a physical haptic feedback for interactions and can open all new dimensions in terms of functionality. Some electronic devices may include mechanical inputs, such as buttons and/or switches. These mechanical inputs can control power (i.e., on/off) and volume for the electronic devices, among other functions. However, sometimes these mechanical inputs can fail to give a user tactile feedback, such as the “click-click-click” feeling of winding a mechanical alarm clock with a knob. Advertisement While the main idea behind the move is pretty clear, it is highly unlikely that we’ll see an end product any time soon. Nonetheless, the perception of a Digital Crown on an iPhone or iPad is directly related to how you see the mechanical tool on the Apple Watch. If you’re interested in learning more, it is detailed quite well in the application. You Can Now Transform Your Existing Apple Watch Into the Original Macintosh Using the Elago W3 As for now, what are your thoughts on an Apple Watch-like Digital Crown on an iPhone or iPad? Do you think the idea will ever see daylight? Share your thoughts in the comments.

By: FE Online | Updated: January 4, 2017 12:18 PM Under a new exchange offer, Flipkart is offering a huge discount of Rs 22,000 on the space grey coloured 16GB variant of Apple iPhone 6.

(Source: Reuters) The previous variant of Apple iPhone, that is iPhone 6 smartphone can be bought on Flipkart for as low as Rs 9,990. Under a new exchange offer, the website is offering a huge discount of Rs 22,000 on the space grey coloured 16GB variant of the device. Added to that, is a further discount of 5% if users buy the product using bank cards. All these discounts add to almost Rs 27,000 off on the device. The iPhone 6 16 GB price right now is Rs 31,990, but now you can be able to buy it for less than Rs 10,000. There is a list of smartphones for the exchange offer, and it goes upto a maximum of Rs. 22,000 discount against old smartphones. Since this discount depends on the models users exchange, it is interesting to note that the maximum discount is available only on the Apple iPhone 6S device. However, it is very unlikely that anyone with the iPhone 6S will exchnage it for iPhone 6. However, this is a Rs 2,000 increase in the regular exhange offer Flipkart gives on iPhones, which is generally Rs 20,000. Also read | Apple confirms flaw in iPhone 6 Plus, agrees to repair This discount is available only for the silver grey 16GB iPhone 6 model. One can also avail exhcnge offers on other variants, as well as upto Rs 20,000 discount on the latest, iPhone 7 and iPhpne 7 Plus. Incidentally, there were recent reports of some battery issues in the Apple iPhone 6. Users complained of quick battery charge draining out and the phone switching off even when there is almost 30% life left. Please Wait while comments are loading...

India to be world’s 3rd assembler of iPhones Published on Jan 04 2017 - - India - - BENGALURU: With the upcoming Bengaluru assembly plant of Apple, India will become only the third country to do the final assembly of iPhones -an indication of how important the country has become for the world’s most-valued company. Apart from one assembly facility in Brazil, all of Apple’s assembly units for its bestselling product are in China. Apple uses a global and fairly complex supply chain.The parts for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac are manufactured, mostly by third parties, across 28 countries. It has 766 suppliers, of which 346 are based in China, 126 in Japan, and 69 in the US. There is one in India -in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. That’s a unit of Flextronics. But it’s not clear what the unit makes. Some parts made by these suppliers are sub-assembled in certain locations. All the sub-assembled units and other parts are brought together for final assembly in either China or Brazil in the case of iPhones. For the Apple Mac, the final assembly happens in China, US, and Ireland -the last of these is Apple’s own facility -and for the iPod, China is the only final assembly location. With India becoming one of the world’s biggest smart of the world’s biggest smartphone markets and one of iPhone’s fastest growing markets, Apple has decided to assemble the iPhone here.As TOI reported last week, Taiwan’s Wistron, one of Apple’s suppliers and assemblers, will set up a facility in Bengaluru’s industrial hub of Peenya for the purpose.The products from this facility are expected to be available in the domestic market towards the end of next year. Wistron has three supply facilities for Apple and an iPhone final assembly unit in China. “An assembly unit does not require big investments,” said Jaipal Singh, market analyst at research firm IDC. He said this has been a strategy that all Chinese handset manufacturers have followed in India over the past couple of years. “Labour in India is cheaper than in China. It makes sense to grow the Indian market by establishing a domestic plant,” he said. Analysts said the unit would also manufacture for exports over time. Data from Hong Kongbased Counterpoint Technology Market Research showed Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, a rise of more than 50% over the year-ago period. Apple India clocked robust sales touching Rs 9,997 crore in the 2016 financial year, up 56% from Rs 6,472 crore in the year before. iPhones are expensive, but with a local assembly unit, some analysts believe, Apple can avoid import tariffs and cut the iPhone price by around 15%, allowing it to expand the market. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said India’s low percapita income would not become an impediment in growing Apple’s market share in the country . More than 50% of Apple’s sales in India are contributed by older models which become cheaper once newer models are launched, indicating the brand’s aspirational value.Apple has around 40-45% market share in India’s premium phone segment.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BUSINESS Can Trump convince Apple, IBM, and Microsoft to create more U.S. jobs? Barb Darrow, Fortune January 3, 2017 8:37 PM Tags: Apple, Donald Trump, ford, Fortune, IBM, jobs, Microsoft, Oneweb, Softbank, sprint Above: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks as (2nd L to R) PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook and Oracle CEO Safra Catz look on during a meeting with technology leaders at Trump Tower in New York U.S., December 14, 2016. Image Credit: REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton A surprise move by Ford on Tuesday to kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas. A big question is whether tech giants like Apple, IBM and Microsoft, all of whom rely heavily on foreign manufacturers, will follow Ford’s lead. To be fair, while Trump tends to take credit for saving all these jobs—he had threatened Ford with a 35% tariff on Mexican-built vehicles sold in the U.S.— Ford chief executive Mark Fields told CNN that the company “didn’t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business.” Whether you believe Ford’s move was due to Trump himself, or to a growing belief among voters that the country needs to maintain its own manufacturing capabilities, or that it just makes financial sense, as Fields argued, it is noteworthy. Last month, telecommunications company Sprint and satellite provider OneWeb announced plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. Although Trump claimed credit for those jobs, they were, in fact, part of a planned $50 billion U.S. investment by SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son before Trump’s election victory. SoftBank owns stakes in both Sprint and OneWeb. About 3,000 of those jobs would be at a new Florida factory where OneWeb says it will build low-cost satellites. It was unclear how many of the other jobs would be in manufacturing, but the fact that two tech companies committed so publicly to investing in American workers was noteworthy. And it was also great public relations since SoftBank also wants to revive a Sprint merger with T-Mobile that was proposed in 2014 but dropped in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. SoftBank/Sprint might have better luck getting approval of the deal in a Trump administration. Apple, criticized by Trump in the past for its outsourced manufacturing, is a bellwether for tech stalwarts. Apple has talked with Foxconn and Pegatron, two Asian contract manufacturers that build iPhones, to move some of their work stateside, according to unconfirmed reports.Furthermore, Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with his Microsoft and IBM counterparts Satya Nadella and Ginni Rometty respectively, attended Trump’s tech summit in New York last month. Creating U.S. jobs was one hot topic of the event. In an emailed statement, an Apple spokesman said the company: is responsible for creating more than two million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers. We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. In a blog posted the day after the election, Microsoft president Brad Smith pointed out the need for more highly educated workers. He cited research showing that the U.S. economy added 35 million jobs over the last 25 years, but that the number of jobs held by those without a high school diploma fell 13% to 7.3 million while jobs for those with four-year degrees doubled. He stressed the need for private-public sector collaboration to boost jobs and innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Smith made no mention of whether the company Microsoft would start making its Surface tablet devices in the U.S. or push its Asian manufacturing partners to open facilities here. IBM’s Rometty, likewise, stated a need for companies to work with the U.S. government to improve the climate for job creation. In an open letter to Trump in November, she spoke about a need to train people for skilled jobs that don’t require two- or four-year college degrees. But again, there was little in the way of specifics and no mention of moving any services or manufacturing work to the U.S. from elsewhere. Fortune contacted Microsoft and IBM for comment about their U.S. job plans and will update this article as needed. Toni Sacconaghi, senior research analyst with Bernstein Research said he hasn’t heard much from tech players about bringing jobs—manufacturing or otherwise—to the U.S. from abroad. And, Rometty’s plans, as spelled out in her letter, are “tough to interpret,” he said in an email. Thus far, SoftBank affiliates Sprint and OneWeb seem to be the only tech companies that have promised specific action on the domestic jobs front in the near term. The rest of the tech community has remained silent, at least publicly, about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But then again, it’s early. One thing is certain, says Jeff Matthews, managing partner for RAM Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, via email: “Every company I talk to is thinking about how to do more in America. I’m not sure that they will, but it is now something that’s on everybody’s radar, which can’t hurt.” This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

A new report claims that the Apple Watch Series 3 will be out this fall. The Apple Watch Series 3 is said to come with the same design as its predecessors. The only big changes that are expected to come in the next-generation smartwatch is that it will have improved battery life and better overall performance, according to DigiTimes. Since the new smartwatch has been given a fall 2017 release, it will most likely make its debut alongside the iPhone 8 during Apple's annual September event. Taiwan-based Quanta Computer will still be manufacturing the new Apple Watch. The manufacturer is said to be focusing on “improving battery efficiency” noting that the new model will not see much change in terms of its hardware. Related Stories Pokémon Go App Arrives On Apple Watch, How To Use It Apple Watches Bricked After New watchOS 3.1.1 Update Although better battery life and improved performance will surely be something consumers would want, it’s a bit disappointing that there’s no indication on other new features or even a redesigned look. The Series 2 looked similar with the first generation Apple Watch, but at least it added several new features like GPS, a better display and a waterproof design, as pointed out by 9To5Mac. However, Apple sticking to a single design has worked for the company with the iPad. For the iPhone, Apple stuck to its tick-tock pattern by introducing major redesigns to the smartphone every other year. Perhaps the tech giant believes that the current exterior look of the Apple Watch doesn’t need changing as smartwatches aren’t like smartphones that are always evolving over time. Apple has sold 7.5 million units of the Apple Watch in 2016 which is significantly lower than the projected 12 million units back in early 2016. With offering the same design for the Apple Watch Series 3, consumer interest may possibly continue to dwindle in 2017. After all, overall interest in smartwatches has been declining.

The Taiwanese contract manufacturer has also requested that its application be fast-tracked, the official at the state government of Karnataka in southern India said. The move comes less than two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was in talks with India’s federal government about the possibility of assembling products in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets, where the US tech firm controls less than 2 per cent. Apple setting up production in India would be a significant win for the government which has embarked on a major campaign to attract global manufacturers under the slogan “Make in India”. “Wistron has approached us to expedite certain clearances with regards to the augmentation and expansion of its existing unit,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. Whether Apple will begin manufacturing in India is unknown, but Wistron’s desire to expand “pretty quickly” could represent “several steps in that direction,” the official said.
