International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones If the iPhone 8 should look like this, Samsung Galaxy S8 is a better choice Based on the information gathered by an informed source, here's how the iPhone 8 aka iPhone Edition may look like. Sami Khan   March 31, 2017 11:02 IST iPhoneReuters We've seen and heard a lot about iPhone 8, but nothing is really confirmed. The renders, specifications, features and even the price of the upcoming iPhones this year are based on information leaked by sources, and little do we know about their authenticity. But there have been some reliable sources giving intel on what to expect from this year's Apple flagships. In the latest development on iPhone 8, a post published by iDrop News not only reveals some of the main changes coming in the 2017 edition iPhone, it also gives away how the handset might actually look. The iPhone 8 renders shared by the publication is supposed to be a final-stage prototype of the iPhone Edition, which is claimed to be the official name at launch. If true, it clears the air around the confusion between the iPhone 8 names, which has been called iPhone Pro, iPhone 7s, iPhone X and simply iPhone. So let's take into consideration that iPhone Edition is going to be this year's Apple flagship, and move on to solve other mysteries. iDrop News seems to have great deal of faith in the information it has obtained from a "source with intimate knowledge of Apple's manufacturing facility." Based on that, visualisations were developed, which the source said were identical to the real iPhone Edition. Exclusive 'iPhone Edition' Insider Information Leaked #applenews https://t.co/OapkTd05Gj — iDrop News (@iDropNews) March 28, 2017 Apple has impressed its fans and every mobile user with its classy and unique design year after year. Even though some models had minimal changes, they stood out in the crowd, earning Apple the respect it yearns. But the latest renders of the iPhone Edition seem clumsy and amateur. Of course, the final design will vary, which we hope to impress us, but until then this is the closest we can get to the future iPhone's design. There's a lot of hope on Apple this year as it marks the tenth year anniversary for iPhone. A lot of known analysts have predicted big things in store, some of which are backed by the latest report. The iPhone Edition is expected to have a dual lens camera at the back as well as in the front, 2.5D curved OLED display, slimmer bezels on top and bottom and no physical home button. While these features align with earlier reports, there are some changes that are new in this report. Starting with the design, the iPhone Edition is expected to have a metal back for durability instead of glass, horizontal lens setup for the dual camera at the back, rear-facing fingerprint scanner and no integrated Touch ID within the display. The front view of the iPhone Edition looks a lot like Samsung Galaxy S8, while the rear panel doesn't really spell out Apple with its fingerprint scanner and oddly-placed cameras. If the iPhone 8 is indeed going to look like this, it's better to go with the Galaxy S8, which has more or less a similar design with top-notch features.

The Note7 explosions from last winter continue to haunt the company, and Samsung's leadership is currently embroiled in a scandal that is, to put it gently, totally bananas. The company needs a big win lest it be consigned to the punchline of late night talkshow hosts. So let's stop talking about how bad the last six months have been for Samsung, and let's start talking about Samsung's new phone, which is available for pre-order today, and goes on sale April 28. It will retail for $1199, while the larger S8 Plus will retail for $1349. Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo The Galaxy S8 looks like the phone Samsung has been trying to build for the last few years. Its display dominates the design unlike any other device available, and the integration of Bixby, its newly acquired AI assistant, lets Samsung compete with Google and Apple in a new and, at least for Samsung, unprecedented way. We've only spent a few precious moments with the device, and we'll have a full review closer to its release date, but for now, here are nine things you should know about the Galaxy S8. 1. Samsung has all but murdered the bezel and it looks great Aspect ratios seem to be the rage this year for smartphone companies. First LG announced the G6, with its bizarre 21:9 aspect ratio, and now Samsung has the S8 and S8 Plus with their 18.5:9 ratio. That's just a little wider than the traditional 16:9, when you're holding it in landscape orientation. The extra width all comes out of the bezel, which has basically disappeared. There's a tiny black bar at the top and bottom of the phone. The bezel remaining at the top of the device hides the 8-megapixel front-facing camera. There's also a tiny sliver of bezel on the bottom. In a briefing, a Samsung rep proudly boasted that 83 per cent of the front of the device is screen. The S8 comes in two sizes, the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 and the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus. Both are 2960 x 1440. For those who care, the S8 has a pixel density of 570 per inch, while the S8 Plus has a pixel density of 529 per inch. While we have no idea how that extra screen is going to affect battery life (more screen usually means less battery) the effect is striking. This looks like a very pretty phone from the front. 2) The Home button is gone In addition to hacking away at the bezel, Samsung also killed the Home button. If you want a dedicated little nubbin on the front of your phone you can finger blindly while it's still in your purse or pocket, then you'll need to invest in another phone. The S8's Home button, as well as the Back and Menu buttons, are now entirely software based, as they are on the Google Pixel. 3) The colour choices in Australia are so boring I bet you can't even remember what the colours are Last year, Samsung had a very nice looking blue phone that suggested a little colour was finally creeping into the phone market. Other phone makers followed suit — Apple even released a bright red phone earlier this month. Unfortunately, the new S8 will only be available in three colours in Australia, and they're a profoundly boring grey, black and gold. 4) Why is that the fingerprint scanner? Killing the bezel and the home button means there's no room for a fingerprint scanner on the front of the S8. Rather than do away with the fingerprint scanner entirely (the S8 can also be secured with your eye iris or your face), Samsung moved the button to the back of the phone. It's right next to the 12-megapixel rear camera, which means you'll probably be getting greasy finger oil all over the camera lens as you blindly try to open your phone with a tap. 5) Samsung Dex is the computer in a phone we've been promised since the Moto Lapdock One of the biggest surprises is Dex, a dock you hook up to your monitor and keyboard that lets you turn the S8 into a tiny, slick, desktop computer. This is something Android phone makers have been promising us for years. Back in 2011 Motorola even launched a phone with a dock that doubled as a laptop. But that thing was a failure. It was slow and the desktop version of Android was unappealing and cheap feeling. The S8 has a super-fast, 10nm-based processor (depending on what country you live in, it's a Snapdragon 835 or a Samsung-built processor unit) so it is, in many ways, faster than many of the processors found in ultra budget Windows and Linux PCs. Samsung's S8 desktop computer experience seems very natural. You just drop the phone into the Dex dock, which uses NFC to to launch the desktop mode — no fiddling with plugging anything in. The desktop experience strongly resembles Windows — a nice change of pace from the desktop version of Android on the Galaxy Tab S3. And if you, like me, don't really like Android for heavy-duty computing, then the Dex also has a virtual Windows 10 solution. That's intended for businesses, which often force their employees to stream Windows 10 from a central server, but it should work for regular people too. 6) Bixby looks great on paper Samsung is now competing with the big boys when it comes to AI in a phone. Bixby is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant. Like those phone AIs, Bixby can be activated by voice or by touching an activation button (Samsung is very proud of its button). We're not sure how smart Bixby is compared to Siri or Assistant just yet, but we do know it can translate 52 spoken languages. Siri does around 30. Google does not have an official estimate for how many languages Assistant translates, but it's approximately the same number as Siri. Besides acting as a kind of universal translator, Bixby can also search for things via photo — something Siri is incapable of and Assistant struggles with. It also automatically delivers any requested information via a much more attractive card than the display that pop up when using Assistant or Siri. We won't be sure how smart Bixby is until we get some more time with it, but on paper, it appears to be a worthy adversary to the two titans of mobile AI. 7) Bixby recognises photos of backpacks but doesn't know what the Samsung Galaxy S8 is Bixby's image recognition ability appears to be pretty incredible. With a quick button press Bixby opens the camera and asks to be pointed at whatever needs identifying. We pointed the phone at a backpack and it instantly found bags a similar colour. But Bixby is not infallible. We tried to get it to look at a Samsung Galaxy S8, at the time still a device made up of leaks and rumours, and it struggled to identify itself, and instead pulled up the ancient LG G2. 8) Samsung still cares about VR, even if you don't Besides announcing a new phone and a new AI, Samsung also took the time to announce some VR news. Mobile VR is where most of the VR sales are happening, so it makes sense that Samsung would continue to embrace the medium — even if most consumers really haven't. The two big updates are a controller for the Oculus-powered Gear VR headset, and an updated 360 camera. The old Gear 360 camera resembled a golf ball, but the new one looks more like a golf ball on a tee, as the stand is now built in. Meanwhile the Gear VR controller resembles another Android product — specifically, Google's Daydream controller. It also seems to function like the Daydream controller: It has a touch pad for navigation and a trigger for blasting aliens or clicking on menus, as well as some spatial awareness. The Gear VR controller runs on Bluetooth and Samsung claims you will get nearly 30 to 40 days of use out of the two AA batteries inside, provided you only play about two hours a day. The controller will ship with all new Gear VR headsets, but Samsung promises a version sold independently for current Gear VR owners who want to upgrade. 9) Samsung's smart home features are starting to look actually smart My personal favourite announcement wasn't isn't the bezel-free phone, or the Siri clone. It was the work Samsung is doing in the smart home space. Samsung announced a bevy of smart TVs and appliances at CES back in January, and this week it announced a mesh router system. There's no word on pricing, but the Samsung Connect Home and Samsung Connect Home Pro are both 802.11 AC mesh routers with a Samsung SmartThings hub built in — the only difference being the Connect Home Pro has a larger 4x4 antenna versus the perfectly adequate 2x2 antenna in the regular connect. The built-in Samsung SmartThings hub connects all Samsung smart devices, as well as support for a ton of smart lights, shades, and thermostats. And to control all those devices you can use a Google Home or Amazon Echo (unavailable in Australia), or you can use Bixby on your S8, or you can use the smart home app, which is integrated directly into the S8's notification menus. Smart homes rely on a unified ecosystem, and at the moment, Samsung appears to have the most robust one.

It's the most powerful, with an innovative screen and a design that's incredibly refined. It has Bixby, a voice agent that wants to be just as useful and integral to your phone as touch already is. It has a new motion-sensitive Gear VR headset and works with a new high-resolution Gear 360 camera. At the same time, there's no one standout feature or gimmick with the new phone from the world's largest phone maker that makes you go wow -- after travelling the rocky road paved by the Galaxy Note7, Samsung is concentrating on getting the basics right with the S8 and larger S8+.

An iPhone. That would not ordinarily be news, but given the security concerns about the risk of hack attacks on the prolific White House tweeter, the shift is significant. Cybersecurity specialists say Trump’s decision to transition from his Android device — details of which were never disclosed but which was believed to be an unsecured, older-model Samsung — is positive for security, but doesn’t eliminate risks from hackers. “I can guarantee the Russians and Chinese will try to figure out an attack,” said John Dickson, a former air force cybersecurity officer who now works for the Texas-based Denim Group consulting firm. White House social media chief Dan Scavino confirmed the smartphone shift this week, tweeting that Trump “has been using his new iPhone for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting!” Dickson said security will depend on how the president is using the device — whether it is exclusively for tweeting — and if it is plugged into an enterprise management system that can “wall off” vulnerabilities. “If it’s a single-purpose device, the risk is minimal,” he said. “But as soon as you start clicking on things, downloading apps, granting access, that’s when things matter tremendously.” Mobile devices can be hacked to allow an attacker to listen via the phone’s microphone, access its camera, monitor geolocation or even take over the handset remotely. Former president Barack Obama carried a BlackBerry, and later a different smartphone, with security modifications that limited its functions. Trump’s switch comes despite his call for a boycott a year ago of the iPhone maker for refusing FBI requests to help hack a device for a probe into a deadly California attack. More secure? Some analysts say Apple devices may offer more security because the company controls the hardware and software and frequently updates its operating system. Apple did not respond to an AFP query on Trump’s decision. Betsy Cooper, executive director of the University of California’s Centre for Long-Term Cybersecurity said that despite Apple’s reputation, recent research has shown “that both iPhones and Android can be abused by hackers.” Cooper said it remains unclear how the president’s social media is managed — what devices are used and who has access to his personal @realDonaldTrump and official @POTUS handles on Twitter. From a security standpoint, “it would be better to eliminate the personal accounts and use only government devices and government-protected social media accounts,” Cooper said. Concerns of hacking come following Trump’s unverified allegation that his phones were tapped during last year’s election campaign, and after leaked documents from former contractor Edward Snowden showed US tapping of German leader Angela Merkel’s personal phone. Some phones are marketed as “hardened” or secure devices for people in power, but it wasn’t clear if these are used at the White House. Phone as ‘honeypot’? Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the California-based International Computer Science Institute, said Trump’s phone swap “massively reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the security risks.” But while he agreed foreign governments are likely to try to hack the phone, Weaver said US intelligence services may have modified it to be “a nice honeypot to trap attempted attacks.” A honeypot is a technique used to lure hackers and attackers to identify them and find ways to neutralise or punish them. Weaver said in a blog post earlier this year that Trump’s use of an older Android device opened massive security risks and that “the working assumption should be that Trump’s phone is compromised by at least one — probably multiple — hostile foreign intelligence services.” At the time, it was not clear what type of handset Trump was using, but a New York Times report after the inauguration said he was using “his old, unsecured Android phone.” Last month, Representative Ted Lieu of California called for an investigation, saying Trump’s phone use may be “jeopardising national security.” Dickson said that even with strong security, the president could fall victim to an attack if he uses his phone for email and web browsing. This could be in the form of “spearphishing,” or a message disguised to look as if it’s from a trusted aide or family member, but which contains malware. “This is what sophisticated attackers do,” Dickson said, and because the president’s activities are widely known, “he would be an easier target for spearphishing.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week SpaceX hails ‘revolution’ after recycled rocket launch, landing (VIDEO) Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app With new iPhone, Trump still a target for hackers ‘Fifa Mobile’ makes Hazard perfect player, adds Daily Objectives Garmin unveils the Forerunner 935, a GPS sports watch for runners and triathletes Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard WikiLeaks releases CIA hacks of Apple Mac computers Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Former Trump advisor Flynn offers testimony for immunity Trump shakes up White House staff after setbacks Democrats urge probe of Trump ties to Iran-linked oligarch Israeli cabinet approves first West Bank settlement in 20 years UN: Syria refugee total hits over five million Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   One thing that always bothered me is that whenever we casually talk about video game history, what we usually end up with is something like this: A timeline divided into console generations, showing the big console and game releases. Cool. But where's the Apple II, C64. Amiga, Spectrum ZX and the IBM PCs? Where are world-changing technologies like CD-ROMs, smartphones, the mouse or the Internet?  Sadly, video game history is often "abridged". This is just a  graph, of course, but even in the narrative of mainstream websites we rarely hear anything on the history of pre-Windows 95 computers. And I don't blame malice or "those damn millennials". There are several complicated factors in play. One is that consoles were indeed much more popular than 70's & 80's computers. Other is that home computers don't have platform owners promoting their history - Commodore, IBM, Atari, Sinclair, etc, all closed down or left the business, and Apple never showed to care about Apple II games. Bloody ingrates. But the biggest problem is how complicated their history is. Consoles are divided into eight cute and self-contained generations, but learning about home computers requires understanding things like what's a goddamn IBM PC-Compatible or the difference between CGA, EGA and VGA.  Yes, this information is available online - "just read Wikipedia". But it's a terrible approach to take a 16-year old that was born after Halo and send a 15,000+ words Wikipedia page just to know "what's an IBM PC". And even if he did, he lacks the historical context about the Apple II, C64, etc. A 70's computer to someone from the 2017 is as shocking as a 2017 computer to someone from the 70's. Just watch a bunch of teenagers in awe of a Windows 95 PC if you need proof (and wanna feel old).  As such, while working on the CRPG Book I decided to create a timeline of ALL types of video games - one that would be visually pleasing, easily shareable and ease in readers of any background.  Over 16 pages (or 8 pngs) I tried to give a notion of the importance of each event and machine, building a road map - self-contained enough to be understood without checking Wikipedia, but leaving hooks that point readers towards places that can later be explored in-depth on their own. So, without further ado, here's the full timeline gallery: http://imgur.com/gallery/u1tE9 And here I would like to invite you all to give it a read and share your opinions. I must warn beforehand that my background is in Marketing, not Computer Science, so I tend to focus on the Macro Environment a lot - and probably made a technical mistake or two along the way. If you spot anything wrong of have any suggestions, please comment or e-mail me at crpgbook@gmail.com . Consider this article a request for "peer review" - or an Early Access. ;) PS: I know that the timeline is currently confusing to read and I'm already working on a better way to show the years & months.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Manual Installation Apple Seeds macOS 10.12.5 Beta – How To Download By Necta Casiple on March 31, 2017 01:52 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Apple | Just a little over a week after rolling out macOS Sierra 10.12.4, Apple started seeding the first public beta of macOS 10.12.5 to beta testers. The update comes alongside the first developer seeds of iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. Apple did not include any significant release note, so it’s unclear what changes the new version brings to Mac. However, they likely contain only bug fixes and small revisions to the issues introduced in Monday’s big OS release, since it isn’t a full “point” update. The only insight we’ve heard from Apple so far is that it “improves the stability, compatibility, and security” of the machine. How to register for the Beta Program As announced, the new software is currently available to developers via the company’s Developer web page. For public testers, Apple plans to make macOS 10.12.5 available next month. Those who are interested in testing the beta version needs to register in the beta program first. According to Apple Insider, signing up is free and gives access to future public betas of both macOS and iOS. Apple Here’s how to register as a beta tester: Go to the OS X Beta Seed Program website and create an account. After agreeing to Apple’s terms and conditions, enroll your devices to receive notifications of new updates and beta releases for download. Once a member, all you need for download and installation is the latest version of iTunes.When a beta is released, simply connect an enrolled iOS device to an up-to-date computer and open iTunes, or alternatively run Software Update. Testers of Sierra can access beta software from the Mac App Store. Backup your data But before proceeding with the macOS 10.12.5 beta download, there are a few things to be aware of.  As always, Apple’s betas are not recommended for daily use devices or work computers. The beta program exists to iron out any issues in preparation for the public release, so there are bound to be bugs when using these early versions. That said, it’s also advised to backup data and filed before installation. “Always back up your data and files before installing beta versions of OS X. If you have multiple Macs, we recommend installing the Beta on your secondary computer. Backing up files on a Mac is easy with Time Machine, the built-in backup utility in OS X.”  If you encounter an error or a bug, MacWorld says you can use the Feedback Assistant app to send feedback. Simply open the app, select the category about which you’re providing feedback and its specific sub-area. Describe the problem in one sentence before giving a more detailed description. If the problem has something to do with a third party app, you can let the company know by reporting it via the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, the site suggests also providing feedback to the app’s developer.

As to what the situation is right now is unclear, but safe to say that there are probably quite a few people out there who are worried about. This is possibly why there seems to be a recent phone scam that has been making its rounds in which scammers are calling pretending to be from Apple, and are informing their victims that their iCloud has been hacked in order to obtain login information from them. According to MacWorld writer Glenn Fleishman, he claims that his wife has gotten no less than 6 calls from these scammers. “Earlier on Monday, my wife let me know that “Apple Support” had called about iCloud security. She was dubious, and rightly so. “Apple” then called five more times (and counting). Suffice it to say, it wasn’t Apple, but fraudsters trying to piggyback on reports that a major breach of iCloud credentials could render hundreds of millions of accounts vulnerable.” If you do receive such a call, it’s best to ignore it. Even if you think there’s a remote chance your account could be compromised, it’s probably best that you go through the motions yourself by changing your password manually. It would probably also be a good idea to enable two-factor authentication. Filed in Apple >General. Read more about hack, icloud and Security.

According to a report from The Information, Apple has hired Shiva Rajaraman to work on Apple’s video and music efforts… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report explains that Rajaraman will report to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue as Apple faces several different choices about where to take its video efforts. According to today’s report, citing two people familiar with the matter, there’s a debate going on within Apple about the direction of its videos efforts, as well as other efforts like search. It appears that Apple hasn’t developed a clear path for these areas and that executives have been unable to come to an agreement. The report notes that one possibility Apple has considered is bundling music, news, and books with new video and cable services: Executives have debated how to go forward in video. One idea that has been discussed is to bundle its music, news and book offerings with new video and cable services that could be activated via the iPhone and work on Internet-connected TVs. The hiring of Rajaraman is notable for a few reasons. He spent 8 years at YouTube, working to secure licensing content from companies like Disney for streaming. After his tenure at YouTube, Rajaraman spent two years at Spotify working on its video and podcasting efforts, licensing content from Time Warner, Disney and NBC. Rajaraman isn’t the first high-profile hire for Apple in recent months. Last month it was revealed that Apple had hired former Amazon Fire TV head and Netflix executive Timothy D. Twerdahl to head its Apple TV business. Apple was long said to be developing a streaming TV package similar to DirecTV Now and YouTube TV, but those efforts ultimately failed as the company struggled to negotiate with networks. Apple has a few of its own original video efforts in the pipeline, but it hasn’t gone all-in like Netflix and Amazon have. With these recent high-profile hirings, however, Apple seems to be looking to nail down its video and content strategies. Rajaraman and Twerdahl both bring a wealth of experience and it’s like that we’ll see the effect of their hirings sooner rather than later.

The latest details were supposedly obtained by someone “who has spoken privately with a Foxconn employee,” so just like with your friend’s uncle who works for Nintendo, you should take the rumors with a grain of salt. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT First up, the site corroborates a previous report from Mac Otakara that the next flagship Apple handset won’t be called the iPhone 8, but rather the iPhone Edition – just like the fanciest versions of the Apple Watch. It’s unclear what the moniker would be for the other two iPhone models Apple is rumored to be releasing. iDrop News provided this render, which looks “almost identical” to the prototype its report is based on: Here’s a comparison with the original iPhone for good measure. Note how though the device is significantly taller, the slim bezels means it’s not much wider: Look familiar? The design is a stone’s throw away from the upcoming Galaxy S8 and LG G6, abandoning a front facing button and minimizing bezels by implementing a taller aspect ratio. But hey, I suppose there’s only so much you can do when you fill up the entire front of the device with a screen. Here are some renders of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 for comparison:   One key difference from previous renders is that the dual camera setup is stacked vertically rather than horizontally, which could theoretically aid depth perception when using the device mounted in an AR or VR headset. Also unlike previous reports, which suggested the device would have TouchID under the display, iDrop News suggests Apple is simply apeing Android devices in moving the button to the rear. That inconvenience to long-time Apple users could be mitigated by a possible implementation of face or iris detection (again, a la Samsung). The rumor claims that Apple won’t be using a glass or ceramic back, as previously rumored, but is using a more traditional metal back. Meanwhile, the 5.8-inch OLED screen won’t be totally curved like on some of Samsung’s devices – it will simply run edge to edge and use that mild 2.5D curvature already seen in current devices. Though there’s no evidence to back up the claims, much of what’s in the report seems reasonable. For one, it always seemed unlikely the next flagship iPhone would be called the iPhone 8 or 7s. It’s the device’s 10th anniversary, after all; Apple will want something a little more ceremonious than a simple number. That said, the more traditional 4.7 and 5.5-inch models might still continue the traditional name scheme. If the rumors all hold up, I find it striking how… unexciting the new design looks. There’s little about it that we haven’t already gotten from the likes of Samsung and LG, and Xiaomi has arguably done the bezel-less design the best with the Mi Mix. Here’s to hoping Apple has something more up its sleeve than just a bigger screen – perhaps in the form of some truly revolutionary mixed reality features.

Ryan Stuart by James Eyers Paul Smith The competition regulator has rejected an application by the banks to collectively negotiate with technology giant Apple over access to the iPhone's "near field communication" (NFC) controller. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank had asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for permission to form a bloc in order to give them more negotiating power in discussions that would have asked Apple open the NFC to their own digital wallets. Apple has not made such a move for any bank in the world.  But ACCC chairman Rod Sims said on Friday the regulator was concerned that allowing the collective discussions "is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets." The ACCC said if the banks were to get access to the NFC, it could reduce competition between Apple and Google's Android phones, could reduce competition for payments devices other than smartphones, and could reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards.  The ruling is particularly significant because, despite the popularity of phones running on Google's Android operating system, Apple is by far the largest single supplier of phones in Australia. The banks want their own digital wallets to access the NFC to enable contactless payments to be made through them. Apple only allows its digital wallet to access the NFC. But the banks have refused to do a commercial deal with Apple, effectively locking three-quarters of Australia's card holders out of Apple Pay. The decision means each of the applicant banks will have to negotiate bilaterally with Apple if they want to provide Apple Pay to their millions of customers. Apple welcomed the ACCC decision. "We believe the ACCC's decision is great for Australians who want the easiest, most secure and private payment experience possible with Apple Pay. Today, millions of users from 3,500 banks in 15 markets enjoy using Apple Pay and we look forward to continuing to work with individual banks in Australia and around the world to bring Apple Pay to their customers too," an Apple spokesperson said.  Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

In a statement, they said it could stifle their ability to compete in the future market for digital wallets, which are stored on mobile phones. The banks also say it will limit the continued innovation of mobile wallets not just by banks but retailers, mass transit organisations and government entities.  Nevertheless, Westpac said it would not walk away from Apple Pay, and would look at re-engaging with the tech giant. "We remain open to partnering with Apple and we'll review our position in order to best serve our customers," the bank said.  Yet it was disappointed with the decision because Westpac said it believed open access to the NFC function on iPhones was needed to enable real choice and real competition for its customers. "Our application attracted strong support from many of Australia's leading retailers and other financial institutions who also recognised the public benefits of open NFC access and broader industry benefits," a spokeswoman said. Mr Sims said the ACCC accepted "that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments". However, if the banks got access to the NFC, this would affect Apple's current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and it "could artificially direct the development of emerging markets to the use of the NFC controller in smartphones," he said. "This is likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring around different devices and technologies or mobile payments." The regulator also pointed to digital wallets and mobile payments "being in their infancy and subject to rapid change". And while the whole banking industry is currently looking for ways to facilitate switching of cards and accounts to facilitate competition, Mr Sims said Apple wallet and other multi-issuer digital wallets could increase competition between the banks, "by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any 'lock in' effect bank digital wallets may cause."  In its most recent study research firm Telsyte estimated that there were 8 million iPhone users in Australia at the end of 2016, or 43 per cent of the smartphone user base. Telsyte also believes that phones are just an early gateway to greater adoption of mobile payments via wearable devices, where Apple is also in a strong position. It found over 50 per cent of smartwatch sales in the second half of 2016 were for Apple Watch. Its research also showed that half of Apple Watch users have used Apple Pay, 80 per cent use it regularly.    Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said Apple's concerns about reduced security through opening up its NFC chips was difficult to deny in the light of consumer concerns about payments security. He said now the ACCC ruling had been made he expected more banks to join ANZ in moving on Apple Pay. ANZ Banking Group has already done a deal with Apple to allow its customers to use Apple Pay; so has Macquarie Bank, ING and many mutuals, who are paying an undisclosed fee to Apple.  "It won't be in the best interest of any bank to publicly come out and say that they are refusing to deal with Apple, given the potential to lose customers by taking a fixed stance," Mr Fadaghi said. "Apple customers tend to be early adopters and it will be increasingly be difficult for banks to ignore this large group of influential technology users." Each bank will also have to decide whether they appeal the decision to the Australian Competition Tribunal or the Federal Court although this seems unlikely.  A spokesperson for the banks, Lance Blockley, a payments consultant who advised them on the application, said it had been made to ensure banks can participate in the future of mobile wallets "and not have the course of development for mobile wallets in Australia dictated by a single overseas corporation".  "The application attracted strong support from many of Australia's leading retailers and other financial institutions who also recognise the public benefits of open NFC access, and the subsequent flow on benefits for mobile wallet innovation and competition in Australia."  "Mobile wallets are currently overwhelmingly focussed on mobile payments, but will soon take in loyalty programs, mass transit ticketing, access, identity and a great number of other future innovations.  Ultimately there is no technical barrier standing in the way of our entire physical wallet becoming digital," he said. "Apple has a stated desire to own the entire mobile wallet, and will use the beachhead into mobile wallets afforded to them by complete control over mobile payments on iPhone to exert control over the rest of the digital wallet.  This in our view is aimed at increasing the services revenue they can earn from iPhone users."  Commonwealth Bank meanwhile declined to comment on the ACCC ruling individually, instead directing media enquiries to Mr Blockley.  magazine.afr.com ANZ NAB CBA WBC Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles Hydrogen battery firm, Carnegie join SA storage race Hydrogen battery firm says time has come Big four to curb interest-only loans 1 hr ago Contains: Infographics APRA targets investor home loans Contains: Infographics Musk's SpaceX pulls off first reused rocket Latest Stories Zoustar the big draw for Sheikh Fahad 14 mins ago Fears risky lending will shift to the shadows 19 mins ago Contains: Infographics PM scores $50m company tax 'win' 20 mins ago More Advertisement Lang Walker gambles on $100m Fijian paradise How Jose Neves built a fashion unicorn Fashion that fuses East and West 43 little accessories to stash away Why chefs need a fashion makeover 3 signs that your leadership is failing Why startups don't need corporate advisers How to foster team chemistry How to tap Silicon Valley's smarts Sydney's best and hottest new spots Wrist watches are a tough sell for millenials Walk through Australia's best homes this week Can age settle the cork v screwcap debate?

Image from the official Google blog. Google iPad users will now be able to use a native version of the Google Calendar. This will be brought by an update that brings the organisational features of the application in an app designed for the device and its Apple operating system (OS). This will be the first time the application will finally have a version compatible with the device since the Calendar was released in 2006. The app will have its core features intact. Users can see their calendars and those that other users have shared with them. Moreover, the application offers quicker scheduling options that the Calendar is famous for. This makes some Apple users choose Google's programme over the native Apple calendar.  The organisational features of the app make use of the G Suite's advanced cloud infrastructure. This allows documents to be seamlessly synchronised with a diverse set of contacts. The company also has more plans for the application. Google Calendar will eventually include a "Today" widget that allows users to see scheduled events for the day. Users may be able to see this in their Notificaton Center in future updates.  However, PC World explains that the wait for an Apple version of the Calendar can be explainable. This is because Google is the company behind Android, the rival of Apple's iOS operating system.  Regardless, this does not mean there were not any versions of the Calendar present for Apple devices. For instance, there is a version of the application for the iPhone that could be used in the tablet before. However, unlike the recent version, the older versions are not optimised for the iPad.  There are also other features that users can use to fully optimise their scheduling experience. For instance, users of Calendar can actually create different "calendars" for specific themes. They also have the option to colour-code these calendars for easy access.  Its scheduling system also lets users choose if the app should recommend a time, or if it can "match" schedules. This feature lines up the schedules of users that make use of the calendar and the app will find a compatible free time. This can be done easier as Calendar also has a "World Clock" feature that can show time in different time zones.  Events in the Calendar can also be connected to Google Hangouts. This means long-distance chat or video call meetings are automatically set in the time given. Organisers of meetings can also attach complementary files in the specific event tab. They can also specify meeting places by integrating the event with Google Maps.  Google Calendar is part of the company's G Suite. The Suite is a diverse set of "smart" applications designed for groups and teams. The applications include Gmail, Docs, Drive and the aforementioned Calendar.  Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related HTC U and Google Pixel 3 update Google launches new product designed to defy fake health information Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Australia steps up measures to detect and deter sharks 0 Shares 2 'Curb Your Enthusiasm season 9' will cause a lot of controversy, assures Mary Steenburgen 0 Shares 3 ‘Ghostbusters VR: Now Hiring’ requires PS4, VR headset and Move controllers 0 Shares 4 London tech startup aims to disrupt the digital rewards and loyalty landscape 0 Shares 5 Cannabis stocks rise by significant margin 0 Shares 6 OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 3T update 0 Shares 7 Optus to provide new 100GB, 30GB data plans for consumers, SMBs 0 Shares 8 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon heading to South Africa 0 Shares 9 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Jamie’s pig will appear next year 0 Shares 10 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Ivar and Bjorn will ‘explode in time’; The Boneless ‘doesn’t recognise boundaries’ 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Amazon to collect sales tax in Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico on April 1 Spotify acquires MightyTV, helps users decide what to watch European retailer TK Maxx chose 303 MullenLowe Qantas and Slingshot Venture Fund tap startups for airline innovation Volkswagen to sell diesel-powered cars in the US Woolworths: Pick date to pack date for supermarket produce More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance European businesses call for post-Brexit settlement, Japan’s Keidanren to take issue on ‘no Brexit deal is better than a bad deal’ US travel ‘falls off a cliff’ according to a search site ALDI, Kroger, Publix warn customers of fake discount coupons Queensland amends medicinal cannabis laws Analysis suggests US Tourism may lose US$18B, Trump travel ban to be blamed Politicians divided over cannabis legalisation More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East NFL News: Adrian Peterson working out with Jameis Winston with Tampa Bay Buccaneers 'I showed a lot of heart today,' Roger Federer says after surviving Tomas Berdych in Miami Open quarters Rafael Nadal storms past Jack Sock to reach Miami Open semis Los Angeles Lakers vs Minnesota Timberwolves live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time Manny Pacquiao next fight: Jeff Horn deal 'nearly done,' fight likely on July 2 Jimmy Butler 'as good as gone' from Chicago Bulls, according to NBA front office executive More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More Google Pixel C vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Tesla Model 3 praised by Morgan Stanley analyst Facebook Messenger to add ‘dislike’ button but will stop support for older versions of Android, iOS and Windows app Elon Musk backs brain-computer interface venture Xbox One and 360 Deals With Gold until April 3 announced Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 not expected anytime soon More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design Chris Hemsworth workout secrets revealed: Trainer tells all details of diet and exercise ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’: Gary Barlow casting confirmed 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for March 29: A big decision puts an end to two men’s agony; a murder case is revisited Adele may never tour again, says 'applause makes me feel a bit vulnerable' ‘MasterChef Junior’ Season 5 Episode 8 spoilers: Two eliminated young cooks earn a spot back in the competition [VIDEO] ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for March 29: Brooke refuses to marry a 'wandering eye', keeps Eric in the dark about his wife and son’s infidelity More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

You can install the 560–650 MB update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. The biggest new feature in iOS 10.3 is one you may not notice: it introduces Apple’s new Apple File System (APFS), which will eventually replace the legacy HFS+ file system currently in use on all of Apple’s platforms (see “What Apple’s Forthcoming APFS File System Means to You,” 24 June 2016). It remains to be seen what, if anything, this will mean for iOS users, but for now, the primary impact is a longer update process than usual while it converts the existing file system. At iMore, Rene Ritchie has a good rundown on APFS’s benefits. So far, I’m finding iOS 10.3 snappier than 10.2, but it’s impossible to say if that’s due to the new file system. Regardless, we always recommend backing up your devices before updating, but doing so is even more important with iOS 10.3. Owners of Apple’s new wireless AirPods will appreciate that iOS 10.3 lets you track the little earbuds with Find My iPhone. You can either track their location on a map or make them play a locator tone. The sound is played on both AirPods and can be muted on each one individually, so if you drop one AirPod, you can silence the one you have so you can better hear the one you’re looking for. Given that replacing just a single AirPod costs $69, this new feature is extremely welcome (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). However, there’s a catch: the AirPods must be connected to (and thus in range of) a paired device for this feature to work. So while you should be able to locate an AirPod that disappeared into the couch cushions, you likely won’t be able to find one that you lost during a run. iOS 10.3 brings support for cross-device iTunes movie rentals, which Apple first introduced in iTunes 12.6 (see “iTunes 12.6,” 21 March 2017). Now, finally, you can rent iTunes movies on one device and watch them on another, though you’ll need iTunes 12.6, iOS 10.3, and tvOS 10.2 to do so. Siri sees a few improvements with iOS 10.3, including support for paying bills in supported apps, scheduling in ride-booking apps like Lyft, and checking cricket scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. If you own a car that can be controlled via an automaker app, you gain some cool Siri capabilities, such as checking your car’s fuel level and lock status, turning lights on and off, and activating the horn. It’s probably still easier to slam your hand into the steering wheel than to say, “Hey Siri, BEEP!” Speaking of cars, CarPlay gets a few new additions, such as app shortcuts in the status bar, Up Next and the current song’s album in Apple Music’s Now Playing screen, and access to daily curated Apple Music content. Apple has rethought identity in the Settings app. Your identity now takes center stage above all other settings and provides a shortcut to a new, more coherent screen to handle your personal information, payment options, security settings, account information, and Family Sharing. Apple has also addressed the problem of Calendar spam, which made the news late last year (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). You can now delete unwanted invites and report them as junk. HomeKit sees some welcome improvements in iOS 10.3: you can now trigger scenes with switches and buttons, and the Home app now shows Accessory battery levels. Other improvements include being able to search for “parked car” in Maps, a new widget and 3D Touch action for the Podcasts app, the option to share podcasts with full playback support in Messages, and hourly weather forecasts in Maps if you 3D Touch the current temperature. Also, iOS 10.3 addresses a bug with Maps that could prevent it from showing your location after resetting Location & Privacy settings, as well as improving VoiceOver stability. There are a couple of additions not mentioned in the release notes. In iOS 10.3, developers can now respond to App Store reviews. I’ve also noticed one small change in Mail: a count of unread Inbox messages in the back button when viewing an email thread. Lastly, iOS 10.3 includes a total of 67 security fixes! When Should You Upgrade? -- Honestly, although Apple doesn’t even mention the move to APFS in its user-level release notes, that’s the main reason to hold off. If there’s some subtle problem that surfaces only once hundreds of thousands of devices have updated to iOS 10.3, you don’t want to be among that group. So we recommend waiting at least a week before installing iOS 10.3, and perhaps longer if you don’t use AirPods, suffer from Calendar spam, or automate your house with HomeKit. After that, though, give it a whirl and enjoy the new features!

Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-28 23:38 I think the change in the iOS file system, which is part of the APFS version of the OS, is the most significant change in iOS 10.3. Almost, I'd say, earth shaking, or, at least, groundbreaking. APFS will be coming to the Mac in the near future, which means iOS and macOS will be truly compatible for the first time. This will provide significantly improved interoperability between iOS devices and the Mac. It should be particularly important for the iPad, which people use for actual work from time to time. The lack of an accessible file system provided iOS with both security and simplicity. But those advantages have been overshadowed as iOS has gotten more capable and the iPad in particular has become more like a computer than was originally imagined. Once iDevices and the Mac have parallel and compatible operating systems, the sky's the limit. Of course, the impact of this change on developers will also be important, if not frightening. And I certainly agree with Josh that it would be wise to hold off on the upgrade until you find out what early adopters (otherwise knows as unpaid beta testers) discover about iOS 10.3. If experience is any guide, the upgrade will have plenty of problems that will need sorting out. I will do the same when the macOS receives the APSF upgrade. If we are lucky it will solve more problems than it creates. Be that as it may, right now, for me at least, macOS 12.3 Sierra is stable. I'm not in a hurry to break it. Reply barefootguru   2017-03-29 15:43 APFS does have a lot of advantages, but I'm not following what you're saying: - Until now both iOS and macOS *have* shared the same HFS+ filing system, so that's not changing. - Apple released the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9 for users to view some of the file system; and AFAIK has no plans to expose more of the underlying file system. - APFS is transparent to developers in all but a few edge cases. Reply brent  2017-03-30 04:24 since this will brick your TidBITS app, will you be upgrading it? Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-30 15:52 Probably not because very few people actually use the app. It's basically just a dedicated RSS reader, so most people are better served by an RSS app, Apple News, or just email.

"That's been the kiss of death for the last two supercycles, the coal super cycle in 2011 and the fracking sand supercycle in 2014, both being called right before coal and then oil collapsed," the "Mad Money" host said. "I hate the term. It creates ridiculous expectations." For now, the Apple shorts have been stifled as the stock held up even with Samsung's S8 release. But Cramer said to watch for reviews of Apple's next phone if you're itching for the next short opportunity. "If you were ever going to short Apple, you'd have to wait until the real Apple bar-raisers express their disappointment in the eighth iteration. And they will, believe me. We just don't know from what level," Cramer said. Getty Images Inside Nasdaq Marketsite in New York City. After the Nasdaq posted a record close on Thursday, Cramer realized that sometimes, it really is all about unraveling the shorts. "The net impact here is that when the shorts are wrong, they create a wave effect of fierce buying that's like a a huge burst of acetylene on an already-lit fire. That's a big part of what's been happening here with some of these huge market capitalization Nasdaq stocks that just seem to levitate almost daily," Cramer said. See Apple's success, or take Amazon, the e-commerce powerhouse that is spending all over the place and fueling its burgeoning stock price through innovation and efficiency. "We basically want the company to grow revenues more than show profits and that's exactly what it's doing. This record-breaking move has been made on the backs of the short-sellers who thought, wrongly, once again, that Amazon's growth had finally begun to peter out," Cramer said. So while Cramer does not think shorting is a bad strategy, having practiced it for years at his old hedge fund, he does believe it can occasionally result in serious damage to companies, or in a surge of buying like we have seen in March. "Some will call it a blow-off in these names. Me? I just say the shorts got the wrong side of the trade," he said. Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon CEO Some stocks, however, have been hit hard despite the market's upward trajectory. But even though the stock may be spiraling, Lululemon Athletica CEO Laurent Potdevin has a proactive approach to saving the Canadian retailer's shares and reputation. Potdevin told Cramer in a Thursday interview that since Lululemon began seeing the weaker results that sent its stock plunging after Wednesday's earnings report, the company has been flexing its creative muscle and introducing new products and colors to their mix. "I feel very confident about the steps that we've taken and how quickly they've had an impact on our performance," Potdevin told Cramer. "We've seen [an] instant pickup in our performance." Cramer also caught up with Honewell's outgoing CEO Dave Cote for a look into how the industrial giant managed to hit new highs under his leadership. One of the most stunning aspects of the company was how well it outperformed its competition during the financial crisis that started in 2008, when Cote was CEO. Cote told Cramer on Thursday that by focusing on the company's three main constituencies — its customers, its employees, and its shareholders — his team was able to prioritize its responsibilities and help the company thrive how it could. "We took a vision right from the beginning that said, 'Okay, this really sucks. It just does. And that's why they call it a recession and they don't call it a party. So we're all going to work harder than we ever did before and it's going to seem very unrewarding,'" Cote recalled. Karen Stern | CNBC Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips CEO speaking on March 7, 2017. In energy news, Cramer saw ConocoPhillips' sale of a portion of its oil sands to Canadian producer Cenovus as a sign that the oil glut will keep prices low for a while. "In one fell swoop ConocoPhillips confirmed a lot of what's become the conventional wisdom in the oil patch: the price of crude's not going to roar higher any time soon, even as it rallied nicely again today, climbing back over $50," the "Mad Money" host said. The oil glut is here to stay, and if you're a daring investor, Cramer said Cenovus' new tar sands essentially make its stock a call option on oil prices. "Personally, though, I'd much rather own an almost-Canadian-tar-sands-free Conoco than a debt-laden play on that now-out-of-style project," Cramer said. In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some of his callers' favorite stocks: Prosperity Bank: "If you're going to buy a bank in Texas, you're going to buy Cullen-Frost, okay? We had them on recently. I think they tell a fantastic story. I want to go Cullen-Frost." Advanced Micro Devices: "We've liked it now for about 100 percent and we're not giving up. We liked the fixed balance sheet, we like that all-new line of chips, we like the fact that they've got gaming chips. It's a junior Nvidia. Not going to be as good as Nvidia, but a junior. Nvidia's starting to get jiggy here." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo 1/2 left right An Apple logo is seen in a store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 24, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson 2/2 By Jamie Freed | SYDNEY SYDNEY Apple Inc on Friday won a victory in its global fight to prevent banks from introducing their own mobile payment services on Apple devices, as an Australian regulator barred lenders from bargaining collectively for access. The decision by Australia's competition watchdog, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on iPhones and Apple Watches that could be used for contactless payments instead of the Apple Wallet. The banks had hoped to circumvent transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps, potentially unlocking more of Australia's contactless payment market valued at an estimated $84 billion a year. "It will have global implications," Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims told Reuters after the ruling came down. "If others need to think it through ... we’ve at least got something out there which they can kick off from." A win by four of the largest Australian banks involved in the case, which command two-thirds of the nation's credit card market, would have given them more negotiating power and could have sparked similar appeals to regulators for access to Apple's systems in other jurisdictions around the world. Apple does not allow any of its 3,500 bank partners in 15 global markets access to the near-field communication (NFC) technology behind its payment system. The Australian regulator was concerned that giving the banks bargaining power could reduce competition by forcing Apple to act more like Alphabet Inc, whose Google arm owns the more open Android operating system that allows contactless payments from individual apps. "(Apple and Android) are very different offerings and they have different implications for ease of use, security and customer experience," Sims said. "It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor." An Apple spokeswoman said it was a great decision for Australians who wanted the "easiest, most secure and private payment experience possible with Apple Pay". The banks involved - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd - have yet to allow use of their cards with Apple Pay, which was introduced to the country last year. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd began offering Apple Pay to customers last year after reaching a deal with the U.S. company, while Macquarie Group Ltd and ING Groep NV's ING Direct introduced Apple Pay in February. ONE AT A TIME Payments consultant MWE Consulting last year estimated the Australian "tap and go" market at A$110 billion ($84.32 billion) a year and growing, although to date more transactions are with contactless cards than mobile phones. Lance Blockley, a payments expert representing the four banks involved in the Australian ruling, said they would now review their strategies regarding Apple Pay individually. "I suspect Apple will want to talk about Apple Pay rather than NFC access," he said, referring to any future negotiations. A Westpac spokeswoman said the bank remained open to introducing Apple Pay, while CBA and NAB declined to comment and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank could not be reached immediately for comment. Steve Worthington, a business professor at Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology, said the four banks that battled Apple might now pay a financial price for doing so in the form of higher fees for using Apple Pay. "If you were in Apple’s shoes what would you do?," he said. "Would you give them the same deal (as the early adopters) or would you punish them by trying to make it more favorable to Apple?"

Don’t worry, a new developer beta — iOS 10.3.2 — was promptly released the very next day. We already told you about all the best new features in iOS 10.3, and we also drew attention to one feature in particular, a hidden change that gives the iPhone and iPad a nice little speed boost. If you haven’t already updated though, there’s one feature that we should warn you about because we’ve received a handful of emails from people who have run into some serious problems.   Don't Miss: Samsung’s Galaxy S8 tried to copy a signature iPhone 7 feature, but failed miserably Among the behind-the-scenes changes in iOS 10.3, Apple’s move to a new file system is clearly the biggest. Prior to iOS 10.3, all iOS devices used the popular HFS+ file system. Beginning with iOS 10.3, however, Apple has moved to the more modern Apple File System (APFS). There are a number of advantages to switching to Apple’s new file system, but the big ones are better optimization for NAND flash storage and SSD storage, more accurate time stamping, and support for stronger encryption. HFS+ is 30 years old at this point, so it was clearly time for a change. Here’s the problem, however: once you update your phone to iOS 10.3 and your file system is converted to APFS, you can no longer roll back without wiping your phone and reinstalling an older iOS build. Why is that significant? Because if something goes wrong and you roll back to an older build, you’ll no longer be able to recover data because everything will have been converted to APFS. So, a word of warning: Back. Up. If you haven’t already upgraded to iOS 10.3, be sure to back up all of your data before you do. This can be done either with iCloud (Settings > iCloud > iCloud Backup > Back Up Now) or by backing up using iTunes. It might take a little while, but waiting a few minutes while your iPhone backs up is much less aggravating than losing some or even all of your data.

Our original report on this was titled "Apple Tells Australian Commission that Three Top Banks are in a Cartel to Dictate Terms for Apple Pay." We covered the ongoing war over at least six reports (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) since then covering various phases and angles playing out in the press. The Australian Fintech war encouraged South Korea's Fintech industry to attempt the same tactic against Apple to force them to open up their Apple Pay APIs. So there was a lot riding on the Australian Commission's ruling. Today the ruling came down in Apple's favor.   According to Reuters Australia, "Australia's competition regulator on Friday said it would bar a group of the country's largest banks from bargaining collectively for access to Apple Inc's contactless payment function, potentially setting a global precedent.   The decision, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on devices like the iPhone and Apple Watch that could be used for contactless payments instead of the Apple Wallet.   That would have enabled banks to circumvent transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps, potentially unlocking more of Australia's contactless payment market.   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement that "While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments."

This is because the other major banks feel that Apple is being unfair in the negotiations which is why they have also requested that they be allowed to collectively negotiate for a better deal. It turns out that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has decided that they will not allow these banks to collectively negotiate and have since officially rejected their proposal to do so. This is due to the country’s anti-cartel laws that helps to ensure that competition is fair and unhindered during the negotiating process. According to the ACCC chairman Rod Sims, “The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments.” As to what this means for Apple Pay in the country, we guess the banks and Apple will have to work together to figure something out, but until that happens Apple users in the country won’t be able to use the service, unless they’re with ANZ.

According to a Nielsen study in 2014, 55 percent of adults aged between 18 and 34 years used mobile payments.Venmo—which has now become ingrained itself as a verb among its young consumers—reported it facilitated $2.1 billion in payments in the third quarter of 2015, three times more than the same quarter last year. Square is planning to go public next week, and its current evaluation is set at $3.9 billion.The mobile payment market has been the new frontier for tech titans to expand over the past year.

According to a new report from The Jakarta Post, the research and development center will begin operations during the second quarter of this year while iPhone 7 sales will begin in the country tomorrow… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple’s new institution in Indonesia is said to develop educational programs for 300 to 400 local students, according to today’s report. The report cites Industry Ministry expert staff member Sanny Iskandar, who reportedly met with Apple representatives today. Apple is planning three R&D centers in Indonesia and the first one will open in Green Office Park in BSD City, Tangerang. For those unfamiliar, Tangerang is a city located in the province of Banten. As for the other two R&D centers, one is said to be located in Java, while the other is said to be located in the Toba area in North Sumartra. All together, Apple’s three R&D centers in Indonesia will cost the company $44 million. As has been reported in the past, this investment will put Apple in compliance with local regulations that say a certain percentage of production must occur in Indonesia in order for a product to be sold there. In this case, Apple’s $44 million R&D effort counts towards that regulation. Today’s report adds that the iPhone 7 will resume sales in Indonesia tomorrow. The company was not able to sell several models of its iPhone 6 series after the government issued a regulation, which required phone makers to meet a certain amount of local content, including through the establishment of R&D centers. Apple finally agreed to comply with the regulation early this year by committing to building the centers and pledging to pour US$44 million into the R&D in Indonesia until 2018. (yon) (tas) Indonesia marks an important country for Apple’s business as it’s world’s fourth most populous country after China, India and the USA. The regulations set forth by the Indonesian government are similar, albeit slightly more relaxed, than the ones set forth in India. Apple is continuing to work towards establishing an official retail presence in India and plans to begin manufacturing the iPhone in the country within 4-6 weeks. The timeline for an official retail presence, however, is unclear.   Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Or so the dogma goes. Recently, the conversation has started to shift. As Apple prioritized its mobile products and showed minimal innovation on macOS, Microsoft began to sell itself as the new platform of choice for creative-types. This culminated with hype-train around the Surface Studio, a purpose-built device that catered more to creative professionals than anything Apple has built in years. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT But hardware is only half the equation, and so we also have the Windows 10 Creators Update, which Microsoft today announced will be rolling out to everyone starting April 11. I’ve had the chance to play with the Creators Update for some time now; though the name is a little bit hyperbolic, Microsoft has added several useful features to its OS in just eight months since the huge Anniversary Update. Here are some of the best. Microsoft Edge gets legit tab management Microsoft Edge is great if you want to conserve battery, but otherwise there’s little to compel you to use it over alternatives like Chrome or Firefox. The Creators Update adds some features to make it worth your while. For one, you can now see visual previews of tabs by pressing arrow next to the new tab button. Perhaps more useful is a “Set these tabs aside” feature, which lets you clear up tabs while still being able to acccess them later. This kind of feature is available to other browsers through extensions, but it’s neat to see it integrated right into the browser itself. Edge becomes an ereader Microsoft sees Edge more than a simple web browser, but rather an app for handling all sorts of reading. It can now load EPUB files in addition to websites and PDFs, including a full-fledged ereader experience. You can adjust the font and text size on e-books, set bookmarks, search for terms, and do most of the the basic things you expect from an ereader. Paint goes 3D Paint is getting its first major update since Windows 7, and arguably its biggest update ever. Say hello to Paint 3D. Yes, Paint can now create 3D models, as well as import them from the Remix3D online community. It can even print to 3D, assuming you have the right hardware or export to a 3D printing service. Give it a try – it’s surprisingly easy to use. Picture-in-picture mode for videos We’ve all done that dance where we arrange and resize windows so we can watch videos on one corner of our screen while we work on another. Now Windows is making your life easier with a Picture-in-Picture feature called ‘mini view’. Basically, apps will now be able to create an always-on-top window so that you don’t have to worry about your video getting obscured while you switch between apps. Unfortunately, it’s limited to the stock Movies & TV app for now, though I’m sure developers will pick up on the feature quickly. That being said, simply adding a universal option to the OS for always keeping certain apps on top would be way more useful, as it’s a feature I’d like to try for more than just video. Night Light’s blue light filter will help you fall asleep more easily By now you’ve probably heard that blue-ish wavelengths of light tend to keep you up at night, which is why we’ve seen blue light filters built into iOS, macOS, and Android device. Now Windows has a native option too, called Night Light. You can go to Settings > System > Display to adjust Night Light’s settings, including color temperature and active hours. Dynamic Lock protects you data when you leave your computer If you’re the type of person who presses Win + L to lock your computer everytime you leave your desk, you’ll appreciate Dynamic Lock. First you pair your smartphone or tablet with your computer. The computer will automatically lock whenever your device leaves Bluetooth range. Surround sound for everyone One of the coolest features in Windows 10 is native support for spatial sound. That means the OS can now turn any regular pair of earbuds into a virtual 7.1 surround sound system – or even implement more advanced techniques like Dolby Atmos. For more on why this is a pretty huge deal, check out post about Dolby Atmos on Windows 10 here. Scribble on Maps, photos, and videos Long-time Google Maps users might be reluctant to try another navigation solution, but Microsoft is adding some pretty neat tricks to its own Maps software on the Creators Update. You can now use a stylus to draw on the map. Aside from just doodling over your landscape of choice, you can now estimate travel distance by simply drawing a route within Maps. You can even create turn-by-turn directions based off of your scribbles. The same goes for photos and videos, which you can now draw on to add annotations or even create animations you can export to share with friends and family. ‘Game Mode’ protects you from dropped frames Game Mode tries to ensure your computer is always maximizing its resources for an optimal gaming experience. No, it’s not going to turn your measly integrated GPU into an Nvidia 1080; though frame rates might see a mild improvement, the emphasis is on consistent frame rates rather than absolute performance. It should, in theory, prevent your game from experience sudden frame drops, even if an application running in the background decides to do something funky. You can turn the feature on and off from the new Gaming section of the Settings menu. Microsoft has a whitelist of games for which it’s automatically turned on, but you can also manually activate or deactivate it by pressing Win + G while a game is running. Speaking of Win + G, you can now start a livestream to Beam by simply using the shortcut and clicking the broadcast button. Support for Windows Mixed Reality headsets The Creator’s Update enables support for upcoming Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Though these are still a ways off, they’ll provide a cheaper alternative to the likes of Oculus and Vive, starting at $300. More work to be done There are some neat features in the update, but there’s more work to be done if Microsoft wants Windows really be considered the OS for creators. Part of what draws people to Apple is its design cohesion. Meanwhile, Windows 10 still functions as a mish-mash of legacy apps and modern styling. I mean, why do I need a separate control panel and settings menu? Why does Windows color management suck? The world may never know. Still, the Creator’s Update is solid example of the benefits of turning Windows as a service; in just a few short months, Windows 10 has become a lot more powerful. Here’s to hoping Project Neon can fix some of the OS’ more glaring UI problems. For more on features coming to the Creators Update, check out Microsoft’s blog post below.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues With the new iPad, Apple keeps simplifying its product lines Jason Snell 31 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Nineteen years ago, Steve Jobs unveiled his simplified Mac product strategy of a box divided into four squares: Power Mac, PowerBook, iMac, and a question mark that would eventually be filled in by the iBook. These days Apple can’t fit its key product lines, let alone individual products, in four squares. But there are strong signs that Apple is in the midst of executing a strategy to simplify its product lines and, ultimately, make it easier for consumers to understand what products Apple is offering. The Mac evolution For a long time, Apple has split the Mac laptop product line in two, with the non-pro laptop (iBook, MacBook) separate from the pro model (PowerBook, MacBook Pro). The introduction of the MacBook Air confused things quite a bit, given that it wasn’t powerful enough to be a pro-level laptop, but it was so expensive that it couldn’t reasonably be considered a mid-range model. These days, the MacBook Air is on the way out. It seems to still exist mostly because it’s the cheapest of all Mac laptops, and by all accounts still sells incredibly well. But it’s clear that Apple’s ultimate goal is to drop the MacBook Air and leave the Mac laptop line with two names: MacBook and MacBook Pro. Goodbye Air? As was the case before the Air muddied the waters, each product name can encompass a variety of different products. There’s currently only one MacBook, but there are three MacBook Pro models—two with a Touch Bar and one without. And we can identify traits that define a MacBook Pro, from price to more powerful processors to Thunderbolt 3 ports. As has been Apple’s tradition basically forever on the Mac side, Apple really doesn’t want to sell last year’s model of Mac concurrently with its latest model. The slower 2015 MacBook isn’t being sold alongside the current 2016 model, for example. Sometimes, an older generation is kept around for specific and quirky reasons—witness not just the MacBook Air, but the old-style 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros, which Apple still sells, but only if you scroll way down Apple’s webpages. These are side effects of a transition to a new product line; wait long enough and they will disappear. No more Air Apple’s announcements from last week suggest that the company is beginning to apply the same product-line approach to the iPad that it’s been applying to its laptops for ages. The Air name lingers in the MacBook line, but it’s been eradicated from the iPad, replaced by a new iPad that’s based on the iPad Air’s body but has somewhat upgraded internals. With this move, Apple has opened a clearer space between the iPad and the iPad Pro, in terms of both price and features. It’s very much meant to parallel the MacBook and MacBook Pro. And, after several years of creating lower-priced products by taking last year’s cutting-edge model and selling it at a discount, Apple’s removed throwback models from the iPad price list entirely. People who want to buy a new iPad are no longer force to choose between the high-powered iPad Pro and an array of rapidly aging models from previous years; now they can choose between the iPad Pro and a more affordable iPad. It’s simpler and clearer. I would expect that when Apple does decide to update the iPad Pro, it will do so in a way that irons out the differences between the current 9.7- and 12.9-inch models. They’ll share the same processors and screen technologies and charging ports and the product line will make even more sense. (And, like laptops, the models will be differentiated more by screen size than by anything else.) Apple Phone? The big question is, does this move to simplify the naming of the MacBook and iPad lines suggest that Apple will do the same for the iPhone? Apple has already taken a step in this direction by releasing the iPhone SE—which, like the new iPad, combines older tech in an affordable “new” product with a simple name. Rumors abound that this fall, in addition to updating the iPhone 7, Apple may also release a more dramatic new phone design. If you think about those rumors in the context of Apple’s current naming schemes, it’s at least plausible that Apple might choose to name that dramatic new iPhone—full of cutting-edge technology and a high price tag—the iPhone Pro. Then the update to the iPhone 7 could simply be called the iPhone 7S, or (if Apple really wanted to get simple), just the new iPhone (2017). Apple could even drop the Plus suffix from its larger phones, if it wanted. Instead, it could market the iPhone as coming in 5.5- and 4.7-inch models. Will it happen? As I tell everyone who comes to me with a theory that it’s only a matter of time before the iPhone becomes Apple Phone and the iMac becomes Apple Mac as a part of a grand renaming scheme, sometimes the power and value of an existing brand is enough to override a company’s desire for consistency. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product by a country mile. It’s become wildly successful, despite the fact that it’s a little confusing that Apple sells models from multiple years at different price points. The addition of an iPhone Plus variant didn’t confuse people—it boosted sales. So, it’s entirely possible that Apple will tread much more lightly when it comes to simplifying iPhone product naming. But I have to admit that the currently circulating iPhone rumors fit nicely with the idea of naming those products iPhone and iPhone Pro. They fit, quite nicely, in the modern version of Steve Jobs’s box.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, Rod Sims, said the watchdog was concerned the proposed move by Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank was “likely to reduce or distort competition” in several markets. The ACCC’s final decision on Friday is in line with its draft ruling on 29 November. The four banks applied in July to negotiate as a collective over the use of Apple Pay, which allows touch-and-go payments on iPhones. Competition regulator's grilling on banks was exquisite torture Read more The banks had argued that Apple Pay prevented them from developing their own integrated digital wallets for iPhones, which they said would increase competition and consumer choice in Australia. Restrictions on passing fees associated with Apple Pay on to customers were also a sticking point. But the regulator rejected the application, meaning each bank will have to reach an individual agreement with Apple before its customers can use Apple Pay. The ACCC said it accepted that allowing the banks to negotiate collectively and potentially boycott Apple Pay would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, but that the benefits for customers were “currently uncertain and may be limited”. It said reductions in competition caused by allowing the banks to collectively negotiate would be significant, and three likely detriments stood out in particular. “First, Apple and Android compete for consumers providing distinct business models,” Sims said. “If the applicants are successful in obtaining NFC [near field communication] access, this would affect Apple’s current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google. Apple Pay stoush turns sour with ruling against Australian banks Read more “Second, digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change. In Australia, consumers are used to making tap-and-go payments with payment cards, which provide a very quick and convenient way to pay. There is also a range of alternative devices being released that allow mobile payments; for example, using a smartwatch or fitness device. It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop. “Access to the NFC in iPhones for the banks could artificially direct the development of emerging markets to the use of the NFC controller in smartphones. This is likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring around different devices and technologies for mobile payments,” Sims said. The conduct was also likely to reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards. “Finally, Apple Wallet and other multi-issuer digital wallets could increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any ‘lock-in’ effect bank digital wallets may cause,” Sims said. ANZ, American Express and Cuscal, which represents 13 issuers, had reached previous agreements with Apple over Apple Pay in Australia.

Vishal Mathur With iOS 10.3, Apple is finally switching to a new file format known as Apple File System. Apple is now rolling out the iOS 10.3 update for iPhone, iPad and the iPod Touch. The latest operating system (OS) brings a bunch of new features as well as performance enhancements, and would most likely be the last big iOS 10 update. There is the redesigned iCloud option, which now shows your Apple ID information as well as the storage details in one place. The CarPlay experience has also been improved, with interface redesigns and additional information screens in different apps that make control easier. Virtual assistant Siri can now pull out cricket scores and stats from International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments as well as annual the Indian Premier League (IPL) extravaganza. Apple has also added a notification in case you open an app that runs the older 32-bit architecture, suggesting that this app will not work with future versions of iOS—it is believed that the iOS 11 software will completely drop support for 32-bit apps, and developers have been getting warnings from Apple about this, as far back as 2015. There is also a new Podcasts widget, updates to SiriKit, 3D Touch actions for Maps and widened support for HomeKit. However, we haven’t even talked about the most critical bit yet—security. Click here for enlarge Also Read | Review: Apple iPhone 7 Plus With iOS 10.3, Apple is finally switching to a new file format known as Apple File System (APFS). This replaces the HFS+ file system that has been in use since 1998, on computers and subsequently phones (it was an evolution of the HFS standard that was introduced in 1985). When you install iOS 10.3 on your iPhone or iPad, for example, it will automatically convert the storage filesystem from HFS+ to APFS. The advantages of APFS include optimized storage (which means critical space may get freed up on the same device) and faster read and write speeds (which will improve overall performance) on solid state and flash drives. However, the biggest change is the security aspect. APFS provides full disk encryption as well as encryption for individual files and folders—with the option of no encryption, single-key encryption and multi-key encryption. APFS will not change how you see your documents, folders and files. Visually, and structurally, things will remain the same as they were earlier, since all the changes are happening behind the scenes. The APFS system has been designed to run on iOS, macOS, tvOS and WatchOS, and we should see specific updates for the other three platforms sometime in the near future. Apple documentation suggests that no data will be deleted or lost during this conversion process—however, just to be on the safe side, we would recommend a complete backup of the iPhone or iPad, before installing the update.

The iPhone 5 is a well grizzled veteran at this stage in the smartphone realm with it being introduced to the market way back in September of 2012, with the iPhone 5 S following it into the market a year later. In tech terms, they're dinosaurs and it seems like Apple are of a similar opinion. Earlier this week, Apple released iOS 10.3 with a host of updates for their devices included in the new software. Less than a day later they released iOS 10.3.2 beta, for testing on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The latest iOS 10.3.2 beta version issued on Tuesday only contains restore images for 64-bit devices, but no restore images for 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 and fourth-generation iPad. "Apple continues its push toward an all 64-bit future and last year began warning iOS 10 users that 32-bit apps might negatively impact system performance. "More recently, users attempting to open 32-bit software in iOS 10.3 are met with the message, 'This app will not work with future versions of iOS,' a clear indication that legacy apps are on their way out," wrote tech magazine Apple Insider. While this is not a definitive sign that 32-bit devices are on their way out, it does indicate that Apple will be dropping support for their older hardware. Advertisement Whether they will cut off support completely for 32-bit hardware with the forthcoming iOS 10.3.2 update remains unknown. Since iOS 10.3.2 is still in beta testing, support for 32-bit devices could still be added at a later date. As it is, it's not looking good for users of the iPhone 5. Episode 5 of our brand new podcast The Capital B has arrived!

The repair team also, however, expressed doubts as to Apple’s claim that the device’s screen was brighter than that of previous generations. Now, however, the iFixit team has put the new iPad through additional tests to further confirm or refute Apple’s brightness claim… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case iFixit stated this evening on Twitter that after more tests, it can say that the new $329 iPad features a display that is 44 percent brighter than the iPad Air 1. As for how the screen compares to the iPad Air 2’s, things are still a bit muddled there and Apple hasn’t offered up any official details, but we can speculate. One difference between the new iPad and the iPad Air 2 is the turn to an unfused display panel that the iPad Air 1 featured. Here’s what iFixit originally had to say regarding the $329 iPad display: In Apple’s press release announcing the iPad 5, they told us it comes equipped with a “brighter 9.7-inch Retina display.” Our question is: brighter than what? It doesn’t look that different from the Air 1’s display. If they mean brighter than the Air 2, then that may simply be due to reverting to the unfused display design of the Air 1. iFixit also notes that the digitizer from the new iPad Air 1 is actually compatible with the new iPad’s, so if you switch the new iPad’s LCD into the Air 1, you’ll get a brighter display. Apple has yet to comment on some of the display brightness speculations, but it originally touted that the new iPad features a “brighter 9.7-inch Retina display.” It’s still not explicitly clear as to what sort of improvements Apple made here, and it could be that the new iPad is brighter than the iPad Air 1 because of the return to the unfused display. Of note, the iPad Air 2 display was somewhat dimmer than the iPad Air 1. As we noted in 2014, the anti-reflective coating used by the iPad Air 2 led to the display being around 8 percent dimmer and less efficient: Apart from the anti-reflective features of the new iPad Air 2 display, however, DisplayMate says the display performs identical to the iPad 4 and “slightly lower in performance” than the first-generation iPad Air. In its tests it found the iPad Air 2 display to have 8% lower Brightness and 16% lower display Power Efficiency compared to the original iPad Air. The report speculates it’s likely a result of comprises with the backlight in order to produce a thinner device. This means that in all likelihood, the new iPad’s display should be brighter than the iPad Air 2’s display, as well. Read our breakdown of all of the differences between the new iPad and the iPad Air 2 here. Have you gotten your hands on the new iPad yet? If so, let us know what you think of it down in the comments and watch our hands-on below. We put the new iPad through more tests: The display on the iPad 5 has ~44% greater luminance than the LCD in the Air 1. — iFixit (@iFixit) March 30, 2017 Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Oh! Really? Red iPhone: Apple is Finally Red To Save Lives. Oh! Really? March 30, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Red iPhone is taking the world by storm and has inspired many brands to join the bandwagon. With its slogan “Buy Red, Give Life,” Cupertino based tech giant Apple is encouraging people around the world to support its cause against HIV/AIDS. In partnership with Red organization, Apple has recently introduced its Red iPhone 7 Special Edition on March 24, 2017. However the innovative approach will save lives of many, but is this the only reason Apple introduced the special edition this year? Or it’s a clever marketing move by the company to save its mobile division as the iPhone sales is sinking? A Noble Cause Apple has raised US$130 million by selling RED products and aims to take the world close to HIV-free generation with each sale. With a positive impact on over 90 million people, this partnership has been doing the same since last 10 years. So, this is not the first time Apple is working on any such project, but this is indeed the first time when the company has taken a step forward and introduced the first ever red phone. A Clever Marketing Move After numerous experiments on size, design, colors and materials, Apple is delivering its range of iPhone products with little differences to distinguish. Last year, the company reported a significant fall in its iPhone sales. However later in the year, Apple witnessed more than expected sales, but it couldn’t even touch the previous year’s sales figures. This launch is undoubtedly a clever marketing move by Apple, as the phone is taking the internet and the world by storm. Apple launched its low-cost iPad at the same time when it introduced the Red iPhone. But, if you look at the search trends and compare these devices, Apple’s red-colored iPhone is seeing overwhelming response from digital generation. Have a look at this search trend comparison between the new iPad and the Red iPhone. A Game Changer Gone are the days when the gold devices were known as the synonym of premium quality and ultra-rich class. With time, this trend no more exists at the level it existed before. The design language is changed and with its new red-colored iPhone, Apple appears to be the game changer. Now, when almost every small smartphone maker is bringing gold mobile phone bodies, the trend is dying rapidly and will no longer be called a ‘hot tech trend.’ Fuelling a Revolutionary Change It’s not just Apple that turned red, in fact a large number of brands have recently introduced red color inspired products. From Durex to Audi, Toyota and even Coca-Cola have jumped into the game and their advertisements are showing their love for the red. Obviously, the companies want to sail on the same boat being led by Apple’s now viral content marketing strategy. With its latest move, Apple has proved that businesses do not need to follow the ‘premium’ label for long time, as such trends are temporary and the synonyms of ‘premium’ can be changed anytime. More specifically for the smartphone makers, Apple’s Red iPhone has a strong message that being premium doesn’t mean being boring and you need to be innovative and unique to rediscover something fresh that people would care choosing. iPhone Red Features and Specifications Apple has launched the phone in two variants powered by iOS 10. Featuring great quality, advanced camera, stereo speakers, dust and water resistant design, the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus bring redesigned version of Apple’s proprietary applications and enhanced security features. The official press note by Apple confirms that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition are available in two different storage capacity options including 128GB and 256GB. Interested fans can buy the products online or from authorized Apple Stores. If you consider buying the newly dressed iPhone 7 devices, the special edition phones are now available to buy. The shipping for over 40 countries around the world will start from the March end and Apple is also aiming to cover more regions from April 2017.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 27th, 2017 at 10:43 AM Share Tweet It seems like a lifetime ago at this point but believe it or not, Samsung’s flagship smartphones used to be pretty… awful. Samsung’s displays were always incredible and its flagship phones always offered the best Android performance money could buy, but the company’s designs were not very good at all. And the materials Samsung used for the phones’ housings was the worst part. While Apple and other companies were using glass and aluminum for their phones, Samsung insisted on using thin plastic that felt flimsy and cheap. Can you believe this was the back of a $640 smartphone? Of course, that all feels like a distant memory because Samsung’s more recent smartphones have been premium through and through. Galaxy S6 started the trend, and the company’s designs have been continuously refined with the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. As good as Samsung’s designs have gotten, however, even hardcore Android fans were willing to admit that Apple still had the edge. With the Galaxy S8, however, it’s probably time to admit that the tide is turning. Don't Miss: 5 Sonos alternatives with killer sound at a fraction of the price As Apple looks to breathe new life into its old iPhone designs by adding new matte black, Jet Black and red color options, Samsung is getting ready to release the sleekest and most stunning smartphone the world has ever seen. Sorry, Apple fans, but it’s time to face facts: the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sport a design that is now almost three years old. Meanwhile, the upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ sport a design that is flat-out incredible. We’ve seen it a number of times now. BGR exclusively published some of the first live shots nearly a month ago, and photos and renders have been flooding the internet ever since. Following a massive rush of leaks this past weekend, graphic designer Benjamin Geskin posted a simple image that does an outstanding job of showing just how far Samsung has come in its smartphone rivalry with Apple. Image Source: Benjamin Geskin The image above shows leaked Galaxy S8 and S8+ renders sandwiched between renders of the iPhone 7 on the left, and the iPhone 7 Plus on the right. A few important things are immediately apparent. First, Samsung’s stunning Galaxy S8 and S8+ designs get closer than any mass-market smartphone has ever come to achieving the all-screen design smartphone users are clamoring for. Look closely and you can see that the smaller Galaxy S8, which is about the same width but slightly taller than the iPhone 7, has a larger display than the massive iPhone 7 Plus. Then, you can see that the Galaxy S8+ is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, and yet it packs a 6.2-inch Super AMOLED display compared to the 5.5-inch screen on the Apple phablet. That’s a 13% larger screen in a phone that’s about the same size. Couple that with a sleek design that features curved edges on the front and back of the phones, and you’ve got handsets that look better and feel better than Apple’s latest iPhones. Samsung is set to unveil the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ on Wednesday, and both phones are expected to be released on either April 21st or April 28th. Meanwhile, Apple’s big iPhone redesign won’t hit store shelves until mid-September at the earliest.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus & iPhone 8 Will All Feature Wireless Charging; Apple Watch 3 Will Support LTE – Apple’s Supply Chain Reports By Ramish Zafar Mar 28, 2017 22Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s no secret that Apple’s working on a big iPhone upgrade for this year. The iPhone 8 as it’s tentatively dubbed, will mark the iconic lineup’s tenth anniversary. The company will make a lot of upgrades this year, both overdue and new. For starters, the iPhone 8 will finally feature an OLED display. Android’s miles ahead of Apple in this area and it’s time that Cupertino caught up. Now, we’ve got some more details for the iPhone 8. Take a look below to find out more. All Three iPhones For 2017* Will Feature Wireless Charging And No Type-C Support Claims Analyst While Apple products might be designed in California, it’s no secret that the company’s heavily dependent on its global supply chain. Apple’s high quality and build requirements can only be met by Eastern manufacturing patterns at adequate cost levels. Today, we’ve got information from just these sources. Analyst Christopher Roland took a trip to China recently and he’s back with the latest from Apple’s supply chain. Related Scammers Are Piggybacking iCloud Hack Stories – Tricking People to Give Up Login Details Roland’s information adds a bit more detail to what’s already known for this year’s iPhones. While earlier sources speculated that only the premium iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging, now there’s new spice. Roland claims that all three iPhones for 2017 will feature wireless charging. Given that Apple’s finally started to target lower market brackets, such a move makes strategic sense. Although don’t expect the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus to be cheap smartphones either. He’s also got some information about the Apple Watch 3. Apple’s supply chain expects that LTE will make it on the device and it’ll also be compatible with AirPods. Advertisement Related UK Police Arrest Man Potentially Linked to Turkish Crime Family (aka Apple Extortionists) Even as all three iPhones are set to receive wireless charging, the feature isn’t very efficient. According to Roland, it will take 3 hours to fully charge the battery using Apple’s tech. USB Type-C will not replace lightning in this model, but the feature will make it on next year’s iPhones with a strong probability. Apple’s looking into a hybrid technology that combines both its lightning ports and Type-C. A big piece of information for the OLED iPhone is its battery. Roland believes that Apple will use a unique L-shaped battery for the device. This will give the company more room to play around with the iPhone’s internals. Finally, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will enter mass production in June. Corroborating earlier rumors, Roland also believes that the iPhone 8 will enter production two months later, in August. There’s only so many iPhones that Apple’s supply chain can produce – even with workers often working six day shifts. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned.

The response follows a request by the four banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank - to the ACCC on 13 February to narrow their request and negotiate with the tech giant. In this, they requested the removal of collective negotiation on the potential to pass-through the fees Apple intends to impose on the payment system to their customers in Australia. The banks also sought authorisation to bargain with Apple for access to the Near-Field Communication (NFC) controller in iPhones, and reasonable access terms to the App Store. This access would enable the banks to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple’s digital wallet, without using Apple Pay. The Aussie banks have been butting heads with the Californian powerhouse since July last year, when they banded together to seek permission from a competition regulator to intercept Apple. On 19 August 2016, the ACCC assessed the applications for authorisation by the Aussie banks after deciding not to grant their request for interim authorisation. In October last year, three of the four banks wrote back a submission to the ACCC, warning that Apple’s exclusive approach to its Apple Pay rollout in Australia would stifle the use of existing contactless payment infrastructure in Australia. However, in November that year, ACCC rejected the request by these three banks to collectively negotiate Apple Pay terms with the tech giant. Apple lashed out against the banks in February, suggesting that attempts by Australian banks to collectively negotiate on the terms of its Apple Pay platform could be viewed as a “Trojan Horse” manoeuvre used to normalise the public’s acceptance of new mobile payment fees. ACCC chairperson, Rod Sims In terms of the determination, ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said the regulatory watchdog was not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweighed the likely detriments.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (15) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU. Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-28 00:43 More a question than a comment. MBP 2016 with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7. running with 598 GB free. Docked most of the time using a Benq 32 inch 4K monitor; currently running at 1080P. Latest s/w not beta. I seem to have a lot of spinning beach balls. I cut they system down to only a few add ons such as SwithcResX. I still frequently get the spinning beach ball with Safari and iTunes. I even get the ball with the MBP native resolution with no external monitor attached. Anyone seen this happening? Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-28 04:55 I have seen a lot of spinning beach balls of late - maybe since Sierra 10.12.3? MacBook Pro 15" with Thunderbolt Display and lid closed. I only rarely use iTunes and have the feeling it is linked to use of Safari. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 09:34 This sounds like the sort of thing you'd need to track down carefully. Joe Kissell's Speeding Up Your Mac: A Joe On Tech Guide is where I'd look for that information. http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/jot-speeding-up Or maybe his Troubleshooting Your Mac: A Joe On Tech Guide http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/jot-troubleshooting Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-29 23:04 Tony, sadly it seems to have started from almost day one. I am glad I did a clean install when I got this computer rather than a transfer. I thought I would give it a few versions to see if MACOS versions would help. NADA. Adam, I guess I should have bought one of those yesterday rather than upgrading another book from Take Control.

News sign-up Google is most valuable US brand News, 31 March 2017 Topics Brand valuation NEW YORK: Internet giant Google has overtaken Apple to be named the most valuable brand in the US, according to the latest rankings of America's top 500 companies. Despite having to weather ongoing criticism about its placement of customers' ads, Google has ended Apple's five-year reign as the most valuable brand in the US, according to strategic consultancy Brand Finance. Based on a range of factors used to assign a company's brand value – including marketing investment, familiarity and sustainability – Brand Finance valued Google at $109.47bn, up 24% from last year's valuation of $88.17bn. Meanwhile, Apple saw its brand value fall 27% over the same period from almost $146bn to $107.14bn in this year's study as it was reported to have failed to maintain its reputation for transformative technology. Along with Google, e-commerce giant Amazon was another big winner this year, having seen its brand value grow 53% since early 2016 to $106.39bn. Brand Finance noted that Amazon has started to take its grocery service overseas for the first time this year and also plans to create 100,000 jobs in the US over the next 18 months. "Such confidence suggests that, with a brand value only fractionally behind Apple and Google already, Amazon could easily become the most valuable brand in the US and the rest of the world in 2018, provided it can establish a more emotional connection with consumers," the report said. Facebook's brand value continued to accelerate over the past year, Brand Finance confirmed, as it valued the social media network at almost $62bn, up 82% since last year. However, it warned that globally Facebook has been outdone by China's biggest tech brands, such as Alibaba (+94%), WeChat (+103%) and Tencent (+124%). Elsewhere, Coca-Cola saw its brand value decline 7% to $31.88bn, placing the beverages firm 16th in the rankings. This represented a significant fall from its heyday in 2007 when the company was Brand Finance's top brand with a valuation of $43.1bn. "Increasing concerns over the links between carbonated drinks and obesity have begun to undermine what the Coca-Cola brand has represented for over 100 years," the report noted, as it also identified a similar trend in the fast food industry. Brand Finance said the brand values of McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway and Domino's all fell since last year as they faced heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market as well as the emergence of healthy challenger brands. That said, the overall outlook for America's top 500 brands looks positive and their combined brand value now exceeds $3 trillion, up 11% since 2016. Along with Google, Apple and Amazon, the top 10 most valuable brands in the US also includes AT&T, Microsoft, Verizon, Walmart, Facebook, Wells Fargo and McDonald's.

A recent report from iDrop News suggests the iPhone 8's Touch ID technology may not be located on the home button. The source, who reportedly has "intimate knowledge of Apple's manufacturing facility," has said that the smartphone's Touch ID sensor won't be found beneath the display. Instead, this person claimed the Touch ID sensor will be located on the back of the phone, just underneath the Apple logo. If this were true, it could generate a some issues for future users. Some feel that a sensor on the back is impractical and unreliable in terms of usability, as users would only be able to unlock their phones by holding it in their hand. It also hinders the use of multiple fingers, as the design would make it too awkward to use others apart from the index finger. Although somewhat improbable, the concept isn't necessarily impossible: Android smartphones have commonly featured fingerprint sensors on the back – including the new Samsung Galaxy S8. Still, earlier reports from more credible sources make a stronger case for the sensor being beneath the display as they highlight Apple's speculated developing and testing of inbuilt Touch ID technology. Websites dedicated to Apple news have also been vocal about their suspicions of the claim. The Mac Observer refers to the claim as "weak," while 9to5Mac said that Apple "isn't dumb enough" to put the sensor on the rear, saying the design isn't elegant nor innovative. With no word from Apple, we still don't know where the Touch ID will actually be located – but we wouldn't could on finding it on the back.

Banks lose fight over Apple Pay Chris Keall Friday March 31, 2017 9 Share RELATED AUDIO: Tuanz boss Craig Young on the banks vs Apple Pay spat (Feb 10) Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on The big Australasian banks have lost a dispute with Apple over mobile payments, refereed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Westpac, BNZ parent NAB, and ASB parent CBA wanted the regulator to grant them authority to negotiate as a bloc with Apple. This morning, the ACCC confirmed its draft decision that they cannot. Last year, the three banks went to the market watchdog after clashing with Apple over: 1. Apple’s contractual stipulation that any bank who adopts Apple Pay cannot pass on Apple’s fees to customers (a fight they abandoned on February 13); and 2. Apple’s refusal to let third-parties access its near-field communication chip, which in practical terms means banks can’t release their own virtual wallets to compete with Apple Pay, at least not for Apple’s devices. The fourth major Australasian bank, ANZ, reached a deal with Apple last year. Terms haven’t been disclosed (though US reports say a card issuer must pay Apple 0.15% of a credit card transaction and 0.5c for each debit card transaction). So far ANZ is the only bank to support tap-and-go payments via Apple Pay across Australia and New Zealand. Apple argued that its Apple Pay wallet was the best solution for competition because its virtual wallet can hold credit cards from different banks. The ACCC echoed this argument with its final decision today, saying collective negotiation was likely to reduce competitive tension between banks. The regulator also noted that banks are already active in mobile payments (though NBR would note Apple’s NFC restriction means all of the action has been on phones and other devices that run Google’s Android software). In choosing not to intervene, the ACCC also noted that “mobile payments are "in their infancy and subject to rapid change." Apple maintained a front-foot stance through, saying banks were trying to "free-ride" on its mobile payment investment. In a joint statement today, Westpac, NAB and CBA said they were disappointed, and that the decision would stifle mobile wallet innovation. Nevertheless, although they don't like it, they now only have one choice if they want to be part of the Apple Pay party, or gain access to its NFC: negotiate one-on-one with Apple. And iPhone is where they do need to be. In September last year, Semble — a jont venture between Spark, Vodafone, 2degrees and Paymark (cooperatively owned by the major banks) — was put to sleep. Semble's virtual wallet failed for a number of reasons, including its need for a new SIM card, and its failure to fill its promise to lure loyalty programmes. But in large part, it was ignored because it would not work with Apple's handset. Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall 9 · Got a question about this story?

Reply Share Share   0 0 #5 by J R  4 hours ago I suspect that Apple, Google, Amazon, (Xero?) et all will become our 'banks' before too long anyway. So maybe this will all become irrelevant. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Chris Keall - NBR Head of Digital  4 hours ago in reply to J R  Well at least Rod Drury understands it would be useful for people to be able to use their phone as an eftpos card, and not necessarily be beholden to credit card fees.  Reply Share Share   0 0 by J R 4 hours ago in reply to Chris Keall - NBR Head of Digital  True. But who will fund my flight upgrades if I'm not being bent over by the banks? I suppose I'll be able to sit upright if I'm not being subjected to that. Reply Share Share   0 0 #6 by Andrew Redwood   1 hour ago The banks will already know how many of their customers are using Android vs Apple by looking at the usage of their banking apps. It is unlikely that customers will spend more money just because they have apple pay. So the bank only benefits if EFTPOS payments instead go through apple pay. Or people switch their banking to them just for Apple pay. Then there is the contract risk of the government regulating credit card fees. Yet the bank still having to honour a contract with Apple.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR iOS 10.3 now available to download on iPhone and iPad Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal March 27th, 2017 at 12:55 PM Share Tweet Following a barrage of betas over the past week, Apple rolled out the final version of iOS 10.3 to the public on Monday. After launching iOS 10 last September, Apple was relatively quick to follow up with iOS 10.1 in October and iOS 10.2 in December, but it ended up taking more than three months to finalize iOS 10.3. Don't Miss: Bloomberg: Apple is working on multiple exciting new AR features for the iPhone 8 Thankfully, the latest update is packed with new features and fixes that should make it worth the wait. Along with bringing the frequently discussed Find My AirPods functionality to the Find My iPhone app, iOS 10.3 also changes the animations that occur when opening and closing apps, adds weather forecasts to the Maps app and gives users the option to add a Podcasts widget in the panel where widgets go. You can read more about these features and other features coming in iOS 10.3 right here. These might not be as exciting to the average consumer as the new emoji or the dedicated TV app that arrived alongside iOS 10.2, but they will make iOS a better, faster platform for current and future iPhones and iPads. It’s also worth noting that 9.3 was the final numbered release of the iOS 9 era, so unless something changes this generation, we likely won’t see anything more than bug fixes and the like from here on out. If you want to update your iOS device to iOS 10.2 immediately, you can do so by heading to Settings > General > Software Update and tapping “Download and Install” at the bottom of the page. As always, you can also apply the update through iTunes, though, fair warning, that does require you to use iTunes.

But Which? has discovered that the battery life claimed by laptop manufacturers rarely lives up to reality, with our tests finding it often falls drastically short. Which? testing has shown that almost all laptop manufacturers overstate their battery claims. In some cases, the battery life estimates were double what we achieved in our lab testing. Laptop reviews – Read our latest laptop reviews, from brands such as Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo. Manufacturer claims vs reality We’ve compared the stated manufacturer claims against our laptop tests over the past year, comparing 67 models. Overall we found that manufacturers are missing their claims not by minutes, but by hours. The most optimistic laptop manufacturers are overstating their battery life by 50% or more, leaving you searching for the power cable twice as often as you’d expect. It’s not all bad news, however – our tests found that with Apple MacBooks, you could meet or even exceed the claimed battery life, according to Apple. Laptop batteries: What we found We test laptops for battery life while actively browsing the web over wi-fi, running the laptop in this fashion until the battery is fully drained. In the graphic above, we show the average claimed battery life for all the laptops we’ve tested since January 2016, versus the average battery life in our tests. Number of laptops tested: Acer (8); Apple (3), Asus (8), Dell (10), HP (12), Lenovo (20), Toshiba (6). The Which? battery test Each laptop we judge goes through our battery tests at least three times. We don’t simply trust battery capacity claims: we actually drain the whole battery from start to finish, several times over, during various tasks. One test involves watching films until the battery finally shuts down, another continually browsing websites over wi-fi. We believe that that these tests are representative of the real world use that a laptop would get. As the figures we arrived at are often drastically different to the manufacturer claims, we have to wonder how their own estimates are arrived at. Below are some examples of the sorts of discrepancies our testing unveiled: Lenovo Yoga 510 Claimed battery life: 5 hours Which? tests: 2 hours, 7 minutes Apple MacBook Pro 13  Claimed battery life: 10 hours Which? tests: 12 hours HP Pavilion 14-al115na Claimed battery life: 9 hours Which? tests: 4 hours 25 minutes Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Claimed battery life: 7 hours Which? tests: 3 hours 58 minutes Acer E15  Claimed battery life: 6 hours Which? tests: 2 hours 56 minutes Which? reached out to laptop manufacturers and asked why there were such big differences in their claims and our findings. Dell told us ‘It’s difficult to give a specific battery life expectation that will directly correlate to all customer usage behaviours because every individual uses their PC differently – it’s similar to how different people driving the same car will get different gas mileage depending on how they drive.’ HP said that is battery tests ‘uses real life scripts and runs on real applications like Microsoft office.‘, and that the exact specifications, such as screen resolution, will impact the results for each model. It’s vital to look past manufacturer claims and dig a little deeper to find out what kind of battery life you can really expect from your laptop. We test like no one else, so check our full laptop reviews for the Which? verdict on laptop battery life.

Apple Pay Is Now Available For Macquarie Bank And ING Direct Customers While Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, and Westpac have been pushing for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to allow the banks to negotiate as a group for access to Apple Pay, and now just the Near Field Communication (NFC) function on iPhones, Macquarie Bank and ING Direct customers will now have access to Apple Pay. Read more "The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. The banks sought authorisation to bargain with Apple for access to the Near-Field Communication (NFC) controller in iPhones, and "reasonable access terms" to the App Store. This access would enable the banks to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet, without using Apple Pay. "While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments," Mr Sims said. The banks argued that access to the NFC controller on iPhones would enable them to offer competing wallets on the iOS platform. The banks said the benefits of this would include "increased competition and consumer choice in digital wallets and mobile payments in Australia, increased innovation and investment in digital wallets and other mobile applications using NFC technology and greater consumer confidence leading to increased adoption of mobile payment technology in Australia". Apple's Fight With Aussie Banks Over Apple Pay And iPhone NFC Rages On For over a year, Australia's largest banks have been engaged in a quiet war with Apple. Their goal is to force the world's largest technology company to open access to the iPhone's NFC chip and allow collective bargaining over Apple Pay. Apple is fighting back, of course, and the next few weeks and months will determine the future of mobile payments in Australia. Read more The ACCC accepted that Apple providing the banks access to the iPhone NFC controller is likely to lead to increased competition in mobile payment services and that this was a significant public benefit. But the ACCC considered the "likely distortions to and reductions in competition" caused by the conduct would also be significant. "First, Apple and Android compete for consumers providing distinct business models. If the Applicants are successful in obtaining NFC access, this would affect Apple's current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google," Mr Sims said. "Second, digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change. In Australia, consumers are used to making tap and go payments with payment cards, which provide a very quick and convenient way to pay. There is also a range of alternative devices being released that allow mobile payments; for example, using a smartwatch or fitness device. It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop." Sims said that access to the NFC in iPhones for the banks could artificially direct the development of emerging markets to the use of the NFC controller in smartphones. "This is likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring around different devices and technologies for mobile payments," Mr Sims said, pointing out that it would also be likely to reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards. "Finally, Apple Wallet and other multi-issuer digital wallets could increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any 'lock in' effect bank digital wallets may cause," Mr Sims said. The ACCC consulted with consumers, financial institutions, retailers and technology companies in reaching its decision. Here's Every Aussie Bank With Apple Pay One year after its launch in Australia with American Express as a partner and with ANZ Bank eventually joining up too, Apple Pay looks like it's starting to hit its stride in Australia. Here's every bank that supports the cardless payment app for iPhone and Apple Watch. Read more WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments B-ob @beeawwb Mar 31, 2017, 10:47am In Australia, consumers are used to making tap and go payments with payment cards Except those of us banking with ANZ (and some of the smaller credit unions). Both of my cards (ANZ Debit, AmEx Credit) are Apple Pay enabled so I use my phone wherever possible. Reply 2 klaw @klaw Mar 31, 2017, 10:52am Except those of us banking with ANZ (and some of the smaller credit unions) And half of the rest of the country, who have access to a myriad of other phone-based payment options: a) Android Pay, using any Android phone b) Samsung Pay, using any recent Samsung phone c) generic Tap and Pay from inside banking apps, using any Android phone. It's good to have options. Last edited March 31, 2017 10:55 am Reply 2 B-ob @beeawwb Mar 31, 2017, 11:23am Yes, of course. I was more meaning in relation to iPhone owners but absolutely there's a huge number of users not in the Apple ecosystem who have even more choices available. Which of course makes the statement from the ACCC even more watered down, given that more and more users are using their phones or other devices and not just their physical cards. Reply 0 konsumer @konsumer Mar 31, 2017, 2:11pm It is all about competition and there is no competition on Android Pay and Samsung Pay "Of the Applicants, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Westpac, and CBA-owned Bankwest have each signed up to enable their cardholders to make mobile payments through Android Pay. None of the Applicants have to date signed up for Samsung Pay for their cardholders." The Banks are pushing their app/solutions that is not a multi-card user wallet. They want to lock you in and not give you choice. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Mar 31, 2017, 3:28pm What! That's bullsh!t. I can switch to Android pay instead of my bank's payment service or Samsung pay at the drop of the hat. That is true competition and consumer choice. The banks don't have to offer the service because the user has the choice to switch. Consumer can switch if they feel their bank or Android or Samsung are offering a service that is either too expensive or too insecure or outright bad consumer experience.. My wife has NO CHOICE but to accept the charges Apple demand for their monopoly. That is the very definition of anti-competitive. Reply 0 blahblah @blahblah Mar 31, 2017, 3:52pm What are you talking about? What charges are Apple demanding that your wife pays? Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Mar 31, 2017, 4:31pm Apple charges the bank a flat rate, the bank forwards the cost on. They (banks) don't operate a charity. They run a business just like Apple does. Reply 0 John Sheppard @normandy Mar 31, 2017, 11:44am Been using apple pay for 6 months... thanks to ANZ... out of principle, I won't deal with the big banks... Reply 0 damo @damo Mar 31, 2017, 12:56pm Planning on getting an iPhone with nfc soon. When I do if ANZ are the only ones with it I'm going to them. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Mar 31, 2017, 3:38pm Good luck being charged large sums for no better service than those of us who enjoy the wide amount of consumer choice on Android. Reply 0 stirlo @stirlo Mar 31, 2017, 12:57pm The banks ultimately wanted to force Apple to give access to the NFC chip for use with their own apps. This was never going to happen. Apple would rather pull out of the country than set a precedent like that. Hopefully now that they've lost they can sit down with Apple and agree to use their (superior?) system and stop trying to force people into exclusive arrangements with their own systems. Good job ACCC Reply 0 blhouston @blhouston Mar 31, 2017, 1:39pm This is exactly my take too. The hubris of these big colluding banks is pretty amazing. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Mar 31, 2017, 3:36pm Enjoy being screwed by Apple. They control a monopoly on the iPhone and they hide behind the "more secure" rhetoric which for anyone with software architectural experience knows is outright wrong. Facts remain Apples paywall is no more secure than the next businesses. In fact I'd go so far as to say less secure now because it's a centralised service. Meaning that hackers only have to target the one platform and get everyone (bigger reward). Instead of breaking into multiple services with a small percentage of customers (each country has its own banks). Just take a look at all the iCloud hacks. Only one service and you (hacker) get access to everyone's phone data. Reply 0 doxxie-au Guest Mar 31, 2017, 1:53pm good outcome. when i originally was reading about this i was under the impression they were banding together to get a better rate from apple, not access to the NFC. surely the purpose of an OS provided digital wallet is to keep everything in one place, i dont want to have to go into 5000 apps to pay for things. Reply -1 Tango India Mike Guest Mar 31, 2017, 2:30pm Yes! Finally someone tells the Banks to get back in their box! Well Done ACCC! Now Westpac, NAB and CBA just get on with implementing Apple Pay! Reply 0 muffinman @muffinman Mar 31, 2017, 3:07pm Now if only someone will tell Apple to get back in their box. We don't want their closed systems forcing us to stay within their ecosystem. I want choice! Reply 0 blahblah @blahblah Mar 31, 2017, 3:59pm No one's forcing you to do anything....go buy an Android Reply 0 muffinman @muffinman Mar 31, 2017, 4:54pm Why? I'll just keep using my tap & go. So much easier. Not battery dependent, and a lot slimmer than any phone Reply 0 fishman18 Guest Mar 31, 2017, 3:31pm Either way the ACCC went consumers lose. If they sided with the banks then banks would have screwed consumers by being allowed to collude together. On that front its very satisfying to see the ACCC tell the banks where to go. But by siding with Apple they let Apple get away with a market duopoly that they can and do charge for and where they they lock out any competition on the device. Everyone should realise that android allows 3rd party access to the NFC chip without imposing any fees and the world hasn't ended. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Mar 31, 2017, 3:43pm The fact remains Apple doesn't like developers. If you're developing on Apples platforms and you produce a truly amazing app. Apple believes you are earning money that Apple should be making. So apple will copy your app and lock out the API if possible so they capture the market. They have done this in the past and will continue to do this as a part of their justification of "a better user experience" or better yet "more secure". Laughable. It has its own name "getting Sherlocked". Don't believe me? Do a search for Apples license to steal. "Nothing in this Agreement will impair Apple’s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as [Licensed Applications]." Last edited March 31, 2017 3:46 pm Reply 0 blahblah @blahblah Mar 31, 2017, 3:57pm I'm neither pro or anti Apple. Apple can do whatever the hell it wants. If consumers don't like it then they can ditch Apple, it's that simple. What I don't understand is that the banks all tried to gang up on Apple through the ACCC by creating a cartel (I believe the banks actually used that word.) The ACCC exists is stop this type of behaviour, including cartels getting together for mutual financial benefit, so wasn't this result always going to happen? Reply 0 Join the discussion!

We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. The banks sought authorisation to bargain with Apple for access to the Near-Field Communication (NFC) controller in iPhones, and reasonable access terms to the App Store. This access would enable the banks to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple’s digital wallet, without using Apple Pay. “While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments,” Mr Sims said. The banks argued that access to the NFC controller on iPhones would enable them to offer competing wallets on the iOS platform which would lead to the following public benefits: increased competition and consumer choice in digital wallets and mobile payments in Australia increased innovation and investment in digital wallets and other mobile applications using NFC technology greater consumer confidence leading to increased adoption of mobile payment technology in Australia. The ACCC accepted that Apple providing the banks access to the iPhone NFC controller is likely to lead to increased competition in mobile payment services and that this was a significant public benefit. However, the ACCC considered the likely distortions to and reductions in competition caused by the conduct would also be significant. Three likely detriments in particular stood out. “First, Apple and Android compete for consumers providing distinct business models. If the Applicants are successful in obtaining NFC access, this would affect Apple’s current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google,” Mr Sims said. “Second, digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change. In Australia, consumers are used to making tap and go payments with payment cards, which provide a very quick and convenient way to pay. There is also a range of alternative devices being released that allow mobile payments; for example, using a smartwatch or fitness device. It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop.” “Access to the NFC in iPhones for the banks could artificially direct the development of emerging markets to the use of the NFC controller in smartphones. This is likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring around different devices and technologies for mobile payments,” Mr Sims said. The conduct is also likely to reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards. “Finally, Apple Wallet and other multi-issuer digital wallets could increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any ‘lock in’ effect bank digital wallets may cause,” Mr Sims said. The ACCC consulted with consumers, financial institutions, retailers and technology companies in reaching its decision. The Final Determination is available here: Bendigo and Adelaide Bank & Ors – Authorisation – A91546 & A91547 Background A ‘digital wallet’ is an app on a mobile device that can provide a number of the same functions as a physical wallet, including the ability to make payments in-store and storing other information, such as loyalty or membership cards. A ‘mobile payment’ is a payment performed in-store using a digital wallet. On 19 August 2016 the ACCC decided not to grant interim authorisation to the applicants. On 29 November 2016, the ACCC published a draft determination proposing to deny authorisation. Authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for conduct that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an authorisation when it is satisfied that the public benefit resulting from the conduct outweighs any public detriment. Further information about the applications for authorisation is available on the ACCC Authorisations register: Bendigo and Adelaide Bank & Ors – Authorisation – A91546 & A91547     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on March 31, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: March 31, 2017 @ 12:43 pm Filed Under: 24/7, Asia Pacific Region, Australia, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Banking and Finance, Business, Economics, English, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Pacific Region NEXT ARTICLE → Interview with Leigh Sales, 7.30 ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE ACCC releases Statement of Issues on proposed acquisition of InterGrain by AGT About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts More Than 3,000 Extra Car Parks At Stations Across Victoria ACCC releases Statement of Issues on proposed acquisition of InterGrain by AGT ACCC denies authorisation for banks to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay Interview with Leigh Sales, 7.30 Hazard reduction burn in the Yarramundi Grasslands during autumn © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

The news comes as Apple Pay’s rollout continues to lag in Australia due to disagreements between Apple and the big banks. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Due to anti-cartel laws in Australia, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are required to negotiate individually with Apple as opposed to in a group. This ensures that competition is fair and unhindered during the negotiating process. In a statement, ACCC chairman Rod Sims explained that the detriments of the banks negotiating together with Apple outweigh the benefits: “The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments.” Apple’s battle with the Australian banks has been ongoing for months now. The banks have sought access to the iPhone’s NFC so that existing mobile payment solutions could be offered in addition to Apple Pay. Apple, however, has denied this request over security concerns. Originally, the Australian banks also argued that Apple’s fee for each transaction was too high, but they agreed to drop that argument last month and focus on making Apple Pay more open with NFC access. Apple itself has stood firm with its position and even argued that Australian customers use Apple Pay more frequently than any other country. Apple Pay head Jennifer Bailey had the following to say on the ongoing Australia battle: “While initially, in many markets, there have been banks that have initially been wary about working with a company as large as Apple, once they begin to work with us and understand the Apple Pay platform, they see the benefits of it. That hasn’t fully happened with the ACCC applicants, because the conversation is happening through the ACCC process, compared to what normally happens, which is we have the conversation bilaterally.” For competition and cartel laws in Australia, the ACCC’s decision comes as good news. As for the fate of Apple Pay in the country, we’ll just have to wait and see, but hopefully we are nearing some sort of end to the battle.

The new cloud platform aims to make it easier to develop business software and comes following Apple’s enterprise-focused partnership with SAP last year. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple announced on its developer blog this evening that the SAP Cloud Platform SDK is now available to developers: Apple and SAP are working together to make it easier than ever to reinvent business processes and workflows everywhere. With the new SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS, you can build powerful native iOS apps that integrate seamlessly with the SAP Cloud Platform. Apple’s VP of Product Marketing Susan Prescott says that the new tools will help developers “transform their businesses” and combine the security of iOS with innovation: “When we set out on this partnership with SAP, we knew we had an incredible opportunity to transform how people around the world work by combining the innovation and security of iOS with SAP’s leadership in enterprise software. We’re already seeing the impact that the combination of iOS and SAP brings to businesses to enable better, more efficient and effective processes across industries. Now even more developers will be able to take advantage of the new SDK, and we can’t wait to see how they transform their businesses.” The new tool is similar to what Apple developed in partnership with IBM that focuses on developing enterprise-class iOS apps for iPhone and iPad. More details regarding the new SAP Cloud Platform SDK are available on Apple’s website.

By Asha McLean | March 30, 2017 -- 23:34 GMT (16:34 PDT) | Topic: Banking An Australian banking consortium has lost its fight to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issuing a determination denying authorisation on Friday. The ruling by the ACCC means the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank (NAB), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have lost the ability to collectively bargain for access to the iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) technology. Latest Australian news NBN announces 100Mbps fixed-wireless product Consumer buck-passing is the unchanging NBN model NBN rollout info by electorate released by Communications Department Telstra announces two cybersecurity centres, new managed security service Telstra's copper pricing cuts to remain: Federal Court "The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. "While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments." The banking cartel has been seeking regulatory approval since mid-last year to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. Throughout the process, the banks have claimed that they want access to the NFC controller in iPhones and reduced their argument last month to solely focus on such, as Apple currently does not allow any other entity direct access to its technology. The group has been arguing that access would enable them to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet without using Apple Pay -- which is what Apple wants to avoid. "To make this point abundantly clear, the applicants are willing to limit collective negotiation to NFC access alone -- ie, the ability to collectively negotiate for the removal of the pass-through restriction will be taken off the table," the cartel said earlier this year. In addition to increasing competition and consumer choice in digital wallets and mobile payments, the banks believe access to the NFC controller on the iPhone would also result in increased "innovation" and investment in digital wallets and other mobile applications using NFC technology, as well as greater consumer confidence leading to increased adoption of mobile payment technology in Australia. However, in handing down its ruling [PDF] on Friday, the ACCC said it accepts that Apple providing the banks access to the iPhone NFC controller is likely to lead to increased competition, but it considered the likely distortions to and reductions in competition caused by the conduct would also be significant. "First, Apple and Android compete for consumers providing distinct business models. If the applicants are successful in obtaining NFC access, this would affect Apple's current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google," Sims said. "Second, digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change. In Australia, consumers are used to making tap and go payments with payment cards, which provide a very quick and convenient way to pay. There is also a range of alternative devices being released that allow mobile payments; for example, using a smartwatch or fitness device. It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop." Sims is also of the opinion that access to the NFC in iPhones artificially direct the development of emerging markets to the use of the NFC controller in smartphones, noting this practice was likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring around different devices and technologies for mobile payments. In a statement, the banking cartel said it is disappointed by the ACCC's decision and that the four banks behind the application will individually review and determine their respective future strategies for mobile wallets and mobile payments in order to "best serve their customers". "This case has always been about consumer choice. The applicants made this application to seek to ensure they could participate in the future of mobile wallets, and not have the course of development for mobile wallets in Australia dictated by a single overseas corporation," applicants spokesperson Lance Blockley said. "Whilst we thank the ACCC for their time and diligence in reviewing our application, and recognising both the imbalance in negotiating positions and that there were real issues for consideration, we are disappointed that the finely balanced draft determination was not tipped in the final decision, given our considerable effort to demonstrate the public benefits inherent in open NFC access, and the subsequent flow on benefits for mobile wallet innovation and competition in Australia." In November, the ACCC handed down a draft determination that moved to deny the banks collective bargaining rights against the iPhone maker. At the time, Sims said the ACCC was not satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. In response to the draft determination, Apple argued in its submission to the ACCC that the collective application is not about access to the iPhone's NFC technology; rather, it is an attempt to avoid paying the fees associated with using Apple Pay. Apple noted that it "will not, and cannot, agree to the terms sought by the banks". In their latest submission, the banks held firm that NFC access would create opportunities to invest in NFC capabilities that do not exist without access. Particularly in a relatively small market like Australia, the banks said that larger addressable market provided by NFC access on the iPhone platform increases the incentives to invest, and would reduce the cost and risk of failure and enhance the likely chances of success. "Apple already provides access to many third-party apps that send and receive information through iPhone hardware features such as the camera, microphone, speaker, and Bluetooth interfaces. These apps can access the iPhone's hardware without having to launch an Apple app," the banks said. "As a result, there has been a proliferation of innovative apps that use the iPhone camera for purposes Apple could not have imagined. There is no reason why the NFC function should be treated differently, and the Android platform shows that multiple applications can use the NFC function as seamlessly as they can use any other hardware feature." In its determination, the ACCC states that Apple is not a monopoly supplier of mobile payment devices on which mobile payments can be made, and as a result said Apple faces competition from a range of other handset manufacturers and faces competitive pressure to offer mobile devices with functionalities offered by its rivals -- such as Android Pay and Samsung Pay. "Overall, the ACCC considers that NFC access is likely to result in a small public benefit from increased competition in digital wallets," the regulator said in its report. "Therefore the ACCC has decided not to grant authorisation." Updated at 12.10pm AEDT, March 31, 2017: Added comment from applicants.

More videos Banks, Apple in stoush over digital wallets A draft decision from the ACCC denies several of the big banks from negotiating as a bloc with Apple for access to its NFC technology. Apple Pay allows customers to use their phones like tap-and-go bank cards. While ANZ has already done a deal with Apple, the other three banks have been resisting over the commercial arrangements that would underpin such an arrangement. "The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. Related Content Banks make concessions in Apple Pay fight Credit card perks to rise as bank competition intensifies: Apple Mr Sims said the inability for customers to easily switch between banks was also a factor in the decision.  He said the Apple Pay wallet provided a "multi-user" platform, meaning it was easy to switch between different bank cards.  Advertisement "The banks are very profitable in Australia and charge very high rates on some products, but customers still find it hard to switch," he said.  "Had the banks been successful, there was the potential for that stickiness to increase." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple Pay has provoked a stoush between the banks and Apple. Photo: Ryan Stuart He said while the ACCC accepted that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, "the benefits would be outweighed by detriments". Other issues in particular stood out, according to Mr Sims: Apple and Android compete for consumers with distinct business models. If the banks were successful in obtaining access to tap-and-go smartphone technology, it would affect Apple's integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally and impact how Apple competed with Google, the consumer watchdog said. Digital wallets and mobile payments were in their infancy and subject to rapid change. While consumers were used to making tap-and-go payments with payment cards, there was a range of alternative devices for mobile payments such as using a smartwatch or fitness device. Access to the technology in iPhones for the banks was "likely to hamper the innovations that are currently occurring" for mobile payments and could reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards, the ACCC found. Apple Wallet and other multi-issuer digital wallets could increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any "lock-in" effect that bank digital wallets might cause, the watchdog said. The banks issued a joint statement shortly after the decision, saying it was disappointing after the ACCC had previously described the decision as "finely balanced". The banks involved would now individually review their positions and figure out how to design their mobile wallets and payment systems. They have 21 days to appeal the decision. "This case has always been about consumer choice. The applicants made this application to seek to ensure they could participate in the future of mobile wallets, and not have the course of development for mobile wallets in Australia dictated by a single overseas corporation," payments specialist and spokesperson on behalf of the applicants, Lance Blockley, said. "Mobile wallets are currently overwhelmingly focused on mobile payments, but will soon take in loyalty programs, mass transit ticketing, access, identity and a great number of other future innovations. Ultimately there is no technical barrier standing in the way of our entire physical wallet becoming digital. "Apple has a stated desire to own the entire mobile wallet, and will use the beachhead into mobile wallets afforded to them by complete control over mobile payments on iPhone to exert control over the rest of the digital wallet. This in our view is aimed at increasing the services revenue they can earn from iPhone users." Mr Sims said the decision was not a win for Apple, and that the ACCC was not required to consider the fact that Apple was an overseas company.  "In making competition decisions, obviously the domicile of companies is not something that we can or should be concerned about," he said.  He said the decision would encourage innovation and competition in the digital wallet market, which would benefit consumers. "Obviously what the banks would want to do is have such a great digital wallet it would lock you in. "All we're talking about here is a chip. You can put a chip in anything. Some are presuming everything will be done through a mobile phone, it may be with this decision the banks and others decide they'll put the chip in other devices. We didn't want to stop that competition between devices." An Apple spokesperson welcomed the decision. "We look forward to continuing to work with individual banks in Australia and around the world to bring Apple Pay to their customers too." 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and anyone interested in trying out the software ahead of its official release. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems and the final release is stable for a lot of users. Others haven’t been so lucky. The official version of iOS 10.3 is here and it brings more than just features, tweaks and bug fixes. Its brought problems to some iOS 10 users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook and HBO Now. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @AppleSupport I keep getting an error message when I try to install iOS 10.3. How do I fix this? — M (@Sassy_soul) March 30, 2017 Well done ios 10.3, you drained my battery faster than before 🔥 — 메이피 (@meivifacinelli) March 28, 2017 Why does @AppleSupport don't take complaints serious, installed today IOS 10.3 and still have problems with severe Battery drain. — Maus (@maus2017) March 28, 2017 so this ios 10.3 update is no good for me, my battery life is going down the drain i hate it :( — shinee ruined me//G☆ (@goyangichorom) March 14, 2017 @Pogue I updated to iOS 10.3 on my iPhone 5C, but my phone won't pair with my Bluetooth headset. Thoughts? — Greg (@niceworkmsft) March 28, 2017 Anyone else found iOS 10.3 removes all their wifi connections? I have… — Simön (@KudosNI) March 28, 2017 iOS 10.3 broke my TouchID. — linuxishawt (@linuxishawt) March 28, 2017 Is it too early to start conspiracy theories about iOS 10.3? I swear my iPad is slower and the touch screen is playing up :-/ — Sir Timmy of Mohawk (@homebrandcola) March 29, 2017 Upgraded to iOS 10.3 last night. Apparently iMessage has been “waiting for activation” since then. pic.twitter.com/pk3xQQSNQW — Wonko the Sane (@sgibson5150) March 30, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, particularly one as big as iOS 10.3. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 and we plan to publish our thoughts on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 updates in the near future. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about your new iOS update. How to Fix iOS 10.3 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 You also have another option at your disposal. If you think it might improve performance, you can try dropping back down to Apple’s iOS 10.2.1 update. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward but you’ll want to put away at least 20-30 minutes to get it done. The downgrade will only be open for a limited time. At some point, Apple will close up the iOS 10.2.1 downgrade path. Once Apple stops signing on iOS 10.2.1, you’re stuck on iOS 10.3. For more on the iOS 10.2.1 downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers. We expect it to be released into the free Beta Software Program in the near future. The update arrived alongside new beta updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta releases before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, keep an eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 One Response 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3.

The new videos highlight user complaints about PCs and offer up a solution to the problems: the iPad Pro. The three new ads highlight the design of the iPad Pro, its battery, its versatility. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The first new advertisement focuses on the iPad Pro’s size and highlights a user tweet complaining about how her laptop “weighs five million tons.” Apple touts that the iPad Pro is thin and light, while also offering powerful apps such as excel. This ad was first showcased on Twitter earlier this month. Real problems…answered. Your computer could be light and powerful, if your computer was an iPad Pro. The second ad is called “All your school stuff” and showcases the iPad Pro’s versatility in education. The ad showcases a tweet from a student who says that she “can’t get any work in my dorm room.” Real problems…answered. Your computer could be your notebooks, textbooks and more, if your computer was an iPad Pro. The third ad highlights the iPad Pro’s all-day battery life and showcases a PC user’s tweet complaining that her laptop died halfway through her flight. Real problems…answered. Your computer battery could last all day, if your computer was an iPad Pro. Apple first began this Twitter-based ad campaign last month, marking a stark change from Apple’s other recent advertisements. The ads are lighthearted and poke fun at PC users, carrying a similar tone to Apple’s icon “I’m a Mac and I’m a PC” advertisements. The ads are meant to highlight how the iPad Pro can be a PC replacement. Apple CEO Tim Cook has long pushed the idea that the iPad is a better solution for most people than Windows PCs: I think if you’re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.

"Real problems... answered" is the campaign's tagline. All of the videos are 15 seconds in length, the ideal size for sharing on social media, where the spots have been featured. The first video features a tweet that says "My laptop weighs five million tons..." which is used as the basis to highlight the iPad Pro's weight (about than a pound) and its ability to run apps like Excel and PowerPoint. In the second video, a Twitter user complains about needing to get out of her dorm room, which is answered with "Well, get out of there! You know your iPad Pro can hold your textbooks and notes so you can study just about anywhere." The third video features a tweet complaining about a dead laptop battery during a flight, which is used to point out the all day battery life of the iPad Pro. Apple's been running its Twitter-based iPad Pro advertising campaign since mid-February. It uses real tweets from real people, but actors are used in the videos to hold up signs and do the voiceovers. Videos so far have focused on features like the Apple Pencil, its range of note taking capabilities, its slim size and portability, its range of software, and more.

It's certainly nice to see tech companies like Samsung and Microsoft actually trying to do some new things. [doublepost=1490927809][/doublepost] No they haven't ? What because Apple doesn't feel the need to refresh a $3000 Mac Pro every year. Apple is not abandoning Mac. I can't think of any forgivable reason why the biggest and richest tech company in the world cannot be bothered to update the Mac Mini from 4th to 7th generation chips. Meanwhile, companies that are a very tiny fraction of the size are able to come up with, produce, and keep updating niche products like the Razer Blade Pro.

Rating: 5 Votes ScottButler 8 hours ago at 04:10 pm Is it just me who feels the 12.9 iPad Pro is almost being forgotten about? Yes it's still advertised as part of the collective "iPad Pro" product line, but it's missing big features that the 9.7 got a couple months after the 12.9 originally came out. Also in the accessory department you get much more colours for the 9.7 than the 12.9. It seems to me that both the 12.9 and 9.7 should have come out at the same time with the same features and accessories. On top of all this, the budget iPad (without a version number) released this week and the rumoured 10.5 iPad, are really making the iPad product line confusing.

Recently, the network announced their programming lineup for the 2017-2018 season. New shows include Apple & Onion, Craig of the Creek, Summer Camp Island, and Ben 10. Check out more details from Cartoon Network below: NEW SERIES · Apple & Onion – Being new and naïve to the ways of the “big city of sophisticated food” doesn’t stop the wide-eyed enthusiasm of the lovable buddies Apple and Onion who are destined to find their way and make lots of friends on their incredible adventure of life. The friendship comedy is created by George Gendi (The Amazing World of Gumball). · Craig of the Creek – At the Creek, the rules of the outside world don’t apply in this kid utopia of untamed wilderness where Craig and his two best friends have ventured and tribes of children reign over tree forts and dirt bike ramps. The adventure series is created by Matt Burnett and Ben Levin, formerly from Steven Universe. · Summer Camp Island – Having completed a momentous and critically acclaimed run at this year’s most notable festivals including the Sundance Film Festival and SXSW, this wildly imaginative animated series, based on the original Cartoon Network short, will continue unfolding the mysteries that Oscar and his best friend Hedgehog encounter at a magical summer camp. The series hails from creator Julia Pott (Adventure Time). · OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes – Cartoon Network powers up a world of original heroes across the TV and gaming landscape together with the greenlight of this action-packed comedy followed by the console and PC game jointly developed with indie video game studio Capybara games. The knockout series is inspired by creator Ian Jones-Quartey’s childhood and follows the heroic feats of K.O., an endlessly optimistic boy attempting to level up to be the best he can be in a dynamic universe of heroes, friends and challenging foes. The series builds on OK K.O.! Lakewood Plaza Turbo, the network’s first original standalone mobile game and was developed from a pilot that was part of Cartoon Network’s Emmy Award-winning shorts program. · Ben 10 – The newest show coming out of the highly successful franchise has launched multiple animated series, and numerous animated and live-action movies. Playmates Toys serves as the worldwide master toy partner for the new Ben 10 with a full line of toys based on the show that will include a range of figures, playsets, and role-play items set to launch at retail globally this fall. The wild adventures begin debuting Monday, April 10 and will introduce fun loving, 10-year-old, Ben Tennyson, his cousin Gwen, and Grandpa Max, as they traverse the country during summer vacation. Once Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different heroic aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens to him, which kids of all ages will admire. Ben 10 is created by and executive produced by Man of Action Entertainment. · Cloudy with A Chance of Meatballs – The mouth-watering animated comedy series premiered earlier this month and is based on Sony Pictures Animation’s highly successful 2009 global feature Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and subsequent, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. The TV series is produced in association with DHX Media, Sony Pictures Animation and Corus Entertainment.” What do you think? Do you watch Cartoon Network? Which new shows will you watch?

And tomorrow, the world? You may not have heard of China's emerging smartphone giant BBK Electronics or its founder, Duan Yongping. However, you've heard of some of its brands, such as Oppo, Vivo, imoo and especially OnePlus. By Jack Schofield for Jack's Blog | March 30, 2017 -- 22:34 GMT (15:34 PDT) | Topic: Mobility OnePlus, which is owned by BBK's Oppo company, appeals to international buyers with smartphones like the OnePlus 3. Image credit: OnePlus Apple's Chinese smartphone shipments slumped by 23.2 percent last year as the American company was overtaken by two local upstarts: Oppo and Vivo. According to IDC's Smartphone Tracker, Oppo increased its shipments by 122.2 percent while Vivo grew by 96.9 percent, as ZDNet reported at the time. That's good going in a declining market. What is less widely known is that BBK Electronics own both. They are not just different brands: the companies were founded separately and compete against one another. Duan Yongping isn't being compared to Microsoft's Bill Gates but to Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. Although he entered the electronics business manufacturing a Nintendo-style games console in Guangdong, he has lived in the USA for several years. According to Bloomberg, he decided to move to California "by 2001". He invested heavily in Apple, and "he even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino". Bloomberg recently managed to get the first interview with Duan for a decade, and headlined it: Secretive Billionaire Reveals How He Toppled Apple in China. There's not much to it. Oppo and Vivo simply offered new features and higher specifications at lower prices, much like China's Xiaomi. This works because Apple is a global business and won't cut prices to match local conditions in poor countries like China and India. Oppo and Vivo also toppled Xiaomi, which suffered a year-over-year slump of 36.0 percent in 2016, according to IDC. Xiaomi had grown rapidly by selling smartphones online, whereas both Oppo and Vivo built massive distribution networks through thousands of local stores. Duan founded BBK Electronics - aka Bu Bu Gao (步步高), which means "higher with every step" - to make corded telephones, then feature phones. The company expanded into household appliances - soybean milk machines, induction cookers etc - and hand-held Chinese and English language teaching devices for home use. However, it struggled when smartphones started to take over the market, and Duan considered closing the company. Oppo proved to be a better response. "Making mobile phones was not my call," Duan told Bloomberg, "but I reckoned we could do well in this market." Oppo was founded in 2004 by Duan and Oppo's CEO, Tony Chen. Oppo sold DVD and Blu-ray players before entering the smartphone market. In 2010, it started expanding into neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia before setting up in India. It entered the US market in February 2013. Vivo was founded in 2009 by Duan and Vivo's CEO, Shen Wei. It entered the smartphone market in 2011 with a focus on delivering hi-fi sound in very slim phones. It uses a forked version of Android, which it calls Funtouch OS. Like Oppo, it expanded rapidly into neighbouring countries. OnePlus was founded in 2013 by former Oppo vice president Pete Lau and co-founder Carl Pei. It's a subsidiary of Oppo but focused on online sales outlets, including Amazon. OnePlus tried to deliver high-end specifications at aggressive prices. This enabled it to penetrate the US and European markets, where Chinese brands find it hard to sell at premium prices. OnePlus used the CyanogenMod version of Android, replacing it later with its own Oxygen OS version. imoo is not a new company, but a new brand from BBK Electronics. Its products include a phone-watch wearable for tracking children, and a smartphone aimed at the education market. It uses a fork of Android it calls StudyOS, and presumably draws on BBK's experience with portable language teaching devices. It's impossible to say whether Oppo and Vivo will become major suppliers outside China. However, the company is planning to ramp up manufacturing to meet larger market demand. BBK Electronics is now investing 2 billion yuan ($300 million) in Oppo's R&D headquarters. It's also investing 2 billion yuan in a new Vivo factory that will 90 million smartphones per year. Both will open in 2019. Another 750 million yuan ($109 million) will be invested in a factory to make educational electronic products. (See: BBK to build R&D, production centers) One minor oddity is that BBK Electronics companies prefer to avoid the number 4, which is considered unlucky in China. For example, the Vivo V3 went straight to the Vivo V5, and the OnePlus 5 is expected to replace last year's OnePlus 3 and 3T. Smartphone shipments in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 2016, according to IDC. Both Oppo and Vivo grew dramatically in a market that declined by 10 percent.

We're about to enter a new era of smartphones that may drastically change the industry the same way the original iPhone did in 2007. It's fair to have assumed that smartphone innovation had plateaued. Over the past few years we've seen only small annual upgrades to our smartphones. Mobile payments finally became a thing thanks to Apple Pay. Fast charging is now possible thanks to Qualcomm. Curved screens hit the market because Samsung dared to try bending glass. While those were small iterations that, as a whole, paint a rather innovative picture, we're on the cusp of really huge smartphone innovations that'll change the industry as we know it. Here are a few areas where they're about to blossom. Todd Haselton | CNBC Phones that anticipate your needs. ﻿Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft are all battling to build smarter mobile artificial intelligence solutions. Your phone will know to turn off the lights because you're home and it's 10 p.m. and you're in bed. It'll automatically bring up directions to work when you get in the car at 7 a.m. because it knows that's what you do every weekday. This isn't science fiction. Phones are already nearly capable of making those decisions, they just need a small dose of situational awareness. We'll be there in a year or less. Lenovo Augmented reality. We've seen a lot of reports that Apple is going to build augmented reality functions into its next iPhone, making it possible to superimpose computer-generated images on top of video of the real world. AR isn't new, but true mobile AR will be, and Apple thinks it's going to be more valuable than virtual reality, where you're totally immersed in a digital world. Imagine walking through a museum with a loved one, pointing your phone at an exhibit, and getting information all about the art piece right on your smartphone. Lenovo and Google are already doing this with Tango, now available on a Lenovo smartphone. Apple will no doubt put its own spin on the tech, thanks to acquisitions of two AR companies, Metaio and PrimeSense. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 2 Logging on with your eyes. Fingerprint readers were unique just a few years ago. Now they're commonplace on even the most affordable smartphones. Get ready for even more secure options that take advantage of your eyes. The new Galaxy S8 packs an iris scanner, for example. Princeton Identity, which provides the sensor inside the Galaxy S8, explained that iris recognition is 100,000 more resistant to false positives compared to other biometric security options, like fingerprint readers. Apple is rumored to adopt similar technology on the iPhone 8. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 6 Amazing displays. Smartphone display innovation is also moving at a rapid pace, largely led by firms such as Samsung. The company is among the first to include HDR support on mobile screens, allowing you to view the same type of quality video that you would on an expensive 4K TV at home. They're ultra sharp, too, with Quad HD resolutions that are required for the best virtual reality experiences. AMOLED technology, long used by Samsung and rumored to eventually hit the iPhone 8, also provides a brighter and more colorful picture than LCD displays, often with a savings on battery life. As displays get better, phones are evolving to become 100 percent display, with almost no blank space on the front, including the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and, according to rumor, the next iPhone. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC A Samsung Galaxy S8 sits in the docking station called Dex. It can be connected to a monitor or TV effectively turning it into an Android-run PC. If the smartphone is a canvas, each of these innovative technologies represents a new brush stroke you can expect this year. The Galaxy S8 will lead the way with the most advanced smartphone display, new biometrics and a smart new AI named Bixby. Apple's rumored to follow suit with the iPhone 8, also expected to pack a next-gen display, AR and fresh new AI features packed into Siri. The smartphone we know today is about to look as dumb as an old Motorola DynaTAC.

As detailed in a blog post, the music industry saw revenue of $7.7 billion during 2016, up 11.4 percent compared to the year before. Perhaps most notably, the report states that streaming music revenue from Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube made up the majority of that revenue for the first time ever, while YouTube is again called out for unfairly paying artists. Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor The RIAA data shows that streaming music services accounted for 51.4 percent of revenue during 2016. This marks the first time that streaming services have accounted for the majority of revenue in the music industry. More specifically, streaming services brought in $3.6 billion in revenue, up 68 percent year-over-year. 2016 overall represented a strong year for the music industry. Showing 11.4 percent growth year-over-year, the music industry saw the biggest increase in revenue since 1998 when CDs were the primary source of revenue. At that time, six times more CDs were sold than today. In the grand scheme of things, however, the music industry is still significantly smaller than it once was. The RIAA notes that revenues are half of what they were in 1999, during the CD-driven era. Although our 2016 revenue report catalogues substantial overall improvement for the industry, revenues are still only about half what they were in 1999, and revenues from more traditional unit-based sales (physical products and digital downloads) continued to decline significantly. The latest RIAA report shares positive news as far as Apple is concerned. In terms of payments to music creators per 1,000 streams, Apple comes out well ahead of Spotify and YouTube. Apple pays between $12 and $15 per 1,000 streams, whereas Spotify pays around $7 per 1,000 streams, and YouTube pays around $1. The RIAA notes that what’s really hindering the music industry from growth is the low payouts from services like YouTube, which uses a “legal loophole” to pay such a low rate: The unfortunate reality is that we have achieved this modest success in spiteof our current music licensing and copyright laws, not because of them. That’s not the way it should be. For example, it makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams. Why does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services — including many new and small innovators — cannot. YouTube has long battled with record labels over how it pays artists. Last summer, the major record labels complained that they were either forced to comply with the rates set by YouTube or continually fight illegal uploads to the streaming video platform. YouTube, however, says that it is all for fair compensation. The full RIAA report is available here.

If you're in the market for a classy, waterproof Android smartphone that nearly does it all, the LG G6 should be at the top of your list. Body The G6 is LG's masterwork. There's no doubt in my mind that it's the finest handset to ever come from LG's designers and engineers in Seoul. The G6 entirely makes up for last year's weak and ungainly G5, and rivals the best from Apple, Samsung, and HTC. LG has outdone itself and set a new bar in combining function and form. LG broke away from the cheap plastic designs of its early G series phones with the all-metal 2016 G5. This year's flagship elevates LG's design chops even further. The G6 features an aluminum frame that's sandwiched between two pieces of glass. The phone is a bit oblong thanks to the new screen aspect ratio, but the general shape is conservative with somewhat rounded side edges and a 3D curved rear panel. Metal and glass phones may not be for everyone, but it looks classy, it feels classy, it is classy. Whether you go for the platinum or black, the G6 is refined and impressive. Body   The phone has a huge 5.7-inch screen and yet LG managed to minimize the footprint thanks to the screen shape and incredibly slim bezels all the way around. The G6's body is significantly smaller than other large-screen phones like the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, etc. The narrow shape makes the phone easy to hold and use. Despite the big screen, I was able to frequently use the G6 one-handed. People with the smallest hands may find the G6 awkward, but I think the majority of people will be able to use the phone easily. I do wish the phone were a tad thinner. At 8.3mm thick, it's slightly thicker than its competition. The G6 is also a little on the heavy side. It fits in most pockets with ease. You can't ask for finer materials and build quality. The flat front panel is made from Gorilla Glass 3, while the curved rear panel is Gorilla Glass 5, and the frame is milled from solid aluminum. If you're wondering why the front isn't Gorilla Glass 5, it's because other aspects of the design (the metal frame, flat face, and physically rounded screen corners) improve durability in a way that takes stress off the screen if it's dropped. LG claims this allowed it to select Gorilla Glass 3 for the front without sacrificing durability. The frame has antenna lines here and there, and attractive chamfers on both the front and back. The glass panels are fitted into the metal frame with a high degree of precision. I really like the feel of the smooth back surface, which curves gently to meet the frame. The fit and finish is fantastic. LG stretched the display from the standard 16:9 aspect ratio to a taller “18:9” (2:1) aspect ratio. At the same time, LG slimmed down the bezels. The result is a tall, narrow phone that looks different from what you're used to. (The Samsung Galaxy S8 adopted a similar aspect ratio and tall design.) Above the screen you'll see the usual sensors and speaker, crammed into a very thin space. These elements are more visible on the platinum color than they are on the black color. LG's logo is the only thing below the display. The phone has no front buttons at all; it uses software buttons to interact with the user interface. I'm glad LG has moved away from its rear-mounted button configuration. You'll find the volume buttons on the side. These buttons are separate keys that have good profiles, travel, and feedback. You can use the volume button to launch the camera if you wish. The top of the phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack, something the iPhone 7, Moto Z, and HTC U Ultra all lack. The right edge holds the SIM/memory card tray. The tray is rather wide, thanks to its side-by-side layout. I had no trouble ejecting it with a SIM tray tool. I wish the tray were metal and not plastic. A USB-C port is positioned in the middle of the phone's bottom edge and the speakerphone is next to it. These outer controls and ports all work as they should. The curvy glass rear panel is gorgeous. I'm more partial to the platinum than the black, but both are stunning in their quality. The platinum color has a grainy finish underneath the glass that I find particularly appealing. It's mostly flat, but does curve just a bit near the frame, on all four sides. The glass and frame are sealed up tight, so there's no access to the battery. If there's one thing I don't like about the G6, it's how LG treated the camera module. The dual-camera array is where you expect it to be, near the top edge. The wide-angle lens is on the left and the standard-angle lens in on the right with the two-tone flash in between. LG cut a section out of the rear panel's glass to fit the module, which is itself covered in glass. The joint between the two pieces of glass is a bit rough all the way around. I think LG could have done a better job here. LG positioned the fingerprint reader below the camera module. I wish it were just a bit bigger, but it's no problem to find by feel. The reader is also the phone's lock button. The action is just okay. The G6 is waterproof with an IP68 rating, which means it can handle full submersion in water for a half hour, in addition to getting wet in the rain. The phone easily lives up to LG's claims here. I held it under running water for more than a minute and let it sit in a bucket of water for while. Water runs off the G6 as it does a duck's back. LG also says the phone can handle some punishment thanks to the design of the screen. I dropped it onto carpet and wooden floors without issue. I'm too chicken to drop it on concrete. I mean, it is nearly all glass. LG insists that a great deal of engineering effort went into durability, but you may feel better getting a case for it. From a design perspective, the LG G6 is nearly flawless. The phone is everything I want in a 2017 flagship and more. It's simply stunning in every way. Well done, LG, well done. Screen The G6 has an IPS LCD display and it is staggeringly attractive. LG is making a big deal about the screen's new aspect ratio. It measures 5.7 inches across the diagonal and packs quad HD+ resolution, or 2,880 by 1,440 pixels. The 2:1 aspect ratio means the screen looks narrow and taller when compared to traditional 16:9 displays. Interestingly, the screen has rounded corners and I really like the effect. The size and resolution make for an incredibly sharp display. The LCD panel puts out plenty of light. I had no trouble using the phone indoors and out, though I found the auto-brightness tool wasn't very effective. You may need to manage brightness manually. Viewing angles are excellent; you'll notice a slight drop in brightness as the phone is tilted, but there's no color shift. This is as fine a display as you're going to find on a modern phone. Signal LG sent us an AT&T-branded G6, so we tested the phone on AT&T's network in and around New York City. The phone performed on par with the best phones I've used in the area. It remained connected to LTE 4G throughout my time with the phone; I never saw it drop to HSPA / 3.5G. The G6 had no trouble placing calls, even under the worst signal conditions. It maintained calls at highway speeds, and didn't drop or miss any while I tested it. Data speeds were impressive. Peak speeds on AT&T's LTE network topped 50 Mbps, though average speeds were less. The G6 was a fine tool for browsing through Facebook, Instagram, and other social apps. Streaming media over 4G didn't tax the phone at all. Music and video alike flowed through the G6 without buffering or interruptions. The cellular radio works well. Sound Most people will be impressed with the G6's voice quality; I know I was. The earpiece produces bright, punchy voice tones. With the volume up all the way, you can hear calls in most places you might bring the phone. I was able to maintain conversations in noisy coffee shops, rowdy basketball games, and busy shopping malls. I did notice a very small amount of static in the background when the volume is cranked, but it didn't impact clarity overmuch. I tested standard voice calls and VoLTE calls. I noticed a small uptick in clarity with VoLTE calls. People said I sounded very good via the G6. The speakerphone works well, too, and delivers crisp, clear conversations that are audible in moving cars, at home, and most other places. The speaker is on the bottom edge of the phone, which I think is the best position given how people often hold their phone when using the speaker. Ring tones and alerts blast from the bottom of the G6 with the force of a bullhorn. I was able to hear the phone ring from anywhere in my two-story house. The vibrate alert is decent. Battery LG packed a 3,300 mAh battery inside the G6's slim chassis and it does a great job. The phone typically had plenty of power to spare at the end of each day, often on the order of 20% to 30%. I pushed it heavily on several days, with lots of camera / video use and even uploaded a 22-minute 4K video to YouTube. These activities definitely chewed through some capacity, but I still had enough juice left at bedtime. Whatever electric mojo LG has tuned in under the hood, it's working. LG gave the G6 extra tools to help manage battery life. In addition to the standard Android power saver mode, the G6 also has a setting that specifically reduces the processor power given to games. Regardless, the battery life is good enough that I didn't need these tools. Lasty, the G6 supports Quick Charge 3.0 through its USB-C port. Thanks to the included fast charger, the G6 will power up quickly when needed. It also supports both major wireless charging standards, which means it is compatible with most wireless charging pads. I tested it on a Qi-based pad and it worked fine. Battery   Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, WiFi The G6's secondary radios all worked well. Bluetooth was a cinch to use and the NFC radio helped me pair the G6 with a wide array of Bluetooth accessories. I used the G6 for several calls via my car's hands-free system and they sounded very good. Music had a rich sound when passed through a good Bluetooth speaker. You can use the NFC radio for mobile payments via Google's Android Pay service. Google Maps and the G6's GPS radio were bosom buddies. The phone located me within seconds and was accurate to about 10 feet. That's excellent. Real-time navigation between points worked flawlessly. The WiFi worked just fine. view article on one page Next page: Software X Related Review: Android 7 Nougat Verizon Bundling Free TV with LG G6 AT&T Launching LG G6 with 2-for-1 Offer T-Mobile to Sell LG G6 Starting April 7 for $650 more LG G6 news LG G6 specs & features LG G6 user reviews LG news   LG phones Google news Android news Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

But unlike Apple's, Samsung's devices don't work well together. With the Galaxy S8 smartphones and other new products, Samsung hopes that will change. The company is setting in motion a grand plan to build smart homes where its devices operate seamlessly and provide a consistent user experience. Samsung's S8 smartphones will be able to activate appliances through Connect, an app based on the company's SmartThings platform. With just a flick of the finger, the app will allow users to start a robot vacuum cleaner, dim lights, or even ask a Family Hub refrigerator to analyze contents and send a supermarket shopping list. The S8 also features a new artificial intelligence service called Bixby, which will ultimately allow users to tell the Connect app to activate a device. Samsung plans to integrate Bixby into appliances and devices for voice-activated operation, said Werner Goertz, research director at Gartner. [ Further reading: Sleek new Galaxy S8 phones feature facial recognition, Bixby intelligent agent ] Samsung also introduced the Connect Home router, which integrates the SmartThings hub. The router can be used as a central device to control SmartThings devices sold by Samsung and other companies. After much foot dragging, Samsung is finally pushing its consumer IoT strategy forward, with SmartThings the glue that brings all devices together. Samsung acquired SmartThings in 2014, but it took almost three years for the company to make it a useful asset. That's partly because Samsung has been a somewhat dysfunctional organization in which divisions often compete with each other instead of cooperating. The competing divisions are now working together with the hope of providing a consistent device experience, something that has made Apple successful. Samsung still hasn't shown anything related to its recent acquisition, Viv, which has developed a full-blown AI service. Either Samsung is fumbling with Viv, like it did with SmartThings, or internal dysfunction is delaying its implementation in mobile devices, analysts said. Bixby has some cool features, but it still lags behind Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana. Bixby is a voice agent for smartphones to run tasks and can recognize images, providing recommendations, and translate languages. Samsung this week showed Bixby on S8 recognizing the Flatiron building and then providing recommendations on places to eat nearby. Additionally, the service can recognize objects and then redirect users to sites where people can buy or see reviews of items. But the demonstrations were carried out under controlled conditions. But there are issues that Samsung needs to work out. The S8 handsets have Google's more advanced artificial intelligence technology, which could hurt Bixby's adoption. The S8 remains "first and foremost a Google ecosystem device," and Bixby is trying to provide a different type of service, said Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, in a research note. "But careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. It also works with few apps, limiting its utility. Bixby also lacks advanced analytics that could help with home automation. For some reason, Samsung has chosen a limited implementation of SmartThings, which is already capable of home automation. For example, SmartThings can analyze data gathered over time to automatically switch air conditioners on or off, or turn on a light or heating when a car is close to home. The service can also provide diet recommendations based on health data gathered over time. Advanced features of SmartThings will be available in the future, a Samsung spokesman said. At an analyst event on Thursday, Samsung showed Gartner's Goertz a pyramid-like graphic which showed IoT and intelligence as a middleware foundation for a group of products. "Going forward, we should expect the currently siloed groups and technologies to leverage this common platform and maybe that way, bridge the silos and create much-needed synergies," Goertz said. But the IoT data platform is still nascent, and Bixby lacks advanced AI features. Viv could bring advanced analytics to Bixby over time, but Samsung hasn't rolled the service out. Samsung also has a cloud service called Artik, but it is offered by the company's semiconductor unit, which operates almost like a separate company. SmartThings can work with the Artik Cloud and open up to a wider range of smart home devices. However, Artik is more of a cloud-based analytics play, much like Microsoft's Azure.

A new report from The Wall Street Journal highlights that iOS 10.3 fixes a flaw we initially covered back in October that caused iOS devices to repeatedly call 911… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The flaw was discovered by an 18-year old who found a way to use Javascript to remotely cause iOS devices to open popup alerts, open apps, and make phone calls. In an effort to show the seriousness of the problem, he created a code that caused iPhones to dial 911 repeatedly. All in all, he ended up being arrested and charged with four counts of computer tampering after causing thousands of accidental 911 calls. Today’s report explains that Apple initially worked with app developers to ogle the problem and that iOS 10.3 officially closes the loophole. The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, exploiting a feature in the smartphone’s software that allows users to click on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call. Earlier this month, cybersecurity experts highlighted just how serious the problem was, saying that it placed one 911 center in “immediate danger” of losing service because of the onslaught of calls. The head of government affairs at one trade group explained that the flaw could have been used to disable 911 systems during an attack: “If this was a nation-state actor that wanted to damage or disable 911 systems during an attack, they could have succeeded spectacularly,” says Trey Forgety, director of government affairs at the National Emergency Number Association, a 911 trade group.  iOS 10.3 was released earlier this week and includes a host of new features, both user-facing ones as well as a variety of security fixes. Apple had originally said that it was working to fix this 911 exploit, but now that it’s officially available as part of iOS 10.3, that’s all the more reason to update. Apple also started beta testing iOS 10.3.2 this week, leading credence to speculation that iOS 10.3.1 is right around the corner.

Better blues and greens, with improved color consistency, brightness, and longevity over previous bulbs. More intuitive app experience. Lots of fun third-party integrations. Cons Expensive. Setting Routines could be easier. Bottom Line The third-generation Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit is costly, but remains the ultimate way to get started with smart lighting in your home. By Victoria Song Philips set the bar high for smart lighting with its original Hue Connected Bulb. Now in its third generation, the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit ($199.95) raises it even higher, thanks to Apple Homekit compatibility, enhanced brightness and color consistency, and a retooled app experience. It still costs a pretty penny, but you get better bang for your buck as Philips has improved the longevity of each bulb. With class-leading features and a robust third-party ecosystem, the White and Color Ambiance package is a great way to get started with smart lighting, and our Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Philips Hue Connected Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White Ambiance   %displayPrice%%seller% C by GE Starter Pack   %displayPrice%%seller% Cree Connected LED Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% GE Link Connected LED   %displayPrice%%seller% LIFX Color 1000   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% TikTeck Smart LED Light Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% MiPow Playbulb Rainbow   %displayPrice%%seller% Stack Downlight Starter Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% New and Improved The latest Hue bulbs aren't so much about innovation as refinement. Design-wise, there isn't anything different from the original Hue lights—they're still the same shape and size. Aside from the words "Hue White and Color" at the base of the bulb, you'd be hard pressed to tell these apart from first-gen models. So what's different? For starters, the included Hue Bridge features an upgraded processor with more than 500 times the memory and is now square. This lets it run multiple applications like the Hue system and Apple HomeKit at the same time, whereas the original (round) bridge was really only designed with the lights in mind. The bulbs themselves are also brighter. Philips has increased lumen output from 600 to 800 lumens, which is equivalent to a jump from 40W to about 60W. Each bulb is also estimated to last 25,000 hours or 22 years, up from the 15-year estimate for the original. And in terms of color, the new bulbs have a richer gamut, with special attention paid to the blues and greens. I plugged two bulbs into my living room and one in my bedside lamp for testing. At night, I was pleased that I didn't have to strain my eyes to read a book or write in a journal thanks to the adjustable brightness levels. As for colors, the range is truly impressive. You can choose anything from light pastels to intensely vivid (bordering on garish) hues. True to Philips' claims, the blues and greens are both rich and bright. I tried out the preset Artic Aurora Scene, which is full of shades like mint, teal, sea foam, and sky blue. Even with a red accent wall, my living room was thoroughly transformed into what felt like an undersea paradise. Likewise, the bulbs were able to produce a darker, murkier shade of green that mimicked deep space (or at least what I imagine deep space to look like) quite well. Cost-wise, individual bulbs are now slightly less expensive at $50 apiece, instead of $60. That's still asking a lot if you're looking to outfit your entire home, or even an apartment. Thankfully, Philips now offers a more diverse lighting portfolio so you don't have to empty your entire bank account. The Hue White Ambiance bulbs, which offer the full spectrum of white light, are $30 per bulb, or $129.99 for a starter kit. Alternatively, if you don't care about having multiple shades of white and just want the bare basics, you can get the Hue White bulbs at a relatively affordable $14.99 per bulb, or $69.99 for a starter kit. The setup process is simple. First, you screw in your bulbs into the fixtures you want and switch them on. Then you connect the bridge to your router via Ethernet, download the Philips Hue app to your Android or iOS device, and follow the on-screen instructions to identify the individual bulbs and group them into rooms. Because the Hue bulbs connect to the bridge via Wi-Fi, you can control them even when you're not at home—something you can't do with Bluetooth-only bulbs like the TikTeck Smart LED. Streamlined Experience The ability to personalize not only the color and intensity, but also to recreate lighting scenes from your photos, was a major draw for the original Hue bulbs. The only caveat was that the original Philips Hue app wasn't the most intuitive to use. So it's a good thing Philips has created a new Hue app that addresses many of the problems we had with the original. First off is a more streamlined design. You no longer have to rotate your smartphone to access the full color gradient for individual bulbs. The layout has also been tweaked so there's a bit less sifting through menus to access the features you want. For instance, you can now find the gradient for colors, whites (cool or warm), and preset lighting recipes all on the same page. Grouping lights by room is also more intuitive. Previously, you had to drag individual bulbs together to create a room. But they'd still be listed individually under the Lights tab, which is confusing when you have a lot of bulbs. The new app does away with that approach. Instead of focusing on bulbs, it centers on rooms. Once you've created groups, you can easily adjust brightness and color for an entire room from the main menu. You can still customize each bulb individually—you just have to tap on the room name. The Scenes feature is easier to use as well. You can find the Scenes tab once you tap on the name of an individual room. There are a number of presets and lighting recipes, including the aforementioned Arctic Aurora, Energize, Read, Relax, and Spring Blossom, among others. Scenes like Spring Blossom are based on actual pictures, while Energize and Read are optimized white lighting for specific moods or tasks. Energize is a cooler, blue-tone white light, while Relax utilizes a warmer, yellow tone. To select a Scene, tap on the bubble with the Scene photo and your lights will automatically match that color scheme. If you want to edit it, hit the pencil icon. That will take you to a larger version of the same image, where you can select a specific area you want to recreate. The app will then assign the colors to each bulb, and you can adjust brightness using the slider at the bottom of the screen. You can easily upload your own photos as well. For example, I uploaded a photo of my vacation to Cozumel, Mexico, and the app automatically adjusted my living room lights to soft shades of teal and sand to recreate the lighting on the beach. Even with these improvements, the Hue app isn't perfect. Setting Routines is a little more roundabout than it needs to be. There are presets for waking up, going to bed, and you can enable location services so that lights turn on and off based on where you are. These are simple enough, but it's less intuitive to create a custom schedule. Setting a start time, brightness, color, and days of the week is straightforward, but it's frustrating that you can only program an on or off time in a single routine, so you essentially need to create the same Routine twice (once to turn lights on, and once to turn them off). Lastly, the Settings menu is where you can add extra lights, accessories, and even widgets for the Apple Watch. The latter are basically shortcuts on the watch to your favorite settings, so you don't have to pull out your phone. I was surprised by how much fun I had with these—especially since I could quickly change the living room lights to my favorite color whenever I won a dispute with my roommate. (Immature, yes, but an entertaining use of technology.) Throw a Party With Third-Party Apps Philips also has a big leg up on the competition with 400 unique third-party apps in its Hue ecosystem. Some are fairly practical, but most center around syncing your lights to music, movies, or television shows. Others, like Lightbow, offer you more options for presets and color palettes. None of these are necessary, but they enable you to do more than the official app alone. Keep in mind that many of these third-party apps cost a few extra dollars. I tried the free SyFy Sync app, which uses your phone's microphone while you're watching certain SyFy shows to match your lights to what's happening on screen. Initially I was skeptical, but it worked pretty well for season one of The Expanse—even if I ended up focusing more on how well the lighting fit each scene than the actual plot. You can find these apps in either the Apple App Store or Google Play, but I'd recommend rifling through the Explore tab in the Hue app. There's a handy, curated list of third-party apps and all compatible platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Bosch, Google Home, IFTTT, Logitech, Nest, and SmartThings. I tested the Hue lights with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit. With Alexa, you just download the Philips Hue skill in the (Alexa) app itself. You can then create groups and control your lights through voice commands such as, "Alexa, dim living room lights to 50 percent" on your Amazon Echo. You can do the same with Siri and Apple HomeKit, right from your iPhone. There's a simple "HomeKit & Siri" menu in the Hue app, and you don't actually have to do anything extra to set things up. The only caveat is that you can't edit HomeKit settings unless you're on the same Wi-Fi network. The Best Smart Bulbs Money Can Buy Hue's only real limitation is the depth of your pockets. At $200 for the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit and $50 per additional bulb, it's still quite expensive for the average consumer. This is especially true if you want smart lighting in every room of your home. But as mentioned, you can spend far less by adding a mix of Hue White bulbs, which are less expensive and offer similar functionality, minus the color. (And let's be honest, most rooms don't need to light up like a club.) If you want to go the more economical route, the C by GE Starter Pack is about a quarter of the price, doesn't require a hub, and comes with four bulbs—one more than you get here. You can't set routines and there's no Wi-Fi support, so you can only control your bulbs when you're home, but you can't really beat the price. If price isn't an issue, however, the Hue White and Color Ambiance are the smart bulbs we recommend. They're easy to install, customize, control remotely, and they integrate with many other devices and services you probably already use. Despite the intimidating start-up cost, they are shining examples of what smart bulbs should be, and our Editors' Choice.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iPhone to Return to the Argentinian Market as Regulations Ease | Main | Apple Invents an Advanced Lubrication System to Ensure Future Foldable iPhone Displays Don't get Damaged » March 30, 2017 Apple Invents a New Wave of Wireless Charging Devices Designed to Work with Third Party Peripherals & more   Earlier today Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Invents a Wireless Charging System that Puts Equal Emphasis on Wireless Data Transfers." A second patent on wireless charging was published today by the US Patent & Trademark Office, this time relating to a wireless charging assembly with a few standout features. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wireless charging assembly that could be used as a component in a charging device such as a charging station.   Apple notes that Sometimes, third-party manufacturers also provide peripheral systems that utilize mobile devices and provide additional functionality, such as playing audio on speakers or video on a display device. These third-party manufacturers may wish to provide charging capabilities for mobile devices in such peripheral systems. In other words, they may wish to incorporate a charging device into the peripheral system.   This is likely why Apple joined the Wireless Charging Consortium so that Apple's third party peripherals developers could ensure their wireless charging system is compatible with Apple's charging stations.   Charging Assembly for Wireless Power Transfer   Technically speaking, Apple notes that some embodiments pertain to a wireless charging assembly comprising a housing, a cap structure, a ferrimagnetic sleeve, an inductive coil, a magnet, a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), and a four-pin connector.   The housing can include a bottom housing surface having an aperture, and a sidewall extending between the bottom housing surface and a lip that extends outward from the sidewall along a perimeter of the housing parallel to the bottom housing surface.   The cap structure can have a charging surface and a bottom cap surface opposite the charging surface. The bottom cap surface can include a ridge formed along a perimeter of the cap structure and can be coupled to the housing at the lip. In some embodiments, the bottom housing surface further can have a plurality of protrusions, each protrusion including a threaded screw hole configured to receive a screw or bolt.   The ferrimagnetic sleeve can be disposed within the housing. The ferrimagnetic sleeve can include first and second opposing faces, a central opening extending from the first face to the second face through the ferrimagnetic sleeve, and a recess surrounding the central opening and open at the first face.   The inductive coil can be disposed within the recess between the bottom cap surface and the second face of the ferrimagnetic sleeve. The inductive coil can be configured to wirelessly transmit power across the charging surface.   The magnet can be disposed within the central opening of the ferrimagnetic sleeve. The PCBA can be disposed within the housing between the second face of the ferrimagnetic sleeve and the bottom housing surface. The four-pin connector can be attached to (or part of) the PCBA and extend from a bottom surface of the PCBA through the aperture. The four-pin connector can be electrically coupled to the inductive coil. In some embodiments, the PCBA can comprise one or more contact pads configured to receive (and electrically couple to) wires from the inductive coil. In some embodiments, the PCBA can comprise wireless charging circuit elements.   The wireless charging assembly can further comprising an electromagnetic shield disposed between the bottom cap surface of the cap structure and the inductive coil. In some embodiments, the wireless charging assembly can further comprise an adhesive material disposed between the cap structure and the housing. In some embodiments, the wireless charging assembly is substantially impermeable to liquids.   Apple's patent FIG. 5 noted below is a simplified cross-section of a charging device incorporating the wireless charging assembly. The charging device could be a dock, docking station and portable battery; FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate three examples of charging devices incorporating the wireless charging assembly.   Apple further notes that charging devices (FIGS. 6A and 6B) 600, 610, and 620 can also play media content stored in the mobile device by way of a speaker and/or a video display.   The wireless charging device comprising FIGS. 6A and 6B show a design with a pop-up element so that a device like an iPhone can be angled on it while you're working on your iMac or just a standalone display using the iPhone's brains acting as a simple desktop just like Samsung introduced yesterday with DeX.   And lastly, in Apple's patent FIG. 6C noted above we're able to see a simplified illustration of another example charging device #620 incorporating charging assembly #100.   The charging device can be a portable battery and can include a power storage battery not shown in FIG. 6C.   In some embodiments, the battery in base structure #622 can be charged by placing the charging device in a battery charging unit. Although depicted as a cylinder in FIG. 6C, the base structure can be in any appropriate shape and geometry.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. For more details about this invention, click here. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

As detailed in a blog post, the music industry saw revenue of $7.7 billion during 2016, up 11.4 percent compared to the year before. Perhaps most notably, the report states that streaming music revenue from Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube made up the majority of that revenue for the first time ever. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The RIAA data shows that streaming music services accounted for 51.4 percent of revenue during 2016. This marks the first time that streaming services have accounted for the majority of revenue in the music industry. More specifically, streaming services brought in $3.6 billion in revenue, up 68 percent year-over-year. 2016 overall represented a strong year for the music industry. Showing 11.4 percent growth year-over-year, the music industry saw the biggest increase in revenue since 1998 when CDs were the primary source of revenue. At that time, six times more CDs were sold than today. In the grand scheme of things, however, the music industry is still significantly smaller than it once was. The RIAA notes that revenues are half of what they were in 1999, during the CD-driven era. Although our 2016 revenue report catalogues substantial overall improvement for the industry, revenues are still only about half what they were in 1999, and revenues from more traditional unit-based sales (physical products and digital downloads) continued to decline significantly. The latest RIAA report shares positive news as far as Apple is concerned. In terms of payments to music creators per 1,000 streams, Apple comes out well ahead of Spotify and YouTube. Apple pays between $12 and $15 per 1,000 streams, whereas Spotify pays around $7 per 1,000 streams, and YouTube pays around $1. The RIAA notes that what’s really hindering the music industry from growth is the low payouts from services like YouTube, which uses a “legal loophole” to pay such a low rate: The unfortunate reality is that we have achieved this modest success in spiteof our current music licensing and copyright laws, not because of them. That’s not the way it should be. For example, it makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams. Why does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services — including many new and small innovators — cannot. The latest RIAA report comes after a separate analytics firm claimed that Apple Music has by far the largest user base thanks to the three-month free trial. Coupled with the RIAA report, Apple Music increasingly looks like the best option for artists when it comes to streaming music services. The full RIAA report is available here.

Apple had his moments and the talent really shows up on tape, but he also got beaten plenty, as rookie corners often do. I called him a slight reach, because he was my No. 28 prospect and the Giants took him at No. 10, but bottom line: If he takes the next step, he, Janoris Jenkins, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Landon Collins help make this a candidate for one of the NFL's best secondaries. Sterling Shepard is good and can get even better -- he had 65 catches in a year in which Eli Manning was inconsistent. Paul Perkins had 112 carries and could be the No. 1 back going into fall, so you can't knock that value. Jerell Adams looks like he'll be a useful target for them at tight end. A sleeper here that keeps a good grade where it is -- safety Andrew Adams. He was undrafted, but the Giants get a bonus for him here, because they scouted him, got him in and got 13 starts out of him. New grade: B+ Valentine’s View: Quibble with Kiper all you want, this is a pretty fair assessment. If Apple and Shepard take steps forward, Perkins becomes a big-time back and third-round pick Darian Thompson recovers from his foot injury and becomes a quality starter this draft becomes special.

Media Creation | 29 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) Photo Editing as One with Luminar by Jeff Carlson Back when most photographers used Adobe Photoshop to edit their images, many developers created plug-ins or stand-alone applications to focus on specific tasks. For example, Nik Software’s Silver Efex Pro plug-in specialized in creating black-and-white images, as did Macphun’s Tonality application. Whether you wanted more control over removing digital noise or applying lots of pre-made effects, there was a separate tool (often purchased separately or as a bundle) for you. Recently, though, photo editing is shifting back to all-in-one tools. Google purchased Nik Software and has been working its technology into Snapseed and Google Photos (though the Nik tools are still available for free; see “Google Gives Away Its Nik Collection Photo-editing Apps,” 31 March 2016). And Macphun has released a new application, Luminar, that takes the technologies from its solo applications and combines them into one master tool. (Tonality and the other utilities remain for sale separately or bundled as Creative Kit.) Luminar is a bold bet intended to compete against Photoshop — still the biggest gorilla in the jungle for professionals and enthusiasts — while also beckoning those who haven’t yet moved on from Apple’s long-discontinued Aperture. Luminar is also trying to appeal to casual photographers who want more image editing capabilities than Apple’s Photos. Plus, with its $69 price, Luminar hopes to appeal to the folks who don’t want to pay Adobe’s monthly or yearly subscription fee to use Photoshop. Before we get into the details, though, indulge me in one quick declaration about its core capabilities: Luminar is more than capable as an image editor — it has all the adjustment controls for manipulating tone and color that you’d expect. Trying to cover them all in this article would bore us both. In my testing, none of Luminar’s edits were inconsistent with what you’d see when editing in other applications. The tools are all there; it’s what you do with them that makes a difference. If you want to compare features with Aperture, Lightroom, and Creative Kit, Macphun has created a handy chart. What’s most interesting about Luminar is its approach to juggling all of those tools. Like other Macphun applications, Luminar prominently features presets for one-click editing. And for the individual tools, Luminar refers to everything as “filters” that exist in “workspaces.” Other editing applications also use that terminology, but Luminar’s execution sets it apart. First, a disclaimer: In early 2016 I wrote a short guide for Macphun about its Aurora HDR application, which the company still gives away as part of purchasing bundles. I also contract with Adobe to produce tutorials and other educational materials. Presets -- I tend to gloss over or outright ignore presets, probably because of how I learned to edit photos in other applications. I prefer digging into the adjustment controls to nudge a photo’s appearance so it’s closer to what I remember seeing when I captured it, rather than applying a preset that dramatically shifts the look of the image. Some of Luminar’s 60 presets help with the kind of nudging I like. Image Enhancer, for instance, acts as a general make-better button, while Sky Enhancer and Detailed address specific goals or fixes (pulling drama out of bland upper areas and sharpening soft images, respectively). However, it’s increasingly common for photographers to want to apply stylized looks to photos. I often see Instagram photographers who have developed a signature look for all of their shots. The idea isn’t necessarily to reflect what was captured, but instead to evoke a mood, like adding a tinge of earth tones to every shot. Each of Luminar’s preset displays a preview of your image with the effect applied, so you get a sense of how it will affect the photo before you make a choice. Applying a Luminar preset saves a lot of time adjusting the same settings for each image. The app’s six categories of presets — Basic, Street, Outdoor, Portrait, Travel, and Dramatic — are fine starting points, but it’s better to create your own based on your editing preferences. It’s easy to make new presets, share them with other Luminar users, and install presets others have created. Editing with Filters -- One of the things I like about Luminar is that it’s relentlessly non-destructive. When editing photos, you don’t want to actually change the pixels in the original image, something older software did and many of Photoshop’s legacy controls still do. Non-destructive editing not only makes it easy to revert to the original and start over, but also change different aspects of what you’ve edited to that point. For example, if you increase the color temperature and then later increase the saturation, the photo could end up too warm. You can go back and lower the color temperature to balance the warmth while maintaining the saturated colors you want. Luminar enables this flexibility by making nearly every adjustment a filter, from basic controls such as Tone to specialized ones like Adjustable Gradient, which manipulates several types of edits — exposure, contrast, vibrancy, and warmth — in the top and bottom areas of the frame. To use a particular editing effect, add a filter; the interface even explains what each effect does. You can also read more detail about each filter in Macphun’s documentation. This approach isn’t unique; Lightroom has editing panels whose adjustments can be turned on and off, and Photos includes more adjustments than most people realize because they’re not initially visible in the Adjustments panel. Luminar takes the concept further by making almost everything a filter. That leads to some interesting options. You can duplicate each filter, enabling you to stack multiple instances of an effect, or perhaps colorize two instances of the same effect with different hues. Filters can also have their own blend modes, something typically available only to layers. A blend mode applies the filter’s effect to a certain range of colors or tones. For example, the Multiply blend mode removes white from the scene, darkening it dramatically without having to adjust the exposure. One feature I miss is an easy Auto option for calculating the best adjustments to make a photo look good. This isn’t due to laziness on my part (though that’s sometimes true) but is because I’m curious about how the software thinks an image should look. In Lightroom, I often click the Auto button in the Basic adjustments panel to establish a starting point for my editing. Sometimes the software overexposes a shot compared to what I’d prefer. I’ll then adjust the settings to my liking, or choose Edit > Undo and manually start from scratch. The closest workaround in Luminar is to choose a preset such as Image Enhancer and work your way up from there. To the app’s credit, the Tone filter also includes a Smart Tone slider that performs some of these tasks. Perhaps I just need to retrain myself, but I’d find it helpful to have an Auto button on the Tone filter, or on any filter, for that matter. Tools and Layers -- In addition to the filters, Luminar includes a handful of tools that perform specific actions. The Clone & Stamp tool, the Erase tool (which is like Photoshop’s content-aware technology), and the Denoise tool all operate like stand-alone modules, taking over the screen and presenting controls for just those actions. When you finish making the edit, such as removing an object from a scene using the Erase tool, Luminar adds that edit as a new layer — yet another instance of non-destructive respect for the original image. As with layers in other applications, you can use layers in Luminar to build up effects, isolate edits to specific areas, and more. When a new layer is created, by a tool or by manually adding one, all of Luminar’s filters are available to it. For example, suppose you want to brighten just one area of a photo instead of the entire image. One way to do that would be to create a new adjustment layer (which affects the appearance of the layers below it), and add a filter such as Tone or Exposure. Next, you’d use the Radial Mask tool to drag an oval over the area you wish to highlight and click Invert so the adjustment is applying to the area within the circle. You could then add other filters to change the appearance. Luminar supports the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. When using the Clone & Stamp tool, for instance, there’s a handy brush size slider in the Touch Bar, which is far more convenient than taking a mouse trip to the options bar and changing the size there. (You can also press the bracket keys to make the brush size larger or smaller, a faster method and a standard convention among many similar applications, but that’s not obvious to new users.) However, the size slider is not present when using the Brush Mask tool, which would be equally helpful, so it looks as though Touch Bar support isn’t yet complete. Workspaces -- The final piece of Luminar’s editing experience is its Workspaces feature, which takes advantage of the modularity of filters to create collections of filters that you use regularly or in specific situations. Not every photo needs every filter; if you’re working on a black-and-white image, why clutter the interface with Hue and Saturation controls? Luminar offers workspaces for four common photo types, each of which includes filters you’d use for such an image: B & W, Landscape, Portrait, and Street. You can also set up Workspaces for convenience, such as by putting your preferred controls at the top of the Filters panel to reduce unnecessary scrolling. Lightroom Plug-in and Photos Extension -- It’s worth calling out the fact that Luminar does not attempt to manage your photo library. I normally wouldn’t even bring that up, since Luminar is an editing application, but Macphun has said that a future update will add library management, too. If you’re accustomed to managing, opening, and editing photos in Lightroom or Photos, it feels almost archaic to edit image files in another app. In the meantime, Luminar includes a plug-in that lets you use Lightroom’s Edit In command to send a copy of an image to the Luminar application. When you finish, the edited version shows up in your Lightroom library. If you instead use Photos to manage your photo collection, you can take advantage of Luminar’s editing tools using a Photos extension. That loads Luminar inside the Photos interface and offers the same controls you’d find in the stand-alone application. When you save your changes, the extension applies the edits to the image in the Photos library. Note that when you’re using either the Luminar plug-in for Lightroom or the Luminar editing extension in Photos, you can’t go back in and adjust your settings later. Both options create a final edited version of the photo. In Lightroom, the copy sits alongside the original in a stack (Lightroom’s method of grouping photos). In Photos, you can revert to the original and start over if you don’t like the result, or you can edit on top of the edited version. Compare that to opening photos from the Finder and editing them directly in the Luminar application. In that situation, you can save the results as Luminar files that can optionally retain their edit history. You get more editing flexibility, but if you use Lightroom or Photos to manage your photos, you need to track those Luminar files (with an .lmnr filename extension) separately. When Macphun delivers the update that adds image management (which so far isn’t pegged to a date, but is just a promise), you will, in theory, be able to go back and access the entire edit history for any photo in your library. That’s how Lightroom works now if you use its built-in editing tools. All in One and One for All -- For pure convenience, having all the editing tools you want close at hand is better than reaching into every corner of your workshop to get them. Too often, when companies try to build all-in-one tools, the result is either lackluster or overcrowded. Luminar strikes that delicate balance of including most everything you want in a photo editor without being overwhelming. It’s a powerful app that can also be picked up pretty easily by photographers looking for more than Photos offers without committing too (and paying for) the full capabilities of Photoshop.

Hats off for a great review of Luminar that serves your readers well. Your insights into using presets as starting points, plus explaining the flexibility of filters/layers and workspaces were spot on. I also loved the idea of stacking multiple instances of the same filter - good insight that I often forget about! The "Auto button" is a feature I've also recommended and am advocating for w/ the dev team - nice suggestion! One thing I'd add which I think is super-unique and really flexible is the idea of using Filter Masking within a single layer. In other words, any filter you want to apply to an image can be selectively applied with a brush/mask, without creating additional layers. Opens up a world of possibilities! Cheers!

Read More , I’m exploring various first party macOS apps such as Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. I invite you to explore them along with me. You might just discover that iWork has the potential to be your go-to office suite after all. What’s in a Name? Apple’s office productivity apps were collectively known as iWork. That changed (or so it seems) once the applications in the suite — Pages, Numbers, and Keynote — made an appearance as individual apps on the Mac App Store. But the “iWork” name persists on the Apple website, so we’ll stick with that name in the interest of clarity and simplicity. To be clear, Pages is for word processing, Numbers is for creating spreadsheets, and Keynote is for creating presentations. Get Pages, Numbers, and Keynote on Your Mac If you bought a Mac on or after October 1, 2013, it probably came with Pages, Numbers, and Keynote pre-installed. In any case, it qualifies for a free installation of the iWork apps, and you can download them from the Mac App Store anytime. For a 30-day window after your Mac purchase, you can also get the iWork apps for free via Apple’s Up-To-Date program. Conditions apply! iWork’s zero-dollar price tag is not the only reason 5 Reasons You Should Use iWork Instead of Microsoft Office 5 Reasons You Should Use iWork Instead of Microsoft Office Many long-time Office users will be unwilling to transition away from the apps they're so used to working with, but it's time to give iWork another chance. Read More you should install the suite though. If you have a pre-2013 Mac, which doesn’t qualify for free installation of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, downloading them will set you back $19.99 per app. If you already have the iWork apps installed on your Mac, upgrade them to their latest versions: Pages 6, Numbers 4, and Keynote 7. Although Apple has improved the iWork apps over the years and introduced a few much-needed features, it has also removed some good features in the process. At least that’s what some seasoned iWork users have reported on the web. Some of the popular old features are making a comeback though. i’ll wait to update iwork. it’s already missing features i need and i don’t wanna lose more. — Mike Beasley (@MikeBeas) September 7, 2016 What You Can Do With iWork Apps If your office requirements are basic, Microsoft Office-like applications can feel like too much work to figure out. Speaking of their interface, the number and variety of menus, toolbars, buttons, tabs, and links dotting the screen can be overwhelming. I hate the ribbon in Microsoft Office. I thought it might become superior after I got used to it. It hasn't. I still can't find anything. — Andrew Wright (@wrightak) July 10, 2012 In contrast, the clean and clutter-free interface of Apple’s office applications can be comforting. Don’t equate the lack of visual elements with a lack of features though. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are full of features to help you create stunning word documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Password-protected ones at that. Let’s see what we can do across any and all three iWork apps. I’ll leave the application-specific features for you to discover on your own. Set Up a Distraction-Free Screen Pages, Numbers, and Keynote have similar interfaces and present their features in an easy-to-digest format. Options and settings stay hidden until you need them. They appear based on context, such as when you select a certain element on the page or click on a specific toolbar button. All formatting options are accessible from the menu bar, which isn’t much of a distraction because you can hide the macOS menu bar system wide 11 Hidden OS X El Capitan Features You Might Not Know About 11 Hidden OS X El Capitan Features You Might Not Know About Think you've found all the new features in El Capitan? Think again! There is a bounty of handy features that haven't gotten a lot of press. Read More . In each iWork application, there’s one primary toolbar and one primary sidebar (called Inspector) to deal with. You can hide both via the View menu to create a distraction-free interface. It’s a pity those two elements don’t disappear automatically when you switch to full screen mode. Of course, the layout changes a little depending on the iWork application you’re in. For example, Pages gets a word count display, Numbers gets an extra set of tabs for sheets, and Keynote gets an extra sidebar for slide thumbnails. Keep in mind that some these elements won’t show up by default. All in all, iWork makes for a soothing (I would say enjoyable) experience. Memorize the keyboard shortcuts for toggling the toolbar (Cmd + Option + T), Inspector (Cmd + Option + I), and Full Screen mode (Ctrl + Cmd + F) and you can have a distraction-free setup super quick any time you wish. Work From a Template Templates are a sensible way to start working 10 Templates to Save Time at the Office 10 Templates to Save Time at the Office Are there documents that you write over and over again? Whether it's meeting agendas, invoices, or status reports, templates could make your work easier. We have compiled 10 template ideas to save you time. Read More on any document. They take away the fear of the blank page and save you time you would otherwise have spent on setting up a document from scratch and making it pretty. All three iWork apps give you a decent set of starter templates covering a wide range of requirements, not something slapped together haphazardly either. The templates are beautiful and loo professional. They’ll pop up whenever you open an iWork app and choose to create a new document. Pages has templates for resumes, flyers, business cards, newsletters, birthday cards, and so on. Numbers covers everything from personal finance to education to business. You’ll find templates for net worth calculations, invoices, travel planning, loan comparison, recipes, and grade books. Keynote’s templates are more like visual themes that will set the tone of your presentation. Of course, you don’t have to start with a template. You can start with a blank document and build it up as you go along, and maybe even turn that into a custom template for future use. You can even create new or download other templates How to Create Impressive Pages Documents and Templates on Mac How to Create Impressive Pages Documents and Templates on Mac The price isn’t the only reason to give Pages a spin — it's packed with ready-to-use templates that will make your work look fantastic. Read More shared online. Style Content In a few clicks you can change the look and feel of anything you put into an iWork document. You get enough options to tweak the size, color, and arrangement of text and other elements. To reveal the formatting options, click on the Format button (paintbrush icon) in the top right section of any iWork app. Now, what you see in the fly-out Format menu will vary depending on the application you’re in and the element you have selected in the document. For example, in Pages, if you have selected a bit of text, you’ll see options to change the text style, add borders, remove ligatures, and so on. If you have selected an image, you’ll see options to enhance it, replace it, make bits of the image transparent, and so on. In Keynote, you can add effects and edit the master slide via the formatting sidebar. Insert Graphics Information is easier to grasp at a glance when you distill it into a graphic like an image, table, or a chart. You can insert any or all of those three elements in an iWork document via the Table, Chart, and Media buttons placed in the central section of the toolbar. With the Media button you can add not only images, but also audio and video files. The Chart button gives you many 2D and 3D charts to pick from, and some interactive ones too! If you want to add shapes and lines to the document, click on the Shape button to get started. It includes a pen tool to create custom shapes. Consider the graphic elements as mere starting points or templates. You can transform their look via the Format sidebar menu like you would do for text and images. Work With Microsoft Office Files iWork saves files in Apple’s proprietary file formats by default. Text documents get saved with the extension .PAGES, spreadsheets with .NUMBERS, and presentations with .KEY. The good news is that you can also work with Microsoft Office files in iWork, whether it’s importing .DOCX/.XLSX/.PPTX (or .DOC/.XLS/.PPT) files into iWork or exporting them in one of those formats. Apart from the usual Office file formats 9 Rare Office File Formats You Have to Know 9 Rare Office File Formats You Have to Know Have you ever come across strange file formats in your office suite? We'll give you a quick primer on rare, yet useful office file types and what you can use them for. Read More , you can export files to other formats including PDF, EPUB, CSV, HTML, and QuickTime, depending on the application you’re exporting from. You might come across the odd formatting problem with imported Office files, but it won’t seem “unfixable” once you have a better idea of how iWork works. Open Multiple Documents Side by Side Starting with macOS Sierra What's New in macOS Sierra? The New Features Coming to Your Mac What's New in macOS Sierra? The New Features Coming to Your Mac OS X is dead, long live macOS. Read More , many stock apps including Pages, Numbers, and Keynote support tabs. Opening, closing, and switching tabs in iWork apps works like it does in Safari and other mainstream browsers, so you’ll likely already be used to the feature. A tabbed interface means you don’t need frenzied three-finger slides on the trackpad to switch between multiple documents. A simple point-and-click action or a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Tab) will do. I would recommend hiding the tab bar from the View menu to get a little more screen space. That bar will show up by itself anyway when you open multiple documents. You could also use the shortcut Shift + Cmd + T to toggle the tab bar. Add Comments Adding comments to specific portions of a document is a great way to leave notes for yourself and/or others. Whether you want to ask a question, highlight a correction, or add a suggestion, placing a comment in the relevant location works as an effective reminder to take action. To add a comment to an iWork document, select any element within it and click on the Comment button in the toolbar. A small yellow box pops up near the selected element for you to enter your comment. Using the navigational arrows in the comment box you can go back and forth among all the comments in the document. As you do, the relevant section of the document appears highlighted. You’ll find a Delete button for each comment, and you can get rid of any of the comments from a single comment box. If you want to see all the comments in a neater format, click on View > Show Comments Pane. This shows the comments in a sidebar list. Use iWork Apps Online If you log in with your Apple ID at iCloud.com, you can work with the iWork apps right from your browser. The apps are similar to their desktop counterparts, if a little less colorful and a tad slow to respond. You’ll have to deal with a few limitations when you’re working on documents on iCloud.com. Despite those, iWork for iCloud is a handy solution for creating office documents from anywhere, anytime. When you have an active internet connection that is. You don’t even need an Apple device to access and use the web-based iWork apps. As long as you have an Apple ID, you’re in. Head to iCloud.com to get started — even from a Windows PC. Collaborate in Real-Time A real-time collaboration setup is a common feature in productivity apps these days, and now Apple has added it to iWork. To use the collaboration feature in any iWork app, you’ll have to upgrade the app to its latest version. To invite others to collaborate on a document, click on Share > Collaborate With Others… or on the Collaborate button in the toolbar and follow the on-screen instructions. You’ll get a prompt to add people and set permissions for the document. You’ll also get the option to copy a link to the document in case you want to share the link with someone via an email, a message, or a different medium. I’ll leave it to this detailed Apple support page to explain the intricacies of collaboration in iWork apps. Don’t forget the feature isn’t quite finished yet, so you may encounter some bugs until the feature leaves the beta stage. Collaborating on an iWork document with a Windows user is possible, but that user will need an Apple ID. iCloud.com can be your meeting point, as we discussed in the section above. Back Up to iCloud Drive The way iCloud Drive functions can seem confusing at times. To avoid data loss Upgraded to macOS Sierra? Stay Away From These 2 Features Upgraded to macOS Sierra? Stay Away From These 2 Features One is supposed to keep certain folders on all your Macs in sync, the other is supposed to intelligently free up space by deleting files you don’t need. Neither work as advertised. Read More , keep your documents backed up to a USB drive or a different location on your Mac before you experiment with cloud backup for iWork documents. If you have set up iCloud Drive on your Mac, when you save any iWork document as is, it gets backed up to iCloud Drive automatically. You’ll find the document in the appropriate iCloud Drive folder (Pages, Numbers, or Keynote). Remember, you can choose to bypass the default “save” location and pick a different one, within or outside iCloud Drive. Say you don’t want macOS to back up documents from Pages to the cloud. Tell it so by hopping over to System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options… and unchecking the box next to Pages. After you tweak this setting and head back to iCloud Drive in Finder, you’ll notice that the Pages folder has disappeared. iCloud Drive is also available on Windows. Work on Mobile Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are available for the iPhone and iPad, once again for the attractive price of free — that is, if you activated your iOS device on or after September 1, 2013. For devices older than that, you’ll have to pay $9.99 for each of the mobile apps. Once you have acquainted yourself with the iWork desktop apps, you’ll have no trouble finding your way around their mobile counterparts. Even if you aren’t all that familiar with the former, you’ll figure out the mobile workflow in no time. You can access iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive How to Access iCloud Drive Files from Any Device How to Access iCloud Drive Files from Any Device iCloud Drive is a handy tool, but accessing your files can be a little confusing. Today we'll show you how to get file system access to iCloud Drive, whatever your operating system. Read More from your iOS device. The sync works both ways, meaning you can also back up new documents and changes to existing documents to iCloud Drive from your iOS device. It’s a convenient way to access and edit documents on the go. Focus on the Pros Generic comparisons of iWork (or any other office suite for that matter) with Microsoft Office are inevitable, but probably pointless. That’s because what you need from an office suite will have a major impact on whether you think iWork is good, or at least good enough. C’mon @Apple. iWork'9 is still better than current release. Where is mail merge and other advanced features?

(@_thisisnorm) March 18, 2016 I would say focus on what you can do with the available features in iWork and you’ll get more satisfying results than you thought possible. If the apps are already sitting on your devices, free of charge, what have you got to lose? What Do You Think of iWork? Before you launch Microsoft Office on your Mac or switch to one of the apps from Google’s trusty office suite, take a look at Apple’s own effort, iWork. Really look.

By Rajiv Rao for New Tech for Old India | March 30, 2017 -- 19:50 GMT (12:50 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple will have to undertake a big leap in product innovation and pricing if it hopes to tap into India's vast, promising market and best the fierce competition that exists among smartphone makers there. (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) In perhaps the most important electronics manufacturing benchmark for India yet, the green signal has finally been given to Apple to start manufacturing in India. They will apparently be churned out at a factory run by Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp. iPhone 7 review Incredibly fast and powerful, with improved low-light camera Is Apple pushing the smartphone forward, or only doing enough to get by? Read More This is a big win for both India, which has been trying to woo phone makers to the country for the past couple of years so it can catalyse local manufacturing, as well as for Apple, which has been trying to figure out a way to manufacture in India, a country it sees as its next biggest challenge and opportunity. So much so that Apple gave up its adamant stance on not paying India's import duty on electronics components shipped into the country to make the phone that amounts to 12.5 percent of the goods. (This was originally exempt under a WTO agreement, but it was brought back in order to boost domestic manufacturing.) There are few global brand names that spell quality, reliability, and security than Apple in India, so churning out phones from here is a de-facto marketing victory for a country that has long been beset by image problems arising from its inadequate infrastructure, frequent power outages, and crowded and chaotic cities. So far so good, but here's the unvarnished truth: For all its hype about the Indian market, Apple will have to undertake a big leap in product innovation and pricing if it hopes to tap into India's vast, promising market and best the fierce competition that exists among smartphone makers there. YESTERDAY'S MODELS VERSUS TODAY'S BEST The basic problem with Apple's India thrust, as I said here a few years ago, is that its phones are just too expensive and only occupy the premium category -- unlike Samsung, which sits across the whole range. Therefore, Apple's success in China is a poor indicator of its potential in India. India is not China, and that is putting it mildly. China's 'great leap forward' in the 1980s propelled it from a sleepy agrarian country to a manufacturing giant, taking its per capita income from around $1,000 to over $8,000. India missed the manufacturing boat and its current per capita income is a measly $1,500, with the bulk of its population still stuck in unproductive farming thanks to significantly fractured land holdings and a reliance on the fickle monsoon rains. This means the opportunity for a phone maker is in the $115 to $250 sweet spot (or even in the budget segment of up to $100, if you want to go for an economies-of-scale strategy targeting the 600 million who are yet to buy a smartphone). Apple, for years, was peddling smaller outdated models like the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5C in India as its 'affordable' units. Now, it has begun hawking a discontinued version of the iPhone 6 through online channels for a discounted price of $450. That will not be good enough to boost phone sales from the 2.5 million sold in 2016 in India to any kind of meaningful figure. Apple's brand name may be great, but in the last few years, Chinese phonemakers have flooded India with fabulous devices that sport similar specs and features to Apple's flagship phones but at a fraction of their prices. Today, Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo are all going gangbusters in India, firmly entrenched in the top 5 in terms of market share and collectively north of 50 percent, having easily ousted Indian brands such as Micromax and Intex. Samsung, the current leader, also continues to suffer from incursions made by them. It is a significantly different landscape today from two years ago, so a $450 iPhone 6 will not impress Indians as much as the Cupertino company thinks it will. Even in China, where the iPhone 6S was always regarded as the unrivaled queen of premium smartphones, the Financial Times reports that last year it was bested in a shocker by Oppo's R9, which became the new best-selling smartphone. "We see a significant challenge for Apple in China," says Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint in the FT. "Chinese consumers have shown a greater affinity to buy premium phones from local players." Additionally, Pathak says that Chinese manufacturers' handsets have the same form factor as iPhones but are priced way lower, he adds. The same problems happen to apply to India, where Apple hasn't even begun its adventure. Apple needs its India foray to become a success to ease its growing China jitters. Yes, sales in China were blockbuster last quarter, ringing in $78.4 billion in revenue, which was a 3.3-percent increase over the previous year's period, but for much of last year, Apple was looking at a steady decline. The quarter, which ended in September 2016, was the first time since 2001 that Apple showed a decline in both revenue and in profit and was the third-consecutive quarter of decreasing revenue. In other words, a tectonic change that could be a foreshadowing of things to come. INNOVATING FOR THE MARKET It is one thing to be stuck in the innovation game -- as many observers have mentioned, Apple's cash cow, which is the iPhone, hasn't really changed that fundamentally since it was introduced in 2007, and with Steve Jobs now gone, it may not be able to conjure up another dimension-leaping product. Moreover, it is becoming more and more difficult to differentiate subsequent models from prior ones, as phone features, chip sets, and displays are plateauing in terms of relative progress over their previous incarnation. However, what will prove to be Apple's most significant and potentially disastrous stumble, is what Vivek Wadhwa, professor at Carnegie Mellon University Engineering at Silicon Valley and a director of research at Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization at Duke, identifies as its inability to innovate for a local market, which is where the next surge in smartphone growth will happen globally: "Apple has not customized its phones or the applications for them to the needs of Indian consumers; they are the same as in the US. Try asking Siri to recognize an Indian name or city, and it is clueless. Try asking it to play a Bollywood tune, as I have, and you'll also be banging your head against the wall. And forget having support for Indian languages: Everything is in English." By contrast, not only are Android phones -- with 97 percent of the market -- available in every Indian language you can think of, says Wadhwa, they can communicate with their users via a multi-lingual Google Assistant. Plus, with so few Apple phones in the hands of Indians, there is very little motivation to write cool apps for the local market on the iOS platform. Would Steve Jobs have thought about this problem differently? I imagine him eating his Indian vegetarian thali, as he was often did, and then in a eureka moment, diving into the next logical leap in innovation from the other end of the economic spectrum by coming up with a device that was frugal, cutting-edge, and cheap -- something that would empower the world's disadvantaged while bringing about yet another product revolution. Maybe that's asking for way too much from a company that has made its fortunes off a premium pricing model. A cheap phone would be a good start, though.

Apple’s iOS 10.3 update delivers an impressive set of changes including new features, a ton of security patches, and some useful tweaks. It’s a solid update but iOS 10.3 is far from perfect. iOS 10.3 problems are starting to popup and some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are noticing performance issues. We’ve heard about UI lag, random reboots, apps locking up, and more in the days since the iOS 10.3 update’s release. While your first inclination might be to contact Apple Support or schedule a Genius appointment at an Apple Store, there’s a very good chance you’ll be able to fix your iOS 10.3 performance issues yourself. In fact, it might take you just a few seconds. Today we want to share some tips that’ve worked for us in the past. Here’s how we’ve managed to fix bad iOS performance in the past and these might work for you and your version of iOS 10.3. Restart Your Device If you start noticing poor performance on your device, the first thing we recommend is a simple restart. This will take you just a few seconds but it could have a significant impact on your device’s performance. iOS 10.3 is now out for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Most of you already know how to do this but if you’re new to iOS, simply hold the power button down, slide to power down your phone or tablet, and then hold the power button down again to power the device back on. Reset Your Network Settings If you’re seeing slow downloads on the internet, in apps, or in the App Store, we recommend resetting your network settings to see if that clears up the issue. To do this, go to your Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will cause your device to forget your Wi-Fi passwords so make sure you have all of those handy before you start the process. It should only take a few moments to complete. If this doesn’t help fix your connectivity issues, we’ve got some more remedies available on our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems. Cleanup Your Device If you’re running out of space on your iPhone or iPad do some spring cleaning. Reducing the amount of clutter on your device could provide you with a nice boost to your device’s speed and overall performance. If you’ve owned your device for awhile there’s a good chance you’ve accumulated tons of items you no longer use. Maybe it’s videos you no longer watch or need, maybe its an app or 10. Whatever the case, it’s a good idea to track these files and apps down and delete them. You might be surprised at how much space you’ll clear up. To quickly check how much space you’re using on your internal storage, head into your Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and select Manage Storage. Update Your Apps If you’re dealing with poor app performance you’ll want to check to make sure your apps are up-to-date. If you don’t have automatic updates turned on it can be hard to stay on top of app updates. Developers have been pumping out updates in the first half of the year and there’s a chance you might’ve missed an important release. Head into the App Store and see what you can find. Just make sure you read reviews before you install a new version. Stop Automatic Downloads Automatic app downloads are extremely useful if you’re the kind of person that’s unable to stay on top of app updates. That said, the feature will make your device’s GPU work which could lead to poor performance or weird battery drain. If you’re fine with manually updating your apps, at least temporarily, try disabling Automatic Downloads on your device. To do this, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store. Once you’re there, you’ll want to toggle the switch to turn off Updates located in the Automatic Downloads section. Stop Background Refresh Background Refresh is another useful feature that could be hampering your device’s performance, With this feature turned on, your apps will be refreshed with new information while the app is in the background. For example, your Facebook feed will constantly be updated without having to actually open up the app. Shutting this function down could help your device’s CPU so it’s worth a shot if you don’t need instant access to your data. To do this, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle Background Refresh off. This will shut it down completely. You also have the ability to go down your list of apps one-by-one and make a selection on a case-by-case basis if you wish to do it that way. Reduce Transparency & Motion Effects If you’re noticing choppy animations and transitions try reducing transparency and motion effects on your device. Let’s start with Motion Effects. iOS 10 provides you a sense a depth when you tilt your device and when you open and close your various applications. Adjusting this feature a bit could help smooth out iOS 10.3’s performance on your phone or tablet. To reduce Motion Effects in iOS 10.3, go to  Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle Reduce Motion on. Note that reducing Motion Effects will disable some features like the bubble effect in the Messages app. Now that you’re in the Accessibility part of your device’s settings you’ll want to try reducing transparency. This will reduce transparency and blur effects. By reducing these features, you could help your device’s GPU. To Reduce Transparency, tap Increase Contrast and then tap the toggle to turn on the Reduce Transparency function. Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 If you’re ok with hopping off iOS 10.3 completely you might try downgrading to the iOS 10.2.1 update. If you were having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1, it’s definitely worth a shot. For a short time, Apple is signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can transition your device to the older version of iOS 10. The iOS 10.2.1 downgrade will close up in the near future so you’ll need to move quickly if you think this might help. For more on the iOS 10.2.1 downgrade, take a look at our walkthrough. Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Beta software can be problematic but there are times where users actually see improvements over the official software. If you’re desperate, you might try the iOS 10.3.2 beta to see if it helps your device’s performance. iOS 10.3.2 is a small release (as of right now) so don’t expect to see any new features or tweaks. Apple hasn’t announced an official iOS 10.3.2 release date yet so we’ll be moving through the beta without a timeline. Start Over If nothing here helps, and you can’t find a fix anywhere else, you might want to factory reset your phone. If you can’t take your device into an Apple Store, try erasing your device and starting over from scratch. This has been known to have a positive effect on performance, particularly on older devices. Before you reset your phone to its factory defaults, you’ll want to make sure you’re completely backed up. You’ll also need to put aside an hour or two of free time to make sure the process goes smoothly. If you’ve backed everything up and you’re ready to wipe your device clean, head into Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings to get started. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

This gives us a closer look at everything thats inside. The primary difference is the chipset, which is the same Apple A9 that is found inside the iPhone 6s and the iPhone SE. But there are some other changes too. For one, the new iPad is thicker than the Air 2 that it replaces and is almost as thick as the original iPad Air. This comes with a corresponding increase in battery size, which at 32.9Wh is larger than that in the Air 2 and roughly same as the one inside the original Air. The new iPad also uses the same display assembly as the original Air. This means the display and the digitizer unit are separate. This is a win for repairability as you can replace either part independently but it also means there is now an air gap between the glass and the display, something that was a bit of an eyesore on older iPad models and fixed on the Air 2 onwards. Other minor things include the lack of a sliding silent switch on the side, same as on the iPad Pro models, TouchID sensor from the Air 2, and minor redesigns to the microphone and speaker grilles. The new iPad is now available from Apple starting at $329.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the 10.12.5 macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability. The release notes accompanying the developer beta say the update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." There's not much to glean from Apple's release notes, so it is not clear what minor feature tweaks or bug fixes might be included in 10.12.5. Nothing notable has been discovered in the developer betas thus far.

Specs versus experience. By Emily Bary and Alex Eule March 30, 2017 2:16 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The new Galaxy S8 boasts impressive specs, but many smartphone users place a heavy value on user experience. Illustration: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Remember those “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” ads from Apple when it was still David competing with Goliath? Apple is no longer the underdog but the issue still resonates. Today, of course, it’s all about smartphones. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones have leapfrogged the current iPhones from a technology standpoint. Samsung beat Apple to the punch on several key features that folks are expecting from the iPhone 8 later this fall, such as an edge-to-edge screen and facial recognition capabilities. Wall Street analysts are also giving the S8 positive reviews, noting its slim design, fast processor, and glass display. The question is just how much any of it matters. “We note that Apple is never winning on specs,” Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote Thursday. iPhones are cool and easy to use. Sound familiar? The Mac’s winning argument wasn’t about better chips, but rather the overall user experience. That pattern is playing out once again with smartphones. Big Picture: Samsung’s new phones have neat features that iPhones don’t, but smartphone users don’t necessarily care about technical specifications.

But unlike Apple, Samsung devices don't work well together. With the Galaxy S8 smartphones and other new products, Samsung hopes that will change. The company is setting in motion a grand plan to build smart homes where its devices operate seamlessly and provide a consistent user experience. Samsung's S8 smartphones will be able to activate appliances through Connect, an app based on the company's SmartThings platform. With just a flick of the finger, the app will allow users to start a robot vacuum cleaner, dim lights, or even ask a Family Hub refrigerator to analyze contents and send a supermarket shopping list. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] The S8 also features a new artificial intelligence service called Bixby, which will ultimately allow users to tell the Connect app to activate a device. Samsung plans to integrate Bixby into appliances and devices for voice-activated operation, said Werner Goertz, research director at Gartner. Samsung also introduced the Connect Home router, which integrates the SmartThings hub. The router can be used as a central device to control SmartThings devices sold by Samsung and other companies. After much foot dragging, Samsung is finally pushing its consumer IoT strategy forward, with SmartThings the glue that brings all devices together. Samsung acquired SmartThings in 2014, but it took almost three years for the company to make it a useful asset. That's partly because Samsung has been a somewhat dysfunctional organization in which divisions often compete with each other instead of cooperating. The competing divisions are now working together with the hope of providing a consistent device experience, something that has made Apple successful. Samsung still hasn't shown anything related to its recent acquisition, Viv, which has developed a full-blown AI service. Either Samsung is fumbling with Viv, like it did with SmartThings, or internal dysfunction is delaying its implementation in mobile devices, analysts said. Bixby has some cool features, but it still lags behind Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana. Bixby is a voice agent for smartphones to run tasks and is also capable of recognizing images, providing recommendations, and translating languages. Samsung this week showed Bixby on S8 recognizing the Flatiron building and then providing recommendations on places to eat nearby. Additionally, the service can recognize objects and then redirect users to sites where people can buy or see reviews of items. But the demonstrations were carried out under controlled conditions. But there are issues that Samsung needs to work out. The S8 handsets have Google's more advanced artificial intelligence technology, which could hurt Bixby's adoption. The S8 remains "first and foremost a Google ecosystem device," and Bixby is trying to provide a different type of service, said Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, in a research note. "But careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. It also works with few apps, limiting its utility. Bixby also lacks advanced analytics that could help with home automation. For some reason, Samsung has chosen a limited implementation of SmartThings, which is already capable of home automation. For example, SmartThings can analyze data gathered over time to automatically switch air conditioners on or off, or turn on a light or heating when a car is close to home. The service can also provide diet recommendations based on health data gathered over time. Advanced features of SmartThings will be available in the future, a Samsung spokesman said. Advanced features of SmartThings will be available in the future, a Samsung spokesman said. At an analyst event on Thursday, Samsung showed Gartner's Goertz a pyramid-like graphic which showed IoT and intelligence as a middleware foundation for a group of products. "Going forward, we should expect the currently siloed groups and technologies to leverage this common platform and maybe that way, bridge the silos and create much-needed synergies," Goertz said. But the IoT data platform is still nascent, and Bixby lacks advanced AI features. Viv could bring advanced analytics to Bixby over time, but Samsung hasn't rolled the service out. Samsung also has a full-blown cloud service called Artik, but it is offered by the company's semiconductor unit, which operates almost like a separate company. SmartThings can work with the Artik Cloud and open up to a wider range of smart home devices. However, Artik is more of a cloud-based analytics play, much like Microsoft's Azure.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES The Future of Workflow Apple Releases iOS 10.3 with Find My AirPods, Standardized In-App Review Prompts, and Other Improvements iPad Diaries: Working with Zip Archives This week's sponsor Shapego Beautiful Word Clouds for iPad and iPhone The Future of Workflow By Federico Viticci I've loved Workflow since the first beta I was sent in August 2014. Workflow is my most-used iOS app of all time, and, in many ways, it is the reason my iPad Pro can be my primary computer. I've written thousands of words on the app and have created hundreds of workflows for myself and others over the course of two years. I referred to Workflow as Minecraft for iOS productivity and the modern bicycle for the mind in the past. I stand by those analogies. There's nothing else on iOS like Workflow, which deftly walked the fine line between absurd innovation and Apple rejections with a bold vision and technical prowess. Workflow embraced the limitations of iOS and turned them into strengths, resulting in a power-user app with no competition. After two years, no app gets remotely close to the automation features shipped by the Workflow team. And now Workflow and its creators are going to be part of Apple and the company's bigger (and more secretive) plans. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I had always kept the possibility that Workflow could eventually be discontinued or acquired. In a somewhat prescient move, Stephen quizzed me on this problem a few weeks ago on Connected. My "worst-case scenario" of Workflow going away became the new reality of iOS automation last week. Workflow as an app is an incredibly good acquisition for Apple, but there's a deeper subtext here. Workflow represents a movement from a large number of users who enjoy working from iOS devices so much, they want to optimize the experience as much as possible. Workflow's goal wasn't to merely provide a capable alternative to the Mac's AppleScript and Automator; Workflow wanted to eclipse legacy scripting environments and usher iOS users into a new era of mobile automation. There's the Workflow app and team – technically impressive and absolutely talented – and there's the bigger theme behind Workflow. But what has Apple acquired, exactly? Under Apple's control, can Workflow continue on its mission to make automation accessible for everyone? If Apple sees a future in iOS automation powered by Workflow, what else can be done with a virtually infinite budget and stronger ties to the platform? And what does this acquisition mean for Apple's commitment to pro users on iOS? I've been mulling over these questions for the past week. I don't have any absolute answers at this point, but, after building workflows and following the app's development for two years, I have some ideas on where Workflow can go next. Below, you'll find two possible scenarios for Workflow as an Apple app, as well as some considerations on how Apple could evolve Workflow into a native feature of iOS devices and a new developer platform. Worst Option: Workflow Is Abandoned Without a Replacement If you follow tech startup news, you'd be hard-pressed to get excited about your favorite app shutting down because its founders are going to work for a bigger company. Most of these announcements follow the same playbook: TechCrunch/other publication breaks the acquisition news; Bigger company confirms the deal; Startup confirms the acquisition in a Medium post, says the team is "excited to join Company" and "continue on their vision" for Product; Casey Newton writes a fantastic "behind the scenes" obituary; Product receives no updates for 6-12 months. If it is updated, changes focus on removal of existing features or basic bug fixes; Product is unceremoniously discontinued. A shorter, less inspired Medium post mentions the team's "bigger mission that now goes beyond Product". In startup lingo, these acquisitions are referred to as "acqui-hires": a bigger company hires a startup's talent by buying their Product, but the purchase is only skin-deep. This is an over-simplification, but, in most cases, the corporation is only interested in the people who built Product and have no motivation whatsoever in continuing to invest in it, its customers, and legacy tech. If Product stays around for a few months, it's because the startup managed to convince the new owners to enable a grace period out of respect for existing users. Both parties are acting in their best interests, but Company has the upper hand. The only constant is customers losing access to the original service sooner or later. I don't know if Workflow will follow the same path of most startups acquired by Apple and other large companies, but initial signs are already there. The latest version of Workflow has removed some actions (which might be due to legal reasons) and the curated Workflow Gallery no longer highlights user profiles. The app has been made free, Apple has promised to keep it on the App Store for now (grace period), and the core engineering team has joined Apple. It's easy then to imagine the following scenario: Apple has acqui-hired the Workflow team for their talent, but they have no intention of operating Workflow in its current form going forward. The app will live on the App Store for 6-12 months while the team begins working on something else unrelated to a standalone automation product. Sometime later this year or in mid-2018, Apple will remove Workflow from the App Store and links to public workflows shared by users will redirect to a 'Goodbye' webpage. Following outrage by the community, Apple will issue a statement citing the "great new technologies" in iOS 11 that obviate the need for Workflow and provide a better solution for everyone. Finally, changes in a build of iOS 11 will introduce compatibility issues in the last, abandoned version of Workflow that will prevent normal usage of the app. With no actual replacement, millions of users will forever lose access to the best automation app ever created for iOS, and new features in iOS 11 won't be able to compensate for the demise of Workflow. Following Apple's acquisition, this is my new worst case scenario for Workflow. While I don't personally believe in such a dark timeline, it is plausible and it has precedents with hundreds of startup acquisitions and discontinued products that came before Workflow. I should also mention how Apple's spotty performance in automation and recent tumult within the organization lend credence to the common belief that Apple doesn't care about Workflow as a dedicated iOS automation app. On the Mac side, Automator (the app that inspired Workflow in the first place) has been languishing without major updates for years, while scripting technologies such as AppleScript and JXA have hardly received any attention. Sal Soghoian, former head of Automation Technologies at Apple, left last year and later urged users to be vocal about the need for scripting and automation features. Apple's recent approach to automation and other pro software features epitomize a company that is focused on consumer products. And automation, sadly, has never been a tentpole feature that could appeal to millions of consumers. From Apple's perspective, it would arguably make sense to kill off a product that doesn't directly contribute to the bottom line of the company, despite the quality of the software and affection from the community. Best Option: Apple Turns Workflow into a More Powerful, Native iOS Feature When it comes to high-profile acquisitions of popular iOS apps and services, the modern Apple has a fairly solid track record. The three examples I can think of – Siri, TestFlight, and Beats Music – all blossomed into native successful services that are much better as Apple products today than they could have ever been as third-party additions to the iOS ecosystem. The evolution of Siri is particularly impressive, as it went from a third-party assistant app to an integral part of the entire iOS experience. Just like abandoning those three services would have destroyed goodwill among existing customers and put Apple at a competitive disadvantage, letting Workflow wither away without a proper replacement would be a deep setback for iOS productivity and send the wrong message to a community of committed users who are embracing iOS devices as post-PC computers. In a more optimistic outlook, Apple has seen the unparalleled functionality and unique potential of Workflow and convinced the team that the only way to reach the next level of system integration was to have Workflow become part of iOS itself. Similarly to Siri and Beats Music, the vision behind Workflow is ripe for unlimited resources with no restrictions on access to private APIs and system features. Under Apple's guidance, Workflow could grow into a safer, more integrated, extensible automation service and developer platform unlike anything that has ever been attempted on the Mac before. Workflow was already reshaping iOS automation; as an Apple app, Workflow could lay the foundation for the future of iOS productivity. I've been thinking about the future of Workflow for a while – ever since I started imagining what "Workflow 2.0" could have been. Apple has a lot of work ahead and I don't think we'll see the results of their automation efforts in iOS 11 this year. With no knowledge of the Workflow team's (or Apple's) actual plans, I've compiled a list of smaller additions and major changes that we could expect from an Apple-made Workflow in the next few years. Short-Term and Other Obvious Improvements Bearing in mind that Apple is likely going to rewrite Workflow from scratch, these are some of the less visionary improvements I expect the company to bring to the app. Workflow Folders and iCloud Sync Workflow needs better organization for user-created workflows. While the team has done a remarkable job with the ability to easily reference workflows and a larger collection of icon glyphs, there should be a way to create folders for workflows and control their appearance (with folder icons) and sorting settings. Folder navigation would introduce new challenges1, but the current single-view model doesn't scale anymore. Furthermore, I expect Apple to replace Workflow's proprietary Workflow Sync service with their own iCloud-based2 solution with support for versions and public sharing. While App Store guidelines prohibit third-party apps from syncing executable code between devices3, I suspect Apple's future Workflow app will eschew such limitations and securely sync your workflows between devices. A More Flexible Action Extension Workflow's customizable action extension is one of the strongest arguments in favor of opening up user automation on iOS. By integrating with any app or system feature that supports the share sheet, Workflow's extension enables users to create their own (safe) improvements for iOS apps and make their devices work better for them. There's a lot more to done with the extension, though. Workflow's current action extension has limited filtering options. Most notably, Workflow's extension needs more filters to specify where and when a workflow should be available as an extension. Currently, Workflow supports basic type filters for items passed to the share sheet such as "Safari webpages" or "Files". In a future version of Workflow, I would like to see filtering capabilities to control, for instance, workflows that should appear as extensions only at a specific website (filter by domain), with a specific file type shared from an app ("any JPEG shared from Photos"), or for email messages that come from a certain sender or that contain a keyword in their subject. Some of these ideas can be implemented with a series of manual workarounds in the current Workflow app, while others would require direct access to restricted parts of iOS. As an Apple app, Workflow should make it easier to pick workflows for the extension, and it should also allow users to choose from more options previously not available to a third-party app. New Privileges Speaking of limitations in the old Workflow, becoming a first-party app gives Apple the opportunity to grant Workflow new exclusive privileges in terms of performance, iCloud Drive integration, and private API usage. If the company is committed to Workflow, I fully expect them to take advantage of technologies that aren't available to third-party apps. There are dozens of areas Apple could consider for new Workflow-only integrations. iPad users could gain an option to assign system-wide keyboard shortcuts to workflows and run actions from any app at any time – like they can with scripts on the Mac. Workflow could access device settings such as WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay, location, or Accessibility options, and provide contextual actions to modify the behavior of a device depending on the user's preference, network condition, and other criteria.4 Apple could consider giving Workflow full access to iCloud Drive and let the app read files from and write them to any folder from any app – not just the sandboxed /Workflow folder. Currently, Workflow's iCloud Drive actions can't be as flexible as the Dropbox ones. Apple could even make special exceptions for increasing the memory allocation to the Workflow widget and extension, enabling users to perform more power-intensive tasks and for longer periods of time in multiple parts of the OS. Combined with extended background execution times, these advantages could allow Workflow's automation engine to become more pervasive and integrated throughout iOS. My favorite idea, however, is attempting to imagine new "real-time workflows" that would intelligently react to device conditions/environmental triggers and adapt their interface and actions accordingly. Imagine, for instance, a workflow capable of accessing HomeKit controls, Apple Music, and HealthKit workouts at runtime. A user who goes running every morning could easily assemble a multi-step routine which locks their front door and brings up a collection of music playlists before the run starts. While the user is running, an underlying Workflow engine would put workout-optimized music controls and run details front and center on the Apple Watch or iPhone. Finally, the same routine that "prepares" a new run could automatically unlock the front door, continue playing music on a wireless speaker, and display summary stats for the completed workout on a big screen via the Apple TV as soon as the user gets back home. This automation wouldn't be a standalone "workflow" that is manually executed as much as it'd be an invisible, integrated, and secure automation engine connected to every piece of the Apple ecosystem. It may sound too futuristic, but many of the key elements required for these ideas are already in place, both in Workflow and in Apple's own frameworks. Workflow can already integrate with Apple Music and control music playback; it doesn't have any HomeKit actions, but it fully supports HealthKit. With iOS 10, Apple added a basic routine-building UI for HomeKit automation, which would greatly benefit from Workflow's more intuitive interface. Once these two worlds collide, it's reasonable to envision a deeply integrated Workflow that supports Apple technologies such as HomeKit, CloudKit sharing, CarPlay, Siri, and iMessage; it also makes sense to see Apple embrace new home and lifestyle automation features to foster more powerful (and yet secure) connections between all of their services. As iOS continues to split system apps and features into atomic units available as extensions and widgets across the OS, and as services evolve into a new pillar for the company, Apple's Workflow could be the connective tissue between them all, going far beyond the rudimentary app automations we've seen so far. Rewriting Workflow with exclusive access to iOS features and services would be an obvious first step. A Bigger Idea: WorkflowKit One of the unique traits of iOS devices – particularly the iPad – is how they've redefined the concept of modern productivity. As portable screens that can transform into anything, iPhones and iPads are enablers of new jobs to be done that supersede the association of "work" with spreadsheets and meetings. Once the computer is not on every desk but in every hand, the possibilities for productivity and work communications become endless. Apple has played an essential role in the redefinition of modern productivity with the App Store, but we're reaching the point where Apple and app developers can't make one-size-fits-all solutions for millions of users with ever-changing needs and priorities. Apple can't possibly develop all the productivity features for all the creative professionals, small business owners, educators, and enterprise customers who are adopting iOS. With Workflow, Apple could lead us into a second generation of iOS productivity apps by turning automation and inter-app communication into an extensible, integrated platform. In my mind, the next logical move for Workflow is to open up to apps with a new framework that does not require users to edit URL schemes. With a WorkflowKit (my own imaginary name), apps could offer some of their functions and data as discrete modules. These actions would allow users to build more complex and yet easier, faster, and safer workflows that let multiple apps collaborate on the same task in a visually automated fashion. One of Apple's goals with iOS 8 was to remove the need for URL scheme-based automation by offering extensions to invoke certain app functionalities anywhere on iOS. However, by relegating extensions to the share sheet and preventing developers from referencing individual third-party app extensions, Apple's strategy partially missed the point. Developers who wanted to call a specific extension still couldn't, and remained stuck with the extra step of the share sheet (see: how the 1Password extension has to be embedded in apps). Meanwhile, those developers who wanted to ship third-party app integrations and automation features still had to rely on URL schemes – usually, the popular x-callback-url spec (there are plenty of examples around, including ADA winners and Workflow itself). As a result, extensions were a fantastic addition, but they didn't address the lack of true inter-app communication and automation on iOS.5 WorkflowKit could help Apple move past URL schemes for good and offer a robust automation framework for developers. The system could be built on iOS' current extensibility model, where a container app offers sandboxed access to extensions that users can invoke outside of the main app experience. Behind the scenes, Workflow's Content Graph engine would take care of connecting any input to any app action, creating a safe automation environment where everything "just works". This way, rather than exchanging plain text data with a URL scheme (which forces users to jump back and forth between Workflow and apps), an app could offer multiple WorkflowKit extensions (called "actions") to display content and perform rich tasks in Workflow. Permission to use such actions could be granted by users on a case-by-case basis, and actions could be grouped in categories that include running functions from external apps with or without an interface, managing documents, displaying specific app content in a custom QuickLook preview, and more. Consider the current version of Workflow. The app is effectively split in two macro categories: native actions and third-party app ones. Native actions can be executed inside Workflow and offer features such as displaying menus and lists, opening webpages with Safari View Controller, formatting text and numbers, and more. Third-party app actions try to abstract the complexity of URL schemes with a pretty UI, but, in the end, they're still based on launching URLs and leaving Workflow to open another app. Despite the native appearance, Workflow's current app actions are based on URL schemes. WorkflowKit could dramatically improve the second category of actions and make any app action a native one. Without leaving Workflow, an app like Pixelmator could provide a 'Resize and Crop' action to perform an image editing task inline. A note-taking app like Bear could have an 'Append to Note' action to save some text at the bottom of a note. A task manager could offer an action that presents you with a list of active todos to share with someone in your contacts. None of these actions would ever leave Workflow – they'd always run in-place and they'd come bundled with an app just like extensions and widgets currently do. Users would always grant permission to read, write, and delete third-party app data for WorkflowKit actions, and developers would have to support both visual and headless modes for every action they offer, with mandatory Accessibility integration. The entire system would be heavily influenced by Apple's NSExtension framework and the Workflow team's Content Graph engine. This isn't an easy task for Apple, though. To achieve such integration between iOS and apps, the company must first build a framework that enables apps to communicate directly with each other in a non-destructive manner. This implies a new set of privacy controls and permissions to avoid the problems inherent to URL schemes, as well as a fundamental rethinking of the iOS sandboxing structure. That system would then provide a new foundation for Workflow 2.0, which would leverage new inter-app communication APIs to deprecate URL scheme automation and allow users to mix and match functions from multiple apps. The Workflow Gallery, now limited to discovering workflows from other users, would also showcase apps that come with Workflow actions, providing a new discovery avenue for developers and, for users, a way to add more powerful functionality to their workflows simply by downloading new apps. Everyone wins. Workflow already offers limited discovery options for third-party apps. The true potential for WorkflowKit lies, I believe, in going beyond workflows inside the Workflow app. WorkflowKit would give users a way to turn any action into a system-wide extension or widget. For example, workflows wouldn't have to be grouped under a single 'Run Workflow' extension – instead, users could pin workflows as native extensions in the share sheet or other app toolbars. And if we follow this idea – that automation could trickle down into multiple parts of iOS – it's easy to imagine workflow macros made specifically for Pages, sets of custom actions for Safari, or workflows that are designed as routines for Siri and HomeKit. Thus, more than a rebranded Automator, an Apple-made Workflow 2.0 could be a comprehensive set of user automation tools that span an app and customizable extension points, all capable of integrating natively and securely with any iOS technology, app, and interface. A new inter-app communication framework and the subsequent WorkflowKit would be the core of this system. App developers (including Apple) would offer actions; users would ultimately remix them and connect them to anything they want. WorkflowKit would be the framework powering the Workflow app and actions from developers. At a fundamental level, I strongly believe that Apple doesn't like the URL scheme-based app actions in the current version of Workflow they just acquired. Using URL schemes for app automation is an unreliable and unsafe workaround. I don't see an Apple-owned Workflow introducing new features based on visible URL schemes.6 Therefore, if we buy into the theory that Apple wants to invest in the Workflow app without crippling it, it's only natural to assume that the company is planning new inter-app communication features with an automation component. That would be WorkflowKit. If done right, WorkflowKit could reimagine iOS productivity by letting us completely personalize our work experience and favorite apps. The Path Ahead We're on the cusp of a new beginning for automation on Apple's platforms. With Workflow, Apple has acquired more than an app; they have gained a foothold in a new kind of user automation that is friendly, visual, accessible, and deeply integrated with iOS hardware and software unlike any scripting language before. In this article, I have outlined the worst and best scenarios for Workflow going forward. Realistically, here's what I expect: I think Apple acquired Workflow with the intention of building their own automation platform on iOS. Like Siri, TestFlight, and Beats Music, I don't think Apple bought Workflow just to abandon it. I believe both Apple and Workflow saw this as the best possible solution to continue growing the app into a more powerful tool for iOS users. Whatever Apple is planning, however, it won't be ready for iOS 11 in June. I'd expect the Workflow app to remain (mostly untouched) on the App Store until Apple offers a replacement – possibly in Spring 2018 or in iOS 12. If and when that replacement becomes available, I expect it to be a complete rewrite of the app with little to no support for legacy workflows.7 I also assume that Apple wants their take on iOS automation to be tightly controlled by clear user permissions, and that URL scheme callbacks won't be part of Workflow's future. Unless Apple wants to outright remove third-party app support from Workflow, I suspect the company is building "Workflow as a feature" inside iOS with a framework that developers will be able to integrate with. That "WorkflowKit" framework will enable third-party developers to offer discrete app actions that can be embedded in Workflow and other extension points. WorkflowKit will be based on groundwork laid with iOS 11 this year, and it'll tell a bigger story for Workflow 2.0 as the glue between every iOS app, service, or system feature. I'm guessing, but I'd say that all of this is at least a year away. Apple acquiring Workflow could be a pivotal moment for iOS automation and productivity apps. Two years after the release of Workflow 1.0, we're at a crossroads: Workflow has shown us a future where automation means an intuitive GUI, native integrations with iOS, and none of the baggage of desktop scripting. There's a special beauty in Workflow's underlying message: anyone, whether they consider themselves "programmers" or not, can make a computer their own. The software we use every day doesn't have to be a static experience; with automation and creativity, any app can be remixed, extended, and personalized to our needs. Workflow gives power back to the users. Now only Apple can turn Workflow's promise into a reality, ushering us into a new era of automation for everyone, on every device, in every app. I want to believe. Especially if the app retains a dedicated widget for workflow shortcuts; the widget would have to support folders too. ↩︎ CloudKit. ↩︎ This is one of the reasons Pythonista doesn't offer device sync, or why Workflow never added JavaScript actions. ↩︎ Imagine workflows that play media on AirPlay speakers only if available, or actions that change their output based on the user's Accessibility settings. ↩︎ I believe Apple is working on a new framework for deeper access to app documents and data in iOS 11, but I want to focus on automation and what WorkflowKit could mean for the future of productivity apps. ↩︎ I wouldn't be too surprised if Apple eventually removes the ability for users to open any URL scheme. The popularity of launchers and the lack of native automation features currently prevent Apple from blocking URL schemes. WorkflowKit could also be the system that lets users launch apps into specific views with "launcher actions". ↩︎ The best case scenario for this: Apple builds a legacy Workflow importer to automatically convert workflows to the new Apple format. It's unlikely, but Apple did build an importer for the transition from Beats Music to Apple Music. ↩︎ Tags: automation, iOS, workflow Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple clears through almost 350 security vulnerabilities with of iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS updates Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, March 29th, 2017, 05:54 Category: Hack, iOS, macOS, News, security, Software, TvOS, watchOS Apple cleaned house via a slew of operating system updates on Monday, pinning down nearly 350 known vulnerabilities between its changes to iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple’s latest version includes Find My AirPods, Apple’s new file system, CarPlay, and a few other small visual tweaks. With nearly every update Apple does, they also include a handful of security fixes that easily go unnoticed by the user. iOS 10.3 is no exception with over 85 different common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) listed. In one case, the iOS 10.3 update patched a security hole that allowed attackers to spam Safari with a ‘Cannot Open Page’ dialog. Lookout, a cybersecurity company, learned of the attack after one of their users complained of losing control over their browsing experience. The dialog was meant to trick users into eventually paying money to “unlock” their Safari browser. Another update for both iOS and macOS repaired a vulnerability in which users connecting to what seemed to be a secure server opened the door for remote code execution. The vulnerability discovered by Talos, a threat intelligence organization, showed that when a Safari browser navigated to a HTTPS site, macOS and iOS would validate the invalid and malicious certificate leaving the user open to attack. Just in the past few weeks alone, WikiLeaks has released reports from previous exploits that the CIA used on iOS and Mac devices. While the reports were aged and shared outdated exploits, the sheer number of fixes that Apple released this week alone shows that many vulnerabilities still exist. As always, be sure to install security updates where you can, be safe out there and stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share March 30, 2017 2:09 PM EDT APPLE INC -0.19 At Closing, March 30th 143.93 USD This year will be a test of Americans' appetite for even more costly smartphones. That makes it tough to be confident in predictions of a smartphone rebound.  The U.S. starting price for high-end smartphones such as Samsung's Galaxy line and Apple's iPhones had settled around $650. Not anymore. Samsung on Wednesday released the latest lineup of its Galaxy smartphones, which start at $750 -- about $100 more than comparable models in prior years. Apple, too, has subtly dialed up iPhone prices by introducing features to push people toward higher-cost models. The average revenue Apple generates from each iPhone reached a record of $695 in the December quarter. The 2017 iPhone lineup is expected to add a new model at perhaps $1,000 or more.  Defying Gravity Apple's iPhone sales fell last year, but clever feature tweaks pushed up the device's average sale price to a record Source: Bloomberg Note: Quarters shown here reflect Apple's fiscal year, which ends each September. Smartphone sticker price inflation has implications beyond household budgets. Higher prices, combined with Americans' changing smartphone-buying behavior, make it difficult to predict phone sales by relying on patterns from even two or three years ago. The smartphone market has unmistakably changed -- with the biggest implications for Apple Inc.  After the first iPhone sales decline in history, Apple's stock price has recovered from 2016 lows, mostly on expectations of a sales "super cycle" spurred by the next versions of the device.   Naturally, Apple has not discussed its plans, but reports have said Apple might shift from two to three iPhone models in 2017. Two will be refreshed versions of the iPhone 7 and the larger-screen iPhone 7 Plus. A new model may have a more vibrant type of screen with extra real estate thanks to skinnier frames around the phone's edges. Analysts have forecast this new iPhone may cost roughly $1,000.  Apple Ascent Apple's market value has recovered from a 2016 low point as investors anticipate an iPhone sales surge from new models expected this year Source: Bloomberg Wall Street in recent months has grown increasingly confident that a significantly overhauled 2017 iPhone will significantly jolt sales, just as the 2014 introduction of the first larger-screen iPhone did. Sales of iPhones jumped 37 percent in Apple's 2015 fiscal year, the first full year with the iPhone 6. It's been downhill for iPhone sales ever since. (Samsung's smartphone sales also fell last year.) But analysts are expecting the tide to turn. On average, analysts who follow Apple expect the company to sell 239 million iPhones in its fiscal year ending in September 2018, or 13 percent more than the 212 million iPhones sold in fiscal 2016. Some analysts have recently become much more bullish, based in part on expectations that people would start buying new or replacement iPhones at a rate closer to 2014 patterns than to 2016 ones.  Call It a Comeback Sales of iPhones dipped for the first time in Apple's 2016 fiscal year, but analysts expect a return to growth Source: Bloomberg and Nomura (for average analyst sales estimates in FY 2017 and FY 2018) Note: Apple's fiscal year ends each September. Here's a big wrinkle, however. In the U.S., smartphone buying has changed completely since 2014. People are now paying full freight for their phones -- either $650 or more up front or in monthly installments. Back then, U.S. phone carriers subsidized smartphone prices so many people were lulled into believing a high-end smartphone like the iPhone cost just $200. Those phone subsidies are essentially gone in the U.S.  Whether it's because phones don't "cost" $200 anymore, or because the improvements in phone models are more subtle than wow, Americans aren't buying new smartphones as often. The average length of time between people replacing their smartphones was about 31 months in 2016, up from nearly 25 months in 2014, according to telecom industry consultant Chetan Sharma. If sticker prices for smartphones go up, that may give people one more reason to hold onto their old iPhones for a little longer. Change in iPhone Sales in Apple's FY 2016 -8% Predictions of a “super cycle” could still pan out even if Americans don’t revert back to 2014 buying patterns. The number of iPhone owners is 79 percent higher than it was in 2014, according to Bernstein Research estimates, which makes a sales lift more likely even if a relatively small percentage of iPhone owners buy a new, pricier model. There are some signs that shoppers in China -- Apple’s second-largest market  -- are eager for new iPhones. But Apple has misjudged iPhone buying behavior before, and it could again. The combination of rising smartphone prices and longer stretches between upgrades means Apple will have a hard time turning the calendar back to 2014. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. When Apple announced the U.S. launch of the iPhone 6 in September 2014, it didn't even give the "real" price because that was not how Americans purchased phones. Apple doesn't break down iPhone sales by country. But it does disclose that sales in North America, South America and "Greater China" -- China, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- together generated nearly two-thirds of the company's revenue in fiscal 2016.

(Shandra Martinez | MLive.com) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on March 30, 2017 at 3:05 PM, updated March 30, 2017 at 3:06 PM comments KENTWOOD, MI -- If you are wondering what's behind the massive black wall next to the Apple store in Woodland Mall, it's an even bigger Apple store. The tech giant plans to open a new 8,000 square-feet store sometime this year, which is twice as large as the current store. That bit of information slipped from Michael A. Khouri, vice president of leasing for the Philadelphia-based PREIT, the parent company of Woodland, earlier this month when he was talking about the mall's upcoming $100 million expansion. He declined to provide any other details, referring questions to PREIT's public relations staff. The Grand Rapids area mall's spokeswoman declined to comment. So did the Apple spokeswoman. And store employees are mum as well. Behind the black wall, a bigger Apple store is being built. Shandra Martinez | MLive.com  The floor-to-ceiling black wall covers the spaces previously occupied by retailers Justice and Claire, which have relocated to other parts of the Kentwood shopping center, at 3195 28th St SE. Shopper Taneka Smith says she is thrilled about the potential for a bigger store, if only it means that more staff to answer questions. "The store is busy all the time" said the Grand Rapids resident as she was leaving the store this week. On a weekend visit, Smith says she has waited up to an hour for assistance. "I'm glad the store is expanding," Smith said. "I love Apple." The 4,000 square-foot store has been a favorite destination since opening in 2005. It's the only Apple store in West Michigan. Apple has two other stores in Lansing and Novi.

However, at the moment, Apple’s digital assistant is still lacking in features and is somewhat limited in what it can do. For the most part, it can set timers, alarms, and appointments, and even make reservations or simple web searches. Unfortunately, it does not offer a lot when it comes to machine learning. Recent reports reveal though, that Siri will get a much needed upgrade on Apple’s next iOS, the iOS 11. According to an Israeli site The Verifier, Apple is working on integrating Siri with the iOS messaging app. This integration will include improved machine learning; even exhibiting contextual learning based on the flow of the conversation. For instance, say you and your friend are talking about seeing a movie. On iOS 11, Siri will be able to pick that up and make suggestions on what movie to watch. Apple patent for Siri contextual learning (via patentlyapple.com) In addition to contextual learning on iMessage, Siri will also feature deeper integration with Apple’s iCloud service. In the said report, Siri on iOS 11 will be able to identify the relationships between Apple devices under one iCloud account. Based on this connection, Siri will be able to suggest actions that will then be reflected to all the iCloud connected devices. The report claims that these new features will be included in the upcoming iOS 11. However, it did not present any evidence to support the claims. It should be noted that the contextual learning part of Siri has been patented by Apple previously. The report could be pertaining to the same Apple patent involving machine learning and Siri. For now, there is no easy way of verifying the validity of these claims. However, Apple is set to release iOS 11 in less than three months. Although on release, the version of iOS 11 will only be for developers and will not be suitable for everyday use. Apple will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Then in September, the Cupertino tech-giant will official release the iOS 11 together with the new iPhone 8, 7s and 7s Plus. For more updates on iOS 11, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The iOS 10.3 signifies Apple’s jump to 64-bit mobile computing in addition to the new filing system. While many are experiencing long install times, users should be glad to know that the new Apple File System on iOS 10.3 can save them as much as 7.81GB of storage. According to the tests done by Apple Insider, the new firmware update, apart from introducing a new filing system, can also maximize storage formatting on an iOS device. A top-tier iPhone 7 Plus containing thousands of files and hundreds of apps managed to reclaim as much as 7.81GB after iOS 10.3 installation. Furthermore, the storage capacity also jumped from 248.5GB to 252.14GB, a 3.64GB difference. Other iOS 10.3 features In addition to the space saving feature of the new APFS on iOS 10.3, the new firmware also packs in a few more much needed tweaks. For instance, Most of the app animations are now much more responsive and smooth. This is mainly because developers shortened the animation time to reduce file sizes. iPhone running on iOS 10.3 (via apple.com) iOS 10.3 also includes new features for Siri, support for locating lost Apple AirPods, and CarPlay features. The Settings app also received a revamp in the newest iOS update. New Apple File System As mentioned earlier, iOS 10.3 introduced the new Apple Filing System for iOS. This is a major upgrade from the previous HFS+ used on both iOS and macOS devices. Apart from being more efficient in formatting storage, the new filing system also supports 64-bit computing. That means it can keep track of around 9 quintillion files in one volume storage. Unfortunately, the update also meant that old 32-bit applications on the iOS will no longer be supported. In fact, iOS 10.3 now warns users if they are using a 32-bit app. Also, having a 64-bit file system could also mean that iPhones older than the 5s will not be able to get the update. This is because anything older than the iPhone 5s uses either a 16-bit or 32-bit ARM processor. For more updates on iOS 10.2, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Boasting some of the largest wrap-around screens ever made, the long-awaited S8 is the South Korean tech giant's first new premium phone since the Note 7 debacle in October, which wiped out $5.48 billion of profit and helped Apple overtake Samsung as the world's top smartphone maker in the fourth quarter. Two versions of the Galaxy S8, code-named Dream internally, were launched at a media event in New York on Wednesday, with 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) and 5.8-inch curved screens - the largest to date for Samsung's premium smartphones. The phones, which will go on sale on April 21, are slightly longer but comparable in width to their predecessors as Samsung has eliminated nearly all of the bezel borders around the face to maximize the screen surface area. The S8 features Samsung's new artificial intelligence service, Bixby, with functions including a voice-commanded assistant system similar to Apple's Siri. There is also a new facial recognition application that lets users unlock their phones by looking at them. Samsung is hoping the design update and the new features - nothing revolutionary but focused on making life easier for consumers - will be enough to revive sales in a year Apple is expected to introduce major changes to its iPhones for their 10th anniversary, including the very curved screens that have become staples of the Galaxy brand. The S8 is also crucial for Samsung's image as a maker of reliable mobile devices. The self-combusting Galaxy Note 7s had to be scrapped in October just two months after their launch and a failed attempt to recall the Note 7s in September was particularly damaging, investors and analysts say, leading to questions about the firm's credibility. Samsung responded by implementing new battery safety measures after an internal investigation identified battery problems from two different suppliers as the cause of the Note 7's problems. Still, some analysts say consumers may be wary of potential safety problems with the S8. "Initial sales of the S8 may appear slow compared to what was typical for previous model releases," said Lux Research analyst Christopher Robinson. "In other words, smaller initial sales spike." Samsung's early marketing of the S8 has eschewed the safety issue, which brand experts say is an attempt to avoid reminding consumers of the images of burnt Note 7s that spread throughout the world's media late last year.

Some of the details contradict many of reports we've been hearing over the past few months. The new device is said to feature a vertical dual-lens camera, possibility for better depth of field when used horizontally within an AR/VR headset. Additionally, there's allegedly a dual-lens camera setup on the front of the device; likely for 3D sensing capabilities. Their source claims that rumors of a glass back are incorrect. Apple’s current iPhone Edition prototype features a ‘metal’ back plate. Apple’s decision to switch to metal over glass was authorized due to the tendency glass has to shatter when dropped. The site also claims that the Touch ID sensor will not be embedded into the display; rather, it will be moved to the back of the device similar to how it is on many Android devices. Check out their 'iPhone Edition' mockup below and let us know what you think in the comments! Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Luigi Rausch - 19 hours ago Ciao! My name is Luigi Rausch and I wanted to get your opinion on something. As far as the iPhone 8, being it will be the 10th anniversary edition and nobody really knows what the "official" name will be. What if they called it the "Apple Phone" removing the i in iPhone. Why do I think they would do this? They have been progressively changing their naming schemes since the "Apple Watch” and now they have of course "Apple AirPods" "Apple TV" "Apple Music" “Apple Pencil” etc.. Along with this new naming scheme as Apple did with the Apple Watch the following Apple Phone could be the Apple Phone Series 2, which would be the same as the S updated versions. Then the following year could be the Apple Phone 2 and following that the Apple Phone 2 Series 2 etc..I say this because the materials and the naming scheme from the Apple Watch always tend to trickle into the iPhone, like the 3D Touch, soon to be OLED display, and the possibility of a ceramic body. To enforce this all further, as you know Apple recently changed the Mac operating system name from OS X to macOS. Now with the upcoming iOS 11 they are making big changes to differentiate the iOS's for the future iPhones and iPads as the iPads are so much more powerful now (already running a very different version of iOS than is on the iPhone). Hence they will change the naming scheme of that as well, most likely phoneOS and padOS. If Apple were to do this they wouldn't by any means be throwing away the iPhone name. Instead they would continue to use it on their cheaper older version phones at least for a few years to come, being they always give consumers some cheaper options. The Phone would then be reserved for the flagship model of course that is coming out. This would in-turn make the transition slow giving users a chance to adopt the name and at the same time separating it from the rest of the line, making it stand out more for sure. I think it also signifies and sets the tone for a new generation for Apple as a company and how this next generation of Phone's are going to change everything..again..as did the first iPhone ten years ago. We both know Apple has some crazy new tech up their sleeves just from what we’ve seen from their patents alone. I am writing to you because I have found nobody that even remotely mentions this possibility for the next iPhone and I wanted to get your expert opinion. P.S. I also attached a link here to a video I created where I talk about this all more in detail if you are interested in hearing more! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5dF86Uf8k Thanks so much for listening. ~ Luigi Rausch Reply · Like · Mark as Spam D4xM4Nx - 23 hours ago Rumors are meant to create drama and hype, there are no real proof or leaks. Apple knows well how much is at a stake so they will give the new iPhone its very best. I'm excited and expectant.

Feb 23, 2017 Opinion North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Marketing Content The dramatic tensions that characterize a good movie plot are being adopted by the world of marketing, sports and even news and politics. That’s the argument of Alby Anand Kurian, a marketing communications practitioner and theorist whose clients have included Procter & Gamble, Pepsi Foods, Nestle and Unilever. In this opinion piece, Kurian describes the idea behind Conflict as a Marketing Tool (CAMT). He says the basic movie plot treatment of “setup, conflict and resolution” used to grab audience attention is being employed in many scenarios outside of Hollywood. Kurian also teaches in the MBA programs at the University of Bradford in the U.K. and the Grenoble Business School at the Management Development Institute of Singapore. His first book, The Peddler of Soaps, made the India Today bestseller list.   Conflict as a Marketing Tool (CAMT) has its roots not in marketing but in screenplay writing. You will find frameworks for screenplay writing in textbooks on the subject — Syd Field’s Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting is generally acknowledged as an authoritative source. Field details how nearly all screenplays can be broadly divided into three sections: setup, conflict and resolution. “Setup” consists of the introduction of the characters, the stage, the setting, the situation and the various relationships – that is, the background to the entire story. “Conflict” is the backbone of all screenplays; without it, the story becomes a yawn. Whether it’s Romeo and Juliet, The Godfather, a soap opera or even religious texts such as the Bible and the Ramayana, without conflict, the narrative would not come alive. Finally, of course, there’s “resolution” – does it end in tragedy or does all end well? This three-part structure applies to Romeo and Juliet and Hollywood blockbusters, and we are now going to apply it, in the first instance, to sports as well. The Screenplay of Sports In the evolution of an economy, once conditions for survival are in place, you will find that a fair share of the country’s economy is devoted to entertainment — television, cinema and so on. As society further evolves, you tend to find that a fair share of the money is then taken up by sports. Now, sports are truly wonderful – remember the quote about the Battle of Waterloo being won on the playing fields of Eton? It teaches one fair play; it makes one physically fit, mentally alert and all those marvelous things. All of us learn to admire the natural-born skills of a sportsman, and we admire the technique that he has perfected. “This three-part structure [of setup, conflict, resolution] applies to Romeo and Juliet and Hollywood blockbusters, and … sports as well.” But when we look at sports as an industry and we see its evolution today, we see a different dimension to it. It still is about admiring a sportsman’s skill, technique and temperament, but today it must be seen as entertainment. There is a natural resistance in us to think of it as such — sports seem of a higher order than mere “entertainment.” It seems as though we are bringing it down a notch or two — as though it makes it lesser than what we thought it was. Now, whether this makes it less or not is a different matter — what we are establishing here is what sports is today. Sports is entertainment and should be seen as part of the entertainment industry. So how do the rules of entertainment, that have evolved over the years, apply to sports? Let’s take the example of Wimbledon. In the setup phase, there is the game of tennis. It’s a game that has been played for a very long time; it has a long history and tradition to it – it’s probably the most gentlemanly of games – and nowhere as raucous as football. And, of course, Wimbledon is also about the royal box and eating strawberries and cream as much as it is about the sport. Sponsored Content: But entertainment needs conflict. Enter tennis stars Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg. Sport in the classical sense should mean that as long as they play great tennis, who plays and who wins is irrelevant. But that is certainly not the case, is it? Enter Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, and one finds that the audience has already taken sides. So, in a cricket match between India and Pakistan (two countries that have gone to war with each other), it is obvious that interest will run high, even if the battle is now on a playing field and not in a combat zone. The Indian Premier League was a bit of a question mark, really. Where would the conflict happen, who would be “Us,” who would be “Them?”  But the conflict between the different clubs was created and began to take shape, albeit in a friendly way. All credit to the organizers for that – they got the conflict going in just the right way. Conflict in Business: Apple vs. IBM No less a person than Apple co-founder Steve Jobs used conflict skillfully to his advantage. As Walter Isaacson was to record in his authorized biography of Jobs, throughout his life and career Steve Jobs represented himself as a warrior against the forces of evil — who, of course, were his rivals in the marketplace. “Throughout his life and career, Steve Jobs represented himself as a warrior against the forces of evil — his rivals in the marketplace.” When IBM launched its own personal computer in 1981, Apple placed a newspaper ad that said, “Welcome, IBM. Seriously.” Jobs skillfully positioned Apple against IBM when there were many other companies in the fray. He went so far as to say, “If for some reason we make some giant mistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter sort of a computer Dark Ages for about 20 years.” It was the same with Microsoft and Bill Gates. The sharp differences in style between the two would exacerbate an acrimonious divide in the digital industry that Jobs played up, again to his advantage. He did the same with Dell, even going so far as to use a giant picture of Michael Dell with a target on his face to motivate his employees. The Screenplay of the Newsroom Let us now apply the concept of conflict to a new area — the world of news. One can look at news gathering and dissemination in an idealistic manner — it can then be seen almost as an academic exercise, and perhaps it was so in the early days. It was about gathering information, disseminating that information and, of course, analyzing and dissecting current events in a rational manner. We are not disparaging the industry in any manner. We are only affirming that the pressure of competing news channels, newspapers and other forms of news media will force the news to become … entertainment. No value judgment is being made either way — we are only putting news into the context that it exists in the present day. We must accept that even the audience is changing. The viewer has had a rough day – the long commute to work, the attendant tensions, his boss, the clients – all have contributed to his reaching home, dead tired. Even though he might be the last to admit it, when he reaches for the remote and switches on television to watch the news, he is doing so to be entertained. And thus, the rules of screenplay writing creep into the newsroom. Again, we see the need for setup, conflict and resolution. The biggest news story of our time is, obviously, anything about Donald Trump; here, of course, you have all the ingredients of a great screenplay. Donald Trump pits himself as the lone wolf with the entire Washington establishment ranged against him; the lone wolf is one who shoots his mouth off at every opportunity. It is a near-perfect formula for a wonderful conflict – wonderful in the sense of the drama that it can create. Television news ratings, and its spike ever since Trump joined the campaign, all too clearly reflect that. The moment the audience is polarized, this simply becomes the best fodder for the news media ever. The names of the characters could change, and the narrative could change as well. But viewership is always highest when there is a ready-made conflict available. The setup-conflict-resolution formula makes for higher TRPs (or target rating points, an audience metric in advertising) — for news, just as in sports, just as in entertainment. Politics is Entertainment It was inevitable, then, that CAMT would find its way into politics. Traditionally, politics followed its own rather amateur systems of marketing, but those days are, of course, well past. One of the early records of professional marketing and advertising experts at work is described in The Selling of the President, in which author Joe McGinniss documents how Richard Nixon was packaged and sold to the American voter. Since then, marketing in the realm of politics has evolved into both a fine art and a science. It seems to have come to full fruition with President Barack Obama’s campaigns (in 2008, as well as 2012). By then, of course, the Internet had become a major force and Obama’s campaign showed a very incisive grasp of how it could be used to its benefit. In other parts of the world, Prime Minister Modi of India demonstrated a quick and ready understanding of it in 2014 and used it extremely successfully, as well. When marketing had become so sharply professional in politics, it was perhaps inevitable that CAMT would be used in politics, along with all the other tools available. “Trump brings to bear his experience as a television reality star into politics; conflict works very well on television.” Conflict in politics can essentially be used in two ways – internally and externally. Within the country, conflict can be used to pit one set of people or one set of communities against another; it can be used to polarize communities, polarize votes and to win elections. An external conflict could be used, as well. Politicians could set up their country, along with a set of countries that ally with it, against another country and its set of allies. This has been done with great success by Trump. In the Trump campaign, we can see all the dots that we have been pointing to, being joined together with almost textbook perfection. Trump brings to bear his experience as a television reality star into politics; conflict works very well on television, and Trump is a past master of the medium. So, when he came into politics he used CAMT very effectively in two ways. He used conflict initially as a way to arrest and capture, and hold our interest on the television screen, and his entry into politics was, as a consequence, a triumphant television season, with interest levels and viewership level spiking in a very dramatic manner. Every aggressive, combative, conflict-ridden comment that he makes sets up a furor, and the media, therefore (very ironically), owes its high viewership and readership to Trump’s use of CAMT. The great success of Trump’s media campaign then led to his success in the election — he used CAMT as a political weapon to unite all his supporters and his voters against his Republican rivals, at first, and then his final Democratic one. (The Trump victory is a complex one and it has multiple causes; it is only being affirmed here that the use of CAMT is one of them.) In this commentary, do notice that we have scrupulously avoided making any value judgments on the use of CAMT. There may be differing views that we all have on Trump and on the way he has used CAMT to win the election. We only seek to point out that, given his background in television, particularly reality television, he perhaps instinctively was able to understand that conflict would gain him viewership — and that once viewership was secured, conflict could also win him the election. Since it has proved to be so spectacularly successful, it is now inevitable that CAMT will become a more commonly used tool in politics — CAMT is here to stay. Governments, the media, and the general public would do well to be aware of that. We are certain to see a great deal more of it in the near future.

Photo: Dan Taylor/Heisenberg Media ©Dan Taylor David De Min has created an app which allows the user to edit videos during the process of filming, saving hours of time Share Comment Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. Usurv Velapp A video editing app endorsed by the co-founder of Apple will “make a difference to people’s lives”, according to its Kent-based founder. Velapp aims to save hours of time by allowing users to edit videos during the process of filming. Currently available on Apple iPhones, before the official launch in the coming weeks will see it showcased across a number of platforms, it uses the phone’s 3D touch technology to help select ‘highlights’. Users simply press harder on the screen when the best bits occur to easily cut sometimes lengthy videos down to precise points, then can share instantly via social media. A classic example, founder David De Min says, is a toddler taking its first steps - parents tend to film for long periods in anticipation of it happening, but with Velapp, you can capture the magical moment without wasting minutes, if not hours, finding it and cutting it in subsequent editing. The CEO, who attended Canterbury’s Kent College as a teenager and still lives in the city now, told KoS how it all started on a trip to the Himalayas with his brother, Michael. “We got two motorbikes and I was doing filming for a music video,” Mr De Min said. “Using Go Pros we filmed some of the most amazing memories – fly fishing, trading trout for jumpers and so on. “The roads are treacherous so we had some pretty close calls, it made for great filming. “After two-and-a-half weeks we came back with 235 hours of footage. “I consider myself a pro but it still took three weeks to cut it down, it was an absolute nightmare. “I thought ‘there must be a way to improve this’? I was pulling my hair out. “You realise what the best bits are when you’re filming at that time, in the moment, not afterwards, so I applied that idea to the technology, it’s as simple as that.” Like many entrepreneurs, Mr De Min is a natural hustler, who has the confidence and determination to get what he wants. When invited to an event where Steve Wozniak - the late Steve Jobs’ partner in crime - was the headline speaker, he was relentless in his quest to personally pick him up and show him how Velapp works. He went to Rolls Royce in Berkeley Square in London and demanded one of their finest models, telling them it was a great opportunity for the car manufacturer to get some exposure - an offer which they eventually accepted. “People kept asking who I was and I told them ‘I’m no one, I’m a random guy who started a little company in Kent’,” he said. “Eventually we got into this interview room and I spoke to Steve for half an hour, while there were a queue of journalists just waiting to have a few seconds with him. “I demoed the app and he was so impressed. “He gave me his business card and we’ve stayed in touch ever since – it’s by far the coolest card I’ve ever seen.” These are unquestionably exciting times for Mr De Min but he has had to overcome a number of significant obstacles on the road to where he is today. Born in Holland in 1990 to a Dutch father and an English mother, he moved to Oman as a small child before arriving in Kent in 1999. Diagnosed with dyslexia on arrival, he attended East Court, a special school in Ramsgate, to help him build his basic academic skills. Eventually studying IT, business studies and design and technology at Kent College, his creativity shone through - achieving 120 marks out of 120 for an A Level design project during his time on the course. “I think I look at things in a different perspective,” he said. “I really struggle with words and I’m not good at writing but have always been quite creative. “You can’t let a failure or a setback stop you, so many people have doubts about themselves. “You need to have that passionate belief and I think having such a drive is helping me push forward and make a difference to people’s lives, even just by saving them time – that’s what keeps me going.” The biggest hurdle for him to overcome, however, was the tragic death of older brother Jamie, who lost his battle with cancer aged just 17, despite a bone marrow transplant from Mr De Min. “It’s a difficult subject but I try to look at it from a positive because he always said he wanted us to be happy, he was such an inspiration. “It’s certainly brought the family together, my other brother Michael is one of my best friends and now we’ve both got a very different outlook on life. “Now when I see siblings fighting or not talking to each other I think it’s so sad and such a waste because I know what I’ve lost. “I just think ‘why are you arguing? You should be so close’. “It makes you think life is so short and you’ve got to make the most of it, and that’s the attitude I take into my work as well.” Now back at his parents’ home in Canterbury “to keep costs down”, Mr De Min is readying himself for take-off, with a clear aim of seeing Velapp become part of our everyday lives. “The absolute dream would be to have the technology integrated as standard when people open the camera on their phones,” he said. “We are some time away from that but in this industry things move pretty quickly, so who knows?” Mr De Min is also launching a competition, with a prize of £200 in cash, a Velapp t-shirt and the option of mentoring and support from a renowned business advisor in the UK. To enter, simply download Velapp, use it and upload your best Velapp video to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter with the hash tags #Velapp and #Kent – and don’t forget to like the Velapp Facebook page.

According to earlier claims, the tenth anniversary iPhone will be unveiled in September and come only as a limited release during the first month. However, it looks like Apple is going full throttle with the manufacturing process of the next iPhone. According to Digitimes, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is now at the next phase of production for the Apple A11 chip. Starting April, TSMC will start mass producing the said ARM processors that will later power the iPhone 8. The report also mentioned that Apple’s main chip supplier is targeting a full production run of 50 million units by the end of July. Furthermore, it also set a target of 100 million A11 chips by the end of 2017. iPhone 8 concept (via iphone8update.com) The A11 chip, is Apple’s next generation ARM processor for the iPhone 8. It will be manufactured under the same processing node other 10nm FinFET processors such as the Mediatek Helio and HiSilicon Kirin. Unfortunately, not a lot of details are known about the next A11 chip from Apple. So far, the current A10 Fusion chip is built with a total of four cores per die. As for the A11, Apple has been mum even on the core count of the said processor. However, there is a big chance that it will be an eight-core system due to the fact that its counterparts are now using the said number of cores. Even though the chip is now being produced, experts still believe that the iPhone 8 will be released in September on limited availability. This is mainly because a lot of new technology has been put in the new phone. Apart from the new processor, it will also include an OLED display and a plethora of new features. These features, according to analysts, are what will drive the iPhone 8’s price to more than $1,000. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

By: Gizbot Bureau Updated: Friday, March 3, 2017, 10:37 [IST] Apple may soon set-up manufacturing plant in the US, in an attempt to create more domestic jobs, this move is in light with the pressure from the Trump administration. The company is believed to expand its $50 billion US manufacturing and supplier base as stated in a media report. "We love this country. We will continue to look for ways to expand and help in any way that we can," Cook was quoted as saying at the company's annual meeting in Cupertino. Apple CEO, Tim Cook went on to further state that though the final assembly of the iPhones is done in China, the semiconductors, glass screens and adhesives for the device are made in the US. He also pointed out that though only one-thirds of the company revenues comes from the US, it still maintains two-thirds of its employees in the US. SEE ALSO: Apple's next generation iPhones will likely feature USB Type-C port The company is still looking at options to expand its operations in the US and feels that Apple could only exist in the US. Though all of this may be due to the pressure from the Trump administration it will be interesting to see how things pan out. Apple had recently shown interest and even confirmed to start manufacturing its iPhones in Bangalore, India. Though it is rather early to know for sure what Apple has planned we could very well see Apple operating from both India and the US owing to the relationship between the two nations. None-the-less we will keep you posted on the latest updates as and when we get them.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile TSMC Gearing up to Mass Produce A11 Chipset Starting From April By Omar Sohail Mar 27, 2017 22Shares Share Tweet Submit As most of you know, TSMC is the sole producer of 10nm FinFET chips which Apple is going to use for its A11 chipset that is expected to power the upcoming and highly anticipated iPhone 8. Since previous reports have suggested that Apple has only tapped TSMC, the semiconductor manufacturing company will have a mountain to climb. According to the latest report, to meet the deadline, it will start the production of chips starting from April. A11 Expected to Be Packaged With a ‘Wafer-Level Integrated Fan-Out Technology’ – Resulting in More Performance and Higher Efficiency We are still several months away from the arrival of the iPhone 8, but to keep up with Apple’s demand, TSMC is expected to ramp up production starting from the month of April. The California-based giant’s A11 SoC could share similar attributes to A10 Fusion. It is also possible that Apple chooses to name the chipset A11 Fusion instead of A11, but looks like we will find this out during the official keynote that is going to take place during the month of September. Related TSMC Will Decide To Build U.S. Fab Next Year, According To Spokesman; Plant Estimated At $16 Billion Till the production of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple used a dual-core processor and while that was sufficient to overwhelm the competition, it was time to kick it up a notch. With the arrival of the A10 Fusion, Apple now used a quad-core configuration, with two performance cores that would tackle intensive tasks such as gaming and two low-power cores, which behave in the same manner as Cortex-A53. Advertisement Related TSMC’s 7nm Risk Production Will Start In April; 7nm+ Will Use EUV, With 1.2x Logic Density & 10% Performance Boost Over 7nm Unfortunately, the A10 Fusion was made on the 16nm FinFET architecture, so with the arrival of the 10nm FinFET process for the A11, it will result in greater performance and higher efficiency rating. According to Economic Daily News (via DigiTimes), TSMC will prepare a capacity of 50 million units of the chip before the month of July. In total, the manufacturer is expected to roll out around a 100 million A11 chips before the end of 2017, spiking its revenues for this year. As stated before, these chips are going to be used in the upcoming iPhone 8, and apart from the radical design makeover, you guys will also be able to experience ground-breaking performance from a smartphone.

Some of them utilize free download of the apps with in-app purchases. Even before, Apple discouraged developers from using this tactic. That is, referencing the app’s price in the title in the App Store. Unfortunately, it didn’t stop every developer from doing it. However, Apple is now forcing software makers to change it. In a report published on VentureBeat, App Store now prohibits the publishing of an app with the word “free” in the title. It also bars software maker to include other price references. As a developer, if you mention the word “free” in your app’s title for review, you’ll receive this message: “Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect.” However, this error message will only appear on new apps and updates on existing apps. Thus, you’ll still see many apps with “free” in the title. It’s annoying to see the word “free” in the title of the app. Some developers even write it in all caps. It’s a way for them to market their apps and publicize it. A lot of users are enticed to download apps after knowing that it won’t cost them anything. What’s more is that they can download it right away. With the word “free” in the app’s title, the apps will stand out from the crowd. Barring price references on new titles is also a way for Apple to respond to the pressure from the lawmakers in Europe. Several years ago, these lawmakers stated that the “free” in the app’s title is misleading to users and enticing them to download apps that were packed with a lot of in-app purchases. Furthermore, they believed that including the word “free” in the title would fool children in particular. Apart from the title, developers are also forbidden to use the word “free” on the app’s icons, previews, and screenshots. If developers wish to advertise any discounts, they must do so in the app’s description. Meanwhile, App Store is leading in revenue compared to Google Play. However, Android may overtake iOS in app revenue this year. According to App Annie: “The iOS App Store is projected to remain the leading app store for the next five years — it’s slated to generate more than $60 billion in gross consumer spend in 2021. However, when factoring in Google Play and third-party Android stores combined, consumer spend should overtake iOS for the first time ever in 2017, thanks to their dominant smart device market share and strong installed base growth.” Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Jane Danes Jane has a lifelong passion for writing.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still a Value Play The numbers and Joel Greenblatt suggest it is  By Will Ashworth, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 30, 2017, 2:40 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   Popular Posts: The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement The 7 Best Low-Risk Healthcare Stocks to Buy Jefferies Thinks Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is a Buy — Should You? Recent Posts: Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Value Play The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement Jefferies Thinks Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is a Buy — Should You? View All Posts Gotham Asset Management co-founder Joel Greenblatt certainly thinks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) provides good value for buyers of AAPL stock. Source: Shutterstock In a recent interview, Greenblatt talked about how expensive the markets are at the present moment: “When we think about the S&P 500, we go back over the last 26 years where we have good data and look at the entire market from a perspective of bottom’s up valuation. Right now the S&P 500 is in roughly the 17th percentile of expensive during those 26 years, meaning it’s been cheaper 83% of the time.” To beat the index Greenblatt buys the cheapest S&P 500 stocks and shorts the most expensive. And wouldn’t you know it, but AAPL stock is one of his largest holdings — 31st out of 925 positions in a $7.8 billion portfolio — at 337,952 shares as of December 31, 2016. For Greenblatt, it’s all about cash flow and the price you pay for it: “We’ve owned Apple for a long time … They generate lots of cash flow, and we don’t have to pay a big price for it. That’s what’s attracted recent investors like Warren Buffett, where he’s looking at both that mix between growth and value … We figure out what a business is worth and try to pay a lot less.” Is AAPL Stock a Value Stock? He believes the markets are still valuing AAPL stock as a hardware company when in fact it’s very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer also feels Apple’s service business is underappreciated by investors, thoughts I shared with readers in early February when Apple was trading around $129; up almost 10% since then. InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau recently discussed how Apple stock hasn’t come close to peaking. I couldn’t agree more, which is why I asked the rhetorical question back in February of how AAPL stock got to $200. Apple’s service revenue accounted for about 9% of overall sales in Q1 2017, growing 18% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Annualize that and we’re talking about almost $29 billion. That’s huge when you consider Piper Jeffrey analyst Gene Munster estimated in 2016 that Apple’s gross margins on its service revenues were 60% and that operating margins could hit 50% in the coming year. If that’s accurate, Apple’s operating profits in fiscal 2017 could be as high as $15 billion or $2.86 per share for this small part of its business.

Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run? Here’s Why Lululemon Athletica Inc. Stock (LULU) Could Drop 20% View All Posts Donald Trump is apparently learning more and more every day that being President is much more difficult than just blurting out whatever comes to mind. Source: Sunnyc Sure, you can call for a boycott of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones before you’re elected, but after you’re in the White House, the government decides what kind of smartphone you’re going to use… even if it happens to be an iPhone. So while you might think you’ll be able to do anything you want when you become president, that’s not actually the case. He seems to be learning the hard way why it’s best to keep your mouth shut until you find out what you’ll actually be able to do so that people don’t call you out for doing the opposite of what you said you would do, like use an iPhone when you said no one should use an iPhone. White House Social Media Director Dan Scavino, Jr. revealed on Twitter that Trump is using an iPhone now. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone?for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting! — Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) March 29, 2017 Although Scavino clearly states that the President has been using an iPhone for the “past couple of weeks,” CNN Money notes that a “tweet bearing the hallmarks of Trump’s combative style was sent from an Android device as recently as Saturday.” Mobil Phones a Matter of National Security The issue of him using an unsecured phone prompted some Democrats to send an official letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis in February requesting details about the kinds of mobile devices the President is using. Apple Inc. Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPad As President of the United States, Donald Trump has access to some very sensitive information, so U.S. intelligence agencies must ensure that he has the most secure smartphone possible. He has been criticized for using an older, unsecured Android phone even after his inauguration, despite the report that he had ditched the phone. Now instead of using an Android phone to tweet, he’s supposedly been using the government-issued iPhone. It’s unclear whether it’s a custom model designed specifically for the President or just a standard model. Officials will not say whether any security measures are in place on Trump’s mobile devices. When Barack Obama was in office, he used various devices, including a specialized BlackBerry long after most people were using an iPhone, and later, a stripped-down phone with pure security in mind and few features. Trump Called for iPhone Boycott The tech community has always paid close attention to what kind of smartphone the world’s leaders are using, and in Trump’s case, the use of an iPhone has been met with a healthy heap of derision. While on the campaign trail, he called for a boycott of Apple’s devices until the company complied with the government’s demand to help unlock the iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. An Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Factory in America? Maybe Not. Interestingly, that very issue could be one reason the government has decided that the iPhone is secure enough for the President. Apple refused to unlock the phone used by a deceased man officials say is a terrorist, and government hackers were having a difficult time unlocking it, at least until they bought an exploit from a third party. Even before being elected, he didn’t seem to be locked into his call for a boycott because tweets were posted from both iPhones and Android phones. Some, however, have suggested that his aides were using Apple devices to post tweets while Trump himself used an Android phone. The post Donald Trump Now An iPhone User After Calling For Apple Inc.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Thursday, March 30, 2017, 15:31 [IST] Apple fans may soon face disappointment as the Cupertino-based tech giant may be planning to end its support for several versions of the iPhones. A new report from an Australian publication suggests that Apple is tipped to pull out support for iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the fourth-generation iPad. The report further says that this could eventually happen later this year. And if this does happen, then owners of the said devices will be forced to upgrade to a newer device. SEE ALSO: Android users will reportedly spend more money on apps than iOS users The publication further credits Eagle-eyed analysts for making the discovery. So, while going through the code of the recently-launched iOS 10.3 beta update for developers, the analysts found out that if users tried opening a 32-bit software in iOS 10.3 it would not work. @TheApplePost Strange thing I found in iOS 10.3.2 beta, lack of 32bit devices pic.twitter.com/e15ZKk8z8N— Zeph McLearan (@zmclearan) March 29, 2017 Similarly, the publication highlights IT specialist Zeph McLearan's tweet where he has posted a picture of Apple's code that shows how it does not make any mention of older 32-bit devices in the latest iOS update. And this could mean only one thing. The new update will basically support iPhones with 64-bit processors only. SEE ALSO: Apple now rejects app with price in their name Besides, with this move, Apple might be pushing its users to move on to the 64-bit devices. On the other hand, while some users may be upset, Apple had earlier stopped the support for the iPhone 4S, first iPad mini, and the fifth-generation iPod touch when it introduced iOS 10 earlier this year. So the new move could be in line with Apple's roadmap ahead. The company is expected to announce iOS 11 at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5 later this year.

By Victor Fiorillo  |  March 30, 2017 at 2:43 pm comment on this post The Rittenhouse Square Apple Store on Walnut Street. (Photo by Sophia Pizzi) Every day, hundreds of people visit the Rittenhouse Square Apple Store on Walnut Street to check out new products, pick up an emergency charger, or just check their email. And according to one former employee, black customers are handled differently than white customers. Philly resident Cori Fisher worked at the Philadelphia Apple Store from 2010 to 2016, first as an Apple Store “expert” and later as a “specialist,” as Apple classifies their employees. In a lawsuit just filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Fisher claims that he noticed some disturbing activity there. According to allegations contained in his lawsuit, the Apple Store racially profiled black customers. Fisher claims that he witnessed a store manager asking a cop to get some black teenagers out of the store, and he says that the Apple Store told its employees to “closely monitor” black customers in general. The lawsuit describes the store’s actions as “racist.” Fisher says that he complained of one incident in particular that occurred in December 2015 and was told that Apple Store management told him that they would investigate. He claims that in February 2016, he expressed his concern that the Apple Store was treating black customers differently than white customers. In the end, Fisher says he was fired in April 2016 in retaliation for speaking up about the alleged discrimination. This isn’t the first time that an Apple Store has been accused of racially profiling black customers. In 2011, a New York City store was accused of telling black customers wearing baggy jeans and hooded sweatshirts that they had to buy something or leave. In 2015, Apple apologized after a group of black teens at an Apple Store in Australia were confronted by store employees and told to leave because they “might steal something.” The same year, a white mother with a black child — who happened to be from a very wealthy family — alleged that a San Diego Apple Store had racially profiled them. And earlier this month, two black men filed a $12 million class-action lawsuit against Apple alleging racial profiling at a Bethesda, Maryland, Apple Store. But Fisher’s suit doesn’t end with racial profiling. Fisher is also alleging that the Rittenhouse Square Apple Store discriminated against him because of his religious beliefs. He claims that the Apple Store originally accommodated his scheduling requests that would make room for his religion’s requirements — Seventh-Day Adventists are taught that they cannot work from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday, and many attend church services on Sunday — but that this changed after took a leave of absence following a cancer diagnosis. When he got back to work, he says, the Apple Store would no longer make the appropriate accommodations. We called the Apple Store on Walnut Street to ask about Fisher’s allegations. A store manager referred us to the national Apple media relations department, which has not responded for a request for comment.

Telephone scammers have been cold-calling people across the US in a bid to obtain their login details and other personal information. The scammers seem to be piggybacking on a separate group of hackers who demanded ransom from Apple in exchange for some 300 million iCloud accounts. Scroll down for video  If you receive a phone call claiming to Apple regarding an iCloud breach, hang up. Telephone scammers have been cold-calling people across the US in a bid to obtain their login details and other personal information THE APPLE SCAM  When the potential victim answers the phone, an automated message is played claiming to be from Apple support.  The recording tells them there has been an iCloud breach or there is an issue with their own account, then they are put through to a human operator. The scammer will ask for the person's information, which includes details of their account. Kiro 7 has spoken with people in Seattle who have received a phone call and believes the scammers will use the information to make purchases – among other things.   Many of the victims have flocked to Twitter to warn others of the scam - some users are also sharing the number that was used by the data thieves. Glenn Fleishman, with Macworld, said his wife was called five times by the data thieves. 'Earlier on Monday, my wife let me know that 'Apple Support' had called about iCloud security,' Fleishman said. 'She was dubious, and rightly so. 'Apple' then called five more times (and counting). 'Suffice it to say, it wasn't Apple, but fraudsters trying to piggyback on reports that a major breach of iCloud credentials could render hundreds of millions of accounts vulnerable.' Another source found that the thieves are using the area code '206' when making calls in Seattle, Washington. When the potential victim answers the phone, an automated message is played claiming to be from Apple support, Business Insider reported.

Kiro 7 has spoken with people in Seattle who have received a phone call and believes the scammers will use the information to make purchases – among other things. When the potential victim answers the phone, an automated message is played claiming to be from Apple support. The recording tells them there has been an iCloud breach or there is an issue with their own account, then they are put through to a human operator MacWorld also noted that the scammers have attempted to get people to download 'antivirus software', which is actually malware, allowing them to attack computers. However, many iOS users will agree that Apple has never called them in the past regarding hacking issues or problems with their account – it is usually the user who makes the call. The tech firm has warned its customers that they should 'never provide personal account information—including your Apple ID password, credit card info, or other personal information—by email or text message, and use extreme caution when clicking links in messages or sharing information over the phone.  Many of the victims have flocked to Twitter to warn others of the scam. Some have noted that Apple would never call its customers about a breach or if there was an issue with their account Some people were called that are not even iOS users.  The scammers seem to be piggybacking on a separate group of hackers who demanded ransom from Apple in exchange for some 300 million iCloud accounts Instead, visit the company's website directly or call them yourself.' It was revealed last week that a group of hackers, who call themselves the 'Turkish Crime Family' (TCF) said they were holding 300 million iCloud accounts and iPhones hostage. The group also set out their terms to Apple and issued a final deadline to receive its $75,000 ransom. However, Apple said if the list is legitimate, it was not obtained through any hack of its servers. MacWorld also noted that the scammers have attempted to get people to download 'antivirus software', which is actually malware, allowing them to attack computers 'There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID,' the spokesperson said. 'The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.' However, the hackers upped the ante just a day after setting their demands – to $700,000. TCF claimed that a former member of the group incorrectly demanded a total of $75,000 for the heist from Apple. Each of the seven remaining members now want $100,000 - almost ten times the figure originally reported. Technology experts at ZDNet contacted a number of users whose passwords and account details were provided to them by TCF. They confirmed that the data was indeed correct, and that in one case the password had never been used on another site. But the report's authors concluded that TCF 's main aim was publicity. In an article on the site, they said: 'Based on our experience and our interactions with the group and its members, it's evident that the group is naïve and inexperienced. 'Based on its grandiose claims and its cherry-picking media outlets to cover its claims, it's clear that the group is gunning for publicity. 'When we began asking the group questions, the conversation quickly turned to whether or not if CBS News (which like ZDNet is also owned by CBS), would also cover the group's claims.' It is not exactly clear how the group acquired the sensitive data. But a statement by Apple confirmed one widely-held assumption - that the data may have been obtained from other sites whose data has been breached.    Read more: Ignore that call from ¿Apple¿ about an iCloud breach | Macworld New phone scam targeting Seattle iCloud users | KIRO-TV Phone scammers target victims with claims of iCloud breach - Business Insider Share or comment on this article e-mail 244 shares Most watched News videos 13 year old has no idea he's talking to the voice of Bart Simpson Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Gran starts heated debate with anti-Brexit campaigners Woman screams as burglars break into her home and rob her Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack Oddly satisfying deep cleaning of a very dirty car seat The last moments of expert storm chaser Kelley Williamson CCTV captures milkman killing tuk-tuk driver with a BRICK President Trump rearranges items on a table Newly released CCTV footage shows man being glassed in London bar Dramatic moment armed police make arrest in Birmingham Thirsssty much?: Rescued king cobra drinks water from a bottle Snake gets its comeuppance after attacking a porcupine...

At the end of April, Apple plans to eliminate certain retail positions, including Business Manager, Business Events Lead, Events Coordinator, and Events Lead. Apple Store Leaders began informing affected employees about the change earlier this week, and many were caught off guard by the sudden sunsetting of specialized positions that have long existed at retail stores. Our source says that the elimination of the Business Manager position is something of a shock because Business Managers lead the Business Team and are responsible for bringing in up to 20 percent of overall store sales. "These managers have established relationships with various small and medium businesses in their markets," said the source. "Their position is highly specialized and often times not easily understood by retail leadership who do not have experience in B2B sales." Existing managers, senior managers, store leaders, and market leaders are currently unfamiliar with the "complex sales cycles involved with B2B engagements," so Apple's retail change could have a significant impact on business sales. Employees who currently hold positions that are being eliminated have been told they can take a lower level (also lower paying in many cases) position or take two months of severance pay. "This comes as a rude awakening to employees who have always felt Apple has had their best interest," said the source. Managers and affected employees have been notified about the imminent change, with a broader announcement planned for an all-hands meeting that will take place on Sunday, April 23. Apple may share more information on the reasoning behind the elimination of the positions and its future retail plans at that time. On its "Jobs at Apple" page, Apple has already removed "Business Manager," as an option, a change that was made recently. The sunsetting of these specialized retail positions comes following some major retail changes that were introduced in mid-2016. Three new retail positions were added, including Pro, Creative Pro, and Technical Expert, and several other positions were renamed.

I worked at Apple Retail for 2 years, including on the business team, and every business manager I met was deluding themselves. People shopping at Apple Retail stores for their business ARE NOT B2B customers, and every business manager I saw get promoted to corporate crashed and burned in no time at all. There's A LITTLE extra expertise about taxes and such, but they were all vastly overpaid for what they actually did. They weren't doing cold calls, the business just walked in. You could train a specialist to do the majority of their work in an afternoon. Rating: 26 Votes zhang96 13 hours ago at 11:06 am Nothing new here. Profits come first. People second.

This easily could have been a joint or collaborative effort amongst other Apple executives to consolidate the positions. Although, the eliminating of positions does make me wonder and now with the Genius training in Cupertino being reportedly axed, it provokes thought of Apple's latest moves and the backlash behind the motives. If Apple gets rid of after sales support and repair from their stores, what makes them diffeeent from any other store? When I was a kid, Savitt Jewelers always talked about POMG, peace of mind guarantee. Apple's no hassle service and support is a big reason why I buy Apple products. If Apple gets rid of their POMG, they get rid of me too.

gizmodo Deadspin Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide You Won't Believe What Jared Kushner Does to His MacBook Adam Clark EstesYesterday 2:15pm Filed to: spoiled brats jared kushner macbook windows new york observer politics business 311 8 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: Getty You’re probably not surprised to learn that Jared Kushner enjoys Apple design. The Cupertino company does make some fine-looking hardware! But would you guess that the Trump suck-up actually buys expensive MacBooks just so he can install Windows on them? Advertisement It’s true. At least, it was a few years ago when Gawker’s founding editor, Elizabeth Spiers, inherited Kushner’s laptop at The New York Observer, when she took a job as the paper’s editor-in-chief. Spiers explains the experience bluntly in a Washington Post column published Thursday: The computer was a recent-model Mac, but when I turned it on, it was inexplicably running Windows. I summoned our beleaguered IT guy to explain, and he informed me that it had belonged to Kushner, who liked the design of Apple products but preferred the Windows OS. “So he was basically using a $2,500 desktop as a monitor?” I said. The IT guy shrugged. Actually, it’s a metaphor for the paralyzing combination of vanity and ineptitude that defines Kushner as a human being. (Spiers does a really great job of making this point in about 2,000 words, all of which you should read.) While the $2,500 monitor analogy doesn’t make perfect sense, the idea that a rich kid from Manhattan inherited his family’s real estate empire and then bought a newspaper for the fun of it, only splurge on unnecessary gadgets and fire staffers in order to make the business appear more successful than it actually is, well, it’s all horrifying. Advertisement Jared Kushner is now a senior advisor to Donald Trump, his father-in-law, and recently took on the perplexing task of making the government run more like a business. Kushner, as Spiers points out, has never been a successful businessman outside of his family’s real estate dynasty. One could even argue that he hasn’t even been successful at that, if the botched development of 666 Fifth Avenue is indicative of his capabilities. A few days after Trump’s election, Kushner also threw in the towel at The Observer, shuttering the print edition and putting the digital edition up for sale. But back to running Windows on a MacBook. This is something plenty of people do for a variety of reasons. Those reasons are often utilitarian in practice. For instance, developers might want to see how their code runs on both operating systems without changing machines. Business types might prefer macOS but need to run a piece of software that’s only available on Windows. To pay the steep price for a MacBook only because you like how it looks is just ridiculous, though. You can buy a Windows laptop for a fraction of the price, one that might even outperform a MacBook Pro. Obviously, Jared does what Jared wants to do. The 36-year-old likes to compare himself to a young John F. Kennedy, which almost makes sense if you simply focus on the nepotism that enabled him to rise to a position of power. In truth, Kushner has a lot more in common with his fried yam of a father-in-law. Both men are vain. Both men are incompetent. Both men love Ivanka Trump. Both men are trying to ruin this country. The similarities are uncanny, really.

Apple joined other companies including Google and Microsoft in signing a statement backing renewable energy efforts. Sony A6500 “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. The joint statement follows an order signed by President Trump that reverses Environmental Protection Agency climate rules put in place by the Obama administration that Apple and other companies backed. Apple’s commitment to renewable energy efforts made when signing the 2015 pledge may line up with other tech companies, but Bloomberg notes that other companies welcome the change: Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. Last fall shortly before the U.S. election, Apple reaffirmed its commitment to its goal of 100% renewable energy through new initiatives shared at Climate Week. Greenpeace, which monitors renewable energy efforts, awarded Apple the most environmentally friendly tech company for three years running in January. Apple has also said its new headquarters, Apple Park, will be “one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy” when it opens next month.

But are sales from Apple’s App Store about to be surpassed by those from apps designed for Android-based devices? That’s the estimate coming from App Annie, a website and research firm dedicated to tracking the app business. App Annie’s latest report on app revenue, released on Thursday, says Android app sales will claim the top spot from iOS this year… with a catch. App Annie said revenue from app downloads should reach $82.2 billion this year, up from $61.8 billion in 2016. Of that total, iOS sales are forecast to climb to $40 billion from last year’s total of $34 billion. Where Android overtakes iOS is when sales from Google Play app downloads (forecast to reach $21 billion) are combined with those from third-party Android stores (estimated at $20 billion this year), for a grand Android total of $41 billion. The third-party Android stores include marketplaces run by the likes of Baidu, Tencent and Huawei. While Android may, in total, surpass Apple’s iOS store download sales, App Annie noted that, as far as a single app store is concerned, Apple’s should remain the top generator of app revenue until at least 2021. By that year, App Annie estimates revenue for the iOS App Store will reach $60 billion, and total worldwide app sales from downloads will climb to $139.1 billion, with downloads of almost 353 billion apps that year.

The realities of the smartphone market mean that Intel's cellular modem technology -- at least in its current form -- will find limited success outside of Apple. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 30, 2017 at 12:30PM In a recent note from Susquehanna Financial Group (via Barron's), analyst Christopher Rolland said that he and his team were "optimistic" that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) might be able to find business outside of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its stand-alone cellular modems but noted that "Chinese handset vendors did not share [Susquehanna's] enthusiasm." Here's my take on why Intel just won't get any traction with its modems outside of Apple, no matter how good they are. Image source: Intel. Understanding the market A smartphone maker can opt to equip a smartphone with a stand-alone applications processor paired with a stand-alone cellular baseband processor, or it can choose to use a single chip that integrates the applications processor with the cellular baseband processor. In the early innings of the smartphone market, it wasn't uncommon to see both -- some smartphone makers would go with stand-alone baseband and applications processors, while others would pick the more integrated solutions. Today, for cost and space reasons, integrated solutions dominate the market. It's virtually impossible today to market stand-alone smartphone applications processors, and there's only one high volume smartphone customer that uses stand-alone cellular baseband chips -- Apple. Intel doesn't sell integrated solutions In the past, Intel had indicated that it aimed to both sell integrated applications processor/baseband solutions alongside stand-alone modems. However, the company has slashed its investments in mobile technology over the last couple of years (Intel says its investment in this area is down 55% over the last two years) and hasn't said much publicly about trying again to build such integrated parts organically. The chipmaker is attacking this market in a roundabout fashion by offering manufacturing services to companies like Spreadtrum, but it remains to be seen whether Intel can gain significant traction in the mass-market smartphone market (outside of Apple) this way. Intel could conceivably try to field organically developed integrated solutions into this market at some point, but given that Intel already tried, failed spectacularly, and pulled the plug on its efforts here, it's hard to imagine that smartphone vendors would be in a hurry to bet their businesses on Intel's product road map and execution. But the bottom line is that there's simply just not a market outside of Apple for stand-alone cellular modems, even if those modems are highly competent. The next step for Intel In the near to medium term, Intel's job will be to focus on trying to continue to build competent stand-alone modems to keep Apple happy. Apple buys enough chips, and Intel probably gets enough for each chip, that Intel could probably continue to justify modem development just with Apple's business. At some point, though, Intel is going to want to expand the total addressable market that it can address with its modem technology. Maybe another crack at the integrated smartphone applications processor market would be the right course of action, or perhaps it could partner with a third-party chipmaker to incorporate its modem technology into their own applications processors (a suggestion that's been thrown around about Apple, although I doubt that it would be interested in doing that). The point is that if Intel can consistently deliver great cellular modem technology, and if that technology has been "battle tested" inside of multiple generations of Apple iPhone models, then it would be a shame for the chipmaker to not find a way to get it into other smartphones and profit from it.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Mar 30, 2017 at 11:31AM You might have noticed that smartwatches are popping up all around you more than ever before. That's because smartwatch sales spiked to 21.1 million last year, up from just under 5 million in 2014.  Smartwatch shipments are expected to continue growing quickly and reach an estimated 111 units worldwide by 2020, according to IDC. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) are the top players in the space right now, and investors looking for smartwatch stocks would be wise to give each a hard look.  Image source: Apple. The leader Apple is the dominant smartwatch maker right now and holds more than 63% of the smartwatch market. The company's share is down a few percentage points from a couple of years ago because of increased competition, but Apple is still the undisputed smartwatch leader. The company doesn't report its smartwatch shipments or how much revenue it makes from them, but CEO Tim Cook said on the company's fiscal Q1 2017 earnings call that the Apple Watch had record unit sales and revenue for the quarter and noted that Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world.  Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 5.2 million watches in the calendar fourth quarter, which would be a modest increase of 2% year over year, according to the research firm's estimates. It's worth nothing here that Apple Watch shipment estimates vary. IDC, for example, says Apple shipped 4.6 million watches in the quarter, up from 4.1 million a year ago. But both research firms list Apple as the top smartwatch vendor. Apple's position in the smartwatch market is unparalleled at the moment, and while competitors are eating up more market share than before, it's unlikely any of them will be able to match Apple's dominance anytime soon. The challenger Much as in the smartphone market, Apple and Samsung are pitted against each other in the smartwatch space as well. Samsung is the second highest-selling smartwatch vendor, with 16% of shipments in Q4 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung entered the smartwatch space more than a year before Apple and is currently on its third-generation flagship device, the Gear S3. The company shipped about 800,000 smartwatches in the fourth quarter, representing a 38% decline from Q4 2015. That dip probably came because Samsung launched the Gear S3 late into 2016 (mid-November in the U.S.), and two months after Apple had already rolled out its Apple Watch Series 2.  But even though the company has fallen behind Apple's smartwatch shipments, Samsung still easily outpaces its other rivals. "Combined together, Apple and Samsung today account for an impressive three in four of all smartwatches shipped globally, and they are a long way ahead of trailing rivals such as Garmin, Fitbit, and Huawei," Strategy Analytics' Steven Waltzer said back in January.  The rising star Garmin's smartwatch shipments hit an all-time high in the third quarter of 2016 -- surpassing 600,000 units -- and even outpaced Samsung's shipments in the quarter. Garmin's third-quarter numbers showed an impressive 324% year-over-year  increase that showed that established Garmin as a rising star in the smartwatch space.  The company didn't have the same breakout quarter in Q4 2016, but there are several reasons smartwatch investors should keep an eye on the company. Part of Garmin's rising position comes from the diversity of its smartwatch lineup, which includes models for running, hiking, swimming, and golfing. This diversity allows the company to cater devices specifically to a user's needs, compared with Samsung and Apple's one-size-fits-all approach.  Garmin has also smartly opened up its watches to developers, allowing them to create new watch faces and other features through its Connect IQ app store. The store has 2,500 apps, widgets, and watch faces right now and has seen 24 million downloads since it launched. Garmin says its app store is an "important differentiator for our smart wearables" versus other players.  This is just the beginning While smartwatch sales numbers may seem to be off to a slow start, investors should remember that this segment is still relatively new, and tech companies are still trying to figure out which features users want the most and what price points to sell the devices at. But it's clear from shipment forecasts in the coming years, and growing sales in 2016, that the smartwatch market is poised for much more growth.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Specs, Release Date, Price And Everything We Know Posted: Mar 30 2017, 8:51am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017 as early as the WWDC 2017 in June. There is no hard evidence that a new iMac is coming, but the anticipation grows.  Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac might adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. I would not mind to go back to the thick design of the iMac in order to get the most powerful CPUs and GPUs on the market. I don't see the thinness of the iMac when i sit in front of it. The problem is that Apple is obsessed with making things thin.  3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac ideally would have powerful graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Apple unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The red iPhone Plus and the new iPad went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. There are a lot of new products and updates coming from Apple in 2017. The Apple rumor mill is in full swing. Find out in this Apple rumors round-up what new products and features Apple rumored to release this year. Read the latest Apple News.

Sure, it lacks the gorgeous laminated, anti-reflective display of the iPad Air 2, and sure it’s not as svelte in either thickness or weight. But there’s no denying that the 2017 iPad with A9 dual core processor in tow, is a good value. With base model storage starting at a healthy 32 GB, the new iPad is priced so reasonably that it’s almost an impulse buy for anyone previously on the fence about iOS tablets. No longer do you have to pay an extra $100 to obtain a model that will actually work over the long haul from a storage perspective. No longer are you left with an anemic processor that feels somewhat feeble after an iOS update or two. Even with its obvious shortcomings, the 2017 iPad is worth considering as long as you know what you’re getting into. If you’re brand new to the world of iOS, or you’re coming from a pre-iPad Air device, then you may want to seriously consider the new iPad. Watch our hands-on video walkthrough as we explain. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? The most “glaring” downside The biggest downside for those considering the new iPad is its most glaring — literally. The 5th generation iPad (Apple doesn’t count the Air series as a part of the same line) lacks the laminated digitizer and the antireflective coating found on more expensive models. This amounts to more glare on the 2048-by-1536-pixel Retina display when in bright settings, which will cause you to have to boost the brightness. More notably, the lack of a laminated digitizer also results in a disconnected feeling from the content on-screen. There is a noticeable air gap between the glass panel, and the screen content below, just like there was on the original iPad Air and models that preceded it. The presence of an air gap only intensifies the glare in bright settings. For me, those are the two biggest flaws on an otherwise value-packed device. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Extra thickness and added weight The new iPad features a form factor that’s similar to the original iPad Air. That means that it’s not only thicker, but heavier than the iPad Air 2 and the 9.7″ iPad Pro. This is a definite downside, but I feel like most people who are in the market for a cheap iPad will be fine with the added girth. Slightly thicker than the iPad Air 2 The iPad is thicker and heavier, but not so much that it becomes a burden during every day use. And if you’re coming from a device prior to the iPad Air 2, you’ll be none the wiser. Slightly heavier, too A value-infused iPad Outside of the aforementioned downsides, the 2017 iPad shoehorns a lot of value into a small price. You get a 64-bit dual core (1.85 GHz) A9 processor that features faster single core performance than the A8X found in the iPad Air 2, and comes within striking distance of the Air 2’s multicore scores. Impressive performance from a $329 tablet The 2017 iPad features the same silicon that’s found in the iPhone 6s, hence it packs enough speed to run iOS 10 without any hiccups. It’s also a capable enough processor to where it can run the latest games, and edit and export 4K video without breaking much of a sweat. Editing 4K video on iPad Unlike the original iPad Air, the 2017 iPad comes with 2GB of RAM, which makes a massive difference in performance, especially when browsing the web with multiple tabs and switching between apps. Where the new iPad may lack somewhat in aesthetic appeal, it makes up for in performance. Only the iPad Pro is faster than the $329 iPad when it comes to single core performance. Battery life Despite packing a larger battery than both the iPad Air 2 and 9.7″ iPad Pro, Apple rates the 2017 iPad at 10 hours of battery life on Wi-Fi. Given the size differences between batteries, that seems a bit conservative. Perhaps Apple reasons that users will keep the brightness higher on this iPad when compared to newer models in an effort to combat the lack of advanced antiglare properties. Apple also claims that the screen itself is brighter, but there are some lingering questions about that claim. Since the screen is the biggest battery drainer, I could see how the extra battery might be used to help compensate for screen brightness. Cameras The FaceTime and iSight cameras feature the same configuration as the iPad Air 2. You get an 8MP iSight camera with ƒ/2.4 aperture on the rear, and a paltry 1.2MP FaceTime camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture on the front. The iSight Camera can shoot 1080p and 30 FPS, and the FaceTime camera is stuck at 720p. Shot on iPad Touch ID If you’re coming from anything prior to the iPad Air 2, then you’ll appreciate the fact that the 2017 iPad includes Touch ID. A must have feature for security and ease of use, Touch ID allows you to unlock your iPad, unlock features in supporting apps, wield Apple Pay, and make App Store purchases all with your fingerprint. Having Touch ID adds a considerable amount of value to an iPad, and those who adopt the $329 tablet will no doubt grow to appreciate it as a feature. Storage Finally, 16GB SKUs are a thing of the past. The entry-level iPad now comes with a manageable 32GB of storage space, which should prove to be enough for average use. Where 16GB was barely enough to be usable, 32GB lends users enough headroom to feel comfortable downloading apps and storing media on iOS. Of course, 128 GB would be even better, but it’s only $100 away instead of $200 away like in times past. Conclusion The 2017 iPad isn’t geared towards the early adopters and those looking for the absolute latest and greatest. Rather, it’s strategically priced to be appealing to first time iPad owners, and iPad owners steeped in the past who still use the pre-Air 2 hardware. For those people, the new iPad is a very compelling device that brings a lot of value to the table for not a lot of money. I could also see the iPad being a hit in the education sector, especially when factoring in education discounts. Coupled with the new Classroom 2.0 app, the 2017 iPad could prove to be difficult to pass up for school districts. Make no mistake, Apple did cut corners in order to make the iPad more competitive at the low-end of the market, but it cut corners in areas that allow the hardware to flourish as a functional device for years to come. Instead of gimping the hardware with an inadequate processor, or not enough memory, Apple scaled back in areas where those who aren’t as tech savvy may not notice. The air gap between the glass and display While the lack of a laminated digitizer and antiglare properties is enough to bother someone who is used to the iPad Air 2 and newer hardware, such things mean little to those who aren’t fully engrossed in the Apple hardware ecosystem. I think that the 2017 iPad is a very smart release. It stands the chance to capture a new audience who may have balked at a higher price, and serves as a tempting upgrade for iPad users on legacy hardware. And if you do happen to care about a better screen, or better cameras, you’re naturally pushed up market to the more expensive iPad Pro. If you’re willing to wait a few days, you can find the new 2017 iPad for pre-order on B&H. By going that route, you get a small discount, free shipping, and no tax in most cases. Units are scheduled to be available on April, 4. What are your thoughts on the new 2017 iPad? Would you consider buying one?

A handful of stores may have had limited stock already, but supplies now appear ample for Apple to accept reservations. Apple has yet to activate Personal Pickup in other countries where it operates Apple Retail Stores, including Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Macao, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, in-store stock may be available as early as today in some of those countries as well. Apple said the new 9.7-inch iPad would be available to purchase at select Apple Retail Stores, authorized resellers, and carrier stores by the end of this week in more than 20 countries. Call ahead to check. Availability of new 9.7-inch iPad in Los Angeles area Apple Stores today Apple began accepting online orders for the new 9.7-inch iPad on its website last week, with initial orders estimated for delivery between March 31 and April 5 in the United States. Orders placed today are estimated to ship between April 6 and April 14 depending on the shipping method selected. Apple accepts iPad returns within 14 calendar days of receiving an online order, so some customers that still have a far out delivery date may elect to try their luck in stores, but your mileage may vary. Online orders can also be canceled on Apple's website if they have yet to be processed for shipment. Apple unveiled the new 9.7-inch iPad last week as a low-cost successor to the iPad Air 2, which has been discontinued. The tablet features a faster A9 chip and brighter Retina display than the iPad Air 2, but it is somewhat thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 since it lacks a fully laminated display. The tablet essentially packs an iPhone 6s chip with other iPad Air 2 components into an original iPad Air design. Read our new 9.7-inch iPad vs. iPad Air 2 article for a side-by-side comparison of complete tech specs. The new 9.7-inch iPad starts at $329 for a 32GB model with Wi-Fi, making it the cheapest new tablet that Apple has ever sold. Apple also offers a 128GB model with Wi-Fi for $429, while cellular-capable 32GB and 128GB models are available for $459 and $559 respectively in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray.

It looks like great value, and it would be my first iPad since buying an iPad 2 many years ago, which still gets used fairly regularly in our household. However: The inability to have multiple users (and thus individual email accounts, safari password keychains, etc) is really holding me back. It makes the iPad hugely less useful in a family/household setting. I really hope Apple will finally sort this out in iOS 11.

Rating: 4 Votes Rob_2811 14 hours ago at 10:30 am This looked like a good deal until I remember Apples current approach to storage tiers on these devices. In post Brexit UK unless you can make do with 32 gb of storage you are looking at £429 or £559 if you want cellular model. So much for a cheap iPad. :eek: Before somebody says no Apple isn't responsible for Brexit but they are responsible for their staunch insistence on huge profit margins on everything and removing storage tiers to gouge a bit extra out of the customer for storage they don't really need. They just can't grasp the idea that the value proposition of a tablet just isn't there at the price points they want to play at can they ? This has clearly been aimed at the US education market but are they going to get many takers given what your average Chromebook can be had for? I would be surprised.

Rating: 3 Votes Relentless Power 15 hours ago at 09:24 am So after all the Samsung hype, here is what Apple gives us. Boooooring! You're comparing Samsungs new hardware to a budget iPad? The iPad 9.7 isn't even new hardware, its a revamp made for affordability. Perhaps a more appropriate comparison would be when Apple releases its new rumored iPad when it actually releases. That makes more sense. Rating: 2 Votes redscull 14 hours ago at 10:12 am No doubt! But even if I wanted to spent $329 each on several iPads, it doesn't fit the casual way we use them in our house. I don't want to waste time hunting around the house for "my" iPad. I want to pick up the one that's already sitting on the kitchen counter! But you wouldn't have to waste time hunting for it. Because it's yours. It would be where you left it. Unlike with your shared approach where you have to find it wherever the last user left it. I used to have the exact mindset you have and really really wanted multi-user so that I could share my iPad with my kids. Then I caved and bought them each refurbed minis, and honestly, Apple is right. It's a personal device. The overall household experience works so much better when each person just has their own. I could never even consider one tablet with multiple users. The idea makes me cringe now. I get our needs and budget may be different. But wait until these are in the refurb store for <$300. It really is the better way to "share." [doublepost=1490894347][/doublepost] I can't imagine people wanting to buy an iPad Air 2, just to have slower hardware and iOS updates end in late 2018. RAM would be the more likely requirement that ends iOS updates for these devices. The Air 2, 9.7 Pro, and this new iPad are all 2GB. I bet they all lose iOS update support at the same cycle.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | March 30, 2017 -- 15:53 GMT (08:53 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Image: iStock Google's Android operating system will lead Apple's iOS in terms of user spending on apps and subscriptions this year, according to a new report from mobile analytics firm App Annie. what's hot on zdnet ​Samsung's real challenge with Galaxy S8 launch: Apple's upcoming iPhone 'supercycle' Congress just obliterated Obama-era rules preventing ISPs from selling your browsing history Android flagships: Which is best for the enterprise? Could the iPad be the death of the Mac (and the PC)? The report, released Wednesday, predicts that Android users will spend $41 billion on mobile apps in 2017 while iOS users will spend $40 billion. However, App Annie's estimates include third party app stores in addition to Google Play, which tips the scales somewhat unevenly in Android's favor. When matched against Google Play alone, Apple's app store, with its comparatively affluent customer base, is expected to maintain its lead through 2021 with more than $60 billion in gross consumer spend, says the report. Last year, Apple's App Store racked up $34 billion in sales, while Android apps collected $27 billion. In big-picture terms, App Annie expects worldwide mobile app downloads to surpass 352 billion in 2021, with gross consumer spend across all app stores to surpass $139 billion. The top five countries by downloads -- China, India, US, Brazil, and Indonesia -- represented around 75 percent of the global revenue in 2016. App Annie expects the share to increase to 85 percent in 2021. The reports attributes the shift to increased spending on games and subscriptions from existing smartphone users in mature markets, primarily urban China, but also the US, Japan, and South Korea. China's smart phone adoption is reaching saturation, but App Annie says much of the region is still underpenetrated, which will support growing smartphone adoption and growth in app downloads over the forecast period. App Annie expects downloads in China will grow at an annualized rate of 19 percent through 2021, while consumer spend will increase 24 percent to $56.5 billion.

Yes, the teardown specialists over at iFixit have got their hands on the new iPad, and taken it to bits to see just how repairable the device is. And, as it turns out, it's not very repairable at all. In fact, the site gave the new iPad a repairability score of just 2/10 – the same score given to the previous iPad Air 2. Related: New iPad 2017 (9.7-inch) So, why was this latest iPad incarnation given such poor marks? Well, as the site explains in its detailed teardown, the whole thing is really hard to get apart. First of all, the front panel of the device is glued to the rest of the body, making it incredibly difficult to remove without cracking the glass. In fact, Apple's shoved a load of glue in the new iPad, with iFixit noting that "gobs of adhesive hold everything in place,". making removing the battery incredibly difficult. That was the case with previous iPads, especially the iPad Air 1, which also made things incredibly hard when it came to battery removal. And Apple hasn't limited itself to just one form of adhesive; "foam sticky tape" holds the LCD to the front panel, which means anyone trying to disassemble the thing is running the very real risk of shattering the LCD. On the plus side, iFixit says that LCD is quite easy to remove once you get the front panel off the iPad itself, and the battery isn't soldered to the logic board. The team also found out exactly what Apple had stuffed inside in terms of hardware once they'd pried apart the tablet. Perhaps most surprisingly, the new iPad runs on just 2GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the iPhone 7 Plus. There's also the third-gen 64-bit A9 processor, along with the 32.9Wh battery. It seems Apple isn't in a rush to make its products more repairable, then, so if you like tinkering with your tablets, this probably isn't the ideal slate for you.

(AAPL) Will Lose Its App Store Crown to Android Android's collective app stores will overtake Apple in revenue, but it doesn't matter By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 30, 2017, 11:59 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc.

Watch Series 3 Could Cut the Cord View All Posts A new report has been released with comprehensive stats for the global market for mobile apps. App Annie says that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) served up a fraction of the downloads of Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for 2016, yet continued to dominate the revenue side of the business. Source: Apple Apple’s App Store revenue is predicted to continue topping Google Play as the most lucrative through to 2021. It’s expected that all Android app stores combined will overtake Apple’s App Store sales at some point this year. Report on Mobile App Downloads and Revenue App Annie is a firm that tracks global app downloads and app store revenue. A detailed report — which was made available on AppleInsider — sheds light on what’s currently happening in the mobile app market, along with forecasts to 2021. According to App Annie, AAPL’s App Store revenue is about to be surpassed for the first time by the combination of Google Play and third party Android app stores. While Apple remained on top for 2016, with $34 billion in app sales versus a combined $27 billion for Android, in 2017 the lead is expected to shift. Apple App Store revenue is pegged at $40 billion, while Android app stores are on track to book a combined $41 billion. Apple continues to be on top as the single largest app store by sales, with its $40 billion for 2017 expected to nearly double second place Google Play’s $21 billion. Apple’s iOS also stays firmly in the lead as the platform where users are most likely to pay for apps. Apple’s $40 billion in revenue is expected to come from 30 billion downloads. Google Play’s $21 billion will come from 114 billion downloads, making Apple’s App Store a much more lucrative prospect for developers. The App Annie numbers show that Android’s sheer numbers advantage, however, is once again showing results. Apple App Store Revenue Explains Super Mario Run One of the best recent examples of how the difference between app downloads versus app purchases plays out was Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)’s (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Super Mario Run. This was Nintendo’s first full-fledged foray into mobile gaming. Built around one of the most recognizable Nintendo characters of all time, smartphone owners salivated at the chance to play. When the game was released in 2016, if one platform was going to have an edge at getting Mario first, sheer numbers would say it should have been Google Play. With more than double the downloads of the Apple App Store, Google Play would have put Super Mario Run onto a lot more devices. But Nintendo chose to make Super Mario run an iOS exclusive instead. Despite there being far fewer iPhones out there than Android smartphones, AAPL’s App Store revenue shows that those iPhone users are far more likely to pay for a game. Android users had to wait until last week to finally get their hands on the title. And that’s been the model that many premium app developers continue to follow, despite Google Play’s numbers lead. If it’s a high-profile app that cost a lot to develop and you expect people to pay for it, the Apple App Store tends to get it first — if Google Play gets it at all. Will the Shift to Android Dominance Hurt Apple? Services — which includes App Store revenue — has become an increasingly important division for AAPL. It posted the highest growth of any of Apple’s divisions last year and AAPL netted $3 billion in revenue from app downloads last December alone. Is that revenue in jeopardy? That shouldn’t be the case, for three reasons.

By Elizabeth Spiers By Elizabeth Spiers March 30 at 11:59 AM Follow espiers Elizabeth Spiers was the founding editor of Gawker and former editor-in-chief of the New York Observer. Jared Kushner is President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key confidants. Here's a closer look at the man who is expected to be a senior adviser to the president in Trump's White House. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) On my first day of work as the editor in chief of the New York Observer, which had been acquired five years earlier by Jared Kushner, now the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, I inherited an office and a desktop computer, both in fine but used condition. The computer was a recent-model Mac, but when I turned it on, it was inexplicably running Windows. I summoned our beleaguered IT guy to explain, and he informed me that it had belonged to Kushner, who liked the design of Apple products but preferred the Windows OS. “So he was basically using a $2,500 desktop as a monitor?” I said. The IT guy shrugged. In retrospect, this tiny moment seems like a metaphor. Frankensteining two products you appreciate into one product you appreciate even more isn’t irrational; it’s even creative, in a way. On the other hand, why did the newspaper’s owner need a $2,500 monitor? How was it anything but a vanity object? That moment in 2011 came back to me when the Trump administration announced this past week that Kushner would lead the newly created Office of American Innovation to “infuse fresh thinking” into government institutions by utilizing the hard-won knowledge of great American business executives. The appointment was announced with a breathlessness that suggests no one has ever thought of it before, or that former great American business executives have never worked in government until now. But I worked for Kushner for 18 months as he tried to infuse a much smaller institution than the U.S. government with cost-cutting impulses from the commercial real estate world. And my experience doesn’t bode well for the Office of American Innovation. Not everything that works in the private sector is transferrable to the public sector — and even if it were, Kushner isn’t the best person to transfer it.  * * * I was the youngest editor in the Observer’s history and not an obvious choice, but Kushner liked me because I had been the founding editor of Gawker, which had grown into one of the largest indie media companies in the country, with more than 100 million unique visitors a month, and because I had an entrepreneurial and digital background. I also had started a Wall Street site he’d considered acquiring, and I was the only candidate he interviewed who asked to see the Observer’s financials before I would take the job. [Jared Kushner’s White House job may be legal, but history shows it’s a bad idea] Almost 40 percent of my compensation was in the form of a performance bonus contingent upon hitting growth milestones while staying under budget. I was fine with being held accountable; I viewed the paper as a business, just as Kushner did. But I resigned in 2012 for a variety of reasons, chiefly that the president of the company and I couldn’t persuade Kushner to recapitalize the Observer — even though I reached all my numbers. When the paper had a profitable quarter for what I was told was the first time, Kushner floated the idea of layoffs to increase the margins, seemingly ignoring the fact that staff reductions would also reduce ad inventory by reducing content. A material part of what had been attractive about the job was the promise of expansion and growth. But we submitted business plans over and over again, and Kushner rejected them. He wanted the Observer to be cheaper to run, usually at the expense of growth and evolution, and he could not see the relationship between scale and profit — between risk and reward. (The White House did not answer a request from The Washington Post to provide Kushner’s perspective for this story.) He viewed investments in terms of opportunity costs. “Why should I put more money into the Observer when I could invest in a software company?” he would say. This is a legitimate question for any returns-driven investor. But news media doesn’t scale like software. You need people to produce content, at least until artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and sensitive sources are willing to trust a bot. Why would you buy a newspaper if you expect it to scale the way software does? Why assume that media and software have the same risk profile and dynamics? Kushner would frequently point to a media company with a 60-person editorial staff and ask why our two-person desk wasn’t producing as many stories or as much traffic. Or he’d argue, bizarrely and incorrectly, that because Gawker started with one person, that meant you didn’t need head count to scale a media company. The Internet makes media more scalable, of course — distribution is unlimited and gained at little marginal cost. But that doesn’t mean a media company is just like Uber. That same obsession with the tech world permeates Kushner’s new project. Cost-cutting is important in situations where there is excess, but it is not what catalyzes evolution; if the point here is to make government more effective, not just more efficient, cuts alone won’t do it. The Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kushner has roped into helping him with the new office — such as Apple’s Tim Cook, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff and Tesla founder Elon Musk — would be the first to tell him that scale is important, and that growth is often a function of prioritizing R&D investments. You prototype cheaply to get to a minimum viable product, but if you stop there, you’re in trouble. You have to reinvest, constantly. Lessons from Silicon Valley are even likelier to be misapplied in government than in media. Outside experts always groan that government institutions are running outdated systems that still rely on floppy disks, and that this is a function of some combination of government waste, idiocy and ubiquitous Luddite-ism. But a more logical explanation is that systems upgrades require appropriations, many of which have been gleefully slashed by Congress. There’s also the problem of government pay, and the fact that the private sector has financial resources that the government does not. Is it reasonable to expect speedy, high-quality upgrades when engineers are making $90,000 a year and implementations are often contracted out to the lowest bidder? [Trump says his budget will make government lean. It’s really a scam.] The irrelevance of private-sector nostrums is likely to haunt Kushner’s new initiative. “They’re all outsiders and nobody knows anything about the government,” says Elaine Kamarck, who worked with Vice President Al Gore when the Clinton administration sought to reinvent government 25 years ago and who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It will take these people a year just to figure out what they’re doing.” There are many government functions that have no analog in the private sector, she pointed out, like maintaining a nuclear arsenal. The Clinton administration’s efforts had some success, Kamarck said, because Gore’s group was staffed primarily by government people and civil servants who worked in concert with private-sector experts. “They also have to staff the government,” she said, pointing to the Trump administration’s failure to fill hundreds of crucial positions so far, leaving any ideas that the new organization produces without a government to execute them. * * * Kushner’s claim to business knowledge, beyond admiring Silicon Valley, boils down to his work for his family’s commercial real estate company, which is hardly comparable to a government institution. And if industry dynamics are not transitive across the board, expertise isn’t, either. On that count, I’m not even sure how to quantify Kushner’s expertise, anyway. Yes, he ran the company — which he inherited, not uncommon in New York’s dynastic, insular real estate world. But he was sure he had the goods. When I worked for him, I wasn’t sure he had a realistic view of his own capabilities since, like his father-in-law, he seemed to view his wealth and its concomitant accoutrements as rewards for his personal success in business, and not something he would have had in any case. To me, he appeared to view his position and net worth as the products of an essentially meritocratic process. Yet when Kushner Co. bought 666 5th Avenue for $1.8 billion in 2007, it was the largest transaction for a commercial real estate building in Manhattan’s history. Had the financing gone south, as it nearly did, it probably would have destroyed the family’s fortune. The building is heavily in debt now and in need of new investors to let Vornado, a real estate firm that owns 49.5 percent of the building, get out; discussions with Chinese insurance giant Anbang fell apart this week. Is this good dealmaking? I don’t know. If I were to assume any expertise I have is transitive to commercial real estate, I might argue that Kushner Co. overpaid for the building in the first place and overleveraged itself. But I also know what I don’t know, and I don’t make a living using vast amounts of debt to buy Class A office buildings in New York, so I will defer to people who do to opine. You could construe my evaluation as a reasonable observation by an outsider with a set of “fresh eyes,” but you’d be nuts to hand me a billion-dollar commercial real estate company because of it. When it became clear in 2012 that Kushner was conflating running lean with starvation, I submitted my resignation and left the Observer mostly on good terms with him, but I was disappointed. The company president resigned a few weeks later. Kushner eventually filled our positions with a family friend and his brother-in-law, the latter of whom had no media experience. He wanted outsiders to run the business — but loyal, compliant outsiders. A few days after Trump won the election, Kushner folded the now attenuated print newspaper and subsequently announced that the Observer, in its digital incarnation, was for sale. He probably would refer to it as a “lean” operation. I would say in his zeal to trim the fat, he began eliminating muscle and hacked into a few bones. I realize also, in retrospect, that he may never have intended to grow it or improve it. It was for him, in essence, another vanity object — like the beautiful, expensive desktop computer he used as a monitor. I worry that this new office will be more of the same: a vanity project, one that exists primarily to put Kushner in the same room with people he admires whom he wouldn’t have had access to before, glossing government agencies in the process with a thin veneer of what appears to be capitalism but is really just nihilistic cost-cutting designed to project the optics of efficiency. If the outside experts have good advice, it will be heeded only where it reinforces what the administration would do anyway. And anyone who volunteers to carry out the administration’s agenda may be handed wholesale control of an area of government where their domain expertise isn’t just low, but nonexistent. But I would like to be a fly on the wall when Kushner expresses his feelings to Tim Cook about the Macintosh operating system.

Apple's $5 billion campus opens next month — here's what it looks like now Kif Leswing Mar. 30, 2017, 11:57 AM 129,373 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's biggest launch in 2017 isn't a new iPhone or iPad. It's a new campus in Cupertino, California, that looks like a spaceship and reportedly cost over $5 billion to build. The project was one of the last that Steve Jobs was involved with. YouTube/Matthew Roberts Apple named the campus "Apple Park" in February and said it would open in April for employees. There will also be an Apple Store on the premises and a visitors center for non-employees, although the opening date for the public hasn't been announced yet. "The main building, parking structure, theatre, and fitness center are under construction," said a progress report delivered to the Cupertino City Council on March 7. "Occupancy for main building will begin in April and phased to end of 2017. Phase 2 and ancillary building expected to be completed by 2018."  Our latest look at Apple's "spaceship" headquarters comes from Matthew Roberts, a drone pilot and photographer who has been making Apple Park videos for years.  Take a look: View As: One Page Slides Apple Park is right on Interstate 280, but a military-grade fence shields it from the noise and intruders.

Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. Read More: Trump Sweeps Away Climate Rules Vowing ‘New Energy Revolution’ “Most big companies in the US recognise that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric Co’s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars Inc, the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” ‘American competitiveness’ Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticising the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc, Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co and Best Buy Co, which all signed the 2015 pledge organised by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honour their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp said in an interview. “Mr Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Activist targets GM share structure, board Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia to bar banks from bargaining collectively with Apple over payments Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Nothing in this region comes close to Pengerang Activist targets GM share structure, board Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles With new iPhone, Trump still a target for hackers Australia to bar banks from bargaining collectively with Apple over payments Former Trump advisor Flynn offers testimony for immunity Trump shakes up White House staff after setbacks Democrats urge probe of Trump ties to Iran-linked oligarch Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Suburbs Niles Herald-Spectator Niles News Niles school art teacher surprised with Golden Apple award for excellence Golden Apple surprise in Niles Art teacher Tina Daskalopoulos of Viola H. Nelson Elementary School in Niles was surprised in her classroom Wednesday, March 29, with announcement that she won the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching. Art teacher Tina Daskalopoulos of Viola H. Nelson Elementary School in Niles was surprised in her classroom Wednesday, March 29, with announcement that she won the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching. Mike IsaacsContact ReporterPioneer Press For the second time this year, the nonprofit Golden Apple organization managed to joyfully fool Viola H. Nelson Elementary School art teacher Tina Daskalopoulos. A group burst into the teacher's art class where she was working with her fifth-grade students Wednesday to let her know she had won the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching. Golden Apple officials were there alongside school administrators, parents, board members and the teacher's colleagues, making this anything but a normal day at the East Maine District 63 school in Niles. According to officials, no Nelson School teacher had won a Golden Apple before. "Oh my God," Daskalopoulos said as applause, screams and various whoops broke out. The teacher covered her mouth, trying to push back emotion and then reached for the closest student and delivered a hug to her. A Nelson School art teacher for nearly 30 years, Daskalopoulos said she never even expected to be named a finalist let alone win the award. A family friend nominated her, she said, and then she went about submitting her application even if she didn't think she had much of a shot. Daskalopoulos said she believed the award went mostly to math and science teachers so being named one of 34 finalists was her first surprise. Winning the award was an even bigger one, she said – especially since many other winners had already been notified. Nelson School was on spring break the previous week so she became the final teacher in the 2017 lineup to be awarded the Golden Apple, officials said. "This was completely unexpected," Daskalopoulos said. "Recognitions had been given already and I thought that was it and now I'll move on. I thought 'I can be thrilled I was a finalist.'"

(Mike Isaacs / Pioneer Press) She called winning the award "one of the happiest days of my life" and the art room where she was notified about it "one of my happiest places in the world." According to Golden Apple officials, this year's award recipients were selected from a pool of more than 600 fourth- through eighth-grade teachers throughout Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Recipients were nominated by students, community members, parents and colleagues who have directly engaged with them, they said. Teachers, college professors, administrators and former Golden Apple winners served on the selection committee to help decide the winners, officials said. The winners receive a tuition-free spring quarter sabbatical to study at Northwestern University, a $5,000 cash award and become fellows of the Golden Apple Academy of Educators. "We continue to see conclusive evidence that being taught by an effective teacher has significant consequences on student achievement," said Golden Apple CEO Dominic Belmonte. "Our 2017 award recipients have distinguished themselves through their talents, creative approaches to powerful modern teaching and devotion to their students."

(Mike Isaacs / Pioneer Press) Those on hand for the surprise ceremony Wednesday described Daskalopoulos' approach to her job with the same word: "passion." "She has absolute passion for art and for teaching and for her kids," said Nelson School Principal Jean LeBlanc. "She shares her love about art and (helps) them view themselves as artists and as people who appreciate art." LeBlanc said she explained to the kids what a prestigious award their teacher was in the running for – but it didn't matter. "They know she's special. She didn't need an award for them to know that," she said. District 63 Supt. Scott Clay also said the teacher's passion for her job is always on view. "She loves art. She loves children and she loves helping them to learn about art and explore their talents," he said. "She's really great at highlighting the kids' skills. That's all we can ask from teachers." The teachers' fifth-grade students were creating human figurines when their class was suddenly interrupted with the good news. They were asked to hold up Golden Apple signs for photo opportunities and then many of them approached Daskalopoulos to ask for her autograph. "I feel happy," said fifth-grader Eli Mohammed. "She's a really good teacher. She's really nice and she helps us with our artwork."

(Mike Isaacs) Eve Kaczowski, a former student, said she took off from Oakton Community College to join the surprise party. "She's pretty special and this is awesome," she said. Her mother, Janet, said all three of her children had art under Daskalopoulos. "It's amazing what she can coax out of the children," she said. Sixth-grade teacher Tracy Fragassi had tears in her eyes as she hugged her colleague and offered congratulations. "She means everything to the kids," Fragassi said. "She is in their lives forever after they leave here. Everyone talks about Mrs. D." Daskalopoulos said the award validates what she has always believed. "Art is a component of the whole person," she said. "It has to be addressed. It has to be valued. It has to be included for a complete education." The teacher may never have won a Golden Apple before, but this isn't the first "apple" she has received for her teaching, she said. She remembered a student who became a medical doctor, but he returned to her – as many of her students do – to say thank you and bring her a gift. "It was a silk box that he made," she said. "In it was a crystal apple and he wrote me the most beautiful, eloquent letter. He said, 'I'm a medical doctor now but I made this for you and I want you to have it because you opened up a part of my life that I would not have had.'" misaacs@pioneerlocal.com Twitter @SKReview_Mike Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Four people fatally shot in South Shore neighborhood 'Everywhere I go, it's gonna be a challenge:' family discusses life in Englewood What's new at Guaranteed Rate Field, besides a new name?

The new phone displays are bigger than the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and they have curved screens that flow onto the sides. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Months before Apple could release a new iPhone that's all screen, glorious screen, Samsung beat it to the punch. Samsung unveiled its latest smartphone on Wednesday, the Galaxy S8. The sleek phone's standout features are a screen that goes nearly to the edges of the device, and a virtual assistant named Bixby. Can this phone lure away iPhone customers, or at least undermine Apple by featuring similar advancements first? This summer marks the iPhone's 10th anniversary. As it does every year, Apple will likely unveil a new version of the smartphone at a flashy press event. This year, there are heightened expectations that the company will wow customers with something fresh to mark the occasion after keeping the hardware design largely unchanged in recent versions. After a decade of amazing and consistent growth, iPhone sales finally started to cool off in 2016, though they bounced back again this past quarter. "I think it does put a lot of pressure on Apple to show that they can still innovate. Certainly Apple remains the one to beat," said analyst Christopher Voce of Forrester Research. Many faithful iPhone owners have been putting off upgrading to wait and see what the company has in store for this year's model. Rumors include an edge-to-edge screen and the removal of the physical home button -- just like the S8. The new iPhone could also have wireless charging and a slew of high-end camera features. Apple might even skip calling it the iPhone 7S and name it something more dramatic such as iPhone 8, iPhone X or iPhone Pro. The early buzz for the S8 has been mostly positive. That's a blessing for Samsung, which is still reeling from its disastrous Galaxy Note 7 launch last year. The company had to recall, then discontinue, those devices after faulty batteries caused sudden fires. While it's first to the large screen, it's last to the virtual assistant. Samsung has jumped on the hottest tech trend and launched its very own voice-activated assistant, Bixby. But early looks indicate Bixby is no Siri. Or Cortana or Alexa. In fact, it seems to do less than other voice assistants while also directly competing with Google's own version which is part of Android. Apple doesn't have to be first to a feature to sell it as revolutionary. In fact, many of its biggest additions in recent years already existed on other devices -- like waterproofing, stickers and animations in messages, and Live Photos, which are similar to animated gifs. The iPhone won't be the first to have an edge-to-edge screen, but you can bet the company will describe it as revolutionary. Jony Ive might wax poetic in a video showing the manufacturing process. The key is making sure Apple executes the feature the best, perhaps by having smaller bezels or none at all. Are people really choosing a phone based on bezels? How many even know what a bezel is (it's the frame around the screen)? There are Android and iPhone people, each faithful to their chosen ecosystems. But some customers are still up for grabs. "You're going to have people in one camp or another, but then a lot of people in the middle who go back and forth," said Voce. We might be running out of ways to truly innovate with smartphone designs. In which case, the battles will be won based on the quality of the design, pricing and perhaps whether or not a device has a headphone jack or catches fire.

Except this house had been built from the ground up, for the launch of Google Home, with on-brand door knockers shaped like the letter G. When it comes to introducing a new product, pulling out all the stops for the launch has become a field of innovation in itself. When the Samsung Galaxy S8 was revealed yesterday, simultaneously at both London’s Olympic Park and New York’s Lincoln Center, there were packed out audiences, live music and immersive videos to drive the message home. At the American event, YouTubers Franchesca Ramsey and Casey Neistat made the audience laugh uproariously with routines riffing on phones (many tuned in to watch online too) and at a recent Apple launch, Sia performed.  There ain’t no party like a tech launch party. “Launches are our opportunity to share with the world our excitement around ground-breaking new products,” says a spokesman for Samsung. “From inviting people to follow launches through our channels such as Facebook and Twitter, to live streaming our events, we are using social and digital platforms to make our launches as inclusive as possible and involve as many as we can.” Here’s how to launch a product. Setting the stage Read more What you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch On Tuesday, to showcase its Google Home technology to the UK, Google unveiled a house in Bermondsey it had built from the ground up. Hallways, bedrooms, a kitchen — the works. The idea was to put the voice-activated smart assistant (a rival to Amazon’s Alexa) in its element by unleashing it everywhere from the bathroom (“Hey, Google, play music”) to the bedroom — a fully furnished bedroom, with a king-size bed, wardrobe and even a pair of slippers snugly tucked away. Guests compelled the AI to adjust the thermostat, flick Stranger Things on via Netflix on the room’s smart TV and turn off the lights (“Hey Google, I’m ready for bed”).  That’s entertainment Apple and Samsung know that launches mean putting on a show. “One phone launch by Samsung in New York was a lavish, high-kicking musical in Radio City Music Hall,” says freelance technology editor David Phelan. “It was slick, lively and very cheesy. Apple’s events are extremely focused on the message, but that doesn’t mean there’s no glamour. Often they end with a guest appearance from a band or singer. I’ve seen Sia, Kanye West and — best of all — Tony Bennett singing I Left My Heart in San Francisco at the final MacWorld event.”  The last Google launch event — for the Pixel phone — worked with the theme “OK Google +, help me get home”. Accordingly, it had built a miniature Tube station — complete with a working train. Nintendo Switch meanwhile invited guests to milk a virtual cow when it launched.

The party continued with Aperol spritzes, as well as fine meat and celeriac among dishes served by self-proclaimed “MasterChef losers” (they were finalists last year) Billy Wright and Jack Layer.  “You can always tell when the food at a launch is good because journalists huddle round the exit to the kitchen.” says Phelan. “Usually, canapés are pretty average, but the hands-down best launch food has to be at the Club des Chefs extravaganzas from Samsung, where they show off their latest kitchen equipment and where the snacks are cooked in front of your eyes by a select group of Michelin-starred chefs.” People power Often, though, the star attraction is as much the name behind the ticket as the product. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, in a turtle-neck sweater and battered trainers, was fabled for his showmanship, stunning thousands at a Macworld conference in San Francisco by unveiling the original iPhone in 2007. “Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything,” he said.  Read more Google Chrome feature knows when you’ve been browsing too much porn Samsung unveils Bixby voice command service to rival Siri and Alexa Samsung Galaxy X expected to be a foldable phone and tablet hybrid These days, current CEO Tim Cook goes even further: last September, the Apple boss filmed a Carpool Karaoke skit with The Late Late Show host James Corden and musician Pharrell Williams. They drive through San Francisco as Cook, Corden and Williams sing Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Sweet Home Alabama, before Cook runs out of the car and onto the stage at a conference to deliver the news that Apple Music will be teaming up with Corden to make its own Carpool Caraoke series.  Presentation and correct Then there’s the small matter of the product that’s being revealed. “Amazon’s UK launch of the Echo was impressive,” says Phelan, “because there was a lengthy demonstration of the voice-recognition capabilities of the Echo. Voice recognition is difficult to achieve in a domestic situation, near-impossible in a large-scale public one, but it went flawlessly.”  But what about when it all goes wrong? “This happens quite a lot and you leave thinking, ‘Well, if they can’t get it right now, will it ever work for me?’ It’s also extremely cringe-worthy when things go horribly wrong. Even if it makes for fun reporting.” More about: Google Samsung Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

As it appears, the main ring-shaped building should be soon open to employees in some of the wings. Drone pilot Matthew Roberts just posted his latest flyover footage of the 175 acre campus in glorious 4K resolution, showing continued work on landscaping, solar installations and more. Matthew noted that the building is open to employees in some of the wings, with office chairs and tables being set up inside a secure R&D facility and other buildings. The Tantau Avenue parking garage is nearing completion, too. Additional prep work for the pond within the large, central courtyard of Apple Park is visible as well and you can even catch glimpses of staircases leading up to the entryway atrium. Here’s Matthew’s latest footage of Apple Park construction progress. Apple Park files as the biggest office building and corporate campus ever. Other people took their drones to the skies to film construction progress at the site, too. Here are some of the more recent examples. Apple paid a homage to its late co-founder by naming a 1,000-seat underground auditorium where future press and corporate events will take place the Steve Jobs Theater. It won’t open until later this year as there’s clearly more work to be done there. Apple has yet to specify a move-in date beyond the month of April.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 Galaxy S8 features people can’t stop talking about, and 2 features no one knows about Image Source: Samsung Zach Epstein @zacharye March 30th, 2017 at 10:14 AM Share Tweet It’s funny how you can know just about everything there is to know about a new flagship smartphone thanks to rumors and leaks, and yet still be blown away when the phone is finally announced. We’ve seen it time and time again with Apple’s iPhone lineup since all the details always leak months in advance, and now we’re seeing it with Samsung’s hot new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Android fans lost count of all the leaks as they flooded the web in the weeks ahead of Samsung’s big Unpacked press conference on Wednesday, and we’ve seen photos and videos leak time and time again. Once people actually saw the full Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ picture come together on stage yesterday, however, they knew they were watching something special. We already gave you an extensive hands-on preview of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, and we also ran through a number of the duo’s most exciting new features. In this post, we’re going to focus on the five new Galaxy S8 features people just can’t stop taking about, and we’ll also cover two fantastic new Galaxy S8 features that most people don’t even realize were added to the new phones. Don't Miss: 10 new Galaxy S8 features you won’t find on any iPhone Design This is obviously the big one, and for good reason. After spending just a couple of hours with Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, we can already state conclusively that these new flagship smartphones are the sleekest, most elegant, best-designed handsets the world has ever known. Just a few short years ago, Samsung was still releasing flagship phones made out of thin plastic that felt flimsy and cheap. Fast-forward to 2017 and the company’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are unmatched. Apple’s iPhones have always been considered the gold standard of design — they are the most copied handsets on the market, after all — but Samsung has bested Apple in nearly every way. First and foremost, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ have narrow bezels and a screen-to-body ratio of 83%. As a result, Samsung has fit a monstrous 6.2-inch Super AMOLED display into a phone the same size as Apple’s 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. In fact, at 5.8 inches, even the smaller Galaxy S8 has a bigger screen than the iPhone 7 Plus. Then you’ve got the rounded edges on the front and back of the phones, which makes them fit perfectly in the hand. It also makes Samsung’s new phones feel incredibly thin despite actually being a tiny bit thicker than Apple’s iPhones. Photos will never do the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ justice. When you finally get the chance to check these hot new handsets out in stores, you’re going to be blown away. Bixby The second most talked-about Galaxy S8 feature has to be Bixby. This is Samsung’s attempt to combat the rise of digital assistant products like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and the one that started it all, Apple’s Siri. This is one of the hottest spaces in consumer tech right now, so it’s no mystery why Samsung would want in on the action. It’s obviously far too soon to compare Bixby to any other virtual personal assistant products out there, though a number of gadget blogs out there have inexplicably already tried to do so. Early impressions generally seem positive though, and we’re looking forward to putting Bixby through the paces when we review Samsung’s new phones. Bixby Vision Bixby Vision is an extension of Bixby that brings the physical world around you into the picture. Literally. Using the camera on the Galaxy S8 or S8+, Bixby Vision allows the phones to “look” at their surroundings and offer useful information to users. Bixby Vision can also “see” printed text and instantly translate more than 50 different languages. Samsung DeX Samsung isn’t the first company to bake a desktop experience into a smartphone, but it is the first company to bake a desktop experience into a smartphone that people actually want. Microsoft and its partners like HP have offered a similar feature on Windows phones, but they were, well, Windows phones. What’s more, Samsung’s implementation with DeX is shockingly fast. It looks and feels a bit like Chrome OS, but the idea of having one device with all of your data, logins and more is compelling. Unless you need specialized software that’s only available for Windows or macOS, Samsung’s DeX solution can easily replace the need for a desktop PC for many people. Here’s a video that shows Samsung DeX in action: Processors To be honest, it’s a bit odd that there’s so much chatter out there surrounding the processors in Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Specs are important, of course, but they hardly tell the whole story. In the case of the Galaxy S8 and S8+, however, the processors are more important than normal because these are the first new smartphones to sport next-generation 10nm chipsets. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Samsung Exynos 8895 use a process that is more compact than any other mass-market processors. They’re also more energy-efficient and more powerful than any other processors on the market. In terms of multi-core performance, they absolutely crush everything else on the market and people are excited to check them out. Two features almost no one is talking about Most people were so enamored with Samsung’s new design that they apparently didn’t bother to really dig into the details. We can’t blame them, to be honest — these new smartphones are just so gorgeous. There are two features involving the Galaxy S8’s wireless connectivity that users should be very excited about, and we’ll quickly cover them here. First up, the Galaxy S8 will be the first widely available smartphone with Bluetooth 5.0. This next-generation wireless technology is better than current versions of Bluetooth in literally every way. It’s more power efficient, it has four times the range, and it supports two simultaneous independent streams. That means you can play a video and stream to two separate pairs of Bluetooth headphones at the same time. Last but certainly not least, the Galaxy S8 will be the first phone to support gigabit LTE speeds. That’s right, 1Gbps data transfers on your phone. Good luck holding onto your tiered data plans in the future… Here’s a video from T-Mobile that shows off some crazy speed tests: Tags: Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8 Plus, Samsung View Comments Trending 1 Tech A word of warning to anyone who hasn’t already updated to iOS 10.3 2 Deals Amazon’s best-selling smart thermostat works with Alexa and costs half as much as a Nest 3 Tech Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ hands-on: Samsung finally out-designed Apple’s iPhone 4 Tech No one buys Windows phones, so Microsoft has its own version of the Galaxy S8 5 Tech The 8 best new features Apple added to your iPhone in iOS 10.3 Picked For You The 8 best new features Apple added to your iPhone in iOS 10.3 By Zach Epstein March 27th at 1:09 PM Google Pixel 3 is coming next year, and phone makers are already fighting over it By Chris Smith March 29th at 7:35 AM Go get these crazy MacBook deals while you can By Chris Mills March 29th at 5:04 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

You published a newspaper once a day or produced a nightly newscast. Even with the advent of the Internet things were fairly straightforward: You had a website and posted your coverage there. But as platforms — from Facebook and Snapchat to messaging platforms such as Kik and Line — become more ubiquitous, news organizations now have to decide where they want to publish and how they want to present their coverage on these platforms. A study out this week from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University examines how platforms have changed journalism, and while the entire 25,455-word report is worth reading, one particularly interesting section looks at how news outlets are choosing to publish (or not publish) across a variety of platforms. The report compares how The New York Times, CNN, and The Huffington Post utilized platforms during a week in early February. In that span, each outlet posted to about 10 different platforms. The Times and HuffPo each posted about 1,660 times across the various platforms. CNN, however, published more than 2,800 stories, about 40 percent more than the other two. The Tow report defines two primary different types of platform-based content: native and networked. Native content includes entities such as Snapchat Discover and Stories, Facebook Instant Articles, or Apple News. These formats live entirely within the walled gardens of the platforms. Networked content, meanwhile, links back to the news organizations’ own sites. The study examined 14 publishers and found that during the week of Feb. 6, they posted 12,341 pieces of networked content and 11,481 pieces of native content. “While publishers all need to have a presence across a broad range of platforms, how they distribute their content — and, in particular, the amount they ‘give away’ to platforms in the form of native content — differs considerably,” the study said. During the week of February 6, two-thirds of The Huffington Post’s distributed content was posted in native formats. That includes 695 stories on Apple News and 305 Facebook posts, which include Instant Articles, Live Video, and other formats. “These native Facebook posts also represent 98 percent of Huffington Post’s total Facebook posts,” the study found. CNN similarly posted 59 percent of its content natively. That included 1,016 Apple News Articles, 948 tweets, and 278 YouTube videos. The report also noted that “CNN’s concerted effort to reach younger audiences is also evident in its Snapchat Discover channel, on which we saw a shift away from scrollable articles repurposed from cnn.com to more bitesize news cards, and its ongoing commitment to chat app LINE.” Meanwhile, only 16 percent of the Times’ posts were native. The Times was one of a handful of news organizations that Facebook launched Instant Articles with in 2015, but the paper has since stopped publishing on Instant Articles. During the week that Tow measured the posts, just 19 percent of the Times’ 406 Facebook posts were native to the platform. The paper also posted 74 stories on Apple News. Unlike The Huffington Post and CNN, the Times is focused on digital subscriptions and its main goal is to drive users back to its own platforms, which explains its reluctance to use native posts. In a speech at a conference last year, Lydia Polgreen, who was then the editorial director of the Times’ global expansion effort and is now the editor of The Huffington Post, explained how the Times’ approach to platforms is different than other publishers. Social platforms, especially Facebook, allow us to target our journalism to those most likely to want to pay for it. I believe that we are better off as Facebook’s happy customer than as its outgunned competitor in a David and Goliath fight for advertising dollars. Yes, Facebook will try mightily to keep news consumers inside its platforms, via features like Instant Articles. Our job is to create experiences that will draw our most loyal users back, again and again, to our own products. So far, we seem to be succeeding at this. We will never be as big or financially successful as Facebook, but I believe we can run a thriving media company that can afford a lavishly funded news operation, as well as return value to our shareholders. Many of the people the study’s authors — Emily Bell and Taylor Owen — interviewed reiterated that business models often determine how news organizations approach publishing on the platforms: Jim Brady, founder and CEO of Billy Penn, a Philadelphia mobile news platform, said that when it came to Instant Articles, “I can afford to be a little bit more agnostic about it than someone whose revenue is tied to where the page view lies.” Gabe Dance, former managing editor of the not-for-profit news organization the Marshall Project said their resources were focused on “impact” because that’s what funders care about. And, after an unsuccessful experiment with NPR to host audio natively on the platform, Wright Bryan, senior editor for engagement, walked away wondering, “Does audio really fit a format like Facebook?” One example of this is that the study showed that publishers’ attitudes toward Instant Articles in particular varied greatly. Outlets such as The Washington Post, Vox, and BuzzFeed News all posted more than 90 percent of their links as Instant Articles during the week of February 6. Meanwhile, Vice, Vice News, and Tronc papers the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times aren’t using Instant Articles at all. “I think because there’s a continuous debate as to the very question: ‘What do you need to control, and what things do you not,’” Sterling Proffer, head of business strategy and development at Vice, told the study’s authors. “Going all in, solely on the platform to support your entire ecosystem in every way, is a big gamble.” Show tagsHide tags Show comments / Leave a commentHide comments Billy Penn BuzzFeed BuzzFeed News CNN Emily Bell Facebook Facebook Instant Articles Gabriel Dance Huffington Post Jim Brady Kik Line Lydia Polgreen Marshall Project New York Times NPR platforms Snapchat Taylor Owen Tow Center for Digital Journalism Twitter Vice Washington Post Wright Bryan   What’s the best way to follow how the news is changing?

The latest look at the site comes today via a drone flyover courtesy of Matthew Roberts (below), which shows progress made on the site in recent weeks including continued work on landscaping, solar installations, and other finishing touches. There are even signs of life at the new campus already with office chairs, tables and other equipment being set up inside… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Apple announced that it would begin moving in employees to the site sometime next month when it officially unveiled the Apple Park name back in February, but it’s clear that the process has already started with at least office equipment. It also named the site’s underground 1000 seat auditorium the “Steve Jobs Theater,” the venue that’s expected to host future product unveilings and Apple events. In today’s flyover, Roberts notes that office chairs and tables are now visible inside of some buildings including the R&D facility separate from the main circular building (pictured below): While there were earlier rumors Apple could hold an event at the new campus and theater early next month, possibly to unveil new iPad models, we noted that it looks unlikely following the last drone flyover of the site earlier this month. Of note, in today’s drone flyover, it’s clear there is still a lot of landscaping and finishing work to be done on at least the theater’s entrance before it’s suitable to host a public event. Following the event rumors, Apple introduced its new iPad alongside other product updates without an event last week. It’s still expected to introduce a refreshed iPad Pro model soon, according to supply chain chatter, but it’s unclear if Apple will host a spring event as usual or if last week’s product announcements were in place of one.

Microsoft sets out to change that—and to bring more creatives to the Windows platform—with the Surface Studio (starting at $2,999; $4,199 as tested), a touch-screen all-in-one (AIO) PC that can stand upright like a traditional desktop display or recline to serve as a digital canvas, letting designers draw, sketch, and edit as they would on a dedicated drawing tablet or physical medium. It's all wrapped up in a thin, thoughtfully designed package, making it equal parts attractive, innovative, and useful. It's expensive and lacks cutting-edge components, but the Surface Studio still manages to easily earn our Editors' Choice endorsement for high-end AIO PCs. //Compare Similar Products Compare HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 27-Inch With Retina 5K Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Aura   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS 27 (7760)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell OptiPlex 24 7000 Series All-In-One (7440)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Veriton Z4820G-I5650TZ   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Envy All-in-One (27-b010)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkCentre X1   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 21.5-Inch With 4K Retina Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corsair One Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Drafting Board First, a quick rundown for the uninitiated: The Surface Studio is an all-in-one PC, the first desktop in Microsoft's hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops. In keeping with that spirit, but tying it squarely to your desk, the Studio's super-thin 28-inch touch screen can tilt from an upright setup (what Microsoft calls Desktop Mode) to a reclined, canvas-like state (Studio Mode). The screen is just 0.44-inch thick, while the components and ports are all housed in a base that measures 1.26 by 8.66 by 9.84 inches (HWD). Our other top pick AIO, the 2017 HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One, takes up even more desk space with its incredible ultra-wide screen, but there's no touch functionality. The Studio's design and build are gorgeous. The look is undeniably iMac inspired, but the convertibility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio its own distinctive look. The "gravity hinge" can stop at any point between fully upright and reclined. It slides effortlessly between modes, and it's satisfying to push the screen down or up with a single finger. View All 11 Photos in Gallery As for the display itself, it bears a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television (192ppi). The Apple iMac With 5K Retina Display, by comparison, has a 27-inch screen with 5,210-by-2,880 resolution, though it's tough to compare directly because the Studio's aspect ratio is also different than standard wide-screen. Its 3:2 ratio was chosen with designers in mind, as one inch on the screen represents one inch in reality, better mirroring physical work in a digital space. The screen shines, with an incredibly crisp and vibrant picture that suits the work many creative types will use it for. The colors are bold and bright, as the display uses 10-bit color depth and supports the P3 and SRGB color gamuts, which you can swap between on the fly. It's brilliantly bright on the default Vivid color profile (so much so that the maximum setting hurt my eyes up close at times, driving me to lower it down a notch). You won't have to worry about images appearing too dim. Fingerprints do smudge up the screen, but you can really only see them when it's powered off. Of course, exceptional screen quality alone is not what will have designers flocking to the Surace Studio en masse. Its convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a real artist's workstation. With the display folded down, it becomes infinitely easier to draw directly on it compared with a traditional upright monitor, and that's what gives the Surface Studio its unique value. Microsoft is aggressively targeting the creative demographic, which has been Apple's bread and butter with the iMac and MacBooks for years. This vibe was unmistakable in its debut presentation of the Studio, and is doubly obvious with additions in the Windows 10 Creators Update like Paint 3D and upgrades to Windows Ink. By embracing touch capability on the hardware and software fronts (while Apple continues to relegate touch to iOS only), the Surface Studio could feasibly become the go-to one-stop-shop for designers and artists. More importantly, it continues the transformation of Windows and PCs as stodgy and business-centric to stylish, versatile platforms for a new generation of professionals, creatives, and students. That brings us to the topic of price, which will likely have many potential buyers balking. The Surface Studio is clearly an expensive product—even the starting configuration costs $2,999—but it's priced relatively competitively when you look at what you're getting. Comparably sized drawing displays don't double as powerful computers, or feature the Studio's engineering, but still cost upward of $2,000 or more. For example, Wacom's 27-inch QHD Cintiq is $2,799, and while you can hook it up to a PC or Mac for digital creation, you'll still need to buy that computer. When accounting for graphics, processing, storage, and a super-high-resolution display, the Studio's price actually starts to look reasonable. Ports and Peripherals All ports are located on the back of the base. They're a bit difficult to access, particularly when the screen is reclined, since you have to reach around it or turn the whole machine around. But it's not terribly frustrating, and keeps the flush, sleek look intact. There are four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack. USB-C connectivity is notably absent here. The Studio comes with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, both of which connect via Bluetooth 4.0. These are also very iMac-like in look and feel, and they get the job done. I don't find the low-profile mouse particularly comfortable, but Apple faithfuls likely won't mind it. The keyboard is satisfying to type on. The Surface Pen stylus is also included. It works well with the Studio, and there's little to no latency between strokes and response on the screen. The "eraser" is a customizable button, as is a skinny strip along the side you can set as right click, paste, or something else depending on your workflow. By default it brings up the Windows Ink Workspace software for quickly launching into note-taking and drawing. There are magnetic strips on either side of the display, like the Surface Pro, to attach the Pen when not in use. We also tested the Surface Dial ($99), though it isn't included. The Dial is not an instrument for drawing or editing in and of itself, but an aid for tool and menu selection. You can press and spin the Dial to scroll through various on-screen options, which feels very satisfying. (Stay tuned for a full review of the Dial.) Placing it directly on the display and pressing down brings up a digital radial menu around the physical Dial with options like Volume, Brightness, and Undo, which looks and feels very futuristic. It doesn't take long to learn, and I was flipping between settings and changing tools with ease within a few minutes. Whether or not this will speed up your process depends on your workflow, but it definitely helped me save time shooting up to the toolbar and back to my canvas. Future software will better integrate with the Dial, giving you more options like a radial digital color wheel, and we'll test those features when they are available. The bottom of the Dial is rubber to help grip the screen, but I found that it slowly slides down when the Studio is at any angle other than fully reclined. This shouldn't be a problem most of the time—the Dial will most likely be used alongside the Pen in Studio Mode. Keeping the bottom clean helps grip, and the Dial also works if it's simply sitting on your desk. Outside of the peripherals, the Studio integrates 802.11ac Wi-Fi and wireless support for Xbox controllers (connecting them to a PC typically requires you to purchase Microsoft's Wireless Adapter). You also get two front-facing cameras. One is a 5-megapixel cam for Windows Hello sign-in. When you set up Hello, it will scan your face once and recognize you in the future, allowing you to log in by standing in front of the screen instead of typing in a password. The other 1080p camera is for video chats. Speakers are also built in to the Studio, and have a loud maximum volume with good sound quality. They're of better quality than most built-in speakers on standalone displays, though certainly not up to par with those on the room-shaking Dell XPS 27 AIO. Under the Hood While the design and functionality are worthy of high praise, I have a few reservations about component selection. The Surface Studio a fast system by any measure (see the performance numbers below), but for the high-stress workloads of creative users, some inclusions could be cause for concern. Though generally speedy, thanks in part to 32GB of memory, the Core i7 Skylake processor and GTX 980M graphics card are a generation behind. This could be because the Studio has been in development through the launch of newer components (using a Kaby Lake CPU or Pascal graphics would have presumably delayed its release). Cost concerns or engineering obstacles could also be the culprits. Either way, the Surface Studio's internal hardware isn't quite cutting edge, which is disappointing for the price, and a (likely inevitable) refreshed version with newer components would really knock it out of the park. Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive similar to Apple's fusion format. Our test unit includes a 2TB drive, while the base and midrange models each include 1TB. Rather than provide solid-state storage (it's not an option on any of the Studio's configurations), Microsoft includes a hybrid hard drive that utilizes an SSD cache, but data is stored on the 5,400rpm hard drive. In spite of this, and a bit to my surprise, load times were still on the level of solid-state storage. The computer boots very quickly, and programs launch with little or no delay, even if it's not the ideal SSD solution you'd hope for. This leads to the issue of expandability options, which are something you'll have to live without if you buy the Studio. Like most all-in-ones, the machine is ready-to-go as ordered and will stay exactly that way, since you can't open it up to add more RAM or storage. That might be enough to ward off some potential buyers, since it's an expensive product you won't be able to upgrade down the road, but that's not anything new for the category, or for anyone who's worked on an iMac for years. External and cloud storage will be your friends (as they likely already are for artists), even with the roomy drive. Performance Just how fast is the Surface Studio? It's plenty zippy, especially since the gap between the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors is not nearly as pronounced as some generations past. The 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU and 32GB of memory powered it to a strong score on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, even at its demanding native resolution. Multimedia test scores were also solid. It completed the Handbrake test in 1 minute and 3 seconds, Photoshop in 3:03, and scored 702 points on CineBench. These results were all faster than the 2015 5K iMac (1:15, 3:19, and 510 points), but not by the margin you'd hope for a newer, pricey desktop. That extends to the last-gen graphics hardware as well, though it matters a bit less since this isn't a gaming system. A 980M was among the best graphics hardware for laptops last generation, so it's a capable 3D card and a lot better than integrated graphics. Gaming isn't the Studio's purpose, but 3D performance for model rendering and manipulation (say, for CAD, architectural, and medical use) is aided by the GPU, so high-powered discrete graphics fits the bill. See How We Test Desktops It is still a mobile card, though, so it can't go toe-to-toe with gaming desktops like the Corsair One Pro or even the Digital Storm Aura, which is also an all-in-one. That said, the Studio is a capable performer at 1080p, averaging 55 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley gaming tests on Ultra-quality settings in HD. Don't expect it to run much in native resolution, though few computers could do so smoothly, really, but you can definitely manage some high-setting HD gaming on the side. It's not VR-ready, however, since the Pascal GTX 1060 graphics card is the recommended entry point for virtual reality gaming, and the 980M does not reach that mark. Bold Concept, Excellent Execution The Surface Studio delivers on Microsoft's vision of creating a digital drafting board and an efficient desktop in a single package. On top of that unique proposition, it's a beautiful and cleverly designed piece of hardware with a stunning display. I have some misgivings about the component decisions, but it doesn't mean the system is slow or not up to the task. Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed. It's a successful proof of concept in Microsoft's bid for reinventing both the digital artist's workspace and the perception and function of Windows as a creator's platform. You might want to wait for version 2.0 with newer parts if you're concerned about performance. But I can assure you that in its current form, the Microsoft Surface Studio is a joy to use and work on. It's a beautiful, innovative marriage of form and function, and an easy Editors' Choice. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

Apple does something in the iPhone. And then magically we see that appearing in the Samsung Galaxy S phones, along with phones made by other Android companies. This time, however, Samsung has done something that Apple needs to copy, or do it something similar in an event better. In fact, not just Apple, let's hope other phone makers too can copy Samsung and do what it has done to the screens of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus, two phones it launched on Wednesday. The first time we saw the truly saw the ingenuity of Samsung's display engineers was in the Galaxy Note 4. This was a phone with a large 5.7-inch screen. And yet it was smaller than the phones that came with the 5.5-inch screens. The Note 4 was an engineering marvel. It was best of both worlds, a large screen as well as a relatively compact phone. But this time, with the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ truly pushes the boundaries of what is possible. The S8 comes packed with a 5.8-inch screen in a body that is barely bigger than the frame of the iPhone 7, which has a 4.7-inch screen. The S8+, meanwhile, comes with a 6.2-inch screen in a phone that has a body size very similar to that of the iPhone 7 Plus. Also Read: How Samsung beat Apple in the race for innovation with Galaxy S8, S8+ Here are the numbers. The Galaxy S8 measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm. This phone has a big 5.8-inch screen, although the aspect ratio of 18:9 makes the screen narrower which has its own advantages and disadvantages. In comparison, the iPhone 7 measures 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. It's 10mm shorter but that doesn't matter that much because the width is almost the same so both phones are going to fit in hands similarly. One area where the iPhone 7 really feels better is the weight. Compared to Galaxy S8, which weighs 155 grams, the iPhone 7 weighs around 135 grams. This will be very much noticeable. But by going to a slightly heavier and slightly longer phone, in the Galaxy S8 you get an screen that is inch one inch bigger. I am sure most consumers will easily make this trade-off. The benefits of bigger screen are immense. What applies on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, applies on Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL too. These are premium phones and they ought to come with fresher design When it comes to the iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung does even better. In fact, if you notice the Galaxy S8, which is Samsung's smaller phone, has a bigger screen than what is inside the iPhone 7 Plus. When you move the Galaxy S8+, the Samsung design seems just so much better. Here are the numbers: The S8 measures 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm. The iPhone 7 Plus, in comparison, measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm. And yet, there is an almost one-inch -- 0.7-inch to be precise -- bigger display in the Galaxy S8+. And Google should too with Pixel And what applies on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, applies on Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL too. These are premium phones and they ought to come with fresher designs. The bezels in the Google Pixel phones are huge and hideous. They don't even serve any purpose given the fact that unlike the iPhones, which have the home button under the screen, the Pixel don't have anything. It is just empty expanse, a hideous chin just because Google's product designer found it fitting. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+: Full specs, top features and everything you need to know As noted earlier, this is not the first time Samsung has declared war on bezels around the screen. But with the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ it has exceeds even the standards it set earlier with the Galaxy Note 4. A lot of it is also because the screens in these phones are curved on the left and right edges. Surely, until Google, Apple or other manufacturers decide to use similarly curved screens, they won't be able to go truly bezel-less. But it is high time Apple and Google -- and everyone else in the industry making high-end phones -- start thinking of some better designs for their premium top-end phones. The bezels that the current iPhone and Pixel have are truly terrible.

For, uh, completeness. Writing for The New York Times, Damon Darlin talks to Lauren Dragan about “How to Decide Which Headphones to Buy (Hint: Not Apple’s AirPods).” (Tip o’ the antlers to Tibor Csapo.) GOOD TO KNOW. When doing a thing, always remember why you should not Apple. Very important. The Times’ choices of main images for this article, a customer trying on headphones at an Apple Store and Tim Cook introducing AirPods, seem a little odd. It’s like talking about an ex and being weirdly specific about all the things you’re happy for them about. “According to her Facebook status and Instagram photos she’s in a long-term relationship with a doctor who works with Doctors Without Borders saving leper children from being fed to lions. That’s so great for her, she deserves every happiness.” (Another suggested pair of headphones does get a small image you can expand.) Aside from not having a cord to tangle and being decent at taking phone calls, the AirPods didn’t improve much over the corded EarPods. The Macalope really needs to make a GIF of himself turning to the camera with that Jim from The Office expression because the instances in which he could use such a GIF are multitudinous. Headphone choices can be rather personal. Not everyone has the same ears. Thank goodness. Can you imagine? That would be madness. “Hey, can I have the ears on Tuesday?” NO, GARY, YOU ALWAYS TAKE THEM TO CONCERTS AND THEY’RE RINGING ALL DAY WEDNESDAY. But, for the Macalope’s ears, AirPods are more comfortable and they stay in better without the weight of the cords. Also, unlike wired headphones, they can’t get tangled in your antlers or anything else. The sound quality is the same (which is to say, meh, with no bass). Plus the battery life is less than a full day at work, so you had better remember to charge them at lunch time. And this for $130 more than a replacement pair of EarPods? I don’t think they’re fully cooked yet. The Macalope doesn’t know about your experience but, unless you’re this guy or you really hate your coworkers, you probably don’t put your headphones on the minute you get to work and keep them on until the minute you leave. Manager: Ted, I’d like to talk to you about the Johnson account… Ted: CAN’T TALK. RIHANNA. TALK NEXT QUARTER. The Macalope has the same pair of Plantronics that’s one of the headphones Dragan recommends. They claim up to 8 hours of listening time but the Macalope’s never gone more than an hour with them in his ears because, despite being one of the more comfortable Bluetooth headphones not made by Apple that he’s used, they eventually start to hurt. They say you always hurt the one you love, so maybe the Plantronics just love the Macalope more than the AirPods. The Macalope just wants to be friends, Plantronics. According to Apple, just 15 minutes in the battery case will charge the AirPods for another three hours. But Dragan doesn’t mention that or the AirPods’ numerous advantages, such as the pairing experience, the ease with which you can switch devices, taking one out to pause, how the battery case fits perfectly into that little change pocket on your jeans, etc. Ultimately, no one is obligated to include the AirPods on their list of besties. It just seems odd to the horny one when people “meh” one of Apple’s best products of the last few years without really considering what it has going for it. It might not seem like it sometimes, but the Macalope doesn’t complain about every negative article about Apple. Recently his ruggedly attractive yet still nimble readers have sent him many articles bemoaning the lack of novelty-sized forks to stick into the iPad that he’s declined to touch. Because, while a great many of them are over-the-top in their foppish rushing back and forth between the fainting couch and the cabinet where the smelling salts are kept, one hand clutching the pearls, there really is something wrong with iPad sales (even if not ownership and use). The Macalope’s contention is that big iPhones mean people don’t tend to need iPads. While that validates the basic feature set of a device with a decent amount of screen real estate and touch capabilities, it doesn’t absolve the iPad as a product. Apple’s not perfect. Ding them where it makes sense (e.g. iPad sales, no updates to desktop Macs, Eddy Cue’s shirt selection). But the Macalope thinks not including AirPods on a list of wireless headphone suggestions belies most people’s experience with them.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Apple FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! iPhones to Be Sold in Argentina Could Cost Double the Price in the US GO Apple will officially debut the iPhone in Argentina in April Mar 30, 2017 13:32 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Over the past few years, Apple refrained from selling iPhones in Argentina, because of regulatory hurdles for device imports. Back in 2009, the Argentinian President at the time put in place a number of regulations that prevented companies like Apple from selling products in the country. The regulation affected all major companies and required tech giants to assemble devices in Argentina if they wished to sell them in the country. Some companies, including Samsung, abided by the rules and set up plants in the country, so they could make Argentinians their customers. A report by Bloomberg reveals that the Argentinian government intends to lift the restrictions and thus allow companies like Apple to import and sell iPhones created in other countries. However, the Cupertino company could face a hefty import tax that would make iPhones sold in Argentina at least 25% more expensive than smartphones assembled in the country. iPhone prices in Argentina could be double the ones in the US But one Apple reseller in the country believes that iPhones could cost even more. Hector Goldin is already receiving pre-orders for the five iPhone models that he intends to sell at his location starting April 7. Prices of the phones haven’t been set, but Goldin believes that they could reach double the price in the US and 40% higher than in the neighboring country of Chile. In the past, iPads sold for three times as much in Argentina than in the US. Despite the high price, local carriers will still be offering the phones to customers, providing monthly installment plans to make them more accessible to people in Argentina. Before restrictions were lifted, Argentinians bought iPhones from resellers and third-party retailers, or purchased them during trips abroad. Starting next month, Apple could potentially sell the latest iPhone SE with 128GB of storage, red variants of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, as well as the new 9.7-inch iPad. #Apple#iPhone#iPad#Restriction#iPhone 7 Plus subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Might Have Ended Support for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c with iOS 10.3.2 Siri Rumored to Get iMessage and iCloud Integration in iOS 11 All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE Apple 10.5-Inch iPad Pro Enters Limited Production, Unveil Date Still Unclear Windows 10 Creators Update to Launch on April 5 via Update Assistant Microsoft to Launch Windows 10 Creators Update for Phones on April 25 New Android Ransomware Goes Undetected by All Antivirus Programs Fake WordPress Plugin Opens Sites to Attackers Microsoft to Sell Android Devices Because Windows Phones Are So Yesterday Microsoft Releases Cumulative Update KB4016250 for Windows 10 Version 1703 Microsoft Makes the Final Step Towards the Release of Windows 10 Creators Update Windows 10 Creators Update to Launch on April 5 via Update Assistant    iPhone 7 Plus new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Outs First Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 & tvOS 10.2.1 more on: iOS 10.3.2 Beta i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The scammers are making harassing phone calls up to six times per day. “It said: ‘Hi I’m Molly from Apple support and there is a problem the security of your cloud storage account,’” said Jack Herndon, who was repeatedly called Wednesday. Herndon knew it was a scam right away because he doesn’t have an iCloud account. However, he knows many people with iPhones do, so he posted about the scam online. He told people not to give away any personal information, like the crooks were requesting. Dozens of people, primarily across North Seattle, replied to the post saying they got the repeated call as well. Some said they got similar sounding emails. Sheila Cain got called four times last week. “It upsets me because I think of older people or maybe people who are not tech savvy will worry about this, and actually return that phone call to give out information that they should not,” Cain said. The calls seem to originate from several different local numbers within the western United States. However, the call back number is the same. The automated message also prompts people to dial #2 to make the calls stop. This is not recommended because it confirms that you are paying attention and the scammers may only intensify their efforts. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

(Robert Sciarrino | NJ Advance Media for NJ) Print Email Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 30, 2017 at 9:15 AM comments If you're an occasional consumer of internet pornography, take note of the solution for a recent scam. Apple released an update to its operating systems, fixing a flaw that allowed scammers to use pop-up windows in an attempt to snatch cash from unsuspecting users of the Safari browser on iPhones and iPads. The scammers targeted porn connoisseurs, hoping they'd stumble on the many websites registered to the scammers. The sites were ones that would show up high for certain search terms, primarily from users searching for online pornography. Some music-related domain names were also used, reports said. If an unsuspecting victim clicked on the wrong link, the scammers would use a pop-up window to say the user's device has been locked because of "illegal pornography," for example. It would then direct the user to pay -- using an iTunes gift card, another common pay scam -- via an email address that included law enforcement-sounding names such as cybercrimegov or police-pay. A screen shot of the pop-up window on a seemingly locked iPhone.Lookout  Once the fine was paid, the scammy pop-ups said, the user's Safari browser would be unlocked. Cybersecurity firm Lookout found the flaw and notified Apple, which released the updated operating system -- iOS version 10.3 -- on Monday. A Lookout user reported his device was caught in a never-ending loop. Each time he'd press "OK" on the pop-up window on his screen, he'd be prompted to press "OK" again. And again, and again. The browser was stuck, courtesy of the scammers. The security flaw could in theory have affected anyone who uses the Safari browser on an iPhone or iPad, even though the scammers mostly targeted those who searched for pornography. That's why it's important for you to know how to fix your device if this ever happens to you. Yes, you should always download the latest operating systems for your device. But if you don't, you can still get out of this problem on your own. Users can clear their own browser history and data, which essentially gives a fresh start to the Safari browser. You can do that by opening "Settings," selecting "Safari" and choosing "Clear History and Website Data," Lookout said. NOT JUST APPLE DEVICES This attack is similar to the so-called ransomware attacks that we've told you about before. In one version of the scam, the user will get a window with a message that claims to be from the FBI or another law enforcement group. "Your cell phone has been locked," the message would say. "We have recorded your online movements, including your browser and email history. To avoid serious legal action, call this number." And if you call, you'll be asked to pay fines by wiring money, buying gift cards or other payment methods. Another version of the scam locks your computer after you've unknowingly downloaded a virus. These usually came after users click on a "You can't miss this video" or "You won't believe..." kind of link. Or after you click on celebrity news, such as a fake story last year that reported the untimely (and untrue) death of actress Angelina Jolie. Once the virus is in play, your machine will get stuck on one screen. The message is from a phony version of a trusted source, such as Microsoft or your anti-virus software provider. It will tell you what number to call for "tech help." After you pay, it says, the help desk can unlock your device. Yet another version of the scam happens when a users searches for a help desk for a legitimate company but ends up clicking on an impersonation website instead. It happened to one of our readers, and he gave a fake AOL help site control of his computer to diagnose the scammer-manufactured problem. The reader ultimately didn't pay money for the promised fix, and he was able to correct the problem by running his anti-virus software. So whether you're a porn consumer or not, make sure you have the most updated operating systems on your devices, and be sure to run your computer's anti-virus software regularly, too.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple adds more Distinct Hand Gesturing Features Designed to Work with Future Versions of Apple Watch | Main | Apple's iPhone to Return to the Argentinian Market as Regulations Ease » March 30, 2017 Apple Invents a Wireless Charging System that Puts Equal Emphasis on Wireless Data Transfers   At the top of this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple reveals their Coolest Invention Ever: Wirelessly Charging Future iDevices While they Levitate, Spin & More." As the month comes to a close, the US Patent & Trademark Office published another wireless charging patent application from Apple that places emphasis on transferring data equally to transferring power.   Apple's Patent Background   Modern mobile devices, such as smart phones, smart watches, tablets, and the like, operate when sufficient charge is stored in their batteries. Currently, a single cable connection can be used to both charge the mobile device and allow for data transfer between the mobile device and a charger. Some modern mobile devices can charge their batteries via wireless charging. However, there is no effective way to utilize a single point of exchange system to wireless transfer both power and data to a device from a separate computer or other data source. Thus, improvements in integrated data transfer and wireless charging methods are desired.   Apple's Wireless Charging & Data Transfer Solution   Apple's invention relates to systems, methods, and devices that can achieve both wireless charging and data transferring for electronic devices.   In some embodiments, an apparatus includes an inductive transmitting coil disposed within a housing, an optically transparent window disposed at a surface of the housing and above the inductive transmitting coil, a first optical data transfer module disposed within the housing below the optically transparent window. The first optical data transfer module may be to perform at least one of emitting optical signals through the optically transparent window or detecting optical signals passing through the optically transparent window.   The first optical data transfer module may be further configured to automatically align with a second optical data transfer disposed outside of the housing by moving in a horizontal plane. The second optical data transfer may be configured to automatically align with the first optical data transfer module by moving in a horizontal plane. The apparatus may further include alignment magnets laterally disposed around the optically transparent window. In certain embodiments, the optically transparent window is formed of a selectively transmissive material that is selectively transparent to at least one of infrared or ultraviolet light. The optically transparent window may include a selectively transmissive coating, where the selectively transmissive coating is selectively transparent to at least one of infrared or ultraviolet light. In some embodiments, the apparatus may further include a magnetic shielding disposed around the first optical data transfer module.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below illustrates an exemplary charging and data transfer system #100 that may include an external charging and data puck #102 and an iPhone #104. As shown, the external charging and data puck is below the iPhone such that the back of the iPhone is touching or very close to the external charging and data puck.   The external charging and data puck may be connected to a computer (not shown) that receives and/or transmits data through external charging and the data puck. The computer may also provide power to the iPhone through the external charging and data puck.   In embodiments, external charging and the data puck can instead be directly connected to a power outlet (e.g., a wall outlet).   Wireless Charging   In embodiments, the external charging and the data puck includes a first inductive ring #108 for providing power to electronic devices. The first inductive ring may be a transmitting coil for wireless charging. As an example, the first inductive ring may be a transmitting coil that can generate time-varying magnetic fields.   The generated time-varying magnetic fields may induce a corresponding current in a second inductive ring #110. The second inductive ring may be a receiving coil for wireless charging. The second inductive ring may be disposed in a receiving device, such as an iPhone shown in patent FIG. 1.   In embodiments, either one of the first or second inductive ring may be used for transmitting and receiving. The first and second inductive rings are shown as an inductive ring pair.   Transmitting Data   For transmitting data, the external charging and data puck may include a first optical data transfer module #112 and a puck optical window #114.   The first optical data transfer module may be configured to emit and/or detect optical signals, such as light emitted at various frequencies, for sending and/or receiving data to electronic devices, such as an iPhone.   In embodiments, the first optical data transfer module may be configured to emit and/or detect columnated light, focusing light, or dispersing light. The light may exit from and enter into external charging and the data puck through puck optical window #114.   In embodiments, the puck optical window is transparent to the emitted light such that the puck optical window doesn't adversely affect the intensity of the emitted light. For instance, the puck optical window may be formed of a selectively transmissive material. The selectively transmissive material may be reflective of light in certain wavelengths while transparent to light in other wavelengths. As an example, the selectively transmissive material may be reflective of visual light and transparent to infrared (IR) and/or ultraviolet (UV) light. Thus, a user would not be able to see through the puck optical window, but optical signals could transmit through it.   In some embodiments, the puck optical window is an optically transparent material that includes a selectively transmissive coating. Similar to the selectively transmissive material, the selectively transmissive coating may be reflective of light in certain wavelengths while transparent to light in other wavelengths.   The selectively transmissive coating may be a deposited coating or a laminated coating. In some embodiments, the puck optical window is an optically transparent window that is transparent to visual, IR, and ultraviolet light. In embodiments, the emitted light is ultraviolet light. However, one skilled in the art understands that light having any suitable wavelengths can be emitted as an optical signal.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.Other wireless patents from Apple could be reviewed here.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 09:33 30 Mar 2017 Samsung has tried to knock Apple from its leading position in the smartphone market with the launch of its Galaxy S8 device. Samsung and Apple continue to compete for smartphone market share Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will need to step up its game when it launches the iPhone8 later this year to avoid losing its top spot in the smartphone market to Samsung. Samsung tried to raise the bar with the unveiling of its Galaxy S8 phone yesterday, promoting the device as the biggest revolution in mobiles since the iPhone. The company hopes to redeem itself after having to recall its Galaxy Note 7 devices last year after a battery fault led to some catching fire.   A standout feature of the S8 is the 5.8-inch curved display with a 83.6% screen-to-body ratio, compared to 72% for the S7 and 65.5% for the iPhone7. In order to fit the massive screen, Samsung has ditched the physical home button found in the phone’s predecessors.  The standard S8 will cost about US$750 and the larger S8 Plus will be about US$850 - both around US$100 more than comparable iPhones and rival Android phones. Another big change is the addition of another key on the phone, which takes you to the Bixby assistant. With the Bixby assistant, users can take photos and it will recognise the place and provide information about the image. Apple is rumoured to be working on introducing something similar. The new iPhone may reportedly feature augmented reality (AR) technology, including the ability to view additional information about an item or place by using the camera on the phone's screen.  Like Samsung, Apple is expected to remove the home button on the iPhone8. It may also feature wireless charging and an organic light-emitting diode screen, rather than the traditional LCD.  Race to the top... Apple is currently the bestselling smartphone manufacturer with 18.3% market share and 78.3mln shipments in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the latest data from market research firm IDC. Samsung came in second place with 18.1% market share and 77.5mln shipments in the quarter. “While Samsung is bursting out of the box in pushing the limits of screen real estate, its voyage into the increasingly crucial user experience shows that it remains boxed in by smarter and better alternatives,” said Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research. Windsor added: “Most importantly this device is also the first real test that Samsung has had since the Note 7 disaster, which is why the S8 needs to sell very well, confounding the big fall in trust that Samsung has suffered over the last six months. “Samsung has produced the device that it needs to cement its recovery but now it comes down to consumers, a number of whom have already switched to iOS. “   Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Renae Dyer Register here to be notified of future AAPL Company articles View full AAPL profile Apple Timeline Article March 21 2017 Apple Inc launches cheaper iPad and red iPhone 7 as market speculates on iPhone 8 Article February 22 2017 Morgan Stanley upbeat on Apple, calls China sales concerns "mis-guided" Article February 14 2017 Apple to see spike in sales on release of next iPhone, says Goldman Newswire February 02 2017 Apple raises debt fund ceiling to $10bn Article February 01 2017 Strong iPhone sales help Apple's first-quarter results beat forecasts, but some caution on outlook Article January 12 2017 Apple goes to Hollywood?

The company predicts that Android users will spend $41 billion on apps and subscriptions in 2017 while Apple iOS users will spend $40 billion. In 2016 iOS users spent $34 billion on apps and subscriptions via the App Store compared to the $27 million that Android users spent. The report predicts a massive uptick in sales and subscriptions for both stores in 2017 compared to the previous year. App Annie says that Apple will still have the most dominant single app store. The reason for that is that while Google Play is the official app store for Android users, there are other places where Android users can purchase apps that will get some of that money whereas if an iOS user wants an app, the Apple App Store is the only place to get it. The big reason that Android app sales are expected to finally outpace iOS purchases is because Android devices vastly outnumber iOS devices to the tune of 5-to-1 globally. App Annie expects that Apple will maintain the most profitable single app store for at least the next five years. Apple’s decision to have such a closed ecosystem for the iPhone and other iOS devices has paid off with iOS holding only 17.7% of the smartphone market compared to the 80% of the market Android holds, yet Apple still makes more money off its app ecosystem than Android does. App Annie reports that in 2016 Apple users downloaded 29 billion apps compared to 118 billion Android downloads. Some of this is said to be the comparatively affluent Apple user base compared to Android users. MarketWatch reports that Google is looking to expand availability for its Google Play store by bringing it to the Chromebook line of cheap laptops and the Daydream VR platform in the future.

No one guessed Apple's next product Rex Moore, for The Motley Fool 9:02 a.m. ET March 30, 2017 Strange noises roar out of a mysterious Apple facility late at night. Apple officials have refused to comment publicly… (Photo: The Motley Fool) 20 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Think about how many amazing technologies you've watched soar to new heights while you kick yourself thinking, "I knew about that before everyone was talking about it, but I just sat on my hands.” If you’re like me, you can’t help thinking about the money you could have made if you’d simply bought Apple when it introduced the iPod in 2001. The stock is up over 100 times since then, turning a $10,000 investment into over $1 million! Heck, Apple is up nearly 1,052% since it launched the iPhone seven years later. 270% since the iPad in 2010. Did you know how great and amazing these new technologies were, but failed to invest behind them? You might be retired and lounging on a beautiful beach somewhere if you had! <!--iframe--> Well, it appears Apple is up to something again, but this time it’s so radically different from its previous “iDevices" that you’ll be… stunned. You’ll wonder if it could really work. You’ll wonder if management has lost its mind. But remember… that’s what many people thought after Steve Jobs introduced the iPod and iPhone! Big profits come from making bold choices. What exactly is Apple doing? Well, residents of Sunnydale are reporting strange noises roaring out of a mysterious Apple facility late at night. And Apple leased an enormous, 5,000-acre, abandoned military base to serve as testing grounds according to TechInsider. We know that it must be something BIG because the company's R&D budget skyrocketed to more than 50 times as much money as Apple spent to develop the original iPhone! Here’s what we know... Apple just made a $10 billion play to get in early. Cisco believes it will be a $19 trillion market before 2025. General Electric sees an opportunity bigger than the entire economy of China! I saw Amazon received a patent for a piece of it just a few days ago. Can Apple really pull this moonshot off? With a track record like Apple has, I wouldn't be surprised.

So remember how we said this was similar to the first Air? We were serious—take a look inside the Air 1 and iPad 5 respectively. Not much has changed. The company did find a few changes – but also cast some doubt on Apple’s claim that this model offers a brighter display … NordVPN Externally, iFixit noted that three differences: the lack of a mechanical lock switch, smaller microphone holes and a single row of speaker holes. Inside, the biggest difference was of course the addition of the Touch ID sensor and associated hardware. Thumbs up for fingerprint reading. Thumbs down for a harder repair, since the sensor is uniquely paired to its logic board at the factory. At least this lovely button is still a button (unlike the solid-state un-button that debuted on 7-series iPhones). And that screen brightness claim? In Apple’s press release announcing the iPad 5, they told us it comes equipped with a “brighter 9.7-inch Retina display.” Our question is: brighter than what? It doesn’t look that different from the Air 1’s display. If they mean brighter than the Air 2, then that may simply be due to reverting to the unfused display design of the Air 1. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment on this. We noted that the new iPad is a little thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 – if this bothers you, you can pick up a discounted iPad Air 2 on Amazon for around $400.

Caution: Apple-guessing is inexact. Not everything will happen -- there isn’t even time for it all in one keynote. Do you know the way to San Jose? Apple opened its lottery for WWDC 2017 tickets this week. We know the event is moving back to its original home in San Jose this year, just up the road from Apple’s new “spaceship” HQ.  Apple uses the event to teach developers how to build the software for its future platform and product iterations, so every Apple watcher is going to want a ticket to the keynote. Not only this, but they’ll want to take a look at Apple’s new HQ, which opens in summer. Apple ran developer events between 1989 to 2003 in San Jose. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Super powers The true 64-bit operating system, iOS 11 marks the end of days for 32-bit apps on iOS. The OS will also be built natively atop Apple’s new APFS filing system and designed to run seamlessly on Apple’s A11-series processors. This means you can expect significant performance gains in the OS, opening Apple’s mobile platforms up to a much wider range of professional apps and features. There had been claims Apple intended putting a social networking app for video inside iOS 11. Such claims seem weak now Apple has announced Clips, a video app that makes clips for social networks and ships in April. However, I think we’ll see the potential of these powerful chips unleashed in far more interesting ways: Siri gets machine intelligent The first voice assistant to appear in a mass market product, Siri gets a lot of criticism. Apple’s been working hard to address this, and is making no secret of its plan to put even more machine intelligence inside of its platforms. We should see Siri integration in iCloud, Messages, and (more interesting) a move to apply machine learning and contextual intelligence (such as nested queries) in the AI as the company seeks to combat Samsung’s Bixby. And we’ll also see a more natural-sounding Siri as the company applies technologies acquired with VocalIQ. Workflow Apple’s decision to purchase Workflow and to keep the app available as a product on the App Store speaks volumes: It suggests the company already has development of the software on the fast track, and WWDC 2017 should be a first chance to see what the team behind the app can achieve now they will be equipped with the deepest possible access to iOS technologies, particularly when it comes to automating and activating complex actions using Siri. Health Apple’s digital health teams are not wasting time. Expect new tools for shareable health records, more application of sensor-gathered intelligence in existing and future apps, more capacity to figure out your health and fitness levels and improved ways to share such data with medical professionals. Message It’s nice to use emoji in Messages, but it’s still a bit “meh” when people we send them to can’t see them. Will Apple introduce versions for other platforms, opening up a whole new set of retail opportunities for Messages developers if it does? If that is the plan, then a WWDC 2017 announcement makes sense. AR If Apple plans to build an AR platform, then it’s going to need to empower developers with tools they need to build for it. It wants them to deliver powerful and effective solutions, sold through the App Stores, and with the company grabbing its slice of the pie. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has noted these plans frequently in the last few months, making it more likely the firm is accelerating introduction of the tech. A new technology, new processors, and a new AR platform? That $1,000 iPhone Pro looks like it’s going to be a pretty good business after all. Apple Watch watchOS 4 will be upon us. What can we predict? Not a great deal, really, other than noting that if Apple pops an integrated LTE SIM inside the device, then this will become the world’s first truly smart smartwatch. There has been speculation of a sleep tracker and watchface stores. And just how does Apple intend making AirPods even more effective Siri clients? tvOS11 Will Apple at last introduce 4K support? Will it use the keynote speech as a chance to screen the first episode of Planet of the Apps? If it does, will it take a chance to introduce new Apple Music enhancements, including a potential Apple Video service designed to mitigate an anticipated decline in iTunes video sales? What about some form of limited iCloud file browser, so you can read your documents on the TV if you so choose? Will Apple Music introduce a smarter AI for recommendations? Will Apple introduce its own range of HomeKit accessories, potentially including an Amazon Echo competitor? I think it’s unlikely we’ll learn answers to all those questions at the event, but developers will need some insight into how these changes will impact their work in the year ahead. macOS 11? One thing we can predict is that the new macOS will also migrate the platform to Apple’s new APFS file system. Otherwise, it all seems to be about 11: iOS 11, macOS 11, tvOS 11, and A11… Will Apple make anything of this? Hardware WWDC is seldom a hardware show. However, it is interesting to note Apple’s move to regain control of the PowerBook patent scant weeks after this other patent was spotted.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 Apple Watch Series 3 Rumors Suggest Cellular Chip And USB-C Charging Posted: Mar 30 2017, 5:55am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Rumors suggest a hybrid Lightning/USB-C charger port The current Apple Watch is the Series 2 and wearable fans are wondering what 2017 might hold in store for the Apple smartwatch. Presumably the new generation of wearable from Cupertino will be called the Apple Watch Series 3 and there are a few rumors floating around that hint at what might come on the new device. Rumors suggest that the next Apple Watch will keep the same basic design as the current models. This is good news since that will likely mean that the same accessories will work. Don't Miss: Win a FREE Nintendo Switch in our Giveaway One rumor suggests that the Apple Watch Series 3 might get a glass-film touchscreen. Current Apple Watch Series 2 models use a touch-on-lens screen. The problem with the current screen is that the company building them for Apple, TPK Holdings, won't make them for future models due to low yield rates. Replacing TPK will be either General Interface Solution or Biel Crystal Manufactory for the glass-film solution reports AppAdvice. It's unclear if there will be any end-user benefits to changing the screen tech at this time. The only real improvements for Apple Watch fans for Series 3 are likely to be longer runtime from better power management and possibly increased battery size. Overall performance improvements are expected as well. Series 3 wearables are expected to be made by Quanta, the same company that has made the past two generations of the Apple Wearable. Another place where power savings for the next Apple Watch could come from is a new Micro LED display tech. This screen tech was acquired by Apple back in 2014 with the purchase of LuxVue Technology. This screen tech has better brightness levels and better color gamut. It's also more power efficient because no backlight is needed with the tech. Another cool rumor suggests that new watch bands could be available for the next generation that have icons that glow for specific activities taking place. One interesting Series 3 rumor suggests that Apple might add cellular connection to the next Apple Watch. That would mean the ability to connect and perform functions without needing to have your iPhone with you. This is great for active people who like to wear their watch, but not take a smartphone with them during workouts. Barron's reports that Susquehanna Financial Group analyst for semiconductors Christopher Rolland has offered up a new investor note that talks about what he thinks will happen with the Apple Watch. Rolland says that he has heard that the next Apple Watch will have its own cellular chip inside. This rumor has made rounds before, but this rumor is notable because Rolland follows major chipmakers Broadcom and Qualcomm, both firms sell components to Apple. The source of Roland's rumor comes from unnamed sources in the supply chain. Rolland wrote in his note to investors, "We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company’s AirPods (now on back order till May) to make and receive phone calls (perhaps a small win for Maxim with amps in each ear bud). Positive QCOM, MXIM." Operability with AirPods is important, there will be no headphone jack and if you need Air Pods to make phone calls with the Apple Watch, that means it may have no microphone of its own. Another Apple Watch Series 3 rumor that has surfaced claims that the wearable might get a reversible USB-C port for charging. It won't be strictly a USB-C port though, 9to5Mac claims that the Apple Watch Series 3 will have a hybrid Lightning/USB-c port on board. Word also suggests that the LTE chip inside the watch will be a low-power CAT-M1 unit supporting LTE and VOIP while helping to mitigate battery concerns. This story may contain affiliate links.

The new update brings features and improvements such as enhanced SiriKit support, a new Find My AirPods feature, a new file system, CarPlay updates and more. Like every other OS software update, some people would like it and some people might want to revert to the earlier version of their devices’ software. If you are one of them, the important thing to know is that there is a small window of about a week starting Friday in which you can do so, according to TechTimes.  Read: Apple Retracts iOS 10.3 From iPhone 5,5C After Problems The window to revert to an earlier version of Apple’s software usually ends after a short duration of time post the launch of a new and then you are basically stuck on whatever software version you are on. You can check whether iOS 10.2.1 is available on your device by clicking on this link. Before downgrading, it is advisable to back all your files and content stored on the device, because the process would wipe your device clean. You can do so using either iTunes or iCloud. Here are the steps you need to follow to downgrade: Download the iOS 10.2.1 IPSW file after checking your device model from this link. A warning here — unless you download the correct firmware for your device, it will not work. In case you are using Safari to download the firmware, you will need to make sure that auto-unzip is disabled. You can also download the file on Firefox or Chrome app on your device and rename the app .ipsw instead of .zip. Start iTunes on your iOS device and connect it to a PC via USB cable. If the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device, navigate to Settings>iCloud>Find My iPhone and disable it. On  the iTunes app on your device, select your device and click ‘Restore iPhone’ while holing the option key on Mac/ Shift key on Windows PC at the same time. A pop-up window should appear on your iOS device.  In the pop-up window, select the iOS 10.2.1 IPSW firmware file and click ‘Restore and update.’ An agreement regarding iOS 10.2.1 installation will emerge. Click ‘Next’, then click ‘Agree’. Read: Apple Lets Developers Respond To App Reviews in iOS 10.3 Wait for a few minutes and you will see a “Hello” screen on your device, which will indicate that you have performed the downgrade. Just follow the instructions to set up your device. Restore your device from the back up you saved earlier and you are good to go.  Related Stories Android To Surpass iOS In App Spending in 2017, Says Report How To Change The Icon For Apps On iOS 10.3 Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

(Goran Kosanovic/For The Washington Post) I typically think of salad with chicken as a workhorse of the healthful culinary world. It reliably gets the job done and can be good, but it is rarely memorable or inspiring. Truthfully, it can be a boring fallback. I suppose I should have had higher expectations when I ordered one at Fume in Napa Valley several months ago. The place was recommended by a culinary-pro local friend, and I was in a mecca of good food and wine. Still, I was taken aback by just how compelling that salad was and how much it stood out from the same-old, same-old. The thought of it stuck in my mind so long I just had to come up with my own version to share with you. [Make the recipe: Green Salad With Chicken, Apple and Maple Walnuts in Buttermilk Dressing] What makes this salad so special is its variety of tastes, colors and textures which makes each forkful a bit different, so eating it feels like a constant discovery. There are two kinds of lettuce — tender Bibb and crisp romaine — crunchy nuts coated in a maple glaze, sweet chunks of red apple, cool bites of celery, the snap of blanched green beans and chewy dried cherries. Rather than the usual cubes of grilled breast, there are tender pieces of chicken torn from half a roasted bird. All the ingredients are coated in a lightly creamy, tangy buttermilk dressing seasoned with fresh dill and scallion. This salad might take a bit more effort than adding cooked poultry to pre-washed greens and calling it a day. But most of the elements can be made ahead and you can use a store-bought rotisserie chicken, so the salad still comes together fairly easy, and you will be rewarded in pure delight. food@washpost.com Scale, print and rate the recipe in our Recipe Finder: Green Salad With Chicken, Apple and Maple Walnuts in Buttermilk Dressing 4 servings MAKE AHEAD: The dressing can be refrigerated up to 1 day in advance. Dress the salad just before serving. From nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger. Ingredients For the dressing ½ cup buttermilk, well shaken (not low-fat) 3 tablespoons regular or low-fat mayonnaise 1 ½ teaspoons lemon zest and 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 lemon) 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard ½ teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 scallion, trimmed and thinly sliced (white and green parts) 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh dill For the salad ½ cup walnut pieces 1 ½ tablespoons pure maple syrup Pinch salt 4 ounces thin green beans (haricots verts), trimmed 1 head Bibb or Boston lettuce, cored and torn into bite-size pieces 1 small head romaine lettuce, cored and torn into bite-size pieces 2 cups torn cooked chicken (from ½ medium roasted chicken; 8 ounces total) 2 ribs celery, cut into bite-size pieces 1 small red apple (unpeeled), cut into bite-size pieces 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped dried cherries, preferably unsweetened Steps Whisk together the buttermilk, mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, the mustard, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended, then whisk in the scallion and dill. The yield is ¾ cup. Combine the walnuts, maple syrup and salt in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until the liquid has evaporated and the walnuts are glazed and lightly toasted. Transfer to a plate to cool. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Fill a large bowl with cool water and ice cubes. Add the green beans to the boiling water; cook/blanch them for about 2 minutes, until crisp-tender and bright green, then use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer them to the ice-water bath (to stop their cooking). Once they have cooled, pat them dry and cut into 1½ -inch pieces. Just before serving, combine the lettuce, chicken, celery, apple, dried cherries, walnuts and green beans in a large bowl. Drizzle with the dressing and toss gently to coat.

Apple Inc will be ready to start asembling high-end iPhones in the city in less than a month to boost its chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market,Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said on Thursday. “In less than a month, we will have something out — Apple will start assembling and making its high-end iPhones at its plant in the city. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp will help Apple in doing so,” he told PTI. “Assembling and making of iPhones in Bengaluru will boost Apple’s chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market because it will allow the company to lower prices,” he said. Karnataka government has been in talks with the Centre for strengthening the ecosystem even as Apple is negotiating with it for its next level of production in India, he said. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However the Indian government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Mr. Kharge said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players, including Samsung and Lenova, if they are desirous of opening a manufacturing units in India, especially Karnataka. “My position with the central government has been don’t give special treatment to Apple alone, but treat other players equally. Open the entire eco-system for high-end manufacturing of electoronics if you really want to compete with China and Taiwan,” he said. Mr. Kharge said government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field for them. Asked about the Stayzilla case, whose co-founder Yogendra Vasupal was arrested for alleged non-payment of dues filed by a Chennai based advertisement agency, Mr. Kharge said it should be a learning curve for startups to work under the parameters of the Indian legal system.

While the previous leaks hinted that the much-anticipated iPhone could feature curved OLED display and a bottom bezel sans Touch ID, a latest concept photo shared by iDrops hints that the next iPhone may be a Galaxy S8 lookalike. The website has released a mock-up photo based on the prototype shared by an insider. The phone looks similar to the Galaxy S8 in terms of the design. Similar to S8, the phone in photo is seen without home button, making the screen look large with very thin bezels on all four sides. Also the edges are slightly-curved. Fingerprint sensor is seen at the back of the phone, positioned below the Apple logo, again similar to what we see in Galaxy S8. In our earlier iPhone 8 leak report, we had stated three possible scenarios for the placement of fingerprint sensor -- that it may be moved to the back, placed beneath the display or removed altogether. The next noticeable change that the concept photo hints at is the alignment of the dual rear cameras. The rear camera is seen positioned vertically, contrary to what we see in iPhone 7. The report also states that iPhone 8 will have a metal-back for extra durability. Previous rumours had hinted of a glass-back for iPhone 8. The leaker has also hinted that Apple will use 2.5D OLED edge-to-edge display in the upcoming iPhone. Also Read: How Samsung beat Apple in the race for innovation with Galaxy S8, S8+ Reportedly, Apple is also known to be working on facial recognition technology for the iPhone and that it may kill  the traditional home button. This again is similar to what we see in Galaxy S8. Samsung has removed the home button from both Galaxy S8 and S8+. Last year in December, Forbes reported that Apple has filed an application with the Chinese intellectual property office for a patent that describes support for dual-SIM card feature in a phone. The phone is rumoured to house A11 processor and support wireless charging. The next iPhone is also expected to  be water and dust proof, similar to the iPhone 7.

Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple revealing their third invention relating to hand gesturing for Apple Watch covering the 'Hand Clench' and 'Hand Flap' gestures. Apple's filing describes the science behind the gesturing methodology but never reveals what any particular gesture will actually perform. That will only be revealed if and when Apple launches gesturing capabilities for the Apple Watch in the future.   Apple notes that some existing portable electronic devices accept voice or touch input to control functionality of the devices. For example, a voice command system can map specific verbal commands to operations such as initiating a voice call with a particular contact in response to speaking the contact's name. In another example, a touch input system can map specific touch gestures to operations such as zooming out in response to a pinch gesture on a touch sensitive surface. However, there may be situations where the user's ability to speak a verbal command or perform a touch gesture may be limited.   Therefore Apple's invention introduces yet more hand gesturing combinations that could be recognized by an Apple Watch that has multiple photodiodes at the bottom of the watch, each sensing light at a different position on a surface of the device that faces skin of a user. Due to this positioning, the sensor data from the photodiodes can capture movement of anatomical features in the tissue of the user during a hand gesture.   Further, different light emitters on the device can emit light at different wavelengths (e.g., infrared light, green light, etc.), which penetrate to different depths in the tissue of the user before reflecting back to the photodiodes on the device. Accordingly, sensor data from the photodiodes can capture expansion and contraction in the tissue of the user during a hand gesture. Examples of the disclosure detect hand gestures by recognizing patterns in sensor data that are characteristic of each hand gesture, as the tissue expands and contracts and anatomical features in the tissue move during the gesture.   As illustrated in Apple's patent FIG. 1B above, each photodiode #101 can sense light at a different position on a surface of the device 100 that faces the tissue #200 of a user. Due to this positioning, the sensor data from the photodiodes can capture movement of anatomical features in the tissue of the user during a hand gesture.   Further, as illustrated in FIG. 1C, different light emitters #105 on the device (Apple Watch) can emit light at different wavelengths (e.g., infrared light #600, green light #602, etc.), which penetrate to different depths in the tissue of the user before reflecting back to the photodiodes on the device. Accordingly, sensor data from the photodiodes can capture expansion and contraction in the tissue of the user during a hand gesture.   In some examples, a hand can perform a hand clench or hand flap gesture as illustrated above. Variations of these gestures and other gestures could be trained.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q4 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Which smartphone is better? by Sean Keach 19 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Apple and Samsung are facing off once again, but which mobile titan has built the better phone this time around? We compare the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 design, specs and price to help you decide how to spend your money. When Apple launched the iPhone 7 last year, we weren't overly impressed. While the build quality and features seemed decent enough, battery life hampered the experience enough to warrant a 3.5/5 overall score. Still, the iPhone 7 remains one of the UK's most popular smartphones, and it'll be top of the list for many looking to upgrade. Enter the Galaxy S8, Samsung's latest flagship and the iPhone's chief Android rival. Samsung has kitted its new phone with the latest and greatest mobile components, so we've got high hopes that'll impress us in our full review. Until then, we can't make a definitive call on whether the Galaxy S8 is better than the iPhone 7, but we can still detail all the key differences between the phone. Read on for a complete guide on how the Samsung Galaxy S8 stacks up against the iPhone 7. If you can’t be bothered to read the full article, we’ve included a short summary of what you need to know about the bottom of this page. Related: Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S8+ Related: Best Android phones Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7 Design: What’s the difference? It’s easy to claim that smartphones all look the same these days, but the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 are world’s apart when it comes to design. Apple hasn’t made any significant changes to the iPhone since the introduce of the iPhone 6 back in 2014. It’s still a slim (7.1mm), lightweight (138g) and mostly flat handset, with the exception of a small camera bump. iPhone 7 By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is thicker at 8mm, heavier at 155g, and boasts a curvy ‘Edge’-style screen that wraps around the sides of the phone. So it certainly feels more hefty in the hand, which will suit some more than others. But the main difference is Samsung’s ‘Infinity Display’, which is marketing jargon for a screen that occupies nearly the entire face of the phone. Compared to the iPhone's lowly 65.6% screen-to-body ratio, most of the Galaxy S8’s front is display. This was made possible by shifting the fingerprint scanner to the back and jacking up the size of the display panel to 5.8 inches (from a previous 5.1 inches). As a result, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a much bigger screen than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. The good news is the dimensions haven’t changed significantly from generation to generation with the Samsung flagship, so the Galaxy S8 measures a still-manageable 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm, compared to the iPhone 7 at 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm. Samsung Galaxy S8 Both phones are waterproof, although the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a better IP68 waterproof certification. This means it’s been tested at depths of 1.5 metres for 30 minutes. By contrast, the iPhone 7 is IP67-certified, which means it survived a more shallow one-metre dunk for 30 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is available in, black, silver, and blue colour options, while the iPhone 7 is available in Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and, most recently, (RED). Here’s our Mobile Editor Max Parker’s take on the design: "I like the iPhone 7; it's slick and familiar. But after holding the S8 it feels like a relic. The overly big bezel is ugly and the screen feels crammed in its body. The iPhone 8 needs a drastic redesign to really offer Samsung some competition." Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7 specs: Which phone is more powerful? Until we’ve fully tested the Samsung Galaxy S8, we can’t give a definitive opinion on whether or not it’s more powerful than the iPhone 7. But we can still look at the raw hardware and see how the specs stack up. For a start, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch display (or 6.2-inches with the Galaxy S8+). It uses a quirky 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which means you’ll get a seriously widescreen image. You’ll also benefit from a fairly generous QHD+ screen – that’s 2960 x 1440 pixels, giving you an overall pixel density of 567ppi. Samsung Galaxy S8 on O2 (3GB) – £125 upfront, £35/month iPhone 7 By comparison, the iPhone 7 has a much smaller 4.7-inch display with a less impressive 750 x 1334 pixels, which works out at a pixel density of just 326ppi. That means the Galaxy S8 has a significantly sharper display, which means it should be sharper and more detailed. Add that to the fact that Samsung's Galaxy S8 is using an AMOLED panel, which should have richer colours and better contrast than the LED-backlit LCD screen on the iPhone 7, and we’d expect that the Galaxy S8 screen will be far more impressive than the iPhone 7. As far as computing heft goes, it’s impossible to say at this point. The iPhone 7 uses Apple’s custom-built A10 Fusion chip, which we’ve found to be sufficiently powerful to run iOS 10 smoothly. Samsung, meanwhile, has opted for different chips in different markets: you’ll either get Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 or Samsung’s custom-built Exynos 8895 chip. In any case, both chips are built using a new 10nm manufacturing process. This means that the chips should – theoretically – be more powerful and less power-hungry than the Apple A10 chip, which is built using a much older and less efficient 16nm process. Of course, real-world performance will come down to many factors, including how well-optimised the relevant software and chips are. Samsung Galaxy S8 It’s also too early for us to say whether Samsung will beat Apple on photography. The iPhone 7 has proved itself more than capable with a 12-megapixel camera that boasts a wide f/1.8 aperture and built-in optical image stabilisation (OIS). But Samsung’s Galaxy S8 also features a 12-megapixel shooter with OIS, and an even wider f1/.7 aperture, which means more light can reach the phone’s image sensor – that’s a good thing. The iPhone 7’s front-facing camera turns out 7-megapixel shots, and has a respectable f/2.2 aperture. But Samsung appears to trump Apple on hardware again, offering higher resolution (8MP) selfies, and an exceptionally wide f/1.7 aperture. Still, there are plenty of factors that affect how good a photograph looks, so we’ll need to do a proper review to find the truth. While the iPhone 7 may boast waterproofing and a fingerprint scanner, Samsung wins for features. The Galaxy S8 is waterproof and has a fingerprint scanner too, but unlike the iPhone 7, it can be wirelessly charged, unlocked using an iris scanner, and still has a 3.5mm headphone jack too. Better still, base storage starts at 64GB (compared to Apple’s 32GB), and there’s a Micro SD card slot to boot. iPhone 7 We’ll have to wait to properly measure the Galaxy S8’s battery life, but we were very unimpressed by the iPhone 7’s usage-per-charge. That’s likely thanks to the teeny 1,960mAh battery, which is a fair whack smaller than the 3,000mAh cell inside the Galaxy S8. We’re hoping that Samsung’s new flagship can match the Galaxy S7 in offering well over a day’s usage per charge.

The iPhone 7 saw Apple kick up the price of its smartphones, with the new handset retailing at a lofty £599 – much higher than the £529 iPhone 6S. Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will start from £689, which is far higher than Apple's iPhone 7 – though the rumoured iPhone 8 may match that pricing. Samsung Galaxy S8 on O2 (3GB) – £125 upfront, £35/month Samsung Galaxy S8 on Vodafone (24GB) – £160 upfront, £37/month Given the Samsung Galaxy S8 appears to be a better phone on paper, some Android fans may view that higher pricing as justified. But if you're a die-hard Apple fan, shelling out such a significant amount more may not be appealing. Related: Best smartphone Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7 Summary: What’s the difference? Here’s a short breakdown of the key differences between the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Apple’s iPhone 7. Design: The iPhone 7 is a classic Apple smartphone, and retains a relatively small body, flat screen, and minimalist design. Samsung has thrown caution to the wind, showing off an all-screen front, a curvy 'Edge'-style display, and near-invisible bezels. That's why the Galaxy S8 probably wins out in design. Specs: On paper, the Samsung Galaxy S8 appears to have the edge in terms of hardware, boasting a more advanced processor, as well as better specs and features all round. But Apple is known for its slick optimisation, so we'll have to fully review the Galaxy S8 before we can make a call here. Price: Samsung says the Galaxy S8 will start from £689, while the Galaxy S8+ costs an even higher £779. Value: The Samsung Galaxy S8 is far more expensive than the iPhone 7, but it seems – on paper, at least – to be the more attractive handset, both in terms of design and specs.

Taking the ‘Make in India’ route the company is finally moving closer to iPhone assembly in India. By: FE Online | Updated: March 30, 2017 5:31 PM Earlier in February also, the Karnataka government had issued a press release notifying about Apple’s plans to make iPhones in India. (Reuters) Apple is officially going to make its iPhones in India, in the city of Bengaluru from April. Taking the ‘Make in India’ route the company is finally moving closer to iPhone assembly in India. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told PTI that the Cupertino giant will be ready to begin assembling iPhones in Bengaluru in less than a month, with an aim to increase its foothold in the fast developing Indian smartphone market. Earlier in February also, the state government had issued a press release notifying about the plans. According to the statement, the government welcomed a proposal from Apple to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. Today, Kharge told PTI, “In less than a month, we will have something out – Apple will start assembling and making its high-end iPhones at its plant in the city. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp will help Apple in doing so.” According to the minister, making iPhones in the country will automatically lower the prices which will help the company gain a foothold in the country. He added, “Assembling and making of iPhones in Bengaluru will boost Apple’s chances of gaining a foothold in the fast-growing Indian market because it will allow the company to lower prices.” Also read | Made in India Apple iPhones, iPads & Macs coming soon: report You may also like to watch: Earlier in December, the first reports started coming in about Apple’s plans in India. The Wall Street Journal had reported that according to two senior government officials this plan of Apple to make iPhones in India may soon be successful. The report had cited sources who informed that there was a letter given by Apple to the Indian government and later senior trade ministry authorities had a meeting with the company officials. WSJ quoted a government official as saying, that Apple wants financial incentives to manufacture products in India. Recently, according to a report, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) had endorsed the revenue department stance that Apple’s demand for an import duty exemption for certain components for making iPhones in India can’t be met.

Open the entire eco-system for high-end manufacturing of electronics if you really want to compete with China and Taiwan.” He suggested that the government should also give companies, including Apple, particular timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a common field for them. You may also like to watch: Although the Karnataka government had announced that Apple would set up a manufacturing unit near Bengaluru, sources had earlier told FE that the iPhone maker plans to set up only a ‘pilot project’ there (to produce around 3-5 lakh phones), and the extent of manufacturing in India hinges on the kind of concessions the central government is willing to offer to the tech giant.

Cook had said that there was a rise in revenues in India. The Cupertino giant currently sells its devices through Indian distribution companies and retailers, the WSJ report had said. The assembling of iPhones is done mainly by Foxconn Tech Group in China. However, other big rivals like Samsung and even China’s Xiaomi have been assembling in India for some time. Also read | Now, MeitY shoots down Apple’s demand for duty waivers to make iPhones in India This move will give a big boost in the sales of its devices, especially iPhones which still have not made much of a mark in a big smartphone market like India. The company had also in January reportedly sought permission from the government to open its stores. In June, PM Modi-led government eased the FDI restrictions in many sectors, where it said that single brand retailers like Apple are allowed to open stores but they have to purchase a minimum of 30 percent of manufacturing materials from vendors in India after a period of three years which can be difficult of Apple as there are not many manufacturers in India.

Technology experts have expressed concern that the company is phasing out support for the devices. Man questioned after triple stabbing that killed boy, 13 and his mum in their own home Zeph McLearan started the concern when he saw that the new iOS 10.3.2 beta which was unveiled this week lacks a 32-bit device. It could have a huge impact on users. The iOS is the operating system that the phone runs on and it is periodically updated. The latest update was rolled out this week. The iPhone 5 sold millions in it’s opening weekend (Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images) But more recent iPhone types run on a 64-bit processor as opposed to the 32-bit used by the 5, 5C and fourth generation of iPad. With a new update to the operating system that does not support 32-bit processors, fans are worried their phone will no longer be supported by Apple. Police search as third person in two days falls from Westminster Bridge ‘Apple continues its push toward an all 64-bit future and last year began warning iOS 10 users that 32-bit apps might negatively impact system performance. ‘More recently, users attempting to open 32-bit software in iOS 10.3 are met with the message, “This app will not work with future versions of iOS,” a clear indication that legacy apps are on their way out.’ wrote tech magazine Apple Insider. Because this is a beta update, which means it is still testing, Apple could choose to update it with support for 32-bit processors. Could Apple be developing a new update for the devices? (Picture: Joseph Branston/Digital Camera Magazine via Getty Images) Metro.co.uk understands that the company is building a separate update from the hugely popular devices. The iPhone 5 sold five million devices in it’s opening weekend. The largest update, iOS 11, is expected on June 5 at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple declined to comment.

It also had the highest score for ‘can’t live without this brand,’ with 59% of consumers ticking this box. Behind Apple in the top 10 were Disney, Amazon, Harley Davidson, Netflix, Nintendo, Samsung, Whole Foods, BMW and Toyota. MBLM, the company behind the survey, say that hard data proves the rankings aren’t just fluff … NordVPN The top ranked intimate brands continued to outperform the S&P and Fortune 500 indices in revenue and profit over the past 10 years […] “Our report once again reveals that the bonds created between a brand and a consumer deliver greater economic growth. Brand growth starts and ends with emotion and the quantity, quality and character of the bonds formed with customers,” stated Mario Natarelli, MBLM’s managing partner. The firm measured the number of overall positive feelings consumers had for each brand, and the extent to which they associated the brand with six factors. 1. Fulfilment Exceeds expectations, delivering superior service, quality, and efficacy. 2. Identity Reflects an aspirational image or admired values and beliefs that resonate deeply. 3. Enhancement Becoming better through use of the brand—smarter, more capable, and more connected. 4. Ritual Ingraining a brand into daily actions—more than habitual behavior. The brand becomes a vitally important part of daily existence. 5. Nostalgia Focuses on memories of the past and the warm, poignant feelings associated with them. These are often brands a customer has grown up with. 6. Indulgence Creates a close relationship centered around moments of pampering and gratification that can be either occasional or frequent. Half the respondents were in the USA, with the rest split between Mexico and United Arab Emirates. US participants were aged 18-64 with a household income of $35k plus.

Apple Inc will be ready to start asembling high-end iPhones in the city in less than a month to boost its chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market,Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said today. "In less than a month, we will have something out - Apple will start assembling and making its high-end iPhones at its plant in the city. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp will help Apple in doing so," he told PTI here. Kharge said making iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices, which will help it gain a foothold in the fast growing Indian market. "Assembling and making of iPhones in Bengaluru will boost Apple's chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market because it will allow the company to lower prices," he said. Karnataka government has been in talks with the Centre for strengthening the ecosystem even as Apple is negotiating with it for its next level of production in India, he said. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However the Indian government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players, including Samsung and Lenova, if they are desirous of opening a manufacturing units in India, especially Karnataka. "My position with the central government has been don't give special treatment to Apple alone, but treat other players equally. Open the entire eco-system for high-end manufacturing of electoronics if you really want to compete with China and Taiwan," he said. Kharge said government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field for them. "The government should give companies a timeline, say in 10 years they should be able to manufacture 100 per cent of phones and its components by procuring them from the local market. Such a timeline should be given because we don't have that environment now," he said. "The government should also give companies subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field for them to strengthen the Indian eco-system," Kharge said. Asked about the Stayzilla case, whose co-founder Yogendra Vasupal was arrested for alleged non-payment of dues filed by a Chennai based advertisement agency, Kharge said it should be a learning curve for startups to work under the parameters of the Indian legal system. Vasupal was arrested on March 15.

Should you buy it? Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains March 30, 2017 Can you see where the smart home starts? (Samsung) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains March 30, 2017 Quietly, Samsung may have just ushered in the era of the truly connected home. At a splashy event in New York on Wednesday (March 29), the company pulled the curtain back on Bixby, its new digital assistant that can understand contextual questions, and control internet-of-things devices. For now, it will only reside in its new Galaxy S8 smartphones, but in the future, the company confirmed that it plans to bring it to just about every electronic device it produces—something it explained to Quartz in detail at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. Samsung’s new router, the Connect Home. (Samsung) Another device Samsung unveiled was a wifi router, called the Samsung Connect Home. Looking exceedingly similar to other routers on the market that aim to blanket your home in internet connectivity, the Connect Home is also meant to act as a gatekeeper for all the internet-connected devices in your home. It can monitor the internet activity of any tablet, phone, or computer, but it also works as a go-between for IoT devices made by Samsung, Ring, Philips, Netgear, and other manufacturers, and you. Through Samsung’s new Bixby assistant, you can theoretically speak to your phone, and have your robot vacuum cleaner head out on its daily mission, or ask it to show you what the inside of your fridge looks like (did you remember to pick up milk yesterday?), and the Connect Home will be able to complete all these tasks for you, regardless of where you are. The S8 and S8+ will come in three colors in the US: Black, grey, and silver. (Samsung) It’s not a wildly new proposition—Apple’s Siri and Google’s Assistant both have some ability to send out commands to IoT devices. And millions bark orders at technology through Amazon’s Echo every day. But arguably no other company in the world has the scope that Samsung has. Samsung is one of the largest producers in the world of smartphones, televisions, and many of the white goods around the home. It makes fridges, ovens, washing machines, microwaves, air conditioners, and vacuums. It makes computers, tablets, laptops, stereos, and VR headsets. Right now, it sells versions of most of these that connect to the internet. Earlier this year, Samsung announced that it would soon only produce TVs that could connect to the internet. In Samsung’s vision of a perfect world, its consumers would use a Samsung phone to control their Samsung TV, run their laundry through Samsung machines, and cook dinner on Samsung appliances. While this may seem like a Samsung boardroom fantasy, but there’s some rationale to it. Millions of consumers have purchased iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods, and all sorts of other Cupertino-designed electronics and accessories because they’ve bought into Apple’s design ethos—or because they thought they’d be necessary companions for Apple’s computers, and the iPhone. These devices have locked consumers into Apple’s ecosystem. Samsung is pushing ahead on design, especially in mobile and televisions, arguably more than Apple is right now. It’s entirely possible that if consumers find utility in internet-connected versions of the stuff they’re always going to need (the fridge is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon), that they’ll see the benefit of buying into a single ecosystem where every device knows how to speak to each other. Samsung’s smart fridge. (Samsung) In the near future, Samsung envisions Bixby being available on all of its internet-connected products. You’ll be able to ask your washing machine to start the oven, or your fridge to turn on the air conditioner, because you’ll be talking to the same Bixby on any of these devices. While that’s an enticing idea in theory, where everything runs seamlessly, and Samsung can diversify its revenue away from smartphones and component sales, there are all sorts of issues that could hamper that reality. Samsung’s last major smartphone release before Wednesday, the Note 7, had to be recalled globally for catching fire, as a result of multiple production issues. A line of washing machines also had exploding issues late last year. Is consumer confidence in Samsung’s quality high enough right now for people to deck out their houses in its products? Even if they’re not exploding, are all these devices going to work as seamlessly as we’d hope? Owners of Google’s Nest thermostats have been left freezing because of software bugs. What happens when the same system is controlling every electronic device in the house? Will you not be able to cook dinner because your washing machine needs a firmware update? Samsung’s own attempts at operating systems (it relies on a modified version of Google’s Android for its mobile devices, Oculus’s setup for its VR devices, and its own Tizen system for smartwatches and TVs) have not always been met with positive reactions, but they seem to be getting better. However, more devices running on unified systems means more chances for headaches—the latest version of iOS doesn’t run nearly as well on an iPhone 5 from 2012 as it does on a brand-new iPad Pro, for example. Whether Samsung can actually pull off the first truly connected home remains to be seen, and may largely come down to how Bixby, the Galaxy S8, and Samsung Connect Home are received. But for now, Samsung seems content jamming processors and wifi radios into just about everything it produces.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Massive Glass Store under Construction on Magnificent Mile near Chicago's Waterfront is one of a Kind | Main | Apple adds more Distinct Hand Gesturing Features Designed to Work with Future Versions of Apple Watch » March 30, 2017 Apple Invents a Tactile UI that will deliver all-new Sensory Experiences to Next-Gen Devices and Displays   In the last quarter there have been two major patent applications covering next generation tactile sensations added to a surface of a device. One covered 'shear force' sensors that will provide users with a sense of rotational motion. Another patent covered delivering the feel of fabrics or textures to surfaces of a mobile device. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a major patent application from Apple relating to a new tactile user interface for mobile devices that's one of the most advanced to date. Apple aims to deliver next generation tactile and sensory experiences to touch so that when a user touches an image of a beach, touching the sand will produce a hot touch sensation or a wet sensation if they touch a pool of water. Apple's latest invention goes far beyond today's elementary haptics that deliver the sensation of buzzing or vibratiing alone.   Apple's patent application relates to user interfaces for electronic devices, and, more particularly, to input and output components that cooperate to provide a tactile user interface for an electronic device.   For example, an electronic device can operate a tactile user interface in an output mode to produce tactile output via a surface that may be touched by the user. When a user touches the surface and/or draws a finger across the surface, the user may perceive the surface to have characteristics or properties such as, but not limited to, warmness, coldness, smoothness, roughness, slipperiness, stickiness, wetness, dryness, and so on or any combination thereof. In addition, the user may perceive the surface to move, vibrate, shift, translate, depress, protrude, and so on or any combination thereof.   Accordingly, as used herein, the phrase "tactile output" broadly encompasses an output provided one or more components of a tactile user interface that stimulates a user's sense of touch and/or a user's perception related to the user's sense of touch including, but not necessarily limited to, a sense of surface temperature, a sense of surface topology, a sense of surface friction, a sense of numbness, a sense of mechanical pressure, a sense of mechanical distortion, a sense of motion, a sense of vibration, a sense of stickiness, a sense of slipperiness, a sense of attraction, and so on or any combination thereof.   For example, a low-friction tactile output and a low-temperature tactile output may be provided when an image of ice is shown on the display of the electronic device. The user perceives a slippery and cold surface when the user touches the ice image. In another example, a high-friction tactile output and a high-temperature tactile output may be provided when an image of beach sand is shown on the display. The user perceives a rough and hot surface when the user touches the beach sand image.   In other examples, the electronic device can provide a tactile output to virtual input regions shown on the display, such as a button, a key, a dial, and so on. In these examples, the electronic device can provide a first tactile output to an area of the surface within the virtual input region and a second tactile output to an area of the surface adjacent to the virtual input region (e.g., border or perimeter around the virtual input region). The different tactile outputs may define a boundary or perimeter of the virtual input region that can be felt by a user. In other cases, the electronic device can provide a tactile output so that the user can perceive a key or a symbol on the virtual input region (e.g., embossment).   Apple further notes that a tactile user interface is typically operated relative to an external surface of an electronic device that may be touched by a user. For example, a tactile user interface may be operated relative to a touch-sensitive display of an electronic device. In another example, a tactile user interface may be operated relative to a back or side surface of an electronic device housing (see patent figure below dating back to 2006). In yet another example, a tactile user interface may be operated relative to an external surface of an input component in communication with an electronic device such as, but not limited to, a button, a sliding switch, a stylus, a knob, a crown, an inertial movement tracking device, and so on.   Generally and broadly, Apple's patent FIGS. 1A and 1B depict an electronic device/iPad that incorporates a tactile user interface. The tactile user interface can be operated in an input mode, an output mode, or a combined mode. In the combined mode, the tactile user interface operates in both an input mode and an output mode simultaneously, or rapidly switches between an input mode and an output mode (e.g., time multiplexing).   In one embodiment, the individually-addressable segment #106 includes a thermal transducer configured, in an output mode, to increase or decrease the temperature of the outer protective layer of the electronic device. The thermal transducer can be implemented as a Peltier element, a resistive element, or any other suitable element configured to change temperature in response to an electronic signal. In some cases, the thermal transducer may simulate a temperature without physically changing temperature, for example by implementing the thermal grill illusion.   In another embodiment, the individually-addressable segment includes a force transducer configured, in an output mode, to exert a positive or negative magnitude force to the outer protective layer of the electronic device. The positive or negative magnitude force may be perceived by a user of the electronic device as a deformation of the outer protective layer, a vibration of the outer protective layer, a shifting of the outer protective layer, a clicking of the outer protecting layer, and so on.   The force transducer can be a piezoelectric element, an ultrasonic transducer, an electrically deformable material (e.g., nitanol), an electromagnet and attractor plate, or any other suitable element.   In other cases, the force transducer may be an eccentrically weighted motor, linear actuator, or any other suitable mechanical element. For example, the force transducer may be configured to distort one portion of the outer protective surface outwardly and another portion of the outer protective layer inwardly. In this example, a user may perceive different areas of the outer protective layer to exhibit a texture or surface topology.   In an input mode, the force transducer can output an electrical signal corresponding to a deformation of the outer protective layer which be received by the processor associated with the tactile user interface.   In another embodiment, the individually-addressable segment includes a friction transducer configured, in an output mode, to electrostatically attract or acoustically repel an object in proximity to the outer protective layer of the electronic device. The attraction or repulsion may be perceived by a user of the electronic device as high friction or low friction, respectively.   The friction transducer can include an electrostatic plate and an acoustic element, such as an ultrasonic transducer. The electrostatic plate may be supplied with a high voltage (e.g., greater than 75 volts) that causes the electrostatic plate to electrostatically attracts an object in proximity of the outer protective layer.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.
