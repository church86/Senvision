Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions vs. Cirrus Logic Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) suppliers Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) are flying high after getting an upgrade from Pacific Crest Securities. Analyst Andy Hargreaves believes Cupertino will manufacture „at least” 100 million devices in the second half of 2017, prompting his colleague John Vinh to upgrade the semiconductor specialists to „overweight” from „sector weight.” Vinh has set a price target of $75 for Cirrus and $120 for Skyworks, indicating around 20% upside from current levels (as of the time of writing). There is no doubt that both these chipmakers could make big money from the next iPhone, but Apple shouldn’t be the only reason for investors to put their dollars in them, as Apple has been known to ditch suppliers and build its own intellectual property. As it turns out, Cirrus relies on Apple for 85% of its business, while Skyworks is less dependent, with 40% of its revenue coming from the Cupertino-based smartphone giant. The key differentiator between the two companies is that Skyworks has been aggressively diversifying its business and Cirrus is taking its time to do the same, making the former a better bet from a long-term perspective. Skyworks is making smart moves Skyworks Solutions is pursuing a number of avenues to get more business from non-Apple sources, such as Chinese smartphone companies and small cells. In fact, it is seeing strong content growth in Chinese smartphones, with Huawei becoming its second largest customer. More importantly, the semiconductor specialist is making smart moves to push more content in Chinese smartphones by developing LTE-focused products. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. For instance, Skyworks’ SkyOne Ultra 2.5 LTE product family could lead to more content gains in China thanks to the country’s fast-growing LTE subscriber base and an increase in smartphone pricing. By 2020, there will be 1.5 million LTE connections in the developing market, and China will account for the majority of those, according to GSMA Intelligence. By comparison, the country’s LTE subscriber base stood at 762 million last year. What’s more, data from Canalys indicates that average smartphone prices in China have risen almost 25% from 2013 to 2016, and the trend could continue as the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi churn out premium devices. This trend paves the way for Skyworks to drive more dollar content gains at Chinese smartphone original equipment manufacturers. In addition, Skyworks is trying to make the most of the small-cell market that could be worth as much as $10.65 billion by 2021, according to TechNavio. The company is attacking this opportunity with a new product family of eight power amplifiers and is already supplying them to small-cell solutions provider SpiderCloud Wireless , paving the way for long-term growth in this multibillion-dollar market. Of course, Apple will be another crucial catalyst for Skyworks this year, as it could build as many as 130 million iPhones from September to December, a substantial jump over the 89 million units it made last year. But the impressive part about this chipmaker is that its iPhone-related gains will be complemented by its moves in other areas. What about Cirrus? The biggest problem with Cirrus Logic is that it depends too much on Apple for revenue, which is always a big risk if the iPhone maker decides to use some other audio codec supplier or brings manufacturing in-house. What’s more alarming is that the chipmaker might not gain any content in the next iPhone, as the smartphone giant is expected to use the same audio technology . There’s no doubt that higher iPhone builds will give Cirrus a nice boost, but betting the house on a single device is a red flag. In addition, the company is losing ground at Samsung , as the South Korean smartphone maker replaced its audio chips in 60% of Galaxy S7 smartphones, while the Galaxy S8 hasn’t brought any notable gains either. Now, Cirrus is working on emerging audio technologies such as voice biometrics , which is expected to grow at almost 20% a year until 2021. But this isn’t a guaranteed success for the chipmaker. Apple already has a patent related to voice recognition-based authentication to its name. Similarly, active noise cancellation could be another catalyst for the company, as it has provided this technology to Samsung for its latest Galaxy S8 headsets, but the problem is that they’re sold separately to the device. In addition, these two new technologies might take a couple of years to ramp up, indicating that Cirrus will continue to remain dependent on Apple for the foreseeable future. The better bet Not surprisingly, analysts expect Skyworks’ earnings to grow at 34% annually for the next five years, as compared with Cirrus’ projected growth of 20%. The former’s quest of tapping fast-growing markets such as small cells and Chinese smartphones should reap dividends in the long run, while Cirrus Logic’s dependence on Apple could prove to be a double-edged sword. What’s more, both companies trade at identical forward earnings multiples of 14, making Skyworks a better bet given its brighter prospects. 10 stocks we like better than Skyworks Solutions When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Apple Inc. Supplier Talks About A11 Chip Tech Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) reported its first-quarter earnings and held a conference call discussing the results, outlook, and technology development progress and ramp-up plans. It is widely believed that Apple’s A11 chip, which will power the company’s iPhone lineup this year, will be manufactured by TSMC using its brand-new 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. The 10-nanometer technology, TSMC has indicated previously, should enable performance and power benefits, as well as a significant transistor area reduction, relative to its 16-nanometer technology, which is currently used to produce some of Apple’s A9 chips and all its A10 chips. On TSMC’s first-quarter earnings call, the company provided some insight into its progress and revenue expectations vis-a-vis the 10-nanometer technology. Let’s go over what the chipmaker had to say. Qualified for production, ready to ramp TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that the 10-nanometer technology, referred to as N10, from „[research and development] to operation in both Fab 12 in Hsinchu and Fab 15 in Taichung and is ready for high-volume production.” Wei conceded that this technology is „very challenging,” but claimed that the company’s manufacturing yield progress is „slightly ahead of schedule” (although it’s important to point out that without knowledge of the original schedule, this statement doesn’t mean much). Wei also explained that the production ramp-up of its 10-nanometer technology „will be very fast in the second half of this year” and said that the company expects 10-nanometer wafer shipments to contribute „about 10%” of the company’s wafer revenue during 2017. That’s a lot of iPhone chips Consider that TSMC’s revenue from 10-nanometer chips in the first quarter was zero and that its revenue from 10-nanometer chip shipments in the second quarter is likely to be small. For it to make up 10% of the company’s total revenue for the year, TSMC is going to need to ship a gargantuan amount of 10-nanometer wafers in the second half of the year. There are only two potential chip vendors that could consume enough leading-edge wafers to drive the kind revenue that TSMC seems to be expecting, and one of them is already known to not be using TSMC, so we know it must be Apple. What this means for Apple For three product generations in a row, Apple has been forced to use manufacturing technology with roughly the same manufacturing density — 20 nanometer for the A8, and 16 nanometer (which was 20 nanometer with higher-performance transistors grafted on) for the A9 and A10. Apple has managed to increase the amount of performance and functionality of its chips in that time through architectural innovations, transistor performance improvements, and die size growth, but at some point, meaningful improvements without a bigger leap in manufacturing technology become harder to achieve. With 10-nanometer technology, Apple should be able to substantially increase the number of transistors that it allocates to the functionality baked into the chip. This, in a nutshell, means greater performance and feature potential than what would have otherwise been possible. It’ll be interesting to see, come this fall, just how Apple chose to utilize this new 10-nanometer technology in its new iPhone models. Considering just how important this year’s iPhones are, though, I’m expecting something awesome. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile We may have just uncovered another new iPhone 8 feature Image Source: Martin Hajek Chris Smith @chris_writes April 11th, 2017 at 12:59 PM Share Tweet If there’s one smartphone maker known for its unwillingness to make a dual-SIM version of its best-selling smartphone, it’s Apple. But the iPhone 8, a device expected to deliver many firsts for Apple, might also be the first iPhone in Apple’s history to support two SIM cards… or even more. That would certainly be an incentive to buy the iPhone 8 for smartphone buyers who require constant access to at least two different phone numbers, and who don’t want to carry multiple devices. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 Apple has yet to announce any iPhone 8 features, but it does have official documentation that proves the company’s growing interest in mobile devices that could support more than one SIM card. And make no mistake, the iPhone would be at the top of the list of Apple products that could use such functionality. The Apple Watch might also be included on that list. But what’s interesting about Apple’s approach — and what may explain why we don’t have a dual-SIM iPhone right now — is that Apple isn’t necessarily looking to using two physical SIM cards inside its multi-SIM gadgets. For years, we’ve heard that Apple wants to replace the regular SIM card with an eSIM that would help it not only save precious internal space, but also improve water resistance. Carriers, however, are an obstacle in Apple’s eSIM’s dreams. Now, new patent applications from last year have been recently published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, revealing Apple’s renewed interest in smart SIM cards. For example, there’s patent application number 20170099285 titled Methods and apparatus to support Global Platform usage on an embedded UICC (eUICC), which was published a few days ago. Let’s clarify some of that legalese speak using Apple’s own words: Most wireless communication devices (e.g., smart phones) are configured to utilize Universal Integrated Circuit Cards (UICCs) that provide access to wireless network services. A UICC typically takes the form of a small removable card (e.g., a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card) that is inserted into a wireless communication device. In most cases, each UICC is associated with a single “Issuer”–such as a mobile network operator–that controls the programming and distribution of the UICC. A popular standard, known as the GlobalPlatform.TM. specification has been adopted by a majority of mobile network operators and facilitates secure and interoperable management of applications on UICCs. In more recent implementations, non-removable UICCs–referred to herein as embedded UICCs (eUICCs)–are being included on system boards of wireless communication devices. These eUICCs are distinct from the traditional removable UICCs in that the eUICCs are non-removable and soldered to the system boards of wireless communication devices. In order to transition from use of a UICC to an eUICC in a wireless communication device, software embedded in the UICC may need to be completely re-written/re-programmed with new functions and/or applications in order to accommodate this significant change in hardware configuration, which can prove costly and time consuming. Thus, there exists a need for a more streamlined approach to transition from using UICCs to eUICCs. Apple wants to find an easy way to transition from regular SIM to eSIMs in the future. That’s not to say the iPhone 8 will necessarily have dual-SIM support, just that Apple is looking to fix this problem and potentially convince mobile operators to go along with it. But then we have patent application 20170094628 from late March, which explains how a dual-SIM or multi-SIM device would work — that’s the Methods and apparatus to support parallel communication for multiple subscriber identities in a wireless communication device patent. In this patent, Apple describes technology that would simplify the behind-the-scenes management of dual-SIM and multi-SIM functionality in Apple devices. While these wireless communication devices provide for flexible access to different services and to multiple wireless networks, an internal architecture of such wireless communication devices that support the multiple UICCs/SIMs usually includes parallel hardware and parallel software such that each UICC/SIM acts independently with no interaction or interface between them. Although this internal architecture is simple, independent operation of the parallel UICCs/SIMs (and associated hardware/software) in the wireless communication device can result in inefficiencies, as each parallel internal system can duplicate various functions used for network connection management. As such, there exists a need for solutions that enable cooperation and synergy between hardware and software that support multiple subscriber identities in a wireless communication device. What’s interesting about this patent is that Apple takes into consideration various scenarios where SIM cards and eSIMs would coexist on the same device. Thus, a device like the iPhone 8 could have a SIM tray that would support just one single nanoSIM, but also feature built-in eSIM functionality that would let users add at least one more SIM card to the phone. Image Source: Apple via USPTO The patent application also describes a scenario where two devices, each capable of housing at least one SIM/eSIM, would be able to interact via a wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (see the image above). Considering that the Apple Watch Series 3 is expected to come with LTE support, this patent might tell us how LTE management will be handled on the Apple Watch with the help of an iPhone. That said, there’s nothing to guarantee that the technology described here will be found in upcoming Apple products. However, it’s worth pointing out that the patents were filed on November 16th, 2016 (‘628), and December 19th, 2016 (‘285), suggesting Apple is indeed interested in this type of technology for its upcoming devices.

Apple said that it was taking action because Qualcomm was “charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with”. Now, the chipmaker has announced that it has filed a counter-claim against the Cupertino company, detailing its grievances in the process. According to the company, Apple failed to “engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”. Qualcomm’s claims That’s just the start of Qualcomm’s grievances with Apple though. The company alleges that Apple breached agreements, interfered in Qualcomm’s agreements with licensees and “mischaracterised” agreements and negotiations. The company also alleges that Apple “encouraged regulatory attacks” on Qualcomm’s business by “misrepresenting facts and making false statements”. However, one of the bigger claims is that Apple chose not to use the full performance of Qualcomm chips in the iPhone 7, “misrepresenting” the performance between these iPhones and iPhones equipped with competitor-supplied modems. Qualcomm says it was also threatened in a bid to keep it from making any public comparisons about the “the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones”. Qualcomm has gone so far to say that Apple’s iPhone wouldn’t be nearly as successful without Qualcomm technology The company has also claimed that Apple’s iPhone empire hinged on Qualcomm technology. “The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. “But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table.

CNBC scooped the story, citing three unnamed sources who said Apple’s efforts were originally envisioned by Steve Jobs. Apple has a small team of biomedical engineers working on the project in Palo Alto, and the effort has been underway for five years. Monitoring blood sugar levels through sensors—rather than blood tests—is considered the “holy grail” of life sciences. Lots of money has been thrown at the problem by a lot of companies, but no one has succeeded. The reason being that this is how it’s currently done: Glucose monitoring, with blood Apple Watch Diabetes Monitoring Most diabetics check their glucose 4-5 times a day, and still have problems with low blood sugar because they react poorly to insulin. If Apple Watch monitored glucose levels continually, and gave alerts when it was getting dangerously low, it could save lives. Detecting Glucose Levels Could Take Billions Terrance Gregg, executive chairman of biomed company DexCom, told Reuters in 2014 that developing this technology could take, “several hundred million dollars or even a billion dollars.” That’s just one well-informed exec’s opinion, but the reality is that no one has cracked it yet. If Apple did so, it would be a real game changer for millions of people afflicted with diabetes. It would also be a game changer for Apple Watch and Apple itself. It would position both the device and the company as significant players in the life sciences industry. CNBC suggested it would make Apple Watch a must-have device for anyone with diabetes. This is significant because Apple would require substantial levels of regulatory clearance to market a device with that kind of ability. Reporter Christina Farr said that Apple’s efforts were far enough along that, “Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways.” Ms. Farr’s reporting included that as of a year ago, some 30 people were working on this team. She also wrote that the team reported to Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, and that it used to report to Michael D. Hillman. Mr. Hillman left Apple in late 2015 for Facebook’s Oculus VR goggles as head of hardware. The CNBC article has a video interview with Ms. Farr relating to her coverage. Apple R&D Apple’s R&D budgets have skyrockets in recent years, even as the number of new shipping products has declined. Projects such as a (probably-no-longer-happening) car, augment reality, and blood sugar monitoring, not to mention anything that has actually remained secret, account for that increase. More importantly, all represent large scale, long-term efforts. Jeff Butts contributed to this article.

Apple is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 per cent in a plan that would have Toshiba maintain a partial stake to keep the business under US and Japanese control, NHK reported, citing an unidentified source. The proposal is aimed at allaying the Japanese government's concerns over any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a risk to national security, it said. Apple was not immediate available to comment. Taiwan's Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. The report comes as Western Digital Corp, Toshiba's partner and one of the bidders of its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm is violating a joint venture contract in plans to sell to its chip unit, and urged that it be given exclusive negotiating rights. Toshiba has narrowed down the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors, sources have said previously.

Apple tumbles down laptop brand survey after tepid reaction to new MacBooks Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal April 10th, 2017 at 6:01 PM Share Tweet After taking first place every year since 2010 in Laptop Mag’s survey of the best and worst laptop brands, Apple has dropped to fifth place in the 2017 edition of the survey. Participants voted on six criteria for each brand, and while Apple scored well on reviews, design and support, it took a beating in value and selection. Apple has always sold its laptops at a premium, but in 2017, consumers don’t think they’re worth it. Don't Miss: iOS 11 might kill your favorite old iPhone apps While Apple tumbled all the way down to fifth, Lenovo shot back up to the top spot from all the way down at fourth in 2016. Reviews for Lenovo’s latest machines — especially the long-lasting ThinkPad laptops — have significantly improved this year, as has Lenovo’s customer support and dedication to innovation. Image Source: Laptop Mag Behind Lenovo at the top of the list, Asus and Dell swapped spots, with Asus snagging Dell’s title of runner-up this year. Of all the brands featured in the survey, Asus consistently has the best reputation with gamers and is constantly pushing the limits when it comes to design. Warranty and support are somewhat lacking, but that hasn’t stopped Asus from climbing into the upper tier and outperforming Apple. HP managed to sneak in above Apple at number four while Acer actually tied with Apple for fifth. Apple beat Acer in five of the six criteria, but Acer crushed Apple when it came to value and selection. Apple clearly saw the writing on the wall before this survey came out, as it went so far as to invite a group of journalists to the Apple Campus last week to pass on a message to consumers that the Mac brand was still a priority for the company. By the end of the year, we expect to see new MacBook models.

The company is prepared to make a direct investment of several billion dollars in Toshiba Memory for a stake of “several tens” of percent, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported in its lunchtime news.  The report said Apple is also considering a joint bid with Foxconn Technology, which manufactures the iPhone. Toshiba is a major supplier of components for the iPhone. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The memory chip business is one of the Toshiba’s jewels, but is up for sale as part of Toshiba’s attempts to dig itself out of a multibillion dollar hole caused by the collapse of Westinghouse. Cost overruns and delays on projects in South Carolina and Georgia incurred billions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, Toshiba finally released its first financial report in nine months, reporting a $5.9 billion dollar loss due to the problems at nuclear power business Westinghouse. The memory chip business reported a profit of $934 million on sales of $5.8 billion. The release came without the blessing of auditors—a highly unusual move for a Japanese company—and with a warning that the entire company could collapse. Any acquisition of the memory chip business faces hurdles. The business is run as a joint venture with Western Digital under a deal that is said to give the U.S. company exclusive negotiating rights over any acquisition of Toshiba’s stake. Also, Japan is hesitant to allow a foreign company to acquire the business, because it doesn’t want key Japanese semiconductor technology to fall into foreign ownership.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Report may have just revealed more iPhone 8 specs Yoni Heisler BGR News April 13, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple has always managed to squeeze incredible performance out of the iPhone even though the company has a history of being notoriously stingy with RAM. As a point of reference, Samsung’s 2013 Galaxy S4 shipped with 2GB of RAM but Apple didn’t decide to jump on the 2GB bandwagon until it rolled out the iPhone 6s more than two years later. Last year, Apple became a lot more RAM-friendly when it gave the iPhone 7 Plus 3GB of RAM, largely due to the device’s advanced dual camera system. Now comes word via Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri (via MacRumors) that the entirety of Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup will feature 3GB of RAM. The analyst note additionally sheds some light on the storage configurations that will accompany each new iPhone model later this year. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo Dot for the first time this year As a quick refresher, it’s widely believed that Apple later this year will release three brand new iPhone models; an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and an edgeless 5.8-inch iPhone 8 that, rumor has it, may be called the iPhone Edition. Arcuri’s note reads in part: In terms of memory/storage configuration, all three models will likely adopt 3GB RAM; the 4.7”/5.5” will likely have the same storage options as the current iPhone 7/7+ in 32/128/256GB while the 5.8” model looks to be only offered in two memory configurations: 64GB and 256GB. Finally, the 5.8” model will likely have extended battery life with two packs of batteries. Arcuri doesn’t have a storied track record when it comes to Apple rumors, but his predictions regarding Apple’s upcoming iPhone lineup seem entirely plausible. Notably, his remarks regarding extended battery life on the iPhone 8 happen to align with a report from analyst Ming Chi-Kuo who this past February relayed that the device will feature a stacked logic board design which, coupled with a power efficient OLED display, will result in tremendous battery life. Kuo’s note on the matter, originally published this past February, reads in part: As battery material tech isn’t likely to see major breakthroughs in the next 3-5 years, mainboard area can only be reduced via stacked SLP, which makes space for larger battery and extended usage time. Thanks to stacked SLP, we expect the OLED iPhone to have similar dimensions to a 4.7” TFT-LCD iPhone, and have comparable battery capacity (equipped with around 2,700 mAh L-shaped 2-cell battery pack) to a 5.5” TFT-LCD iPhone. As a final point, Arcuri writes that all of Apple’s 2017 iPhones will feature a Lightning connector with a USB Type-C connector on the other end for fast charging.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 13, 2017 at 9:08PM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) are flying high after getting an upgrade from Pacific Crest Securities. Analyst Andy Hargreaves believes Cupertino will manufacture "at least" 100 million devices in the second half of 2017, prompting his colleague John Vinh to upgrade the semiconductor specialists to "overweight" from "sector weight." Vinh has set a price target of $75 for Cirrus and $120 for Skyworks, indicating around 20% upside from current levels (as of the time of writing). There is no doubt that both these chipmakers could make big money from the next iPhone, but Apple shouldn't be the only reason for investors to put their dollars in them, as Apple has been known to ditch suppliers and build its own intellectual property. As it turns out, Cirrus relies on Apple for 85% of its business, while Skyworks is less dependent, with 40% of its revenue coming from the Cupertino-based smartphone giant. The key differentiator between the two companies is that Skyworks has been aggressively diversifying its business and Cirrus is taking its time to do the same, making the former a better bet from a long-term perspective. Skyworks is making smart moves Skyworks Solutions is pursuing a number of avenues to get more business from non-Apple sources, such as Chinese smartphone companies and small cells. In fact, it is seeing strong content growth in Chinese smartphones, with Huawei becoming its second largest customer. More importantly, the semiconductor specialist is making smart moves to push more content in Chinese smartphones by developing LTE-focused products. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. For instance, Skyworks' SkyOne Ultra 2.5 LTE product family could lead to more content gains in China thanks to the country's fast-growing LTE subscriber base and an increase in smartphone pricing. By 2020, there will be 1.5 million LTE connections in the developing market, and China will account for the majority of those, according to GSMA Intelligence. By comparison, the country's LTE subscriber base stood at 762 million last year. What's more, data from Canalys indicates that average smartphone prices in China have risen almost 25% from 2013 to 2016, and the trend could continue as the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi churn out premium devices. This trend paves the way for Skyworks to drive more dollar content gains at Chinese smartphone original equipment manufacturers. In addition, Skyworks is trying to make the most of the small-cell market that could be worth as much as $10.65 billion by 2021, according to TechNavio. The company is attacking this opportunity with a new product family of eight power amplifiers and is already supplying them to small-cell solutions provider SpiderCloud Wireless, paving the way for long-term growth in this multibillion-dollar market. Of course, Apple will be another crucial catalyst for Skyworks this year, as it could build as many as 130 million iPhones from September to December, a substantial jump over the 89 million units it made last year. But the impressive part about this chipmaker is that its iPhone-related gains will be complemented by its moves in other areas. What about Cirrus? The biggest problem with Cirrus Logic is that it depends too much on Apple for revenue, which is always a big risk if the iPhone maker decides to use some other audio codec supplier or brings manufacturing in-house. What's more alarming is that the chipmaker might not gain any content in the next iPhone, as the smartphone giant is expected to use the same audio technology. There's no doubt that higher iPhone builds will give Cirrus a nice boost, but betting the house on a single device is a red flag. In addition, the company is losing ground at Samsung, as the South Korean smartphone maker replaced its audio chips in 60% of Galaxy S7 smartphones, while the Galaxy S8 hasn't brought any notable gains either. Now, Cirrus is working on emerging audio technologies such as voice biometrics, which is expected to grow at almost 20% a year until 2021. But this isn't a guaranteed success for the chipmaker. Apple already has a patent related to voice recognition-based authentication to its name. Similarly, active noise cancellation could be another catalyst for the company, as it has provided this technology to Samsung for its latest Galaxy S8 headsets, but the problem is that they're sold separately to the device. In addition, these two new technologies might take a couple of years to ramp up, indicating that Cirrus will continue to remain dependent on Apple for the foreseeable future. The better bet Not surprisingly, analysts expect Skyworks' earnings to grow at 34% annually for the next five years, as compared with Cirrus' projected growth of 20%. The former's quest of tapping fast-growing markets such as small cells and Chinese smartphones should reap dividends in the long run, while Cirrus Logic's dependence on Apple could prove to be a double-edged sword. What's more, both companies trade at identical forward earnings multiples of 14, making Skyworks a better bet given its brighter prospects.    Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

With the entry-level 2015 MacBook Pro costing £300 more than the 13in MacBook Air the decision isn't as obvious as you might think. by Karen Haslam & Christopher Minasians | 13 Apr 17 Price RRP: From £949 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air comparison review If you are looking for a new Mac laptop there are a number of factors to consider when deciding which model is the one for you. Should you buy the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro Retina? Do you need the Retina display? Would a lighter and cheaper model be better for you? How much power do you need from your Mac laptop? The question of whether to buy a 13-inch MacBook Air (from £949) or MacBook Pro with Retina display (from £1249) - after the October 2016 event, Apple brought out three new MacBook Pro models, starting at £1,449 to £1,949 - however last year's model can still be bought from the Apple store for £1,249. Back in 2013, when there was just £150 difference between the 2013 13in models, our advice was that if you were on the market for a new laptop it was worth paying the extra and getting the MacBook Pro with Retina display. However, now there is a £300 difference between the cheapest 13in models - is it worth paying more? Read on to find out. There is, of course, a third option in the MacBook line-up as of early 2015. It's a 12in MacBook designed for style and portability, and it is stunning if rather expensive. But here we're comparing the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro's 13in options. To find out more about the 12in MacBook, which was updated in April 2016, read our 12in MacBook 2016 review. You can also click here to view the 12in MacBook on the Apple Store. Also see our Mac buyers guide. Click here to view the MacBook Pro on the Apple Store. Click here to view the MacBook Air on the Apple Store. New Macs are here, but will the MacBook Air be discontinued? The MacBook Pro line was updated on 27 October 2016 - the standout feature of the new MacBook Pro 2016 is the Touch Bar with the integrated Touch ID sensor (available from the £1,759 and £1,949 models) - however a third MacBook Pro which doesn't feature the Touch Bar is available for £1,449 and the older 2015 MacBook at £1,249 is also available. The MacBook Air also received an update...one that many won't appreciate - a price increase and an axe of the 11in Air model. The price has gone up £100 for the 13in model, making the cheapest MacBook Air available at £949. This now begs the question: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? We fear that with the same 'Air' properties found in the MacBook Pro, the Air will slowly make its way out. In this article, we will outline all the MacBook Pro models available. Read next: New MacBook Pro 2016 vs new Surface Book 2 with Performance Base Dimensions and weight When it launched in 2008 the MacBook Air was the lightest laptop available. Over the years that followed, where the weight of the MacBook Pro has also declined. We weigh up the differences between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The 2016 13in MacBook Pro weighs only 1.37kg, whereas the 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display weighs almost the same as the 2013 and 2014 models at 1.58kg, both of those models were 50g lighter than the 2012 Retina MacBook Pro, at 1.57 kg. The 2014 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display is a bit heavier than the 2015 13in MacBook Pro, at 2.02 kg, and the same weight as the 2012 model. The 2016 13in MacBook Pro is only 1.49 cm thick - this makes it thinner than previous models that were 1.8 cm thick. In 2012 the 13-inch model was a tiny bit thicker at 1.9 cm. The 2015 13-inch MacBook Air model used to be the thinnest model around, but that's no longer the case with the new 2016 MacBook Pro. The 2015 Air weighs 1.35kg and has a 1.7 cm thickness.  However, the now-discontinued 2015 11-inch MacBook Air weighed in at 1.08 kg. You might presume that the dimensions of both 13in MacBooks would be the same, but you may be surprised to learn that not only are they not the same, the MacBook Air is actually a fraction bigger. The 13in Retina MacBook Pro is 30.41cm by 21.24cm (2015 model: 31.4cm by 21.9cm), while the 2015 13in MacBook Air is 32.5cm by 22.7cm. If you are curious about how the MacBook fits in to this, it weighs 0.92kg - less even than the discontinued 11in MacBook Air, and its dimensions are 28.05cm by 19.65cm, and just 0.35cm-1.31cm thick. Compare the different generations of MacBook Air: 13in 2015 MacBook Air review, and 11in 2015 MacBook Air review, versus 2014 13in MacBook Air and 2014 11in MacBook Air review. 2015 MacBook Air, 11-inch dimensions (discontinued) Height 0.3-1.7cm Width 30cm Depth 19.2 Weight 1.08kg 2015 MacBook Air, 13-inch dimensions  Height 0.3-1.7cm Width 32.5cm Depth 22.7 Weight 1.35kg 2015 Retina MacBook Pro, 13-inch dimensions Height 1.8cm Width 31.4cm Depth 21.9cm Weight 1.58kg 2015 Retina MacBook Pro, 15-inch dimensions Height 1.8cm Width 35.89cm Depth 24.71cm Weight 2.02kg 2016 Retina MacBook Pro, 15-inch dimensions (new) Height 1.49cm Width 30.41cm Depth 21.24cm Weight 1.37kg 2015 Retina MacBook, 12-inch dimensions Height 0.35-1.31cm Width 28.05cm Depth 19.65cm Weight 0.92kg BUYING ADVICE: Dimensions and weight The 13in MacBook Air is no longer the lightest 13-inch laptop from Apple, as the 2016 MacBook Pro has taken its throne. Another surprising thing is that the MacBook Pro with Retina display is actually slightly smaller in terms of width and depth, and only one millimeter thicker than the MacBook Air at it's thickest point. You no longer need to sacrifice power for portability.  If you're looking for the thinnest and MacBook with the lightest weight for its size, the MacBook Pro is the 2016 winner - despite being only 0.02kg heavier, it is thinner and has a smaller form factor than the 2015 MacBook Air. Although, it should be noted that the regular 2015 MacBook weighs only 0.92kg! Price and specs comparison Prices for both MacBook Air and Pro have fluctuated over the years - however after Brexit, UK prices have gone up for all models in 2016. Prices went up by £200 on the 12in MacBook, £100 on the 13in MacBook Air and a whopping £250 on the 2015 13in MacBook Pro! There are some key differences in specs between the 13in Air and 13in Pro: The Pro has a faster processor (2.0-, 2.7- and 2.9GHz compared to 1.6GHz) The Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics (6100 and the newer 540) as opposed to the Air's Intel HD 6000 Graphics The Pro has a native Retina resolution of 2560x1600 with 227ppi, whereas the Air has a native 1440x900 resolution with 127ppi The Pro comes with 8GB 1866MHz and 2133MHz memory (depending on the variant), the Air comes with 8GB 1600MHz memory There are other specs that we should also talk about - such as included ports. Thankfully, both models have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but it's when we look at the new vs old Pro, when it gets confusing!  Starting with the 2015 Air, it features, 2x USB-A 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 2, an SDXC card and MagSafe 2 charging ports. The 2015 MacBook Pro has 2x USB-A 3.0 port, 2x Thunderbolt 2, a HDMI, SDXC card and MagSafe 2 charging ports. The new 2016 MacBook Pro has 2x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, while the more expensive models have two additional Thunderbolt 3 ports - tallying to four ports. It's disappointing to see the SDXC card, HDMI and MagSafe 2 ports scrapped from the MacBook Pro lineup. Next up is storage - which is configurable on all models, but as a standard, you'll get 128 and 256GB flash storage in the Air. In the Pro you'll start off with 128GB in the 2015 model and go from 256 to 512GB flash storage in the 2016 Pro models. Storage can always be upgraded, and despite it being quite expensive to add additional storage internally on Apple's website (as internal SSD upgrades aren't possible) - you can always add additional storage externally - see our best SSD for Mac roundup.

The one place where the Pro lets itself down is its ports - the new ports are a nice addition, but with a removal of some key ports for professionals, we feel that they will be missed. On the plus side, in the new 2016 MacBook Pro models, you have the Touch Bar and Touch ID - making the new models more secure and more customisable than ever before. Click here to view the MacBook Pro on the Apple Store.

By Rob Thubron on Apr 13, 2017, 8:00 AM TechSpot It’s estimated that almost half a billion people worldwide have diabetes, with the figure set to reach 642 million by 2040. For those who endure regular blood sugar monitoring that involves pricking a finger, or other invasive methods, a sensor that's able to perform the same task just by touching the skin would be more than welcome. Step forward, Apple. CNBC reports that the iPhone maker has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to join the 30 people already involved with the project. The group is working out of an office in Palo Alto, a few miles away from the Cupertino headquarters. The engineers report to Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji. The company has reportedly been working on the initiative for over five years – it was former CEO Steve Jobs who first showed an interest in the concept. Now, Apple has reached the point where it has started feasibility trials at clinical locations in the Bay Area and has even hired consultants to deal with the regulatory demands. While precise details of how the system works are unknown, one source said it uses optical sensors that shine a light through the skin to measure glucose levels. What’s also unclear is whether it would be a stand-alone product or perhaps become an attachment for the Apple Watch. If the latter, then the wearable’s popularity would no doubt soar among those with the disease. Apple isn’t the only company working on products aimed at Diabetes sufferers. Google is developing contact lenses that detect glucose levels by analyzing a wearer’s tears. It’s also working on a bandage-sized, cloud-connected sensor, and filed a patent in 2015 for a device that can draw blood without using needles.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Apple could potentially find the cash to pull off a $200 billion-plus takeover Disney -- creating a company worth $1 trillion with "almost limitless opportunities in content and technology." That's according to a speculative analysis from RBC Capital Markets, which in a note to client Thursday said such a colossal tie-up would be contingent on Apple getting tax breaks to "repatriate" overseas cash. "Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney," RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in the note. A combined Apple-Disney would create an instant competitor to Netflix that would take advantage of the Mouse House's content and Apple's user base, the anlaysts speculated. Other benefits: integrating Apple consumer tech as experiences in Disney's theme parks; and landing global streaming sports rights for ESPN via the combo of Disney-backed BAMTech and Apple distribution and a strong balance sheet. "Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand," RBC's Cahall and Kulp wrote. The M&A rumor mill got new grist last fall, when Apple chief Tim Cook told analysts that the tech giant was "open to acquisitions of any size." In addition, Apple execs met with Time Warner honchos in late 2015 in a discussion that raised the possibility of a merger -- before AT&T moved on its $85 billion bid for Time Warner. The Apple-Disney M&A chatter comes as analysts in the last few months have debated the possibility that Disney would make a move to buy Netflix -- a highly leveraged transaction that some view as needlessly risky. But would Apple shareholders support such a bet-the-company move? Assuming a 40% premium for Disney, the deal would carry a hefty $237 billion price tag. If Apple investors balk, Disney could consider spinning off assets like ESPN and theme parks to make the deal more palatable. Another caveat: Apple would need U.S. regulators to give it a "tax holiday" to repatriate offshore cash to fund an acquisition of Disney. Assuming Apple could obtain a 9% tax rate, it would effectively have access to cash of $223 billion, RBC noted. "Even though investors might expect higher cash returns in form of buybacks/dividends, strategic uses are likely to take precedence," the analysts wrote. Per RBC, the merger of Apple and Disney would be highly accretive to earnings, to the tune of 15%-20% increase in earnings per share based on the presumed 40% premium deal price and Disney's low debt load. "We like Disney's fundamentals. Assuming Apple sees the same thing and has the cash, investor anticipation of a prospective transaction only adds conviction to the momentum we see in Disney's shares," Cahall and Kulp wrote. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 11th, 2017 at 10:06 AM Share Tweet Samsung has clearly turned a corner with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in 2017. Just a few short years ago, the company was selling flagship phones made out of thin plastic that felt flimsy and cheap, that changed beginning with the all glass and metal Galaxy S5 in 2014, and Samsung has continued to refine its design since then. All that progress culminated with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, which were unveiled late last month and are set to be released in less than two weeks. How impressive is Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 design? So impressive that all hardcore Apple fans can do is complain about misaligned USB-C ports and speaker holes, since alignment is apparently far more important than squeezing as much as possible into a compact housing. Of course, everyone (including me) expects Apple to quickly take back the design crown when it releases the iPhone 8 later this year. As we’re now seeing, however, is that simply might not be the case. Don't Miss: The only Samsung phone more exciting than the Galaxy S8 isn’t as exciting as we thought As an iPhone user for what will soon be 10 years, I can happily say that Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are far more stunning than any iPhone that has existed so far. I’m not sure why other iPhone users have so much trouble acknowledging that. As I stated in no uncertain terms after spending some time with the S8 and S8+ ahead of Samsung’s announcement, the company has clearly out-designed Apple. Samsung has created two smartphones with big, beautiful screens that are both far more comfortable to use than any comparable models from the company’s rivals. The shrunken bezels surrounding Samsung’s “Infinity Display” coupled with the curved sides on the front and back are practically perfect considering current technological limitations. And needless to say, Samsung’s newest Super AMOLED screens are simply stunning. Now, here’s where things get interesting. Apple has used the same iPhone design for three straight years now, but that comes to an end in 2017. The next-gen flagship iPhone 8 is supposed to feature an entirely new design with an OLED display, no home button, much smaller bezels around the screen, and a glass back. According to new rumors, however, Apple might not have found a way to go quite as far as Samsung did with its new design. iPhone 8 (iPhone X) alleged sizes. Body Dimensions – 150 x 73 mm Display Size – 133 x 65 mm (5.8 inches / 18.5:9) pic.twitter.com/qKJsxf17kR — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 11, 2017 The dimensions noted above have been floating around Weibo and a few other forums lately, and they suggest that Apple’s tenth-anniversary iPhone will be a big step forward compared to Apple’s current iPhones. It will seemingly be sized in between the 4.7-inch model and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus, and yet it will feature a screen that’s larger than both of those phones. And yet… Samsung has managed to fit the same sized screen into a smaller device — the Galaxy S8 measures 148.9mm tall by 68.1mm wide. If these new rumors pan out, Apple will not have managed to top Samsung when it comes to the next iPhone’s screen-to-body ratio, which is quickly becoming the new smartphone screen battleground now that resolution and pixel density are old news. It might seem innocuous — and Apple might have more new tech to pack into the iPhone 8, like an in-display fingerprint scanner — but it’s certainly an interesting shift in the industry. Also of note, the Galaxy Note 8 set to debut later this year is rumors to have an even more impressive screen-to-body ratio than the 83% achieved by the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+.

This is according to a report from iGeneration (via AppleInsider) in which according to emails sent to users, it seems that there will no significant updates released for the app. This doesn’t mean that the app will end up being neglected, but rather if there are updates, it will only to address bugs with the software, but don’t expect anything new. However the fact that Apple is keeping the app around is interesting as Apple has in the past been quick to shut down services that they’ve acquired. Perhaps Apple wants more iOS users to use it app and get used to its features before baking it into iOS. The fact that the app is now free (with Apple reimbursing customers who paid for it) suggests that the company wants the app to reach a wider audience. In any case we guess if you’re already pretty happy with the way Workflow is now, then this doesn’t really change anything. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps and iOS.

Apple Park by Alissa Walker@awalkerinLA Apr 13, 2017, 10:12am EDT tweet share pin Apple’s nearly complete campus in Cupertino, California. Apple When it opens later this month, Apple’s shiny new Norman Foster-designed headquarters in Cupertino, California will be more than just a spaceship-like orb nestled in 175 acres of trees. It will have enough space to park 11,000 cars—an area far bigger than the square footage of the actual building. Apple’s parking infrastructure serves as the the opening anecdote of “Parkageddon,” an investigation by The Economist looking at why humans devote so much land to the storage of motionless vehicles: For 14,000 workers, Apple is building almost 11,000 parking spaces. Many cars will be tucked under the main building, but most will cram into two enormous garages to the south. Tot up all the parking spaces and the lanes and ramps that will allow cars to reach them, and it is clear that Apple is allocating a vast area to stationary vehicles. In all, the new headquarters will contain 318,000 square metres of offices and laboratories. The car parks will occupy 325,000 square metres. That’s almost 3.5 million square feet, or about 80 acres dedicated to parking. Did I mention the building has been named Apple Park? But before you go blaming the technology giant for paving over paradise, as The Economist quickly points out, it’s not really Apple’s fault: Apple is building 11,000 parking spaces not because it wants to but because Cupertino, the suburban city where the new headquarters is located, demands it. Cupertino has a requirement for every building. A developer who wants to put up a block of flats, for example, must provide two parking spaces per apartment, one of which must be covered. Ah, of course. Even the most forward-thinking new structures are subjected to backwards-looking parking requirements, often the most antiquated, outdated aspect of local zoning laws. An estimated 25,000 square miles of land nationwide are devoted to parking our vehicles, an area that’s roughly the size of West Virginia. But Cupertino’s arcane parking minimums aren’t just taking up valuable space in the city (and at great cost to its biggest taxpayer, I might add). By prioritizing parking minimums, welcoming all those cars to Apple’s new headquarters will only exacerbate the region’s horrific traffic congestion. Plus, even though the building will run on renewable energy, the emissions generated by all those vehicles will greatly expand its carbon footprint. Apple knows this, which is why the company funds an expansive transit system of private shuttles that ferries its employees from San Francisco and other cities around the region. The new building’s plan also includes an on-campus bike share system and parking for 2,000 bikes. Additionally, the company offers incentives to get employees to use shuttles, carpool, or bike, so by Apple’s own estimates, about 28 percent of its employees don’t drive to work. And still, the city is requiring way more parking spaces than Apple’s employees and visitors will ever need. What if the city required that, instead of offering free parking, Apple had to charge employees to park? Should Apple have pushed back more? It’s interesting that the city demanded infrastructure funds from Apple to prepare the region for increased vehicular demand. Apple is paying $1.3 million to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and Caltrans to improve local roadways. You’d think that the same thinking would apply to solutions that might reduce the number of cars. What if that $1.3 million went towards public transit improvements to better connect the campus to Caltrain? What if the city required that, instead of offering free parking, Apple had to charge employees to park? What if Apple had—gasp—moved to a city with better transportation? A hyper-efficient building and a forest of 9,000 trees is certainly better than what was on the site before. (It used to be an aging Hewlett-Packard building surrounded by a huge surface parking lot.) Still, the company’s promise of “transforming miles of asphalt sprawl into a haven of green space” is really only partially true. Apple’s actually making the city’s sprawl worse, and cleverly distracting everyone from the issue with a giant black-glass donut.

Apple is on the clock. By Emily Bary April 13, 2017 5:55 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The new Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ screens have minimal bezels, or borders, so there's more screen space. Illustration: Samsung The buzz around Samsung has already changed. Just months removed from the recall of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 devices, all seems forgotten. Samsung said Thursday that preorders for its new S8 phone had surpassed the preorders for its prior model, the S7. (The recalled Note 7 was a “phablet,” largely distinguishable by its stylus.)

It seems that buyers were impressed by the new features Samsung unveiled in its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ phones last month. This could be good news or bad news for Apple. The encouraging consumer response to Samsung’s latest features -- edge-to-edge screen and the removal of the physical home button -- suggests that Apple might have similar luck convincing users to upgrade come the fall if its new phone has those elements, too, as is expected. But the pressure is on. The S8 is already real, but we don’t have actual details on the next iPhone. Last week, there was a report that the new phone might be delayed because Apple was having trouble manufacturing the curved OLED screen. And this week brought the possibility that the company was having trouble making the phone’s 3D sensors (which could be used for augmented-reality and authentication purposes) and integrating a fingerprint reader below the OLED glass. The Galaxy S8 doesn’t go out to consumers until April 21, but the early signs are positive. For Samsung, the best news is the fire seems to be out. Big Picture: Samsung reported good news about sales for its soon-to-launch Galaxy S8 phone.

But this is only possible for an extremely limited period of time, after which you have to stick with the latest publicly available iOS release. Today though, Apple has flipped the switch and stopped signing iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3. This means you can no longer downgrade your iOS device to the aforementioned firmware versions no matter what you do. Related iOS 11 Will Reportedly Drop 32-bit App Support This Fall At the time of writing, Apple is only signing iOS 10.3.1 as well as iOS 10.3.2 Beta. The latter, of course, is meant for developers mainly. But a Public Beta of the software is also available if you want to try it out. You can learn more about it by heading over to this link. Advertisement Quite frankly, I see no reason why you should downgrade back to iOS 10.2.1. iOS 10.3 and above are packed with a bunch of great changes under the hood that ensure the smooth functionality of iOS devices, while also giving things a slight speed boost. Apple was able to achieve this by altering the file system which was being used by iOS, while also tweaking the system animations in a way that everything appears snappier. Related Apple Alerts iCloud Users iOS 10.3 May Have Accidentally Re-Enabled Some Services But, of course, you might have your own reasons for sticking to older firmware, such as battery life related issues. Or maybe you are hoping that an iOS 10.2.1 jailbreak may arrive in due course. That’s completely understandable, and waiting has, thus far, proven to be fruitful for a lot of people out there. Maybe you’ll get lucky in the time to come as well. But keep in mind one thing: there is absolute silence from the world of jailbreaking, so don’t hold your breath for a new solution for Apple’s latest firmware release just yet. Still, if there is an update from the jailbreaking front, we will definitely inform our readers about it, so stay tuned for more in the days to come.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 11 Will Reportedly Drop 32-bit App Support This Fall By Ali Salman Apr 10, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has been making quite a handful of changes in its mobile operating system. While some changes rests on the visual side, others are intramural that reflect more on performance. While, Apple has been cutting down on 32-bit apps, changes on a more bigger scale are reserved for iOS 11. According to a well-known developer, Steven Troughton-Smith, the iPhone-maker is said to drop support for 32-bit apps in iOS 11 this fall. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the subject. Apple Reportedly Dropping 32-bit App Support With iOS 11 This Fall If Steven Troughton-Smith is right about Apple dropping support for 32-bit apps in iOS 11, abundant legacy apps will stop functioning. As per Smith, he said that he is hearing “very clearly” that Apple will implement the change. Related Instagram Stories Hits 200 Million Daily Active Users, Celebrate With The New Stickers Feature (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support. Wonder if that’ll free up any performance/die space?) — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 Previously with the start of iOS 10.3, Apple has started warning iOS users when they open a 32-bit app. When a user first opened a 32-bit app in iOS 10.2.1, a pop up message for that app reads: Advertisement The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility. As the company advanced and released iOS 10 3 beta 1, the message for the 32-bit app reads: Related iOS Has Dropped To Its Lowest Market Share In Three Years In China This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility. Smith further pointed that Apple’s processors to be launched in the future could potentially exclude 32-bit support. Apple’s move basically rests on the developer side of things and will possibly not affect the end user. Instead, developers will have to update their apps before the company completely removes 32-bit support from the firmware. Previously, we also noted that Apple is removing abandoned and faulty apps from the App Store. This is because the company wants to focus on app quality. To push its goals, it removed nearly 50,000 apps from the App Store. This clearly means that Apple is cleaning the App Store from any app that does not meet its required standards. The downsides of this scenario will be observed when the company implements the change on a more bigger scale. We will probably here more to the story, so do stay tuned with us for more details. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple reportedly dropping 32-bit app support from iOS 11 this fall? Do you think it will be a viable move for the company?

And after a lengthy stint in beta, the iOS 10.3 update is now available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As expected iOS 10.3 is a huge update for Apple’s mobile devices bringing new features, fixes and a ton of security patches with it. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. Today we want to take an updated look at the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3 update and its release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates as we push into the month of April. iOS 10.3 Review We’ve downloaded the iOS 10.3 update on the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5. The iOS 10.3 update is massive, over 600MB for the iPhone 7, and the installation process took a lot longer than usual due in part to Apple’s new APFS file system. We didn’t run into any issues but the download/installation took upwards of 20 minutes on all of these devices so make sure you set aside some time to monitor the download and the installation. So far, we haven’t noticed any major problems with any of these devices. In fact, we’ve seen some nice improvements on the eldest device. Battery life is currently holding up on all four phones. We haven’t experienced any weird drain when in use or standby. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data are also stable. We’ve noticed some improvements to the iPhone 5’s boot speed and its UI. The user interface feels faster and more fluid than the previous versions of iOS 10. As of right now, iOS 10.3 is treating these three devices well and it’s recommended if you’re interested in iOS 10.3’s features, protecting your device from potential harm, or if you’re suffering from an unfixable iOS issue. If you’re doing fine on iOS 10.2.1, you might want to wait a few days for more long-term feedback to emerge. We’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, we’ve put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making the move to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3 Problems iOS 10.3 went through a lengthy beta but problems have slipped through the cracks. iOS 10.3 users are complaining about a wide range of issues including weird battery drain, issues with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, lag, random reboots, and issues with third-party apps. As of right now, these issues are isolated. They’re also extremely common after a major iOS update release. Most of these iOS 10.3 problems can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or your home. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading iOS 10.3, take a look at our list of fixes. You’ll also want to report it to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix. Downgrade & iOS 10.3.1 If you decide to download the iOS 10.3 update know that there is no longer a way to drop down to another official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 is causing problems for you you’re stuck until Apple rolls out a new version of iOS 10. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can’t drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the iOS 10.3 update’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 either. Also note that you can now “upgrade” to iOS 10.3.1. Apple’s released an iOS 10.3.1 update with bug fixes for iPhone and iPad. The update is tiny but it could have an impact on your device’s performance. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our walkthrough. It goes over performance, problems, and more. Clips Now Available for iPhone & iPad A new feature, which requires the iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 update is now available. Earlier this year, Apple announced a new Clips application. The company promised a release in April and Clips is now out on the App Store. Clips allows select iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 users to create unique videos. It lets you combine video clips, photos and music that you can share via iMessage, Instagram, Facebook or another popular social networking platform. It also features Live Tiles which will let you create animated captions and titles using your voice. You’re then able to add effects like comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters. For more on Clips, take a look at our roundup. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. What’s Next Apple’s already confirmed the next iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date. As of right now the update appears to be a maintenance release which means it’ll probably deliver bug fixes and security patches as opposed to features. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta ahead of time, be aware that Apple’s early software can cause problems. Issues with apps and services, connectivity, and battery life are common beta issues and we expect these, and other problems, to plague the iOS 10.3.2 update as it passes through the company’s beta program. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 10 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

Apple is secretly working on a breakthrough for diabetes patients—something Steve Jobs originally set out to do. According to CNBC, Apple has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to develop sensors that can continuously monitor blood sugar levels without breaking the skin. If Apple’s team is successful, such technology would be implemented in future models of the Apple Watch. Furthermore, the report claims that Apple has been secretly working on this initiative for at least five years. The company is currently conducting feasibility trials in clinics near Cupertino. Apple has also reportedly been in conversations with consultants to figure out “regulatory pathways.” The technology involves optical sensors that can shine a light through the skin to measure glucose, according to one of CNBC’s unnamed sources. As per usual, Apple declined to comment. Before his death, Steve Jobs envisioned this type of optical sensors in wearable technology that could continuously monitor not only blood sugar, but also oxygen levels and other important vitals.  Why this matters: If Apple is successful in creating this next-gen glucose monitor, it would transform the Apple Watch from a wearable accessory to a revolutionary health device. Even though the Watch can now monitor your heart rate and track your activity, it’s obvious Apple wants to add more significant health applications.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Fortunately, retailers like Amazon are here to ease the financial pain of buying Apple's top-of-the-line machines. Currently, the online giant offers the 2015 15.4-inch MacBook Pro for $1,799.99. That's $200 under the Apple Store's direct price and the cheapest price we've seen for this laptop since it launched in May of 2015. (Excluding refurb prices). This media powerhouse packs a 2.2-GHz Haswell Core i7 quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Unlike the 2016 MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, the 2015 MacBook Pro has all the essential connectivity you need including two Thunderbolt 2 ports, two USB ports, HDMI, and an SD card reader. If $1,799.99 still seems like a lot — or if you don't need that much horsepower — Amazon also has the current-gen 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 128GB SSD for $799.99 and the 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 256GB SSD for $999.99. In both instances, the machines are $200 cheaper than Apple's price and the best deals you can currently find for these ultraporables, which — despite having dated tech and no Retina display — are still solid picks for students and other cash-strapped Mac fans who value portability and battery life over raw power. 6 Reasons to Still Buy a MacBook Air Best Apple Laptops 2017 Best Laptop Deals of Today Add a comment Email Firstname Name Comment Back to top Find a Review All Categories Laptops Tablets Accessories All Subcategories Business Desktop Replacement Gaming Multimedia Student Brand ASUS Acer Alienware Aorus Apple CTL Corp.

Supplier Talks About A11 Chip Tech This new technology, which promises performance and area benefits over its older tech, is ready to produce Apple's next chips. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 13, 2017 at 7:00PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) reported its first-quarter earnings and held a conference call discussing the results, outlook, and technology development progress and ramp-up plans. It is widely believed that Apple's A11 chip, which will power the company's iPhone lineup this year, will be manufactured by TSMC using its brand-new 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. The 10-nanometer technology, TSMC has indicated previously, should enable performance and power benefits, as well as a significant transistor area reduction, relative to its 16-nanometer technology, which is currently used to produce some of Apple's A9 chips and all its A10 chips. On TSMC's first-quarter earnings call, the company provided some insight into its progress and revenue expectations vis-a-vis the 10-nanometer technology. Let's go over what the chipmaker had to say. Qualified for production, ready to ramp TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that the 10-nanometer technology, referred to as N10, from "[research and development] to operation in both Fab 12 in Hsinchu and Fab 15 in Taichung and is ready for high-volume production." Wei conceded that this technology is "very challenging," but claimed that the company's manufacturing yield progress is "slightly ahead of schedule" (although it's important to point out that without knowledge of the original schedule, this statement doesn't mean much). Wei also explained that the production ramp-up of its 10-nanometer technology "will be very fast in the second half of this year" and said that the company expects 10-nanometer wafer shipments to contribute "about 10%" of the company's wafer revenue during 2017. That's a lot of iPhone chips Consider that TSMC's revenue from 10-nanometer chips in the first quarter was zero and that its revenue from 10-nanometer chip shipments in the second quarter is likely to be small. For it to make up 10% of the company's total revenue for the year, TSMC is going to need to ship a gargantuan amount of 10-nanometer wafers in the second half of the year. There are only two potential chip vendors that could consume enough leading-edge wafers to drive the kind revenue that TSMC seems to be expecting, and one of them is already known to not be using TSMC, so we know it must be Apple. What this means for Apple For three product generations in a row, Apple has been forced to use manufacturing technology with roughly the same manufacturing density -- 20 nanometer for the A8, and 16 nanometer (which was 20 nanometer with higher-performance transistors grafted on) for the A9 and A10. Apple has managed to increase the amount of performance and functionality of its chips in that time through architectural innovations, transistor performance improvements, and die size growth, but at some point, meaningful improvements without a bigger leap in manufacturing technology become harder to achieve. With 10-nanometer technology, Apple should be able to substantially increase the number of transistors that it allocates to the functionality baked into the chip. This, in a nutshell, means greater performance and feature potential than what would have otherwise been possible. It'll be interesting to see, come this fall, just how Apple chose to utilize this new 10-nanometer technology in its new iPhone models. Considering just how important this year's iPhones are, though, I'm expecting something awesome.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Movie News New Movies Movie Trailers Movie Reviews TV Superheroes MovieWeb Movie News New Movies Movie Trailers Movie Reviews TV Superheroes Is Apple Getting Ready to Buy Disney for $200 Billion? 2.6k Shares ShareTweetShareCommentsEmail Ryan Scott | 8 hours ago Could Apple really be looking at buying Disney? Right off the bat, we need to say that is is just a rumor, and one that is a bit complicated for those who aren't overly well versed in complex business deals. But if this is even remotely true, it is a massive deal. Not only in terms of the amount of money involved, but in terms of what it would mean not just for entertainment, but really for the world. That said, the amount of money involved is enormous. Roughly $200 billion worth of enormous. The report comes from Variety, who are basing the information on an analysis that was done by RBC Capital Markets. According to their research, there is a very real possibility that Apple could be eyeing a purchase of the Mouse House for a borderline unfathomable amount of money. According to them, the figure would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $237 billion. But this is Disney we're talking about, home of Marvel and Star Wars, so it wouldn't come cheap. Here is how they put it, in broad terms. "Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney." This isn't the first massive purchase agreement that has been bandied about in recent months in regards to Disney. A few months ago there was similar chatter suggesting that Disney could be looking at purchasing Netflix so that they could get some skin in the streaming game. As it turns out, this possible purchase of Disney by Apple would have a lot to do with the same thing. Their priority would be to "create an instant competitor to Netflix that would take advantage of the Mouse House's content and Apple's user base." Apple, using Disney's massive library of desirable content, seems like one of the only companies in the world that could possibly find a way to truly compete and possibly take down Netflix. This information suggests that would very much be part of the plan. RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp said this of the possible deal. "Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand." As insane as this may sound, it really isn't out of the realm of serious possibility. Back in 2015, Apple was looking at purchasing Warner Bros. for around $85 million, which ultimately didn't happen. It was AT&T who stepped in to make the deal for Warner Bros. A deal that, as of yet, still isn't finalized. But the point is, Apple is one of the few companies on the planet that could conceivably put together the money to make this deal happen and, while there is a lot that would need to happen, like U.S. regulators needing to give Apple a "tax holiday" to bring in offshore cash to fund an acquisition of Disney, there is a serious benefit from Apple's perspective if they can make this happen. The report notes that this would create a company worth $1 trillion with "almost limitless opportunities in content and technology." If they could make it happen, why wouldn't Apple pull the trigger? Disney has essentially mastered the art of mass appeal and has been ruling the box office for several years now. That has a lot to do with their major acquisitions piling up over the years, collecting brands like Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar, which generate billions for them annually. Combining powers with Apple would create a lot of possibilities and would truly be an unmatched power in the consumer market. It also is worth thinking about what it would do to Netflix, since the streaming service currently has a deal in place with Disney that gives them exclusive access to all of the studio's new movies very shortly after they arrive on Blu-ray/DVD. With Apple wanting to create a competing service, that deal would almost certainly be affected. Still, that may be getting ahead of things a bit, since there is no confirmation this is even happening. Nothing has been said publicly by Apple or Disney on the matter, so for now, this needs to be regarded as a rumor. But it is a deal that is so important its importance and impact can't really be overstated, so this is something to keep your eyes on.

Photo / Getty Although Apple has killed the 'Mac chime', some users have reported hearing a bizarre noise coming from their 15-inch MacBook Pro. A handful of consumers have witnessed a "popping" sound that is similar to that of when you "slowly squeeze a plastic bottle". Although the cause has yet to be determined, some users have speculated that heat is the culprit - it is either causing the laptop stress or melting glue around the hinges. Apple unveiled a radical overhaul of its MacBook in October, which no longer boasts the traditional USB ports and function keys - the Cupertino company replaced them with smaller USB-C ports and a smart touchscreen. The iconic chime was also removed to offer users a more quietter experience - but another strange noise appears to have taken its place. And users who have experienced the issue are sharing their frustrations on Apple's website with the hopes of finding an answer. "I have heard a strange noise from my MBP, and am not sure if this is expected or not. "Model is MacBook Pro 2016 with Touchbar, 15 inch, Radeon Pro 460, 2.9GhZ i7, 2TB SSD," Michael DN shared on the Apple Support page. He continued to explain that the sound is a rare occurrence, as there are occasions when several days pass and he does not hear anything. Continued below.

Wanaka by-election may cost $30,000 However, he also noted that there are instances when the pooping happened two to three times in just a half hour period. "The sound is a single hollow 'popping' noise, similar to if you slowly squeeze a plastic bottle until it crinkles," Michael explained. "The sound is not very loud, but clearly audible, and sounds as if it is coming from approximately behind the trackpad." "I've had no other notable problems with this computer to date, have made no modifications to any hardware, or used it in any abnormal way." Although many are stumped by the sound, some have offered up an opinion. One user speculated that 'the problem is actually from the hinges', 9to5Mac reported. They continued to suggest that heat is the culprit and it has "affected the glue or some plastic mount in the display assembly". Another found that they themselves could "reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle". Some users have been in direct contact with Apple who is also unable to produce a single reason for the noise. The sound is not very loud, but clearly audible, and sounds as if it is coming from approximately behind the trackpad. One MacBook users took their device into an Apple Store to see what the problem was. "I took my laptop in to the genius bar for this popping noise. They said it is caused by this small dent on the bottom casing hitting the fan," users ACA25 shared in the forum. "They told me I had to replace the entire bottom casing for $130." "Not covered under warranty because its user inflicted damage / a wearable part." "I really don't think that's the only problem. But hey... they're the 'geniuses." So check the bottom of your laptops." Another responded noting they also hear the pop notice, but do not have a dent on their MacBook. "There are many people who have pop noise on their macbook2016, and not everyone have a dent on their case," user titfromisere shared. "Mine has pops, and case is perfect." "If the dent would touch the fan, the noise should be permanent. Here we have 3-4 pops when hearing up, and 3-4 pops when cooling dent." The sound appears to be affecting multiple users, but does not seem to be causing any serious issues to the MacBook itself.

Casey Bennett, from Laytonsville, Maryland, was driving home from school the night of April 6 when he was struck by another vehicle – sending him and his Jeep Patriot flying through the air. Bennett, 22, found himself hanging from the driver's seat by just his seat belt, but his iPhone was too far out of reach to call for help.  However, he remembered the Apple Watch included the SOS Emergency feature – he held the side button down and contacted 911 for help, who were on the scene in six minutes. Scroll down for video  Bennett 's iPhone was too far out of reach to call for help. However, he remembered the Apple Watch included the SOS Emergency feature – he held the side button down and contacted 911 for help, who were on the scene in six minutes HOW DOES SOS WORK?  Users simply press and hold the side button underneath the Digital Crown on the Watch for six seconds and the SOS feature will appear. It can either be slid or tapped to activate, which will prompt a countdown from three – this allows users to cancel the call if it was accidentally activated. A text message is also sent out to the wearer's emergency contacts that includes a link with their location. ‘Usually you only think of an Apple Watch to check a text message, but when you don’t have your phone it can be really helpful,' Bennett told DailyMail.com in an interview. ‘I know eventually someone would call for help, but if I didn’t have 911 to speak to after the accident, the six minutes it took paramedics to show up would have felt like six hours. Apple released the SOS feature with WatchOS 3 last June, which works similar to LifeAlert, in that it enables users to easily reach emergency services. Users simply press and hold the side button underneath the Digital Crown on the Watch for six seconds and the SOS feature will appear.

It enabled TSMC to nearly double its revenue growth in the past four to five years, but at the same time it also increases TSMC's risk concentration to a single customer." .: TSMC's Co-CEO Liu is aware of the situation and said his company would continue to develop more customers and products to further diversify its profile. Lui added that "By 2020, we believe high-performance computing products would become the major growth engine for our company."   Apple 3D-Sensing Camera Supplier Largan Worried over Staffing Levels for iPhone 8 Production   Separately, Chief Executive Adam Lin of key iPhone camera supplier Largan Precision told analysts during an earnings call on Thursday that he is worried whether the company's staffing levels will be adequate to meet demand in the second half of this year, as a new facility will only be ready by the end of the third quarter.   Largan is also widely believed to be providing 3D sensing cameras for Apple this year.   Lin's comments raised some questions over whether the new iPhone range will face a component supply shortage amid speculation that its launch event may be delayed. For more on this, read the full Nikkei report here.   There have been a series of rumors and speculative reports on iPhone component shortages of late. This week Barron's posted reports covering Touch ID sensors and 3D Touch sensors potential problems. On most components Apple has sevral suppliers so it's difficult to bank on this many reports hitting the market simultaneously to take them too seriously at the moment. Unless Apple fell asleep at the wheel, I'm sure the number one smartphone in the world is not going to miss the boat.   There's fear in the market from Apple's competitors that the anniversary iPhone is going to take the air out of the market for their products and so negative rumors are bound to continually creep out until the next-gen iPhone is launched.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

"Why am I so dismissive of this? Because while the combination is rational ... the Disney analyst who promoted the idea calls the option — the possibility — 'greater than zero percent,'" the "Mad Money" host said. "Talk about a low bar. They're basically just saying anything's possible." In terms of mutual benefit, the Disney analyst, Steven Cahall, assumes in his note that Apple could get Disney for a 40 percent premium, and the Apple analyst, Amit Daryanani, believes a merger could boost Apple's service revenues to 29 percent of its earnings. Cahall also says that the combination would create a "$1 trillion company with almost limitless opportunities in content and technology" thanks to Apple's cash balances, which could be helped by repatriation, and Disney's low debt. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer: Like 'The Lion King,' an Apple-Disney merger is fiction    8 Hours Ago | 04:55 For Cramer, the biggest problem is the degree of speculation that went into the analyses. "Like 'Aladdin,' like 'Lion King,' the story is fiction," he said. "Apple hasn't done any big deals like this, although the company did say in one conference call that they're open to them." That openness is the crux of the issue — neither company is likely to comment on the speculations, so the thought-out scenario these analysts presented cannot be contested. And although Cahall argues Apple might do well to move away from hardware and better technology at Disney's theme parks could create "a leader in content creation and distribution that could top Netflix, Google, and Amazon," the odds of an acquisition remain slim. "The fact is that if you buy Disney's stock on this, I'd tell you that you might as well believe in Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and Han Solo and Captain Marvel and anybody else in the stable," Cramer said. Dreaming about strong possible mergers is no new tale on Wall Street, from Kraft-Heinz and Unilever to T-Mobile and Sprint to Facebook and Snap. But Cramer noted that it's possible that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Disney CEO Bob Iger, who also sits on Apple's board, may not want the companies to merge. "The only thing that's really accomplished by this kind of speculation? The short-sellers will be afraid to bet against Disney's stock because of newfound fears of a takeover lurking. It really does put a bid underneath, simply because it was just too juicy to ignore," Cramer concluded. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Thus far, all of these efforts have failed. Now, it's Silicon Valley's turn. Apple is the latest to throw its hat in the ring, CNBC reported on Wednesday. The company has a team of about 30 people in an office in Palo Alto working on this problem using optical sensors, which suggests it intends to bring blood sugar tracking to its devices. Biotechnology experts said such a breakthrough would make the Apple Watch a must-have device for millions of people with diabetes. "There is definitely a huge market opportunity here," said Steve Pacelli, executive vice president of strategy and corporate development at Dexcom, maker of glucose monitoring products. Shares of Dexcom briefly dipped on Thursday, following the news of Apple's efforts in the space. A device that could accurately monitor glucose non-invasively and continuously would be a boon for people with type 1 diabetes, who currently rely on finger-pricks and test strips for accurate measurements. It might also prove alluring for people with type 2 diabetes, which affects 29 million adults in the U.S. alone, and so-called "quantified selfers" who are buying glucose monitors to track their blood sugar proactively. The market opportunity is huge, but many are skeptical about whether such technology is viable -- at least in the near-term. "Abbott, Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, Becton, Dickinson and Company and Roche, just to name five established big clinical companies, have taken decades to where we are today," said Doug Schenkel, a senior research analyst with Cowen and Company. "What Apple is trying to do is harder," he added. "This is really tough stuff." Companies like Dexcom have developed continuous glucose monitors for users to get readings every five minutes with a tiny wire under the skin. Alphabet's life sciences arm Verily is also making a bid in this space. Unlike Apple, it is taking a partnership-driven approach. One of its experimental efforts is a contact lens, which reads blood sugar levels in tears. Verily is also working with Dexcom on smaller, cheaper glucose sensors. Despite the challenges with developing non-invasive alternatives, those in the space are not surprised that the opportunity has attracted interest from both Apple and Alphabet. This is "the most expensive health care problem in society today," said Jeff Dachis, chief executive for diabetes app One Drop. The cost of care and related complications is already costing hundreds of billions of dollars, he said, and 1 in 3 people in the United States are at high risk of the disease. "It's a runaway freight train," he said. --Additional reporting by Meg Tirrell and Anita Balakrishnan show chapters Apple working on new diabetes treatment    15 Hours Ago | 02:37 Christina FarrReporter for CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JNJ --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Now, however, an unverified report from iDropNews claims that Apple is testing two different prototypes: one with Touch ID on the front and another with the sensor on the back. The report also offers up a few additional details… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report, citing Foxconn sources, claims that despite two prototypes still being in testing, it’s “highly-likely” that Apple will ship the model with Touch ID integrated into the display. Touch ID embedded into the display is expected to be one of the highlight features of the iPhone 8, but recent reports had casted doubt as to whether or not Apple would be able to pull it off.   Additionally, today’s report claims that the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire front side of the display. The display itself is said to be “2.5 countered glass,” which essentially means that there is a slight curvature around the edges. The back of the device is said to feature the same glass design. In terms of overall size, this report claims that the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display with the same dimensions as the iPhone 7, corroborating earlier reports. There’s also said to be a “large power button featuring two points of contact.” Lastly, today’s report claims that the front-facing camera will be “invisible” and “hidden underneath the display.” This is something that we haven’t heard before, but falls in line with the bezel-less design. Front-facing Touch ID beneath the display. 4mm bezels around the entire edge of the device. 2.5D contoured glass on the front and back of the device surrounded by a metal frame. Wireless charging. Same dimensions as the iPhone 7. 5.8″ OLED display. “Invisible” front-facing camera hidden underneath the display. Large power button featuring two points of contact. Reason unknown. As with a lot of iPhone 8 rumors, however, this should be taken with a grain/heap of salt. It’s hard to know just what direction Apple plans to take with the iPhone 8 this year, and it’s likely that the company itself hasn’t even nailed down a specific path. To go along with its report, iDropNews also has a new set of renders depicting the bezel-less contoured design, the “invisible” front-facing camera, and more. What do you think of these renders?

 Here's how dependent some companies are on Apple's success Jeff Dunn Apr. 13, 2017, 5:54 PM 3,077 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Apple giveth, and Apple taketh away. That’s the lesson Imagination Technologies, Apple’s longtime supplier of graphics processors, has learned of late. After announcing that the iPhone maker was winding down its use of Imagination’s technology, the company’s stock price promptly fell off a cliff that same day. That came after Apple poached a handful of Imagination’s top executives.  As this chart from Statista shows, Imagination is far from the only company with a huge dependency on Apple. While firms like Cirrus Logic, Apple’s audio chip supplier, and Dialog Semiconductor, a power-management chip designer, have reached great heights being a part of Apple’s supply chain, their continued success seems to hinge on staying in the giant’s good graces. Apple is the world’s most valuable company, so it’s bound to drive a high percentage of some firms’ revenue. And the likes of Glu Mobile, a mobile games maker, and Foxconn, the manufacturing titan, aren’t in any danger of being directly replaced by Apple the way Imagination was. But being so reliant does reinforce Apple’s position of power as it puts its devices together. It also limits how high a supplier’s share price can go, which explains why Dialog’s stock recently dropped at the hint of Apple making its own power-management tech.

(AAPL) Is Poised to Kick 32-Bit Apps From App Store The company may drop 32-bit app support altogether with iOS 11 By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 10, 2017, 4:03 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Amazon.com, Inc. Pads Its Amazon Prime Perks (AMZN) Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 May Be Delayed Until November Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Is Countersuing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Recent Posts: Report: Apple Inc. Is Making an Apple Watch for Diabetics (AAPL) Apple Inc. Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC Declines Apple Inc. Loses Top Smartphone Vendor Crown to Samsung (AAPL) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hasn’t held the title of biggest app store for three years. But despite being eclipsed by Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for sheer number of apps and the total user base of iOS being a fraction of the size of Android, AAPL’s App Store remains firmly in top for revenue generated. App developers love the App Store and so do iPhone and iPad owners. Source: Apple But Apple appears poised to make a sweeping change, switching solely to 64-bit apps for iOS 11 and killing off thousands of older apps that haven’t yet been updated. Will that move impact the App Store? AAPL and the Switch to 64-Bit 64-bit CPUs are able to process data far faster than 32-bit versions, and they’re able to take advantage of more RAM. There’s a catch, though. 32-bit CPUs can’t run code written specifically for 64-bit CPUs. And while 64-bit CPUs can run software written for 32-bit processors, they have to use emulation and the user doesn’t see the performance gain the more powerful CPU should offer. Apple was the first smartphone manufacturer to switch to 64-bit CPUs, with the iPhone 5S in 2013. Every iPhone and iPad released since then has been powered by a 64-bit version of AAPL’s AX processors. However, we are now in 2017 and a significant number of apps in the App Store have not been updated to offer native 64-bit support. And it looks as though the clock is ticking. 9to5Mac is reporting Apple is stepping up its campaign to crack down on older apps and will eliminate support for 32-bit apps in iOS 11 this fall. At this point any of these apps would fall under the App Store Improvements program launched by AAPL in September, 2016. They would also stop working on iPhones and iPads that update to iOS 11. Trimming the App Store Clutter Shortly after announcing that improvement program, AAPL began actively reviewing and removing apps that didn’t comply. Last October alone, the company pulled nearly 50,000 apps. To put that in some perspective, it took about a year from its launch for the App Store to hit a grand total of 50,000 apps in 2009. Apple held the app store lead for several years before the momentum of Android caught up. In 2011, Android smartphones took the lead over Apple iPhones in the U.S. market, in 2013 Google Play took the lead in app downloads and in 2015 Google Play took the crown for sheer number of apps available. However, Apple has never been shy about aggressively policing its app store, because sheer numbers don’t matter any more. Bragging rights for having the most apps were important in the early days, not so much now. Despite actions like pulling 50,000 apps in a single month, AAPL’s App Store remains the most popular for premium apps and continues to dominate in terms of revenue — both for Apple and for developers.

"Buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat business," reads the Chronicle in a piece about a rooftop City Park that's being built above the upcoming Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco. Adam Greenspan and Patrick Trollip, who are sourcing trees for that project, say Apple has made it hard to track down trees across California and Oregon. And it's been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple has been buying up 3,000 trees for its new Cupertino headquarters. When Greenspan and Trollip found a tree they fancied they would "tag it" with a locking yellow tag, so that nobody else -- like Apple -- could get it. Eventually all the tagged trees were moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the transbay project team leased 4 acres.Apple Park, Apple's second campus with the famous spaceship-shaped main building, will be completely covered in greenery. Landscaping at the site started late last year, and Apple has said it will plant more than 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, including fruit trees. In a separate report on Apple Park, The Economist highlighted the parking situation at the campus. For the 14,000 workers that Apple plans to have on site, Apple has built nearly 11,000 parking spaces, many of them located in underground lots beneath the main building and in two garages at the south of the campus. In total, Apple has built 325,000 square meters of parking, compared to 318,000 square meters of offices and research buildings. So much space has been dedicated to parking due to Cupertino city laws, which require a certain number of parking spaces for employees. Employees will begin moving into Apple Park in April, but Apple has said it will take more than six months to transition thousands of employees to the site. Smaller building construction and landscaping has not been finished and will continue into the summer, even after the campus sees its grand opening. 65 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) AngerDanger 9 hours ago at 03:26 pm I don't know what they expected. Those things don't grow on—wait. Rating: 14 Votes macduke 8 hours ago at 03:43 pm Trees are great. All I can see out my back windows are thousands of trees, and any time I work from home I sit facing out the window so I can look at the trees and it re-energizes me. My old office had a few of these beautiful trees out my window that turned bright fire orange and yellow in the autumn and had pretty blooms in the spring. When we moved offices our team was put in the basement and it really took a big toll on me—both productivity wise, and emotionally by not getting any daylight or fresh air. So I can see why Apple is so keen to surround their beautiful windowed campus with tons of trees. It's going to be great for their employees, and look good too. Rating: 8 Votes Bart Kela 6 hours ago at 05:49 pm Miss the point much? The trees are not exotic, they are fruit trees. Growing fruit trees is farming. Whether the maintenance and harvesting is contracted out or not (which many farmer and ranch owners do), it is still agriculture. Speaking of around here, around here we are under serious pest and disease threat. The county comes in every few months now and sprays all of our backyard fruit trees. We have only a few of them. Apple will be growing thousands of them. Get it yet? Sorry to hear the fruit trees in Palookaville are struggling. Miss the point much? People farmed fruit trees in Santa Clara Valley for over a hundred years before high tech companies started paving over the orchards and building offices. This was the main industry in the area for over a century in terms of square acreage and labor. There are still orchards here and there are still people who know how to maintain them. Like I said, the City of Saratoga has a sizable well-maintained heritage fruit tree orchard. Heck, your typical professional residential gardener will know something about caring for fruit trees because many of his/her clients will have some in their backyards. Heck, most people in the landscape maintenance business came from farming families and it is highly likely that in any sizable landscaping team that someone in the group grew up on a farm that had some of those trees. Go look at 1 Infinite Loop on a map and find the cross street Mariani Avenue. That street is named after a local fruit tree farmer; the descendants of that family still farm fruit trees in Morgan Hill. And there are a LOT of other streets in the valley that are named after farmers. You make it sound like this is some sort of newfangled risky venture that has never been attempted in Santa Clara Valley and it can only be handled by some horticulture Ph.D. Well, you are completely wrong. Steve put the fruit trees in the plans as a tribute to the area's history. Steve would have known that, he grew up in Santa Clara Valley before it was called Silicon Valley and when there was still a fair amount of acreage that had fruit trees. Get it yet? Rating: 6 Votes Tycho24 7 hours ago at 05:28 pm I wonder how all these fruit trees will be maintained. This is basically farming, not one of Apple's main businesses thus far. I know, right?? I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out how they're going to keep their urinals scrubbed. That hasn't been one of Apple's main businesses so far either; so it's a TOTAL mystery how it happens! Do all the software engineers, industrial designers, marketing guys, and whatnot just draw straws every Monday & see who is on Landscaping Detail & who is on Toilet Scrubbing Detail? I mean, if only there was some kind of a precedent for this!! But.... as you know: lawyer's office's toilets are scrubbed by the senior partners, the president mows the White House lawn, etc. So your question was definitely well thought out & not in the least bit absurd & reminiscent of like the thought process of a 12 year old that found his big brother's chronic stash..... (I jest of course; that is the most RIDICULOUS "musing" one could possibly post!)

This is basically farming, not one of Apple's main businesses thus far. Apple would contract out the work to a landscape maintenance company, one that is skilled in maintaining fruit trees as well as the normal plants used in corporate campus landscaping. It may be the same existing service that currently maintains their various building complexes in Silicon Valley. It's not like Phil Schiller has been driving the lawn mower at 1 Infinite Loop for the past decade. And any decent professional gardener should be able to understand and execute the basic care of common fruit trees. They're not super exotic species, homeowners grow these things in their backyards around here. Remember, most of what is now called Silicon Valley used to be fruit tree orchards. Of course, Apple could simply call the City of Saratoga and ask, "who maintains your heritage orchard?" They don't need to hire rocket scientists for this.

They are subject to pest infestations that need to be controlled, the fruit has to be harvested on a schedule. The people who know how to do that kind of stuff are called farmers. Whether they contract it out or handle it in house, Apple is getting into the farming business. Right?! EXACTLY!!! You get it! You know, like how - it takes specific cleansers, used in the proper manner to keep toilets spotless. The people that know how to do that kind of stuff are called Janitors. Whether or not Apple contracts out their toilet cleaning or handle it in house; Apple is getting into the janitorial business! note: PLEASE don't stop defending your silly stance! I could do this for however long; and it's fairly mirthful! Rating: 3 Votes Michael Scrip 8 hours ago at 04:30 pm I wonder how all these fruit trees will be maintained.

Sources tell CNBC that Apple has a secret team working to develop sensors that could continuously track blood sugar levels. If successful, it would be a breakthrough for people with diabetes, who could glance at their wrists to check glucose levels instead of pricking a finger several times a day. Apple isn't alone. Other companies have been racing, and so far failing, to come up with similar technology. The winner stands to gain a chunk of a global marketplace in blood-sugar monitoring worth more than $12 billion, per Reuters. In the US alone, there are 29 million people with diabetes. Before his death, Steve Jobs envisioned that wearable sensors could be tapped to tackle other health-related issues, such as monitoring vital signs like oxygen levels. The project got a boost in 2010 when Apple bought a company called Cor and hired Bob Messerschmidt, then the enterprising CEO of Cor, who emailed him cold about using sensors for health. Since then, Apple has acquired experts in the field from various biomed companies in a quest to develop technology that could cost the Palo Alto giant up to $1 billion. Apple's team of about 30 people is working on an optical sensor that shines a light through the skin to measure glucose levels. It's not as easy as it sounds. The reason so many other previous efforts have failed is that as far as sensors go, measuring blood sugar is particularly hard, especially if you want to do so without piercing the skin. One expert in the field tells CNBC it's "the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career."

In the past 8 years of MacStories, I've tried organizing financial records and statements with plain text files and PDF documents; I've used and then abandoned dedicated finance management apps; for a couple of years, I even tested a combination of Dropbox, Excel, and Editorial to visualize transactions and generate invoices with a Markdown template. My Italian bank doesn't support direct integrations with third-party accounting services, and my particular requirements often include converting expenses from USD to EUR on a per-receipt basis. Eventually, I always managed to keep my records up to date and neatly sorted with the help of an accountant, but I never loved any of the workflows I had established. In the end, several factors contributed to begrudgingly assembling reports and statements with systems I didn't find flexible enough.

JOIN FOR $5 PER MONTH JOIN FOR $50 PER YEAR Enter Shoeboxed Last year, I discovered Shoeboxed. It was a dream come true. Powered by a mix of computer vision and human editors, Shoeboxed is a web service that can receive PDF expenses, analyze their contents, categorize them based on type and vendor, and even convert dollars to euros based on the historical exchange rate. The latter had been, by far, the most time-consuming aspect of any system I tried. When it comes to filing expenses from a past date and checking their original amount against my bank records, the optimal way is to convert currencies using a historical exchange rate. None of the apps and services I had tested before Shoeboxed supported that functionality, which forced me to manually convert hundreds of expenses every year to double-check their amount in EUR. There are websites that can do it, but they don't have an API, nor do they support input from an existing spreadsheet. Also, they're not pretty. Shoeboxed was the proverbial glass of ice water for someone in bookkeeping hell. Using the Shoeboxed web app, email forwarding, or its integration with Scanbot, I could send any expense as PDF to the service, which would come back a few hours later with a new record automatically filed and converted for me based on the date matched inside the PDF. It felt like magic. At the end of last year, I simply had to generate a full report on Shoeboxed, export it to a spreadsheet, and combine it with a Dropbox1 folder full of PDF invoices, expenses, and bank records to send to my accountant. For all its technical prowess and convenience, though, Shoeboxed wasn't perfect either. The company's iOS app isn't as full-featured as the web version, which has been designed with desktop browsers in mind. Like most web apps that haven't been optimized for touch, Shoeboxed is barely usable on Safari for iPad. I like the unique idea behind Shoeboxed and its underlying technology, but the service – from the lackluster iOS client to the web app – isn't designed for iPad-only users. Numbers 3.1 A couple of weeks ago, Apple released a major update to its iWork suite for Mac and iOS. Normally, I wouldn't peruse the release notes of an iWork update because Apple's productivity apps never appealed to my creative or financial needs. But Numbers 3.1 for iOS caught me by surprise. The app's layout, already optimized for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro since version 3.0, now sports a contextual menu to speed up cell selection and editing. International users can customize dates, times, and currencies for a specific language or region on a per-spreadsheet basis – useful for those who, like me, use their devices in English but don't live in the United States. And more importantly, among other additions, Numbers 3.1 features new functions to calculate the exchange rate between two currencies at any given point in time. As I started experimenting with Numbers, I realized that the changes in version 3.1 could allow me to migrate from Shoeboxed to a system that was not only native to the iPad, but also optimized for the iPad Pro. Switching between bookkeeping apps is never fun, but I figured that, with a couple of days, I could transition to a more solid, integrated, and relatively future-proof setup. And that's what I did. Two weeks ago, I sat down with my iPad Pro and moved my entire accounting system to Numbers. This includes revenue breakdowns by month, tax calculations, expense tracking, charts, and an automated PDF archival system for expenses. I have already shared documents generated by Numbers with my accountant, who also approved of the way I'm tracking different aspects of my business. This is a very personal setup, and I can't share complete spreadsheets with real data. Thus, I'm going to provide a general overview of the new features in Numbers 3.1 I'm taking advantage of, as well as an explanation of functions, formulas, and additional tips that have enabled me to create an accounting system in Numbers. Numbers' Interface Update The most controversial change in Numbers 3.1 is the adoption of a new 'Cell' button aimed at simplifying cell formatting and insertion of formulas, dates, and times. The new button and associated popup menu replace the standard tap & hold behavior (for copy & paste) and dedicated software keyboards for entering numbers and dates. It's easy to understand why Numbers' existing user base isn't reacting positively to such a major change. The update is a significant departure from Numbers' previous implementation of cell editing. If you don't use an external keyboard and you're not editing text inside a cell, copy & paste operations can now only be accessed through the 'Cell' menu, which is slower to activate than the standard clipboard menu as it requires moving your eyes from the cell. Defaulting to the QWERTY keyboard after double-tapping a cell also requires a fundamental rethinking of how formats are applied to cells. As the App Store shows, a lot of users are disappointed and confused by Numbers' new interface. In an effort to simplify and speed up editing and formula insertion for everyone, Apple has alienated a portion of the core Numbers user base – people who have been trusting and relying on Numbers for seven years.2 It's always tricky to ship a piece of software that can scale for novices and power users at the same time, but I believe Apple should find ways to alleviate the problems caused by Numbers 3.1 to more expert users – such as providing more customization options when editing cells and re-enabling the traditional copy & paste menu. In this case, however, I am the novice, and the new Numbers is easier for me to operate. I don't have years of muscle memory and shortcuts ingrained in my usage of the app. From my perspective, the Cell menu is a reasonable addition, as it surfaces common controls that have enabled me to set up different types of formatted cells within minutes. From the menu, I can access unified clipboard features in a bar at the top, and there are buttons to insert the current date, a new formula from scratch, or a formula from a list of suggestions. There's also a large and obvious Autofill button in the upper half of the menu. The new Cell menu in Numbers 3.1. With a combination of the Cell menu and the Format panel (which is displayed on the right side of the UI on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro), I set up cells with dates, currencies, popup menus, and rich text that I have duplicated across a spreadsheet for every month of the year. For someone without a pre-existing knowledge of Numbers, setting up a new spreadsheet has been incredibly intuitive and fast with version 3.1 of the app. Unlike Microsoft's ribbon UI in Excel, Numbers' controls feel native to the platform; the entire app has a sensible organization of nested menus (such as font options) and solid support for iPad-only features. Numbers can be used in Split View, the Format pane adapts to the iPad Pro's display, it has keyboard shortcuts, and it offers extra buttons in the Shortcut Bar. There's an overall fluidity and polish to Numbers' iPad interface that I appreciate after struggling with Excel's Windows-like UI and the design atrocities of Google Sheets.3 I should also mention the ability for Numbers 3.1 to override the system's language and region setting for individual documents. Available in the 'More' menu (the button with the three dots in the top toolbar), a new 'Language & Region' screen allows you to select different regional settings, which will be automatically applied to dates, times, and currency amounts in a sheet. This is a terrific addition for my peculiar needs, and one that I wish Apple would adopt in other apps as well. By setting my spreadsheets to Italian/Italy, I no longer have to worry about cells being formatted with American dates or USD before sharing a document with my accountant.4 I used Numbers on specific occasions in the past (an example), but I always found it somewhat difficult to get started assembling a spreadsheet from scratch. From a usability standpoint, I believe the new Numbers accomplishes its goal of helping spreadsheet novices easily format and manipulate data. At the same time, though, I can see why these changes have irked more proficient Numbers users, and I think their concerns are valid. It'll be interesting to see if and how Apple can find a better balance between the old and new. Calculating Revenue and Taxes As soon as I decided to move to Numbers, I recreated my spreadsheet to track monthly revenue and calculate tax payouts. This was relatively easy to build as it's mostly based on an existing system I was using in Excel before. There's a spreadsheet with multiple sheets in it: the first one is an overview of the entire year, followed by sheets for individual months. There's also a chart in the first sheet to visualize revenue sources by type. Visualizing revenue sources. Every month, I download a complete report from my work bank account with a list of every incoming transaction. The bank's .xlsx file contains additional data and graphics I don't need, so I only select the portion I want and paste it in the sheet of the month it belongs to. At the top of the sheet, there's a section of rows that look for specific words in the name of a deposit to identify the sender. Each row represents a different income source – such as Stripe or iTunes – and the sum of each match yields the total for each category. This can be built using the SUMIF function – a handy tool to sum multiple values within a range only if they satisfy specified conditions – in my case, some plain text to be contained in a 'Description' column. The formula looks like this: SUMIF(F25:F69,"*Stripe*",D25:D69) What this formula says is: "If you find a match for "Stripe" between cells F25:F69, sum the corresponding values of cells D25:D69". By repeating this formula for different types of deposits on my bank account, I can accurately track multiple revenue sources for each month. Then, I can sum all the categories to get a complete monthly revenue overview, and use another formula to calculate how much I'll owe the government in taxes. Summing revenue sources in a sheet. The SUMIF function isn't exclusive to Numbers, but I find it interesting and useful nonetheless. The function works by evaluating a set of test values – in this spreadsheet, the Description column with details on each incoming transaction. Optionally, you can provide sum values to the function, which correspond to cells on the same row; if you don't pass sum values, however, SUMIF will simply evaluate whatever it finds in the test ones. Speaking of evaluation, Numbers uses an expression that outputs a Boolean value of TRUE or FALSE. Expressions can contain comparison operators, references, concatenations, and wildcards – which should be familiar to anyone who's ever dabbled in regular expressions. In my monthly revenue sheets, I use the multiple-character * wildcard to match any character surrounding the name of the category I'm looking for. At this point, I'm still pasting the total of each month manually into the first sheet (the one with the annual revenue overview). I should probably consider automating this process with references to specific cells on different sheets, which I'm going to tackle next. Organizing and Calculating Expenses Whether I was using Google Sheets, Excel, or reports from Shoeboxed, for the past few years I've always tracked monthly expenses with a spreadsheet. With the latest Numbers, I've been able to create a "smart" spreadsheet that, besides tracking items and summing them up, also converts expenses from USD to EUR if necessary. Every month, I deal with expenses in two currencies. One of the best aspects of Shoeboxed was that it could intelligently understand when to convert USD to my primary currency; I wanted to create a similar system in Numbers. With a couple of nested conditions and the new CURRENCYH function, I've come up with an expense sheet that converts American dollars to euros only if an original amount in EUR is not present, using the row's referenced date for the historic exchange rate. First, let's consider how I organized the sheet. There are 9 columns: Date Description Category Type (single payment or subscription) Kind (website-related cost or other expense) USD amount EUR amount Link to PDF file Total While the Description column contains text fields where I type expense descriptions manually, the other detail fields (Category, Type, and Kind) are cells that use a popup menu. I find the popup format to be an effective solution for items that carry one among multiple fixed attributes, and they're easy to put together. To make the spreadsheet more fun and legible at a glance, I spiced up the Category popup menu with some emoji. My accountant likes them, too: Making popup menus prettier with emoji. The detail fields and URLs in the Link column have no effect on the total calculation in Column I. The date and amounts in the currency columns are the essential pieces of the formula – especially because columns F and G use the currency code as header (more on this below). Now, let's look at my first two expenses of the year to understand my problem: The first expense was in EUR; the second was in USD. While the first expense took place in Italy and uses EUR as currency, the second one is in USD. Thus, I need a system that can skip currency conversion if the original expense is already in EUR, but calculate the conversion rate if the original amount is in USD. In addition, the conversion needs to use the value from the Date cell to provide a historically accurate conversion. There's an easy way to check if a cell is empty in Numbers: the IF function combined with an ISBLANK condition. The IF function, as in most programming languages, is based on an expression that is evaluated by the program; this expression can output different data if the expression returns True or False.5 On the other hand, ISBLANK returns a Boolean value depending on whether a selected cell is empty or not. In my case, I set up the sheet so that each cell in the Total column contains this formula. If the USD cell on the same row is blank (ISBLANK returns True), it means there's a EUR amount for the expense, so the Total cell can use it. If the check returns False, however, a currency conversion from USD needs to happen. There are two types of currency functions in Numbers 3.1: CURRENCY and CURRENCYH. Both functions return data about the exchange rate between two currencies, and they need an Internet connection to retrieve exchange rates remotely.6 The difference between the two is that while CURRENCY calculates the exchange rate for the current day, CURRENCYH returns historical data on the exchange rate for any given past date. Both functions need a currency code as input, but CURRENCYH also requires a date string to perform the historical lookup. With these elements in mind, here's an example of what the complete formula I put in every cell of the Total column looks like: IF(ISBLANK(F71),G71,F71 × CURRENCYH(F$1,G$1,0,A71)) Or, in English: If cell F71 is blank, use value from the EUR column in cell G71. Otherwise; Perform a historical exchange rate lookup for the date in cell A71 using currency codes in cells F1 and G1, calculated at the close of trading day; Multiply USD amount from cell F71 to the just-calculated historical exchange rate to obtain a date-adjusted amount in EUR. This process isn't as automatic as throwing a PDF into Shoeboxed: I need to enter and categorize every expense manually. However, that's a trade-off I accept if it means fewer services to pay for and a single spreadsheet that looks great on the iPad Pro. The full formula in Numbers. Historical exchange rate calculation is such a niche feature, I'm surprised Apple shipped it. And in my tests, CURRENCYH has performed remarkably well, correctly calculating the exchange rate for hundreds of expenses in my document. There are some aspects of this feature I'd like to see Apple improve, though. Some dates – such as past holidays and no-trading days – display an error if an exchange rate isn't available for that day. I'd like to see Numbers offer an option to calculate the historical exchange rate based on the nearest available date or from a range of dates.7 And, there should be a way to perform a full currency conversion from an original amount to another currency instead of having to multiply by a baseline like I do. Numbers tells you what the next available date for exchange rate calculation is, but it doesn't do anything more than that. Overall, I'm happy with the presentation of my new expense-tracking spreadsheet and its currency conversion functions. To make it easier for my accountant to parse individual months, I've added colored separators between months. You might notice that I'm using San Francisco Text and Display as fonts; I downloaded both typefaces from Apple's developer website and installed them with AnyFont so I decide where I want to use which. Under each month, I've also included a breakdown of monthly expenses by category. Finally, there's an automation angle to my move to Numbers, too. With Numbers and Safari/Newton in Split View, I can quickly upload PDF receipts to a predefined Dropbox folder. All it takes is running my 'Save Expense' workflow from the action extension on any PDF document. My workflow to save PDF receipts for expenses to Dropbox. To save time when filing PDFs into the appropriate sub-folders in my Dropbox, the workflow looks at the PDF's file name and, if it finds a match for recurring expenses (such as Stripe, Rackspace, or Writers), it uploads the file to the category's dedicated folder. The workflow then copies a link to the newly uploaded file to the clipboard, which I can paste into Numbers' Link cell. I can go from a PDF on my iPad to a Dropbox link for an intelligently-filed PDF in under 15 seconds, which is pretty neat. Numbers' new currency functions are fantastic improvements for small business owners who operate in the Internet era at a global scale in multiple currencies. I have a lot of ideas on where to take my accounting system next: I'd like to handle even more currencies at the same time (for the occasional GBP expense, for instance), and I want to figure out a way to compare monthly revenues to expenses automatically, rather than manually as I currently do. I want to create more charts, calculate monthly averages for recurring expenses, and I need to set up iCloud launchers to quickly access my spreadsheets from anywhere. I have a lot of work ahead to further optimize my finance management system for Numbers. But I feel like I've found a new home and, after several years, a system that I can fully customize to my needs. In 8 years, Dropbox has been the only constant in my accounting system. All my most important documents are stored and shared with Dropbox. ↩︎ Probably even more – I'm only considering Numbers' original iPad release in 2010. ↩︎ Though, to be fair, Google Sheets has the huge benefit of integrating with automation services like Zapier. I can't use automation for accounting, but I recommend Google Sheets if you want to automate data collection in an online spreadsheet. ↩︎ Interestingly, once you enable collaboration on a spreadsheet, you can no longer change its Language & Region settings. Apple says that "adjusting spreadsheet language and region settings while collaborating is coming soon". ↩︎ An expression can also output a number; 0 is treated as False, while any other number is considered to be True. ↩︎ According to Apple's documentation, financial data is provided by Yahoo. ↩︎ Which I believe Google Sheets supports with the GOOGLEFINANCE function. ↩︎ Tags: iPad Diaries, iwork Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: ConceptsiPhone, YouTube How Apple might make the same iPhone battery last even longer Chris Smith @chris_writes April 13th, 2017 at 4:58 PM Share Tweet If you’re following Apple news closely, you may have heard rumblings that Apple is working on its own battery management chips. But in addition to hardware, Apple is also working on software meant to improve battery life on its devices. A new revelation indicates that Apple is looking to make battery management smarter in the near future, a move that could potentially have other beneficial side-effects, like preventing iPhones from exploding. Don't Miss: How to get two Joy-Con steering wheels for Mario Kart 8 on the Nintendo Switch for $1 “Adaptive battery life extension” is the name of an Apple patent awarded to Apple on April 4th. The documentation describes means through which an Apple device powered by a battery, such as the iPhone, iPad, or MacBook, could benefit from a smart power management system that would be able to interpret various battery parameters and then prolong battery life so that it lasts until the user is able to recharge said device. Apple already offers means of extending battery life on an iPhone or iPad — the Low Power Mode — but that requires user interaction. The patent describes technology that would work behind the scenes to improve battery life on a device. Moreover, Apple says the adaptive battery life extension (ABLE) unit running within the operating system would constantly analyze battery life and actively adapt battery consumption to extend battery life. Image Source: Apple via USPTO “Users of battery powered devices generally prefer that the battery does not run out while they are using the device,” Apple says. “User level power management may try to extend the life of the battery by reducing power consumption at the cost of reduced performance as the battery approaches depletion. Most of the conventional systems perform such power management actions only when the battery is already very low. Sometimes this may amount to too little too late.” To predict battery life consumption at any moment, the ABLE unit would keep track of the user’s behavior and the battery use and battery recharge history. The system would store information about the user’s past battery charge and discharge rates, and use it to determine whether the current discharge rate is within expected parameters and whether the battery will last until the next expected recharge cycle. Image Source: Apple via USPTO The ABLE unit would also instruct the system on whether certain energy intensive tasks should be allowed based on the battery levels and battery level predictions. Content download, video streaming, or system updates may be postponed to prevent a battery discharge. On top of accessing battery status information, and relevant historical data, the software would also be able to interpret the user’s actions. Apple says that using a boarding pass to check into a flight on a plane would tell the iPhone that the user is about to enable flight mode. The ABLE unit would then try to make sure the iPhone lasts through the flight by reducing certain energy-intensive tasks, as it would also know how long the trip lasts. If the user buys a drink in a coffee shop using Apple Pay, the iPhone would know that the user may want to read the news or play games on the device and improve performance even if that means battery life would take a hit. Similarly, the iPhone would be able to determine when the user is at work or when he or she is watching a movie, and adapt battery consumption accordingly. Image Source: Apple via USPTO All this would happen without bothering the user with notifications about battery life status and discharge rates. The system would optimize battery life without the user’s knowledge. “Each user may have different behavior and pattern, by employing a user agent within the portable device, the user level power management system can ‘learn’ that particular user’s behavior and adapt to that particular user’s life style, even without the user knowledge,” Apple explains. With enough information about what the user is doing, the system could also make sure the iPhone doesn’t overheat while in use. The obvious side effect here is that a smart battery monitoring software embedded in iOS and macOS could prevent battery-related explosions — the patent was filed in November 2015, well ahead of the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, so this isn’t a response to Samsung’s battery problem. Finally, the smart battery management tool can also be used to determine whether the device is coupled to a charger in good condition. The ABLE unit would determine whether the charger can be used to recharge the device while it’s in use, or whether it needs to throttle performance to accommodate charging. It’s unclear when such a smart battery management system would be included in iOS and/or macOS, but it seems pretty clear that Apple is looking to safely improve battery life in its devices without increasing battery capacity. A recent patent revealed that Apple may want to keep tabs on what an iPhone user is doing to suggest automated tasks. If that’s indeed a feature of the next iPhone, it would be reasonable to assume that a smart battery management tool is also in the works, given the rather large metadata it needs to collect for it to work.

A schematics image leak on Weibo sheds light on iPhone 8 design details, indicating that it could not sport a completely-bezel-less wraparound display, but instead just reduce bezel chin on all sides, and try to make it as edge-to-edge as possible. The fingerprint sensor in this sketch is seen at the back, below the Apple logo, and this suggests that the company won't embed it underneath the screen. Furthermore, the dual camera setup is situated vertically, something that has been seen in previous leaks as well. The drawing suggests that the iPhone 8 is measured at 149x72.5x7.1mm wide, a slight difference from iPhone 7's measurement at 138x67.1x7.1mm - but the same thickness. Photo Credit: Weibo A research note from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company (via AppleInsider) suggests that Apple could ditch the Touch ID fingerprint integration underneath the display due to yield issues. The company has been facing a lot of trouble in ramping up yield rates due to the new fingerprint technology, and it may just adopt other methods to ensure smooth yield rate. "For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display - the current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products," Arcuri wrote. Arcuri suggests that Apple could solely rely on facial recognition as a fall back option, or it could move the Touch ID fingerprint sensor at the back of the phone, even though it is not user friendly. The analyst also suggests that Apple could stick to the plan, but delay production and sale, even though announcement will happen alongside the iPhone 7s. The analyst also claims that 3D sensors are also causing hiccups in production, something that has been reported earlier as well. MacRumors also got hold of a report by Arcuri, and it reveals that all the three iPhones will have 3GB of RAM, and while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will stick to the 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB storage variants, the iPhone 8 will be offered in 64GB and 256GB configurations only. The report also states that the iPhone 8 will have two battery packs to increase battery life, and will continue to sport a Lightning port. The iPhone 8 is additionally expected to introduce wireless charging, waterproofing, a front 3D sensor camera, and no Home Button.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone - no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a million-dollar vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings by researchers at New York University (NYU) and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints, digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers were able to develop a set of artificial "MasterPrints" that could match real prints similar to those used on phones as much as 65 per cent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. "It's almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it's almost certainly pretty darn bad," said Professor Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. "If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into one in 10 phones, that's not bad odds." Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google's Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger - say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. As a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. "It's as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one," said Professor Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, published in IEEE Transactions On Information Forensics And Security. The other authors are Dr Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at Tandon School, and Professor Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Prof Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 per cent to 50 per cent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone's fingerprint system was one in 50,000, with one fingerprint enrolled. Apple spokesman Ryan James said the firm had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google's standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Professor Stephanie Schuckers of Clarkson University, who is director of the Centre for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrints findings. She said the researchers used a commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. She noted that mobile-phone makers are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Still, the team's fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Mr Chris Boehnen, the manager of the United States federal government's Odin programme, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. "What's of concern here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low," he said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, "but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it". Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Mr Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung's new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Prof Memon said that, despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. "I'm not worried," he said. "I think it's still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I'd rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it's idle for one hour."

On Apple's support site, and on various other forums, many of them have described a strange 'popping' sound coming from their notebooks, similar to the sound heard when you "slowly squeeze a plastic bottle". The problem appears to affect the 15-inch MacBook Pro more than the 13-inch models, and while some describe the issue occurring at random, others say they've only encountered it when engaged in more intensive tasks, such as playing games or streaming videos. 9to5Mac reports that some speculation has focused on the possibility that plastic components or glue used in the device's construction are being affected by heat being generated by the laptop. One user said they were "able to constantly reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle." Another user, who said the popping sound was as loud "as a trackpad click", told Business Insider that it happens "multiple times a day. Notably when i open the laptop - usually after about 30ish seconds, but not every time. And then every 20-100 minutes after that. Some users claimed that Apple had replaced parts of their MacBook Pros under warranty to try to fix the issue, without success. Others said that Apple had blamed the problem on a "dent" in the bottom casing of the device, requiring them to pay $130 for repairs, despite many users having described the same issue without such a dent present on their machines. Whatever the issue, it's clearly annoying, but it doesn't appear to be a serious problem. Even so, those paying as much as $4,299 for the new MacBook Pro would obviously prefer to use it without such irritations.

There probably isn't. People like the stocks anyway. Alex Rosenberg | @AcesRose 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Trading Nation: Apple to buy Disney?    12 Hours Ago | 02:43 RBC research analyst Amit Daryanani says there's an off chance that Apple could acquire Disney, but some investment professionals think it's an exceptionally off chance indeed. While admitting that the odds of such a tie-up "are low," Daryanani wrote in a Thursday note that "We see a confluence of events that make an acquisition of DIS [by Apple] a 'greater than 0%' probability event." "AAPL's focus on services and its inability (so far) to replicate its music/iTunes strategy into content/media make acquiring DIS logical in our view," the analyst explained, adding: "This is particularly true if AAPL can access $200B+ in offshore cash via repatriation holiday." But even if there is a case to be made for such a deal, many heavily discount the chance of it happening. "One large company buying another large company really just isn't good business sense," Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Global, said Thursday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "Being categorized as a media entertainment company could possibly increase Apple's multiple," Gibbs acknowledged in an email to CNBC, "but most of the criticism of Apple revolves around its slowing growth, and Disney is growing at a slower place. One would more likely expect an acquisition to increase the growth rate rather than lower it." On top of that, Disney makes a great deal of its money from theme parks, and technology products drive Apple, so "the two companies have very little overlap when it comes to the main revenue sources." "I do see some merit in it, but it is an off-the-wall proposal," Mark Tepper of Strategic Wealth Partners said Thursday on "Power Lunch." After all, Apple's biggest-ever acquisition was that of Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion. Daryanani's assumption is that Apple would pay a healthy premium and acquire Disney for $237 billion. To be sure, this could be doable given the massive amount of cash on Apple's balance sheet. But whether Apple would see fit to take such an outsized risk is another question. Getty Images Bob Iger, chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, walks with Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. last July. And it's not clear that investors would see much merit in such a tie-up. The recent trend has been for companies to spin off separate businesses, rather than to combine into massive conglomerates. The fact that Apple and Disney are two separate stocks allows investors to select which one they'd rather own. Currently, Tepper is a fan of Disney, saying that its "strong slate" of upcoming films and the robust performance of its theme parks are bullish catalysts. Gibbs, meanwhile, likes both stocks. And Daryanani, for his part, ranks Apple "outperform" and maintains his $155 price target on the $141 stock, with "iPhone 8 cycle tailwinds" serving as the primary bullish catalyst. Disney shares hit a sixteen-month high on Thursday, but that doesn't mean investors are taking the buyout talk too seriously. The stock closed just slightly up on the day, at $113.20. Meanwhile, those shares would be valued at about $157 on a takeout, according to the analyst.

Share This Article: By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 11 hours ago Jesse Hollington Home automation maker Koogeek is back, adding its second HomeKit-enabled accessory to the mix. Koogeek's new Wi-Fi Enabled Smart Socket is a lightbulb adapter that fits into any standard E26/E27 light socket, allowing you to control any attached bulb from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Apple TV using HomeKit, while also adding the ability to monitor and record the amount of power your attached light bulb is consuming. Koogeek’s Smart Socket is basically the same concept as Incipio’s CommandKit Wireless Smart Light Bulb Adapter and iDevices’ Socket — it screws into a light fixture, and you then screw a standard light bulb into it, and use HomeKit to toggle your lighting on or off. A button on the side also allows the Smart Socket to be controlled manually; like most bulb-based HomeKit accessories you’ll want to avoid using your normal light switch to turn your lights on and off, as you’ll lose HomeKit control if the Smart Socket isn’t powered from the source. It’s worth noting, however, that Koogeek’s Smart Socket is only rated for a maximum load of 25W, so for all practical purposes you’ll be limited to using LED or CFL bulbs with it. Notably, Smart Socket only provides on and off controls — unlike Incipio and iDevices’ products, there’s no dimming feature. Smart Socket is also similar in size and profile to the iDevices Socket; while it’s a few millimetres shorter in height, that’s doesn’t make a significant difference, so it still suffers from the same limitations as the other sockets we’ve looked at — you’ll basically only be able to use it in a fixture where you can afford an extra couple of inches of space. Setting up Smart Socket is handled the same way as any other HomeKit accessory, and Koogeek has helpfully printed the HomeKit pairing code on the side of the Smart Socket as well as inside the box. You can add Smart Socket to your HomeKit home using Apple’s iOS 10 Home app or just about any other HomeKit app you may already be using — there’s no need to download Koogeek’s app for basic use, although you will need it to update the Smart Socket’s firmware as well as take advantage of the power consumption monitoring features. Koogeek has updated its HomeKit app with several new features since the last time we looked at it, adding Apple Watch and 3D Touch support, along with a UI that’s very similar to Apple’s own Home app. As noted, you’ll need to use Koogeek’s Home app if you want to monitor the power being consumed by your light bulbs, as unfortunately there’s not yet any HomeKit interface for power consumption monitoring. Unlike outlets, we’re not sure too many users care about being able to monitor the power consumption from an LED light bulb, but it works well enough, providing monthly and daily power consumption graphs, as well as a real-time wattage indicator, although there’s no way to export or even aggregate the data at this point so you’ll be limited to viewing it within the app. device by device. As with the company’s Wi-Fi SmartPlug, Koogeek’s Home app also provides the ability to create basic on/off schedules apart from HomeKit that are stored and run directly in the Smart Socket. This can be useful if you don’t have an Apple TV or iPad to act as a Home Hub but still want to run lighting schedules when away from home. Koogeek’s Smart Socket is a useful if somewhat niche HomeKit product; there’s really no appeal or value to using adapters like these throughout your home as opposed to simply investing in something like a Philips Hue system. While Smart Socket can certainly be useful for “one-off” cases where you have a specific speciality light bulb you want to automate, it’s hard to justify a $55 light socket adapter when you can purchase a Philips Hue White Starter Kit for $80, which includes two white LED bulbs and the Hue Bridge, and can then be expanded further for only $15 for each additional basic white bulb — not to mention that you get standard-sized light bulbs that can be used in any fixture. Essentially, Koogeek’s Smart Socket is a competent product, but it’s really only worthwhile for users with very specific needs.

That means anything developers need to do in iTunes Connect and related services need to be handled before the morning of the 22nd. Apple’s iTunes Connect will be down for maintenance on April 22nd In a note to registered Apple Developer Program members Apple said the following services will be offline during the scheduled window: App build upload in Xcode Application Loader and altool iTunes Connect iTunes Connect Mobile iTunes Producer Transporter Apple says developers can’t submit new content, or make changes to existing content during while the services are down for maintenance. Since Apple is alerting everyone a little over a week in advance, and scheduling the down time for a Saturday, developers should have enough time to plan around the maintenance window.

There is little regulation. AIs can be manipulated in clever ways. Small devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo have very indirect business models so that they can be priced for the middle class, but have hidden drawbacks. I wonder where all this will lead with family service robots if Apple doesn’t step in and do it right. The home invasion is on. Image credit: Bluefrogrobotics. More and more, I wish Apple would jump in, set a new, higher standard, and use its financial muscle and reputation to do it right. Just as Apple engineers may be doing with Apple Watch and blood glucose measurement. Thankfully, Apple has joined the Partnership on AI, but I am skeptical that such an organization can reign in the worst instincts of some companies not in the organization—or even within. Case in Point As these small, AI driven devices and their mobile siblings like Siri and Cortana become more sophisticated, and start to become independently mobile as family service robots (or dangerous dolls) they’ll also fall prey to shenanigans that will create new headaches for consumers. First of all, companies are very good at extolling the benefits of these robots, but with sophistication comes a newfound onus on the consumer to be very astute about their use. My example here is a recent trick played by Burger King on Google Home users. You can read about it here: “Burger King advert sabotaged on Wikipedia.” It backfired badly, and it makes me wonder how anyone at Burger King thought this would be a good idea. It was a mild form of what’s called cross-device tracking, something which in full form is much more malicious. Basically, today, AI and internet technologies are so sophisticated that if something can be done to make money, it will be. Either by thoughtless corporations or by the bad guys. Robot Design I know that companies that build small, friendly family service robots are cognizant of the need for the robot to not be physically imposing. They have big eyes and remind you of a kitten, not a Transformer. After all, if you combine physically strong robots with extrapolated hacking technologies, large muscular family service robots could be turned into lethal weapons. Buddy. Image credit: Bluefrogrobotics Two of these robots that I’m tracking are Pepper and Buddy. I’ll have more to say about them later. Pepper is more of a business tool, but Buddy really is designed for the home. I don’t have a lot of confidence that there will be strict government regulation of these devices, no matter how invasive they become or susceptible to hacks. And so, as we all do, there will be a cautious trade between convenience and security risks—just as we do now with Amazon’s Alexa. Pepper chatting with child. Image credit: Soft Bank Robotics. A New Beginning AI’s have gotten off on the wrong foot, just a bit, by being tied to a network. The good news is that they’re driven by much more powerful servers than can be packed into a small robot. That means the network dependence of the AI’s means huge potential gains in power with the locally limited hardware, but it also means opportunities for dirty tricks. And that even extends to the users! Right now the evidence shows that if a dorky and invasive technical stunt can be pulled off to make a few bucks, it will be. Of course, we don’t see the many cases when corporations exercised restraint, but my feeling is that, sitting behind their consoles, corporate data center managers see opportunities everywhere to abuse consumers. The stand-off distance is great enough that people are seen as a collective mass rather than individual families. This is why, I hope Apple will eventually get into this business and set a very high bar, just as the company has with iPhone encryption and privacy. Apple doesn’t need to sell you a burger and has better ways to sell you a movie than have its robot lecture you. Once your family service robot figures out how to operate and take control of your home entertainment system or grocery list, all bets are off. Fortunately, today, you can still pick it up, dash its brains out and throw it in the trash. For now.

It would be a new market that’s not being serviced by anyone very well, much like the MP-3 player or Smart Phone markets were. It would leverage their interest in AI and AR technology. It also would fit with their ‘devices to make peoples lives better’ core principal. Far better than electric cars or TV shows certainly.

Users report bizarre noise from devices - and no one knows what's causing it Numerous users reported hearing a popping sound from their MacBook Pro Said it is similar to that of when you 'slowly squeeze a plastic bottle' Said heat could be stressing the laptop or melting the glue around the hinges By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 16:35 EDT, 13 April 2017 | Updated: 18:07 EDT, 13 April 2017 e-mail 15 shares 93 View comments Although Apple has killed the 'Mac chime', some users have reported hearing a bizarre noise coming from their 15-inch MacBook Pro. A handful of consumers have witnessed a 'popping' sound that is similar to that of when you 'slowly squeeze a plastic bottle'. Although the cause has yet to be determined, some users have speculated that heat is the culprit - it is either causing the laptop stress or melting glue around the hinges. Scroll down for videos  Users reported a 'popping' sound that is similar to that of when you 'slowly squeeze a plastic bottle' coming from their MacBook Pro. Some users have speculated that heat is the culprit - it is either causing the laptop stress or melting glue around the hinges MACBOOK PRO SPECS  At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 per cent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 per cent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Retina display on the new MacBook Pro is an 67 per cent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wide color gamut.  Apple unveiled a radical overhaul of its MacBook in October, which no longer boasts the traditional USB ports and function keys - the Cupertino company replaced them with smaller USB-C ports and a smart touchscreen. The iconic chime was also removed to offer users a more quietter experience – but another strange noise appears to have taken its place. And users who have experienced the issue are sharing their frustrations on Apple's website with the hopes of finding an answer. 'I have heard a strange noise from my MBP, and am not sure if this is expected or not.  Model is MacBook Pro 2016 with Touchbar, 15 inch, Radeon Pro 460, 2.9GhZ i7, 2TB SSD,' Michael DN shared on the Apple Support page. He continued to explain that the sound is a rare occurrence, as there are occasions when several days pass and he does not hear anything. However, he also noted that there are instances when the pooping happened two to three times in just a half hour period.

Share this article Share 15 shares 'The sound is a single hollow 'popping' noise, similar to if you slowly squeeze a plastic bottle until it crinkles,' Michael explained. 'The sound is not very loud, but clearly audible, and sounds as if it is coming from approximately behind the trackpad.' Other users found they could  'reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle'. The sound appears to be affecting multiple users, but does not seem to be causing any serious issues to the MacBook itself 'I've had no other notable problems with this computer to date, have made no modifications to any hardware, or used it in any abnormal way.' Although many are stumped by the sound, some have offered up an opinion. One user speculated that 'the problem is actually from the hinges', 9to5Mac reported. They continued to suggest that heat is the culprit and it has 'affected the glue or some plastic mount in the display assembly'. Another found that they themselves could 'reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle'. THE HISTORY OF THE 'MAC CHIME'  The iconic startup sound has been part of the Mac in 1990s and although the Mac has drastically changed, the function was something that remained the same.  The F-sharp sound was used in the 2008 Pixar film Wall-E. Power Macs had an electronic jazz guitar strum and the 20th Anniversary Macintosh had a poppy remix of the classic bong as a tribute to the original Mac, reports Pingie.com. But all Mac computers post the iMac G3 have had the same sound – an F-Sharp cord sound modulated from a PowerMac startup sound. Some users have been in direct contact with Apple who is also unable to produce a single reason for the noise. One MacBook users took their device into an Apple Store to see what the problem was. 'I took my laptop in to the genius bar for this popping noise. They said it is caused by this small dent on the bottom casing hitting the fan,' users ACA25 shared in the forum. 'They told me I had to replace the entire bottom casing for $130.' 'Not covered under warranty because its user inflicted damage / a wearable part.' 'I really don't think that's the only problem. But hey... they're the 'geniuses.' So check the bottom of your laptops.' Another responded noting they also hear the pop notice, but do not have a dent on their MacBook. 'There are many people who have pop noise on their macbook2016, and not everyone have a dent on their case,' user titfromisere shared. 'Mine has pops, and case is perfect.' 'If the dent would touch the fan, the noise should be permanent. Here we have 3-4 pops when hearing up, and 3-4 pops when cooling dent.' The sound appears to be affecting multiple users, but does not seem to be causing any serious issues to the MacBook itself. DailyMail.com has contacted Apple regarding the issue and has yet to receive a response.    Read more: Popping Sound, MBP 2016 | Official Apple Support Communities Growing number of 15″ MacBook Pro users report ‘popping’ sound coming from their laptop | 9to5Mac Share or comment on this article e-mail 15 shares Most watched News videos 'Mother of all bombs' tested by the US military in 2003 'Look at me when I am talking to you!': Moscow blasts UK Knife wielding man is wrestled to the ground on London bus Shocking moment a horse attacks an alligator in Florida Dramatic moment mob hold down man who allegedly 'filmed under skirt' Sean Spicer announces dropping of GBU-43 bomb in Afghanistan 'Who Gave You Your Manners?': Lavrov Scolds Andrea Mitchell 'You have to drag me': David Dao just before United incident Rapturous reception for Kim Jong Un opening residental complex Trump said in 2015 that he would 'Bomb the sh*t out of ISIS' Silverback gorila attacks a group of tourists in Rwanda Muslim women explain how men should hit their wives ISIS hammered as US drops biggest non-nuclear weapon...

Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Is Developing Sensors For Apple Watch To Monitor Diabetes Posted: Apr 13 2017, 1:24pm CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Apple   Apple secretly working on high-tech sensors for diabetes treatment   A team of biomedical engineers have been hired by Apple to develop blood sugar detecting sensors Tech mogul Apple has just hired a group of biomedical engineers to work on a new type of diabetes treatment. Rumor has it they are part of a super-secret initiative to develop sensors for monitoring blood sugar. The plan is supposedly initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 The team working on the new diabetes treatment is situated at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California. This is many miles away from the main corporate headquarters of Apple. Engineers from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo, Sano, Medtronic and C8 Medisensors have been scouted by Apple.  The sensors being developed are slated to work noninvasively and continuously in monitoring blood sugar levels. If the rumors are true then the discovery of such sensors will be equal to the "holy grail" in the field of life sciences, according to CNBC. For one many have already tried and failed since tracking glucose levels accurately without invasive measures is highly complicated. People on the inside claim that Apple’s initiative to detect glucose without piercing the skin is far enough they have started conducting feasibility trials. They have also hired consultants from the Bay Area to help figure out the regulatory pathways of the circulatory system.  The same sources reveal Apple has been working on this project for the last three years. Steve Jobs had envisioned the use of wearable devices to monitor vitals such as blood glucose, oxygen levels and heart rate. Apple also acquired the company Cor back in 2010, which was working on sensor technology for the use of health and wellness. The new secret team will report directly to Johny Srouji who is the senior vice president of hardware technologies at Apple. This story may contain affiliate links.

Mark Julian | 4/13/2017 Filed Under: "Avengers" Source: Variety Similar to how AT&T purchased Warner Bros. for $85 billion, Apple is reportedly weighing whether to pursue acquistion of The Walt Disney Company.   Variety reports [via RBC Capital Markets ]that Apple would need to come up with $200+ billion to pull off such a deal.   It's said that Apple is looking to build an instant competitor to Netflix, with all of Disney's TV and film library available on it's iPhones, iPads and MacBooks.  In addition, Apple would integrate all of its tech products and softeare into Disney's various theme parks around the world.   Also of interest is the disclosure that Apple was looking at potentially acquiring Warner Bros. prior to the studio's merger with AT&T last Fall.   This latest rumor comes on the heels of speculation that Disney was weighing whether to make an offer to purchase Netflix, a move that anlysts questioned and they've since backed away from. Again, similar to the AT&T and WB merger (which is still not final), a number of legal proceedings and tax breaks to make such a merger viable would have to occur so any deal or discussions are in the earliest of stages, at best. Fun Fact: Steve Job's wife is the largest shareholder in the Walt Disney company.

Roston - Apr 13, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A small camera drone from Zero Zero Robotics has launched for sale in Apple stores and through the Apple website, the company has announced. The Hover Camera Passport is a consumer-tier autonomous drone designed for consumers who want to easily capture shots of themselves from perspectives that are more interesting than the average smartphone can produce. In addition to its Apple store launch, the drone has been updated with a new interface, automated media editing, and more. The idea behind Hover Camera Passport and other drones like it is that smartphones are limited — you either need someone else to capture you doing something or you have to hold the camera out at arm’s length and capture a selfie. Small drones equipped with smart technology enable consumers to capture hands-free shots of themselves from better perspectives, doing so by having the drone track themselves or their face as the subject. One example, as highlighted in the video above, is having the drone follow a person as they ride their bike, recording video of the trip in ways not possible with a dedicated camera. Even better, the Hover Camera Passport drone is self-flying and powered by AI, meaning there’s little work involved for the operator. The drone identifies the subject’s face and uses that to track the subject as they move around. The drone is going up for sale in five regions: the US, Canada, the mainland of China, the UK, and Hong Kong. Apple is offering an exclusive bundle with the drone, which includes a carry bag, the charger, adapter, and a couple batteries. As well, some Apple stores are now holding demonstrations of the drone, which can be folded when not in use for easy storage.

Apple is continuing to shift away from using i-Brand to name its products, moving toward the Apple brand instead. It started with the Apple Watch. Then, Apple Music. Now, Apple Podcasts. I bit hard on e-domains back around the turn of the century. These went out of favor once Apple popularized domains starting with i. Could Apple’s move away from i have an impact on the value of i-domains? It’s unlikely to impact demand by other companies, at least in the short term. But, should Apple change the branding of any of its iconic products, it could impact cybersquatters who register i-domains trying to anticipate the next version of them. If you’re looking for a couple great podcasts to subscribe to on iTunes, I recommend the Domain Name Wire Podcast and Internet of Things Podcast.

(Reuters/Noah Berger) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession The Office April 13, 2017 Apple has often been known to corner the market for certain parts it needs to bring its latest creations to market. And in its push to become known as one of the greenest companies in the world, it seems that’s also the case when it’s dealing with foliage. In a recent story on the forthcoming indoor garden above San Francisco’s new Transbay Transit Center train station, The San Francisco Chronicle revealed that there is intense competition for trees in California, partly because of the sheer number that Apple has bought for its nearly completed new headquarters in Cupertino. Patrick Trollip, the lead landscaper on the transit project, and Adam Greenspan, the Transbay’s architect, apparently have been combing nurseries up the Pacific coast in search of trees that it can grab before Apple does: Buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat business. And it’s been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple has been buying up 3,000 trees for its new Cupertino headquarters. When Greenspan and Trollip found a tree they fancied they would “tag it” with a locking yellow tag, so that nobody else — like Apple — could get it. Eventually all the tagged trees were moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the transbay project team leased 4 acres. Apple has been sourcing thousands of trees and growing them in a nursery in that same town, although it’s unclear if the company has been trying to hoard trees as suggested. Apple has been labeled the most environmentally friendly technology company and it appears to be on a mission to create an eco-Xanadu in the suburbs of Silicon Valley, regardless of whatever anyone else is trying to build. When discussing the new campus in 2014, CEO Tim Cook said: “We are building a new headquarters that will, I think, be the greenest building on the planet.” Literally, apparently. On its website, Apple says the lands around its new headquarters will eventually be filled with 9,000 trees—many of which will be varieties native to the area, such as oaks—and that the buildings will be powered entirely by renewable energy. It also says that it’s “recycling or reusing more than 95 percent of the material from the demolished buildings at the site by finding ways to repurpose virtually every piece of concrete, glass, and metal.” Hopefully there won’t come a time that we see lines at garden stores like those that form at Apple stores around the world when a new iPhone is released.

Marissa MillerApr 13, 2017 3:55PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestTayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images With a name like Workflow, you know iPhone's anticipated acquisition might actually help you live your best life. The newest addition is slated to reach iOS 11 after years of flirting with the idea of automated commands. As it turns out, Apple has been working on an automation service since 2014, BGR reports. But according to a patent issued this week, along with Apple's acquisition of the Workflow app last month, it might finally reach iOS 11. If at first it sounds creepy, think of all the times you've seen targeted ads for prom dresses based on your recent Google searches, and felt pretty thankful for it. Here, data collection would rely on a more holistic range of factors to offer you more suitable commands, which you have the control to modify: First, it collects activity data on your device for a period of time. Then, it detects routine repetitive functions (like turning on a certain playlist right after you turn your alarm off) by analyzing that data. It then generates suggested automation settings (like turning on the playlist for you after you've turned your alarm off) based on your behavior, which you can then customize. These automation settings help make the device operate more efficiently and more conveniently. So, will your iPhone 8 have your Instagram feed open for you moments upon waking? You'll have to see once you upgrade your device this fall.

"We look at our carbon footprint as so much more than just our office, our data centers, our stores, even our distribution centers," Jackson told Bloomberg Television. "All that's included in our 96 percent, but now we're moving onto our supply chain." Apple and its suppliers expect to generate over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy by the end of 2018. Take a look at the video interview below for more details...

Updates to tvOS 9 focused a lot on feature parity with the previous Apple TV and recent iOS updates, and tvOS 10 updates introduced the new TV app and single sign-on feature. Here’s what we’re hoping to see this year from tvOS 11 at Apple’s developer conference in June. Sony A6500 TV Apple launched its new TV app last December through tvOS 10.1, but it’s still limited to the United States. The TV app does a decent job of presenting shows you watch in one interface instead of digging around for something to watch in multiple apps. The top request for the TV app this year is introducing it to more countries. Next on our list has to be true Netflix support. Some features work sort of by accident, but you can’t use the TV app to its full potential with Netflix like you can with officially supported services. Netflix was a big missing partner to start, and hopefully tvOS 11 offers something to resolve that. Finally, the TV app could benefit from a focus on presenting live content when available. You can already use Siri to jump to live content on specific channels with a feature called Live Tune In, but there’s really no visual user interface for this. The TV app would be the natural location for such an interface. I would also love to see Apple promote single sign-on apps more prominently on the tvOS App Store. They’re currently highlighted with an app tile that goes to the collection, but I wouldn’t mind seeing this promoted to a top-level navigation item. Siri We’re probably years away from this actually happening (who knows!), but the dream is talking to Siri on one device and having Siri do something on another device. For example, you could ask Siri on your iPhone to play Finding Dory on the family room Apple TV. You can already get part of the way there with the Remote app for iPhone and iPad. It lets you control Siri on the Apple TV from your iPhone, but the goal is having one Siri that you can activate in an instant versus a secondary Siri located within an app. Another example of something that Siri could someday pull off is asking Siri to play a specific song on Apple Music on multiple Apple TVs. In general, Siri on Apple TV has opportunities to come to feature parity with Siri on other devices before next level features are considered. AR Apple CEO Tim Cook loves, loves, loves AR. He called the idea of augmented reality something he considers ‘as a big idea like the smartphone’ recently, and he talks about the promise of AR any chance he gets. iPhone 8 AR concept One thing that isn’t clear yet is what Apple has planned for AR features within its ecosystem. The iPhone is the obvious platform for AR features with its portable display and sensors including multiple cameras. At least one unverified report has claimed Apple plans to use AirPlay between the iPhone and Apple TV to create an augmented reality experience as well. Smart Dark Mode tvOS 10 introduced something we all really want on iOS: dark mode. The old Apple TV software always used a dark theme, and tvOS 9 was introduced with vibrant theme that made it pop in comparison. Apple heard our requests for the return of a dark theme, however, and added a toggle in Settings that can also be controlled with Siri. With tvOS 11, we would love to see the ability to automatically switch between light mode and dark mode based on either time of day or sunset/sunrise. Light mode during the day, dark mode during the night. Apple TV can already detect local sunrise and sunset times as a trigger for HomeKit automation so the box knows when the specific event occurs locally. If you want to go a step further, tvOS 11 could introduce Night Shift like we see on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad, although color shifting on third-party displays over video content might not be a great idea in practice. Home App & Video When I wrote about tvOS 10 wish list items a year ago, my modest list included something that Apple delivered: HomeKit support for smart accessory control and automation. It makes perfect sense to tell Siri on the Apple TV to set your Movie Scene which dims the lights before you watch a film in the living room. This year I hope Apple goes a step further and introduces a Home app for Apple TV with tvOS 11. The Home app with iOS 10 is very useful on the iPhone and iPad, and you can already interact with HomeKit through Siri. Creating a Home app on Apple TV could create a dashboard that guests can easily access and control. HomeKit also gained the ability to work with video cameras last year, and video is ideal for Apple TV. You can already use the Apple TV to watch live video feeds from non-HomeKit cameras like Canary, but if there’s a way to view my HomeKit video camera feed on my Apple TV, I haven’t discovered it. Apple News & Video Speaking of video (and something we don’t expect to happen but would appreciate), Apple News could be a useful app on Apple TV and tvOS. Apple News is already popular with readers on iPhone and iPad (and we hear from a lot of readers who say they want a Mac version). Apple News on Apple TV could focus solely on video similar to how Twitter and Facebook have approached their own tvOS apps. You could even have a Watch It Later feature on the iOS app that lets you make a queue of videos to watch on your Apple TV through Apple News. Apple’s News team could also curate video content for Apple TV and feature a video tab in the Apple News app for iOS. More Other major changes to tvOS could come with new hardware to include more sensors like always-on mics, built-in or add-on cameras, and more. Apple TV already works with dedicated gaming controllers, but consoles also support other add-ons that Apple TV could follow. Apple TV’s Remote app has improved greatly over the past year with new features and an iPad version, but there are two more opportunities that I see as possible in the near future. First is Control Center access from iPhone and iPad. I keep the Apple TV Remote app on my first Home screen since I use it frequently, but I would really love Control Center access as a dedicated tile or an app shortcut next to or in place of Timer and Calculator. Second is the Remote app for Apple Watch. It works as a basic navigation controller, but it hasn’t adopted the features of the new Apple TV since it was first introduced and hasn’t changed. Siri and Dictation support would also go a long way. These are changes that could be included in iOS 11 and watchOS 4 but benefit tvOS 11 and Apple TV.

Kee Jr. Published: Apr 13, 2017 2:24 p.m. ET Share When the stock market suffers a correction, Apple might be hurt more than other companies Getty Images By ThomasH. Kee Jr. Shares of Apple Inc. have soared 22% this year, driven by institutional investors. Individual investors, enamored with an investment that’s connected to products they can touch and feel and use daily, have followed along. As a result, momentum has pushed the stock to a record high. But its valuation is stretched. Most investors in Apple AAPL, -0.53%   don’t seem to care, though, because, after all, where else are you going to go, what else has the same institutional support, and which other company has this type of cash balance? In many ways, it is hard to argue with, because institutional investors think the same way. They have nowhere else to go. And even though Apple lacks value, so do most stocks, and virtually every stock that investors perceive as reliable fit that bill too. Moreover, when the European Central Bank frees up cash on hand by buying assets from institutional circles, and the consensus is that Apple is more justifiable than others, at least some money flows will go to Apple. Consistency is the key, and the buying interest this year has been very consistent. However, the “no better option” mindset does not imply good value. But most investors in Apple don’t think of it that way. All that matters to them is that the stock has been rising, cash on hand is growing, and most analysts support the stock. Unfortunately, when the music stops for the stock market, Apple will be just as vulnerable, if not more so. Remember, Apple is not a safe haven. The price-to-earnings ratio of the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.68%   is about 27, compared with its historical average of 14.5, so the valuation is already rich. But, as I explained to clients, this is actually the most expensive non-recessionary stock market we have ever witnessed. A re-pricing is going to happen, and when it does, Apple will get hit, maybe harder than others. Thomas H. Kee Jr. is a former Morgan Stanley broker and founder of Stock Traders Daily.

Amazing Deals. #PrisonBreak Returns — Get the Pass On iTunes + Past Seasons at Limited-Time Prices iTunes Does ‘Apple Podcasts’ Signal Coming Phase Out Of The iTunes Brand? [OPINION] By Arron Hirst 11 hours ago Share Tweet When then named synchronization manager SoundJam MP was purchased by Apple in 2001, and later renamed to the more commonly known iTunes – it made a whole lot of sense, especially when you consider that the company was just months away from the introduction of iPod. Nowadays, while it is clear that Apple still manages to retain some of its signature hype around the iTunes brand – in terms of its own marketing, the actual use of ‘iTunes’ as a product name makes little sense. This is largely due to the synchronization software having since evolved to become not only a complete digital media hub – but a storefront for the purchase of all kinds of different media, not just that of music. In a further signal that the company may be looking to slowly phase out the iTunes brand, Apple this week officially announced that iTunes Podcasts -a format which has been staple of the software since its first introduction 16 years ago- would from here on out be known as Apple Podcasts. The move rings similar to Apple’s dropping of the ‘i’ in the name of its latest flagship product, Apple Watch, as the firm appears set on phasing out the Jobs era and its synonymity with the letter ‘i’ – in place of a new beginning. One focused on ridding the once potential ambiguity surrounding its products, in favour for making sure consumers know who exactly those products and services are provided by – and, as a byproduct, growing in both social and physical status. After all, the Apple brand has always been centered on status — and it appears Cook is ready to double-down on that notion. Of course, it would make little sense for the iPhone (or iPad) to lose the use of Apple’s globally recognised ‘i’ at this point. The iPhone in particular is much too important to the company in terms of the percentage of revenue it currently accounts for, to make this change … and changing something that works well is rarely a good idea. But iTunes is different. As the software continue to evolve and Apple looks to move into original content that will be streamed to Apple Music’s growing membership, so too does the need for a rebrand become more clear. One that clearly communicates what iTunes is about right now, in 2017, and what it is likely to be about in 10 years time. That is, more than music. I believe the phase out will be gradual. But I believe we will see more of this kind of rebrand from Apple going forward – as the company works to consolidate its brand image post Jobs. “Apple Podcasts is the best place to discover audio stories that entertain, inform, and inspire,” Apple said in its announcement. “Millions of people worldwide listen every day and are looking for their next favorite show.” Citing that the move introduces ‘clear and effective’ marketing to its iTunes-driven podcast initiative, as it explains that the change will also help podcast owners “reach an even bigger audience,” just as with its official badge artwork for the iOS App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store, the firm is this week also providing a set of identity guidelines for how its new ‘Apple Podcasts’ badge should be used in both print and online media. “Don’t display both the badge and icon together and do not use the Apple Podcasts icon instead of the Apple Podcasts badge in marketing communications, even when layout space is limited,” the company notes. “Use the Apple Podcasts icon only when displaying an array of icons with similar shape and size,” it adds. You can download the Apple Podcasts badge to begin using it in your own online (or offline) communications, as well as learn more about the rebrand of Apple’s oldest audio/video service format, by heading over here. And you can start exploring all the audio and video podcasts currently available for download on iTunes, which can be listened to with Apple’s official Podcasts app, for yourself – right here.

World traveller Scotty Allen created his own working iPhone 6s out of recycled parts bought from Chinese markets He spent $1,000 on parts and used around $300 to create the actual phone - which is less than half the price Apple is charging for a new iPhone 6s An incredible video shows the adventurer buying the parts at the markets and putting them all together.  Describing his motivation, Mr Allen explained on his blog: 'I've been fascinated by the cell phone parts markets in Shenzhen, China for a while.  'I'd walked through them a bunch of times, but I still didn't understand basic things, like how they were organized or who was buying all these parts and what they were doing with them.' He added that he 'jumped' at the chance to build his own smartphone after hearing about it from friend. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Japanese YouTube star speed-eats SEVEN POUNDS of instant...

Share this article Share 'When someone mentioned they wondered if you could build a working smartphone from parts in the markets, I jumped at the chance to really dive in and understand how everything works,' he said. 'Well, I sat on it for nine months, and then I dove in.' Mr Allen, who used to work at Google, bought a recycled Apple logic board with a processor, flash storage, Wi-Fi and LTE chips and other components on it.  The former California-based software engineer scoured the Shenzen markets to buy a recycled logic board and installed the display, a $5 battery and the back casing . Mr Allen, who used to work at Google, bought a recycled Apple logic board with a processor, flash storage, Wi-Fi and LTE chips and other components on it. The technical whizz also purchased a broken screen from a phone repair booth because he had 'an incredibly hard time' trying to buy a bare LCD and the digitizer The logic board also came with a Touch ID sensor built into it. The technical whizz also purchased a broken screen from a phone repair booth because he had 'an incredibly hard time' trying to buy a bare LCD and the digitizer.  He completely disassembled and then reassembled it with new parts. Mr Allen bought a rose-gold backplate with the Apple logo for the chassis and a $5 battery to complete the 16GB iPhone 6s. The project took 'a couple of months,' he said, adding that even newbies could easily assemble an iPhone - likening the task to assembling your own desktop computer. He explained that he chose to make an iPhone 6s over the newest iPhone 7 model as he already owned an iPhone 6s and felt it would be useful to compare his own to the recycled version. The adventurer added that discarded iPhone 7 parts - being the latest product - were harder to come by.

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Svati Kirsten Narula Obsession Life as Laboratory April 13, 2017 Apple is reportedly working on a “super secret” medical project: building sensors to monitor blood sugar levels without piercing the skin. According to CNBC, the iPhone maker has been working on this for at least five years, quietly hiring dozens of biomedical engineers and sequestering them in a nondescript Palo Alto office. It may be intended to connect to the Apple Watch, which Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously hinted at trying to make more medically useful, even suggesting that an app developed “adjacent to it” might have to get approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. And Reuters reported in 2014 that Apple, Samsung, and Google were all interested in merging their respective mobile devices with glucose monitoring devices. What Apple’s reportedly trying to do here hasn’t worked out so well for Google, whose life-sciences arm, Verily, is also located away from company headquarters in its own unassuming office building and has long been working (publicly) on a smart contact lens for blood sugar monitoring. That project hasn’t been fruitful yet. A fingerstick test with a blood glucose monitor, which requires a small drop of blood and a disposable test strip. (Reuters/Stoyan Nenov) Keeping track of how blood sugar levels rise and fall throughout the day is a big job for people with type 1 diabetes, whose bodies don’t produce insulin—a crucial hormone in blood sugar regulation. Diabetics typically test blood samples from their fingertips several times a day to measure these levels, but since the numbers can fluctuate so much in response to food, exercise, stress, and other factors, a few data points per day isn’t always enough information. That’s why enthusiasm has been building for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors. These sensors rely on a small needle that stays under the skin for days at a time to analyze interstitial fluid—the stuff that surrounds tissue cells—to measure blood sugar and wirelessly transmits the data to a receiver with a screen displaying the numbers. Dexcom, the current leader in CGM, has a sensor that works with an app for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. (Dexcom/YouTube) According to CNBC’s report, it sounds like whatever Apple’s working on would only differ by using light or an electrical current instead of a needle under the skin. Dexcom’s technology is considered “minimally invasive,” while an optical or electrical sensor would be “non-invasive.” This has been tried, unsuccessfully, in the past. Most notable, perhaps, was the commercial failure of a device called the GlucoWatch, which was approved by the FDA in 2001. It was worn just like a regular wristwatch and sent electrical currents through a patient’s skin to test blood sugar levels every 20 minutes, displaying the numbers on its face so that checking a blood sugar was as easy as checking the time. It was described in FDA documents (PDF) as “a device that provides frequent, automatic, non-invasive glucose measurements. The glucose sample is obtained directly through intact skin.” It may have met the definition of non-invasive, and it may have been accurate, but it was also painful. “It generated an electrical current, and for many people it caused a burn,” according to Henry Anhalt, an endocrinologist who had patients that tried the device. Anhalt, now the chief medical officer at a diabetes research network called the T1D Exchange, says that although the GlucoWatch provided accurate results, “people felt this burning sensation which I believe led to the demise of the product. Collectively in the community we were all discussing that this was why patients stopped using it.” Since the early 2000s, companies like Dexcom, Abbott, and Medtronic have successfully brought minimally invasive CGM devices to market, though Dexcom ran in the red for years, Abbott shut down its diabetes division in 2011, and Medtronic’s sensors were hampered by quality control problems for several years. Today, Dexcom is profitable and several hundred thousand people in the US use either its CGM or Medtronic’s. Some people with diabetes consider them “must-haves,” but not all. And it’s not clear that a sensor made by Apple, despite being non-invasive and from a trusted consumer brand, would be a “must have,” either. “These devices haven’t crossed the return on investment yet for a lot of people,” Aaron Kowalski, one of the research leads at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, recently told Quartz. Glucose sensors will become bigger game-changers once they’re hooked up to automated insulin delivery, or “closed-loop,” systems, like the soon-to-launch Medtronic insulin pump, which has an integrated CGM that triggers the pump to suspend insulin delivery when low blood sugar is detected. Future devices are supposed to be capable of even more, and the true “holy grail” for many diabetics, short of a biological cure, is a fully-closed loop system that doesn’t require them to even look at or think about their blood sugar numbers—hopefully because a computer is constantly making its own decisions based on those numbers.

Some users are reporting on Apple support forums say they hear a “popping” noise coming from their MacBook Pro. The sound is described by a user as a “single hollow" popping’ noise, like when slowly squeezing a plastic bottle. “Sometimes I won't hear it for days and then all of a sudden I will hear the ‘POP’ 5-8 times over the duration of about 2 hours,” another user said on Apple’s support forum thread for the issue. More apps are getting support for the Touch Bar of the latest generation of MacBook Pros. Photo: YouTube/Marques Brownlee Read: MacBook Pro 2017 Might Have Apple's Own ARM-Based Processors: Reports MacBook users recorded the popping sound on video and uploaded it on YouTube and Vimeo: Untitled from Skulcar on Vimeo.   MacBook owners believe the popping noise is related to thermal conditions. One user claims to have found where the cracking and popping noise originated from: “Pick up the laptop, with the screen open at 90 degrees and press right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle. It will crack and pop like a candy. Now, I think the problem is actually from the hinges, as there is some natural flexing in the aluminum back of the display. I think the heat has affected the glue or some plastic mount in the display assembly.” Read: Apple To Treat Diabetes? Tech Giant Working On Non-Invasive Method To Check Glucose, Report Says Another user also reported a “hinge noise” issue, which makes a “clacking sound,” when opening the laptop for the first time after not using it for a while. However, the noise is not made when the laptop is closed. The certain keys on the keyboard on the user’s MacBook Pro also makes “loud-pitched noises” when the laptop is hot. The user said: “The computer makes the random popping sound every once in a while; to me it seems to be related to the device getting warm. It seems to happen much more frequently when I connect an external display (which causes the dedicated GPU to turn on and therefore increases the amount of heat). I can also (at least sometimes) reproduce the issue by running a program to get the CPU usage to 100%.” One MacBook owner said Apple found the issue was caused by a small dent on the bottom casing. The user had to pay $130 to replace the entire bottom casing. Another MacBook owner took the laptop to the Apple Store and got the top case and battery replaced but the popping sound continued. The user then got a new MacBook Pro, but the noise was still there. The complaints come after previous problems with the 2016 MacBook Pro. Last December, Consumer Reports declined to recommend Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar citing “highly inconsistent” battery life tests. Consumer Reports rescinded its verdict on the product after Apple fixed the issue with a software update in January. Related Stories Will Apple Develop Touchscreen MacBooks, iMacs?

Already having been at 100% renewable energy in the United States, three more of the company’s worldwide suppliers have pledged to follow suit. In the interview, Jackson mentions that the company won’t stop until it hits 100% everywhere. Within the United States Apple is at 100% renewable energy usage, alongside 23 other countries. The current 96% of renewable energy sources includes Apple’s offices, data centers, stores, and distribution centers. The last few percentage points to reach 100% will come from the supply chain, companies Apple doesn’t explicitly own. Biel Crystal Manufactory Ltd., Sunwoda Electronic Co., and Compal Electronics Inc. are the three new supply chain companies pledging to join Apple’s sustainability goals. With these additions Jackson states that, “We’re now at seven members of our supply chain who have committed to making their Apple operations renewable too.” Apple states it will continue with its renewable energy plans that were pledged under President Obama’s administration. Although President Trump may have rolled back some of the EPA’s rules, Apple will continue forward. From Bloomberg’s previous reporting: “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed.

Shares fell as low as $72.62 a share, but last traded around $76 a share, down less than 1 percent. Dexcom makes glucose monitoring products, including mobile apps, to help patients with diabetes. IPhone-maker Apple has been testing super secret noninvasive technology, including sensors that can shine a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose, a source told CNBC in a report published on Wednesday. "Because it's Apple, it scares people," said Michael Weinstein of JPMorgan. "That said, what Apple is trying to do is very hard. Companies, scientists have been trying to develop noninvasive impedance sensors for years. Very hard to do, particularly without putting something on the skin." Dexcom declined to comment on the stock move, citing a quiet period ahead of their quarterly earnings release. But Steve Pacelli, Dexcom's executive vice president of strategy and corporate development, said there would be some real challenges to Apple's approach. Pacelli said Dexcom worked closely with Apple when they released the Dexcom app. "We certainly have an idea of what they are working on," Pacelli said. "There have been hundreds of millions of dollars spent on non-invasive technologies, but none of them have been able to achieve the clinical needs or accuracy for patients living with diabetes." Traditional finger-stick testing means users have to prick their fingers, drawing blood to get glucose levels at each point in time. Continuous testing, like that offered by Dexcom, means users can get readings every five minutes with the wire the size of a human hair under their skin. That type of minimally invasive technology is set to become standard within the next five years for medical applications, Pacelli said. But other noninvasive technologies, potentially including what Apple may be exploring, could be used for endurance athletes. "Think the amount of money that people spend on athletics, running triathlons, marathons," Pacelli said. "Maintaining an appropriate level of glucose can absolutely affect your performance." Dexcom is no stranger to the world of big tech: It partnered up with Alphabet's life sciences team at Verily to develop smaller, cheaper cloud-connected glucose sensors. "It's been a great collaboration," Pacelli said. "We have said publicly that we expect to launch first generation product by end of 2018, and the second generation, truly the miniaturized bandage, by sometime in 2020." But Doug Clinton of venture capital firm Loup Ventures said that Apple may have an advantage because of the biological data available to its AirPod wireless earbuds. "Transforming medicine has long been a focus at Apple, particularly under [CEO] Tim Cook," Clinton wrote in a blog post. "The company pioneered ResearchKit to drive forward medical research through rich patient data. Apple also created CareKit to enable developers to create better applications that help users manage their health. Developing solutions for a condition like diabetes, which affects millions of people around the world, is a next logical step." Pacelli said he's unsure whether that is possible. But either way, the interest from big tech reveals how important the glucose testing market could become, Pacelli said. "I think there is definitely a huge market opportunity here," Pacelli said.

The personal assistant showed that even smartphones, with their advanced multitouch screens that make you feel as if you’re directly manipulating your pictures and more, had some room to get better. Apple innovated again when it added the Hey Siri command. With the feature activated, saying “Hey Siri” replaces the long press on the home button. This makes it even easier for you to choose the next song to play in your car. You can do other things too, all without having to directly interact with your iPhone. Siri can get you sports scores, change settings and send messages, and you don’t have to tap once. Read: 39 iOS 10 Tips & Tricks & Hidden Features Here’s how to turn on Hey Siri on Your iPhone with iOS 10. Setting Up Hey Siri in iOS 10 Before we begin, there are something that you should know. Hey Siri has been around for some time. Apple didn’t add the feature with iOS 10, it only improved on it. You’ll need iOS 10 loaded on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch before you see on your device what’s shown in this tutorial. That being said, phones, tablets and more stuck on iOS 9 still have Hey Siri capability. It’ll just be in the General Settings area instead of what’s shown here. Unlock your iPhone the way you usually would. If you use your finger with TouchID, do so now. Enter your PIN Code now if you don’t use TouchID. If you don’t use any kind of security on your iPhone at all, press the home button to unlock your device. Welcome to the home screen. Look for the Settings app on your home screen. Keep in mind that if you have rearranged your apps the Settings app could be buried in a folder. The Settings app is in the bottom-right corner of our screen in this example. Welcome to the Settings screen. Naturally, turning on Hey Siri is a feature that can be found inside of Siri’s settings. Scroll down a bit until you see the Siri icon. Tap Siri. In order to use the Hey Siri command in iOS 10, you’ll need to have the personal assistant enabled in the first place. Flip the switch labeled Siri to turn on Siri. Next, your iPhone will ask you if you’re sure you’d like to enable the personal assistant since she relies on Apple’s servers and your personal information to make life easier for you. Tap on Enable Siri if you’re comfortable agreeing to Apple’s terms. Look for the Allow “Hey Siri” field and flip the switch to the right to turn it on. iOS 10 allows you to keep Siri listening without having to keep your iPhone plugged in at your desk or in the car. Apple has also added a set-up screen for guiding you through the process of getting the voice command going. Tap Continue. Now your iPhone will have you say some phrases so that it can better understand your voice. Note that you might want to do this in quiet place as your iPhone will pick up any close background noise. Now that you’re back at the Siri settings area, flip the Access When Locked switch. This will allow you to access most of Siri’s features without having to unlock your phone first. Using Hey Siri in iOS 10 Now that you’ve gotten Hey Siri working, it’s time to get to the basics on using it. First and foremost, Hey Siri isn’t a universal replacement for interacting with your iPhone. You’re going to have to interact with your device to get things done that Siri just isn’t capable of streamlining yet. That being said, one of the restrictions Apple dropped with iOS 9 was the requirement that modern iPhones be plugged into a power outlet before Hey Siri can be used. With the iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 6s Plus, you can use the Hey Siri command at anytime – even if your smartphone isn’t plugged in. Don’t worry, turning on Hey Siri doesn’t seem to ruin iPhone battery life. At least, it hasn’t in our experience.  Be sure to keep an eye on your battery meter the first few days you have the feature turned on. Whenever you say “Hey Siri”, your iPhone will be ready for a command. You can tell it to play a certain artist, album or song from your music collection by saying “Play” and the name of the song, artist or album. “Hey Siri, play Beats 1” is a great way to quickly start streaming Apple’s new radio station. Of course, if you don’t have a car with a Bluetooth stereo Siri will play the music through the iPhone’s speakers. You can also call your different contacts without having to jump through too many hoops. Simply by saying, “Call” and the person’s name. Conversational language like “Hey Siri, I want Chinese.” Siri will get search results for you and give you driving directions and more if they’re needed. When unplugged, your iPhone or iPad has to have Low Power Mode disabled for the “Hey Siri” command to work effectively. This is because Low Power Mode restricts what apps can do in the background. 13 Responses 10/30/2014 Siri User Reply I want to be able to unlock my phone with my voice after I say hey siri.

The announcement came this morning via Twitter from Steve Wilson of Apple’s Podcast marketing team. It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts. Podcasters, we've got a great new badge to help you promote your shows.— Steve Wilson (@StephenWilson) April 13, 2017 In his tweet, Wilson provided an example of the new marketing badge, along with a link to Apple’s Podcasts Identity Guidelines page covering the guidelines for podcasters’ use of official Apple assets and materials to promote their podcasts. The change brings the branding more in line with Apple’s other media services such as Apple Music, although it’s unclear whether this is the first step in a broader rebranding of Apple’s media services to move away from the “iTunes” focus or is merely a case of separating free and subscription content from media sold on the iTunes Store.

Kee Jr. Published: Apr 13, 2017 2:24 p.m. ET Share When the stock market suffers a correction, Apple might be hurt more than other companies Getty Images By ThomasH. Kee Jr. Shares of Apple Inc. have soared 22% this year, driven by institutional investors. Individual investors, enamored with an investment that’s connected to products they can touch and feel and use daily, have followed along. As a result, momentum has pushed the stock to a record high. But its valuation is stretched. Most investors in Apple AAPL, -0.53%   don’t seem to care, though, because, after all, where else are you going to go, what else has the same institutional support, and which other company has this type of cash balance? In many ways, it is hard to argue with, because institutional investors think the same way. They have nowhere else to go. And even though Apple lacks value, so do most stocks, and virtually every stock that investors perceive as reliable fit that bill too. Moreover, when the European Central Bank frees up cash on hand by buying assets from institutional circles, and the consensus is that Apple is more justifiable than others, at least some money flows will go to Apple. Consistency is the key, and the buying interest this year has been very consistent. However, the “no better option” mindset does not imply good value. But most investors in Apple don’t think of it that way. All that matters to them is that the stock has been rising, cash on hand is growing, and most analysts support the stock. Unfortunately, when the music stops for the stock market, Apple will be just as vulnerable, if not more so. Remember, Apple is not a safe haven. The price-to-earnings ratio of the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.68%   is about 27, compared with its historical average of 14.5, so the valuation is already rich. But, as I explained to clients, this is actually the most expensive non-recessionary stock market we have ever witnessed. A re-pricing is going to happen, and when it does, Apple will get hit, maybe harder than others. Thomas H. Kee Jr. is a former Morgan Stanley broker and founder of Stock Traders Daily. Kee managed the fourth-best-performing strategy in the world in 2016, according to HedgeCo.

That's according to a speculative analysis from RBC Capital Markets, which in a note to client Thursday said such a colossal tie-up would be contingent on Apple getting tax breaks to "repatriate" overseas cash. "Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney," RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in the note. A combined Apple-Disney would create an instant competitor to Netflix that would take advantage of the Mouse House's content and Apple's user base, the anlaysts speculated. Other benefits: integrating Apple consumer tech as experiences in Disney's theme parks; and landing global streaming sports rights for ESPN via the combo of Disney-backed BAMTech and Apple distribution and a strong balance sheet. "Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand," RBC's Cahall and Kulp wrote. The M&A rumor mill got new grist last fall, when Apple chief Tim Cook (pictured above) told analysts that the tech giant was "open to acquisitions of any size." In addition, Apple execs met with Time Warner honchos in late 2015 in a discussion that raised the possibility of a merger -- before AT&T moved on its $85 billion bid for Time Warner. The Apple-Disney M&A chatter comes as analysts in the last few months have debated the possibility that Disney would make a move to buy Netflix -- a highly leveraged transaction that some view as needlessly risky. But would Apple shareholders support such a bet-the-company move? Assuming a 40% premium for Disney, the deal would carry a hefty $237 billion price tag. If Apple investors balk, Disney could consider spinning off assets like ESPN and theme parks to make the deal more palatable. Another caveat: Apple would need U.S. regulators to give it a "tax holiday" to repatriate offshore cash to fund an acquisition of Disney. Assuming Apple could obtain a 9% tax rate, it would effectively have access to cash of $223 billion, RBC noted. "Even though investors might expect higher cash returns in form of buybacks/dividends, strategic uses are likely to take precedence," the analysts wrote. Per RBC, the merger of Apple and Disney would be highly accretive to earnings, to the tune of 15%-20% increase in earnings per share based on the presumed 40% premium deal price and Disney's low debt load. "We like Disney's fundamentals. Assuming Apple sees the same thing and has the cash, investor anticipation of a prospective transaction only adds conviction to the momentum we see in Disney's shares," Cahall and Kulp wrote.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 13, 2017 2:17pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Tech Sector Earnings: Starting The Year Strong? Report: Apple Wants To Create A Better Way To Treat Diabetes Nasdaq Joins Dow, S&P 500 Below Key Support As JPMorgan, Nvidia Fall (Investor's Business Daily) Recent media reports have suggested that the notoriously secretive Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is working on developing a non-invasive way for diabetics to monitor blood glucose levels. While Apple enthusiasts have speculated that glucose monitoring could be integrated into the Apple Watch, Loop Ventures analyst Doug Clinton anticipates that Apple will instead choose to integrate it into its wireless AirPods headphones. The Complications Of Vitals' Monitoring Past studies of wrist-worn heart rate monitors have revealed accuracy and consistent readings can be an issue. However, Clinton points to a study that found that an ear-based sensor had a 98 percent correlation coefficient to an electrocardiogram when it came to accurately measuring heart rate. The 98 percent coefficient was in-line with the accuracy of a typical Polar M7 chest-worn monitor and well above the 91 percent coefficient found for the Apple Watch. Clinton believes the Apple Watch’s monitoring accuracy gets even worse during periods of exercise. “We also believe that the ear offers the possibility to collect better data, which the aforementioned study seems to confirm, and richer date because of the semi-internal nature of the ear canal, proximity to the brain and greater blood flow in the area,” Clinton explained. If Clinton is correct, Apple investors looking for Apple to expand its medical monitoring technology may need to shift their attention away from the Apple Watch and toward the AirPod.

Kee Jr. Published: Apr 13, 2017 2:24 p.m. ET Share When the stock market suffers a correction, Apple might be hurt more than other companies Getty Images By ThomasH. Kee Jr. Shares of Apple Inc. have soared 22% this year, driven by institutional investors. Individual investors, enamored with an investment that’s connected to products they can touch and feel and use daily, have followed along. As a result, momentum has pushed the stock to a record high. But its valuation is stretched. Most investors in Apple AAPL, -0.53%   don’t seem to care, though, because, after all, where else are you going to go, what else has the same institutional support, and which other company has this type of cash balance? In many ways, it is hard to argue with, because institutional investors think the same way. They have nowhere else to go. And even though Apple lacks value, so do most stocks, and virtually every stock that investors perceive as reliable fit that bill too. Moreover, when the European Central Bank frees up cash on hand by buying assets from institutional circles, and the consensus is that Apple is more justifiable than others, at least some money flows will go to Apple. Consistency is the key, and the buying interest this year has been very consistent. However, the “no better option” mindset does not imply good value. But most investors in Apple don’t think of it that way. All that matters to them is that the stock has been rising, cash on hand is growing, and most analysts support the stock. Unfortunately, when the music stops for the stock market, Apple will be just as vulnerable, if not more so. Remember, Apple is not a safe haven. The price-to-earnings ratio of the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.68%   is about 27, compared with its historical average of 14.5, so the valuation is already rich. But, as I explained to clients, this is actually the most expensive non-recessionary stock market we have ever witnessed. A re-pricing is going to happen, and when it does, Apple will get hit, maybe harder than others. Thomas H. Kee Jr. is a former Morgan Stanley broker and founder of Stock Traders Daily.

Funko Debuts New Line Of Attack On Titan Pops Apple Rumored To Be Interested In Buying Disney Matthew Mueller - 04/13/2017 Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of Mergers aren't uncommon in today's business landscape, but rarely do two giants the size of Apple or Disney end up in the conversation. Even rarer is the possibility or opportunity for companies of that size to join together, but the latest rumor from Wall Street points that out as a potential outcome. Speculative analysis from RBC Capital Markets says it's a possibility (via Variety). “Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney,” RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in a note to a client on Thursday. If Apple can pull the money together, a takeover of Disney worth around $200 billion would be possible, making their combined worth around $1 trillion. “Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand,” RBC’s Cahall and Kulp wrote. All of this would depend on if Apple gets some specific tax breaks, allowing them to repatriate cash from overseas. “We like Disney’s fundamentals. Assuming Apple sees the same thing and has the cash, investor anticipation of a prospective transaction only adds conviction to the momentum we see in Disney’s shares,” said Cahall and Kulp. That combination would give Apple access to Disney's massive wealth of content, including their core characters, live-action remakes, and Marvel and Star Wars divisions. It would also allow Apple to get involved in their Theme Park empire, as well as Disney ventures ESPN and ABC. Right now though this requires too many "if" factors, as Apple would need to win over the shareholders for such a big move, and would need around a 9% tax rate to access that offshore cash. For now, this is just a possibility, but if it does happen it would certainly impact the media landscape in a huge way. Beauty and the Beast is in theaters now, while Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar’s Revenge lands on May 26, 2017. Cars 3 is next up, racing into theaters on July 14, 2017, with Pixar’s Coco hitting on November 22nd, 2017.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 13, 2017 6:12 pm UTC reader comments 102 Share this story The earliest version of iOS 10's 64-bit app warning, as seen in an early beta. Andrew Cunningham Later versions of the warning became more oblique, referring to the symptoms of running 32-bit apps rather than the root cause. Andrew Cunningham The full list of incompatible apps was introduced in iOS 10.3. Andrew Cunningham Among many other things, iOS 10.3 makes it clear that the end of the road is near for 32-bit iOS apps. This has been coming for a while—all apps and updates submitted for App Store approval since mid-2015 have needed to include 64-bit support, and Apple has been pledging to purge the App Store of abandonware since last fall. Pretty soon, Apple will simply go one step further and make it so that older 32-bit code simply can’t run on iDevices. Putting aside that this spells the end for all kinds of old, unmaintained games and other apps from the early days of the smartphone and App Store, Apple’s complete transition to 64-bit is a unique and interesting technical achievement. Here’s the complete timeline of the transition, to date: September 2013: Apple introduces the iPhone 5S. Its Apple A7 chip makes it the first 64-bit iDevice. iOS 7 is the first 64-bit version of iOS, at least when running on the A7. October 2013: The iPad Air and what is now called the iPad Mini 2 are introduced. Both include the Apple A7 SoC. March 2014: iOS 7.1 is released. It resolves most of the memory-related crashes in 64-bit iOS. September 2014: The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are released. Their Apple A8 chip is Apple's second 64-bit SoC. Apple stops selling the iPhone 4S, making the iPhone 5C the last of the 32-bit iPhones. October 2014: The iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 are released. Both include 64-bit chips (the A8X and A7 again, respectively). The fourth-generation Retina iPad, which had been on sale for $399, is discontinued. The original iPad Mini is the last of the 32-bit iPads. February 2015: All new apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support. June 1, 2015: All app updates submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support. June 19, 2015: Apple quietly discontinues the original iPad Mini. The only 32-bit iPads Apple now sells are refurbished. September 9, 2015: Apple announces the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and stops selling the 32-bit iPhone 5C in favor of the 64-bit iPhone 5S. All new iPhones Apple sells from this point on are 64-bit. June 13, 2016: Apple announces iOS 10. Beta versions generate a warning about 32-bit apps, though this is removed in the final release. iOS 10 drops support for the Apple A5, making the Apple A6 and A6X the last supported 32-bit iOS SoCs. October 24, 2016: iOS 10.1 restores the 32-bit app warning. March 27, 2017: Apple releases iOS 10.3. One of its features is a list of installed 32-bit apps that won’t work in future iOS versions. To this list, I’d add a couple of predictions. In June at WWDC, we’ll get our first look at iOS 11, which is almost certain to drop support for the last 32-bit iOS hardware (the iPhone 5 and 5C and the iPad 4) as well as 32-bit iOS apps. And when that update comes out in September-ish, it may be accompanied by the first iPhone that can’t run 32-bit iOS apps (because it doesn’t have to be able to). The second supposition is based on a guess from prominent iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who regularly discovers hidden or semi-hidden iOS features and is often in position to hear things from people near and inside Apple. It’s not a guarantee of Apple’s future plans and of all its products, especially since the company generally keeps the tightest lid on the design of its A-series chips. Still, an iPhone without 32-bit iOS apps would present a unique opportunity for Apple to use its control over its software to streamline its hardware a bit. The 64-bit ARM instruction set, also called AArch64, is unique in that it is totally separate from the 32-bit (and ARMv7-compatible) AArch32 instruction set. In the PC world, the x86-64 instruction set is an extension of the 32-bit and 16-bit instruction sets—it was designed that way on purpose, and its easy backward compatibility gave it a decisive advantage over Intel’s 64-bit-only Itanium architecture. As a side effect, it has drawn out the 64-bit transition on PCs for years. Even today, every x86 PC supports 32- and 16-bit code that it will only rarely need to run. Further ReadingARM’s Cortex A32 is a tiny CPU for wearables and Raspberry Pi-like boardsSince ARM separates the instruction sets and since Apple has total control over iOS and its app ecosystem, Apple could be the first company to build an ARM CPU architecture that only supports 64-bit code. ARM has already demonstrated that this kind of thing can be done with its tiny AArch32-only Cortex A32 CPU core. On the hardware side, this could mean freeing up a small amount of space in a hypothetical A11 SoC for more CPU cores, larger CPU cores, or a better GPU or other features. This is the kind of thing that other SoC vendors would have a harder time doing—most SoCs in the Android world either use ARM’s Cortex CPU cores or designs substantially based on the Cortex cores. To maintain maximum compatibility and flexibility, it’s unlikely that ARM will ship anything without 32-bit support any time soon. Even if this doesn’t happen, Apple can still achieve some streamlining on the software side, stuff that will also benefit phones with hardware support for 32-bit apps. With 32-bit support cut out, Apple will be able to rip out any remaining 32-bit code in iOS, as well as 32-bit software libraries and things that allow 32-bit apps to run within 64-bit iOS. This may save some small amount of storage space, though it may be used for new iOS 11 features and not passed on to users. It can also help with memory usage in a few cases, since iOS won’t ever need to load 32-bit libraries into memory (thus ejecting other apps or Safari tabs from RAM and slowing down load times when you’re switching between tabs or apps). Whether Apple ever actually talks about any of these benefits publicly is anyone’s guess. The company does seem to be a little more open and a little less secretive on some fronts these days, but it’s still difficult to get Apple employees on the record talking in detail about its chips or low-level tech (beyond the stuff developers can learn at WWDC, anyway). But it will be a first for a mass-market consumer operating system: not only has iOS transitioned from 32-bit to 64-bit, but it will soon completely end 32-bit backward compatibility altogether, something that has remained in the 64-bit versions of Windows, macOS, Linux, and other OSes. Even if the benefits to users and to Apple are relatively small, the fact remains that only Apple has enough control over its hardware and software to realize those benefits.

In a statement, Tony Thomas, president and CEO of Windstream, said the acquisition will allow the advanced network communications and technology vendor to advance its product portfolio and enhance its competitiveness and ability to provide "enhanced" services, while leveraging Broadview's sales force and cloud operations. On Broadview's end, CEO and president Mike Robinson said the company has succesfully transformed from a legacy telecom business. "Windstream's nationwide footprint, extensive portfolio of service offerings, vast distribution and attractive customer base are a natural fit for our strategic direction," he added. The deal is expected to close in Q3 2017. Apple's "secret" Apple has secretly been working on diabetes treatment for at least five years, CNBC reports. Citing "three people familiar with the matter" CNBC claims Apple has a "super secret intiative" leveraging a small number of biomedical engineers in an attempt to find a way to monitor glucose levels without skin penetration. According to CNBC, the team of engineers reports to Johny Srouji, SVP of hardware technologies at Apple. The report also says Apple is "conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways". One source told CNBC that Apple is creating optical sensors that monitor glucose by shining a light through a user's skin. AWS's users Amazon Web Services (AWS) users plan to spend more money on cloud-native AWS services like Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda this year than last year, according to a survey of 1,000 IT and business executives released by MSP 2nd Watch today. The research found that 35 percent of participants plan to spend 10 to 20 percent more on such services, and 13 percent plan to spend 21 to 30 percent more. As for potential drivers, 2nd Watch found the opportunity to boost revenue to be the biggest (31 percent), followed by the chance to cut costs (24 percent), the ability to enhance customer service (22 percent) and faster time-to-market for upcoming products and services (20 percent). The survey also identified key challenges AWS users face with the cloud, with a lack of internal technical skills (34 percent) being the top issue when implementing new cloud services. Of note for the channel, 36 percent said they will turn to a third-party organization for help. AT&T's irrigation AT&T has made its AT&T Smart Cities irrigation solution availble to members of its Alliance Channel. According to the vendor's announcement, solution provider partners will now have access to the solution, which uses Internet of Things controllers to monitor water flow and usage in "near real-time", according to AT&T. It claims the offering has use cases in retail, office parks, landscaping, golf courses, hotels and resorts. The offering also allows users to locate leaks or breaks in pipes and turn off water flow to prevent damage and water waste, AT&T said. Westcon-Comstor's addition Weston-Comstor has added Viptela to its invitation-only Acclerate program. Under the program, Westcon-Comstor will provide the SDW-WAN organization with regional support and delivery sources as it looks to grow its channel footprint and enter new markets, the companies said in today's  announcement. "Exploding market demand for Viptela's technology makes this the perfect time to enlist Westcon-Comstor to help us expand our geographic reach and pool of worldwide solution providers," Anthony D'Angelo, VP of worldwide channel sales at Viptela, said in a statement.

Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Reportedly Developing Non-Invasive Blood Sugar Sensors By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: APRIL 13 2017 A small, secret team of biomedical engineers at Apple is said to be working on a "holy grail" for diabetics: wearable sensors that could continuously monitor a person's blood sugar levels without the need for pin-prick testing. Based in a small facility in Palo Alto, Calif., the Apple project "has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area," CNBC reported yesterday, citing information from "three people familiar with the matter." According to the report, Apple has been working for at least five years to develop such biomedical devices. The program was reportedly inspired by Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011. Apple did not respond to our request for comment on the report. No Breakthrough Product Yet A chronic disease in which the body cannot produce or use insulin properly, diabetes currently affects more than 420 million people around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The disease causes a wide range of health complications, including blindness, heart attacks, and stroke, and is blamed for millions of premature deaths every year. Diabetes can often be controlled through exercise, diet, medication and insulin injections, but monitoring the condition can require patients to regularly draw a small amount of blood for testing. "Pricking a finger multiple times a day to monitor their blood glucose levels often proves overwhelming for patients with diabetes," the JAMA Network reported in a July journal article. "Many simply won't follow their physician's recommendation to test so frequently, making it harder to manage their condition." Over the years, such difficulties have led to numerous and well-funded efforts to develop an effective, easy and non-invasive way to monitor blood sugar levels. However, no such breakthrough product has yet to hit the market. Active Health Tech Market According to the CNBC report, until 2015, Apple's glucose monitoring project had been led by Michael Hillman, who is now the head of hardware at Facebook's virtual reality firm, Oculus. Apple's engineering team is believed to include a number of experts hired away from biomedical companies such as C8 Medisensors, Medtronic, and Vital Connect. One of CNBC's unnamed sources said Apple's goal is to find a way to measure blood sugar using light-based sensors on the skin. The sensors could be incorporated into devices, such as the Apple Watch, to provide diabetic wearers with continuous blood monitoring. Many companies are working to develop new sensors and other technologies for the health industry. Former Apple platform architect Bob Messerschmidt, for example, left the company in 2013 to start Cor, which plans to produce a home blood-testing device for monitoring a wide variety of health indicators, including glucose and cholesterol. In an interview with Fast Company last year, Messerschmidt criticized Apple for being extremely secretive about its projects. Microsoft is working with a number of health organizations to make use of its holographic computing device, the HoloLens. For instance, HoloLens could be used to create simulated environments for nurses to safely, but realistically train for disaster response. And last year, Google/Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences began working with the pharmaceutical company GSK on a joint project to develop bioelectronic medicines. The biomedical tech industry has also had some spectacular failures, including Theranos, a U.S. blood-test technology startup that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital before questions about the effectiveness of its products led to regulatory and criminal investigations. The company has since laid off a large portion of its workforce and closed its lab facilities. Image credit: Product shots by Apple.

This Fool takes a look at two competing rumors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 13, 2017 at 11:30AM A while back, TrendForce said that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 will come packed with 3 GB of DRAM, just as the current iPhone 7 Plus does. The iPhone 7s, on the other hand, will sport 2 GB of DRAM, just as the current iPhone 7 does. According to analyst Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company (via MacRumors), though, all three iPhone models that will launch this year will pack 3 GB of RAM. Image source: Apple. Which one of these analysts is more likely to be right? Let's take a closer look. More RAM is nice, but it's a cost adder Although Apple's smartphones are premium devices with price tags to match, Apple can't just throw features in willy-nilly; there needs to be a good reason from a user experience/selling point perspective to add more features. Right now, memory prices are quite high (just look at how well the memory makers are doing these days), so not only does additional memory add cost, but it's a relatively significant one at this point. It makes sense for Apple to include additional memory in the iPhone 7 Plus/iPhone 7s Plus/iPhone 8 for a couple of reasons. First, these phones simply have higher-resolution displays than the iPhone 7 does (and the iPhone 7s presumably will). For graphics-intensive applications like games, the additional memory can help improve performance at higher resolutions. Additionally, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo argued a while ago that the additional RAM is helpful for the added functionality that the dual-camera system found on the iPhone 7 Plus (and will be found on the iPhone 7s Plus/iPhone 8). Obviously, more RAM is better, but there needs to be a legitimate reason from a user experience perspective for Apple to add that RAM and therefore increase the cost to produce the device, which would translate into either an increase in end-user device cost or lower product gross profit margins for Apple. I'm just not sure I see that reason.  A potential solution One thing that other smartphone vendors have done is tie the amount of RAM included in a device to the amount of flash storage inside the device. So, there could very well be a scenario under which both TrendForce and Arcuri are correct. The entry-level iPhone 7 with 32 GB of flash storage, for example, could come with 2 GB of RAM, while the higher-priced models with 128 GB and 256 GB of storage could come with 3 GB of RAM. In this case, Apple would be cutting somewhat into its gross profit margin per device with the higher storage tier models, but the higher-margin profiles on those devices would be able to somewhat cushion the blow. I don't know how likely it'd be for Apple to offer different RAM configurations based on the device, though (especially since it wouldn't be able to actually advertise the difference, as Apple doesn't ever talk about the RAM capacities of its devices). Foolish takeaway My inclination is to believe that the next 4.7-inch iPhone will have 2 GB of memory rather than three, as this should allow Apple to keep costs under control -- especially in an environment in which DRAM is relatively pricey -- while still delivering a compelling user experience. There's always the possibility of Apple trying to segment DRAM capacity within the iPhone 7s lineup based on storage capacity, but I think the odds of that are slim.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Niels Epting Apple has a secret team of researchers trying to solve one of medicine’s biggest challenges Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 13th, 2017 at 12:41 PM Share Tweet A fascinating new report from CNBC claims that Apple has a secret team of scientists, researchers, and biomedical engineers trying to develop a way to noninvasive measure a user’s glucose levels. As it stands now, the only way for a diabetic to measure his or her glucose levels is to draw blood from a finger or to use an implanted sensor linked up to an external device. That said, if Apple is able to succeed where dozens of biotech firms have previously failed, it would mark one of the more significant medical breakthroughs of our time. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo Dot for the first time this year According to the report, Apple’s research initiative in this area has been ongoing for five years. Indeed, when Apple began assembling a team to develop the first incarnation of the Apple Watch, it hired a number of individuals with broad and deep experience in the realm of non-invasive blood glucose research. One person said about 30 people were working in this group as of a year ago. But speculation has been flying around since the company snapped up about a dozen biomedical experts from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo Corp, Sano, Medtronic, and C8 Medisensors. Some of these people joined the secretive team dedicated to glucose, sources said, while others are on Apple Watch team. One of the people said that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. While there’s no doubt Apple is working on and researching such advanced technologies, the prospects of Apple actually succeeding is, by all accounts, extremely low. Over the past many years, innumerable biotech companies have tried to develop sensors and technologies capable of noninvasively monitoring blood glucose levels, and while some companies have seen some extremely mild success, there is no body of evidence to suggest that a marketable solution is right around the corner or even inevitable. I’d love to be proven wrong, but it’s hard to ignore the words of John L. Smith — one of the world’s preeminent experts on non-invasive glucose measuring technologies — who wrote the following back in 2013: … I’m sad to say that no technology has yet reached the marketplace, or for that matter, been reliably reported as actually succeeding in laboratory or clinical testing. I have personally looked at perhaps another two dozen technologies (but can’t discuss many of these newer ones, due to confidentiality agreements), been intrigued by a few and disappointed in most others. Some new companies have joined the quest, and many others have reached the end of their participation. While it’s possible for Apple to succeed where others have fallen short, I believe that it’s far-fetched to expect Apple to come up with a medical breakthrough in the near future, let alone a miniaturized solution that could fit on a wearable device as compact as the Apple Watch.

Skip to content Home Research Contact Twitter LinkedIn Feed Menu Research LoupVentures Apple’s Glucose Monitor Better Delivered via AirPods Than the Watch April 13, 2017April 13, 2017 By Doug Clinton http://media.blubrry.com/loup_ventures/p/loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/041-airpods-glucose.mp3 Media reports suggest Apple is aggressively pursuing the creation of a non-invasive blood glucose monitor. The most obvious device to leverage this monitor may seem to be the Apple Watch; however, as we wrote two weeks ago, we think that, long term, AirPods are a more important product for Apple than the Apple Watch, because biological data available in the ear is much richer than the data available from the wrist. This makes AirPods a better candidate to be Apple’s glucose monitoring solution in the future. Source: Apple A recent study on wrist-worn heart rate monitors, including the Apple Watch, suggests that they offer spotty accuracy at best. The study showed that the Polar M7 chest-worn monitor has a 99% correlation coefficient to an electrocardiogram when measuring heart rate, the industry standard.  The Apple Watch had the next highest coefficient at 91%, with the study noting that the accuracy decreased as exercise levels increased. While 91% accuracy may be acceptable for recreational heart rate monitoring, it’s not acceptable for blood glucose monitoring. In a separate study, scientists tested the use of an ear-based sensor to calculate VO2 max during exercise. The study showed that the ear-based sensor had a 98% correlation coefficient to an electrocardiogram when measuring heart rate, nearly the same as the Polar M7 monitor. We believe that movement of the wrist during activity is a key factor in reducing accurate biological readings, a problem that impacts ear-based wearables significantly less. We also believe that the ear offers the possibility to collect better data, which the aforementioned study seems to confirm, and richer data, because of the semi-internal nature of the ear canal, proximity to the brain, and greater blood flow in the area. If Apple does use AirPods to monitor glucose via the ear, they wouldn’t be the first company to try it. Integrity Applications sells a product called GlucoTrack, which uses an ear-clip device to monitor ultrasonic, electromagnetic, and thermal data to produce a blood glucose reading. Apple may be able to incorporate similar functionality into AirPods, creating a multifunction device. Transforming medicine has long been a focus at Apple, particularly under Tim Cook. The company pioneered ResearchKit to drive forward medical research through rich patient data. Apple also created CareKit to enable developers to create better applications that help users manage their health. Developing solutions for a condition like diabetes, which affects millions of people around the world, is a next logical step. We think that step happens at the ear, not the wrist.

If the iPhone and Apple Watch maker is successful, it won’t be necessary to pierce the skin to get accurate blood sugar readings any more—something no other company has been able to figure out. Apple is working on diabetes blood sensors that don’t pierce your skin Insider sources speaking with CNBC said Apple’s project is already far enough along to start feasibility trials. They say Apple is working with clinics in the bay area, and has hired consultants to help with health regulations. Solving the non-invasive blood sugar sensing puzzle is a big accomplishment because accuracy is critical, and so far no biomedical company has been able to reliable manage that. Apple’s system is said to use light to measure glucose levels through the skin, but little else is known about how the system works. Apple’s Diabetes Sensor Team Apparently Apple’s team has been working on the sensors for five years and is following through with an idea Steve Jobs had for a wearable diabetes monitoring device. About 30 people are on the project. Apple isn’t confirming CNBC’s report, but it does fit with health and fitness-related hires. Michael O’Reilly MD who was the Chief Medical Officer at Masimo, Ravi Narasimhan who served as vice president of research at the biomedical sensor company Vital Connect, Nancy Dougherty who was in charge of hardware at the transdermal medicine delivery company Sano, Ueyn Block who was director of optics and systems engineering at C8 MediSensors, Ceracor CTO Marcelo Lamego, and Todd Whitehurst who worked at Senseonics as vice president of product development have all joined Apple over the past few years. Assuming Apple is at the clinical trial phase for their diabetes sensor, navigating the regulatory process is likely coming soon. Odds are we’ll learn more about Apple’s project as it progresses, assuming the company really did solve the problem biomedical companies haven’t been able to crack.

She’s “borderline” and has to watch her sugars like a hawk so she doesn’t have to start insulin. Poking her finger several times per day isn’t much fun. This would be fantastic for her.

Assuming the rendering is legit, the iPhone 8 will look a lot like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 smartphone. A screenshot supposedly from a Foxconn factory shows the iPhone 8 schematic The image showed up on the Chinese social network site Weibo and is supposed to have come from inside Foxconn, which is Apple’s iPhone production partner. The rendering shows an iPhone with dimensions similar to the iPhone 7, but with a much larger display. The phone also has stacked rear-facing cameras instead of horizontal, and the Touch ID sensor is centered on the phone’s back below the Apple logo. The rendering is tagged as EVT 03, which means it’s the third revision of the Engineering Validation Test. That means it’s most likely from a design that’s still in flux, so it may not be the version that lands on store shelves this fall. Reports prior to this rendering leaking claim Apple’s iPhone 8 will sport a body size similar to the iPhone 7 with a larger screen with curved edges and no side bezel. The Touch ID button will be embedded in the display glass, plus the phone will support wireless charging, and include a 3D sensing front-facing camera. That generally fits with the screenshot we’re seeing from Weibo. It’s possible this is a design variation Apple has ready to go if it can’t get the embedded display Touch Id sensor working. It’s also possible this is a complete fake and isn’t a shot from inside Foxconn’s factory. We’ll be able to get a better idea what the iPhone 8 will really look like once component photos start leaking. iPhone 7 schematics were leaking about this time last year, so today’s shot is right on schedule. The usual blurry photos showing the phone’s body and other components should be coming soon. Still, we’re a little skeptical that this is the final design for the iPhone 8.

It’s a minor change and Apple hasn’t made a big deal about it. The change was made public in just a couple of tweets sent out by the department’s marketing head. This streamlines the company’s audio-related offerings and makes the branding similar to that of Apple Music. The decision to drop the branding separates the Podcasts app from the legacy of iTunes. Apple appears to have taken a keen interest in the podcasting market. It’s certainly a big one and continues to grow. Apple’s Eddy Cue has previously promised that the Podcasts app is going to get some new features in the near future. The company is yet to reveal precisely what these new features are going to be but it goes to show that Apple is serious about making its presence felt in the podcasting space and a rebrand is a good way to go about this as it seeks to step up its efforts in the coming months. Apple is not revealing anything else about its plans for Podcasts so we’ll have to wait and see when it comes out with new features for the app. It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts.

Here are some fantastic options! USB-C is becoming the new standard connector and Apple is jumping on board in a big way. The newest MacBook Pro surprised everyone by only having Thunderbolt 3 (A.K.A USB-C) ports, and that left a lot of people scrambling for dongles, including card readers. Whether you just bought a new Apple product that only supports USB-C or you're doing a little future proofing, here's a list of our favorite USB-C card readers for Mac. IOGEAR USB-C 3-Slot card reader Transcend USB 3.1 Type-C multi-card reader Cable Matters USB 3.1 type-C dual slot card reader SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II USB-C card reader IOGEAR USB-C 3-Slot card reader Just like the name suggests, the IOGEAR USB-C 3-slot card reader can accommodate three different types of cards; SD, microSD, and Compact Flash. The Wirecutter was impressed with the reliability of the IOGEAR, as it performed consistently during testing. "The IOGear has fast speeds, works consistently, and comes with a great warranty, all for about the same price as the competition." No drivers, updates, or software need to be installed to use the IOGEAR USB-C 3-slot card reader, making it easy to use with all your devices at will. See at Amazon Transcend USB 3.1 Type-C multi-card reader Another great option for people who have a lot of various cards, the Transcend USB 3.1 Type-C multi-card reader should have you covered. All three types of cards are supported, SD, microSD, and Compact Flash, and it even has a Memory Stick slot on the back. For most people that will mean nothing, but for the select few who use the older technology, it may be a welcome surprise. When the folks at the The Wirecutter put the Transcend USB 3.1 Type-C multi-card reader through testing, it's read and write speeds were satisfactory. "The Transcend was about as fast as the IOGear, with read and write speeds of 82 MB/s and 70 MB/s respectively during our SD card test, and read and write speeds of 83 MB/s and 60 MB/s during our microSD card test." The Transcend USB 3.1 Type-C multi-card reader also comes with a LED indicator light to let you know when your cards connected and being read. See at Amazon Cable Matters USB 3.1 type-C dual slot card reader Perfect for people who don't use Compact Flash cards, the Cable Matters USB 3.1 type-C dual slot card reader supports both SD and microSD cards. With no need to install any drivers, and a handy LED indicator light, he Cable Matters USB 3.1 type-C dual slot card reader is as simple and straightforward as it gets. According to The Wirecutter, its performance was satisfactory during testing. "During our SD card tests, the Cable Matters reader had a read speed of 81 MB/s and a write speed of 70 MB/s. When we tested the unit with a microSD card, it had a read and write speed of 81 MB/s and 64 MB/s respectively." Due to the lack of Cable Matters USB 3.1 type-C dual slot card reader is smaller than both the Transcend and IOGEAR, making it even easier to carry around! SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II USB-C card reader If you're using a camera and cards that support UHS-II speeds, you should take a look at the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II USB-C card reader. Officially licensed by Apple, the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II USB-C card reader only support SD cards, but does so with lightning speed! The Wirecutter clocked the read and write speeds of the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II USB-C card reader at 256 MB/s and 193.6 MB/s, respectively, nearly three times the speed as any other reader included on our list.

Computers designed to sit on or under a desk ushered in the era of personal computing—and atrocious office furniture. Then desktops all but died when laptops and phones became powerful enough to get work done without chaining you down. With nothing left to lose, desktop makers are rethinking what a stationary computer is good for. Now you can draw on them, stack them in modular pieces, or use them to surround your head in pixels. There is one that’s all touch screen, top and bottom, like Geordi La Forge’s warp-drive controls on “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” Many are aimed at creative types who will pay $3,000 for fanciness. But by breaking out of the beige box, computers are becoming more human. They bend to meet our specific needs—in some cases, literally. A couple of developments are fueling the reinvention. Insanely large screens are cheaper. Microsoft made Windows 10 friendly to touch and other inputs, opening up some crazy new ways to interface with a computer—hey, dials! And the cloud untethered us from any one device: You are on a phone during the commute, laptop on the plane and at the office, a giant screen. Notably absent from the conversation (for now) is Apple, which hasn’t made a significant change to the iMac’s form in nearly a decade. Last week, Apple signaled we will see improved iMacs later this year, and an overhaul to its Mac Pro line in the more distant future. But it doesn’t take Apple to make desktops cool. Here are four of the most successful reinventions I’ve been testing. If your ideal work setup looks anything like a stock trader’s, have I got a computer for you. With 34 (yes, 34) inches of gently curving screen, the striking HP Envy is like having your own desktop IMAX theater. Starting at $1,830, the Envy is a natural evolution for massive multitaskers who already stack multiple monitors. But it may also appeal to people who like to kick back and watch movies from a swivel chair. The Envy (look for the 2017 model) has respectable horsepower for its price, sufficient for all but high-end gaming. It supports all the plugs you will need to stay connected for the foreseeable future, such as USB-C. And HP built a nice loud set of speakers into the base to complete the cinematic experience. Bonus: The webcam can be tucked away for extra privacy. Just know that with great size come complications. You will need to make room on your desk for a wide landing pad. Know, too, that with a 21:9 aspect ratio, that screen is longer than most HD TV shows—though it’s the right shape for some blockbuster movies. And while all that real estate means doing 10 things at once, I sometimes lost track of my mouse. This is the computer that made me cheat on my iMac. Microsoft’s $3,000 take on the all-in-one balances a stunning 28-inch screen on a hinge so it can swing from 90 to 20 degrees with the gentlest of taps. Why would you want that? So you can touch it, pinching to zoom on photos, flicking through pages, even drawing with your fingers. The swivel is an elegant solution to the “gorilla arm” problem raised by Steve Jobs and others—touch screens are hard to use at 90 degrees. While the Surface Studio looks handsome enough to adorn any home office or living room, its core audience is artists who can make use of its 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution display and array of specialized input tools. There is an included pressure-sensitive stylus and a $100 rotating Surface Dial. © Emily Prapuolenis/the Wall Street Journal My biggest holdup is the price. My review unit quickly became my favorite tool for using Photoshop, but I’d only buy it if Microsoft drops the price below $2,000. I might forgive Microsoft if the Surface Studio were as powerful as other PCs in its price range, but even at $3,000, it lacks the horsepower to run a VR headset, for example. Dell picked up on the swiveling touch-screen idea with the XPS 27, which can lie completely flat, but requires more muscle than the Surface Studio does. Think of this as the iMac upgrade we have been waiting for from Apple. For home offices and dorm rooms in need of a multimedia powerhouse, the $1,500 XPS 27 includes a 4K screen and a 10-speaker system mounted like a soundbar that sets a new high bar for computer audio. Soon, they will even have a version for $2,100 with enough graphics horsepower to run VR headsets like the Oculus Rift. The problem is space. Though the XPS 27 comes in slimming black, there is no hiding that it’s considerably chunkier than a Surface Studio. And Dell put the webcam beneath the screen, so Skype video chats shoot straight up your schnoz. The XPS 27 may be the most normal-looking in my lot of reinventions, but not for long. In May, Dell plans to sell a 27-inch screen accessory called the Canvas, which connects to the XPS 27 (and other models). For $1,800, it replaces the keyboard and mouse with touch, pen and Dell’s own dial control. All touch…everywhere. Traditional desktop computers took design cues from boxy office towers. HP’s Pavilion Wave looks more like London’s “Gherkin.” A rounded shape and a woven fabric cover make this $480 computer a welcome sight in bedrooms or family rooms, or standing proudly beside a TV it powers. You might think the Thermos-sized Wave was a speaker, and you’d be right: Its central speaker produces full and loud sound, but because it’s just one unit, it can’t offer stereo separation. The Wave can power a 4K TV. However, if you are going to add it to your home entertainment system, pay the extra $170 to upgrade it to handle gaming and video editing. Write to Geoffrey A.

Cureton 15 hours ago 46 Comments 346 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment Apple – which is perhaps the most popular and lucrative computer company in the world at the moment – may be considering an acquisition of Disney to the tune of over $200 billion dollars. Over the course of the past ten-plus years, Apple has created a nice little spot for itself as a premier mover and shaker in the tech industry. Likewise, Disney continues to be a powerhouse when it comes to producing and distributing incredibly successful blockbuster success stories – with the most recent example coming in the form of the $1 billion worldwide hit that is Beauty and the Beast. The very idea that the two industrial superpowers might consider pooling their resources is one rife with financial possibility. If Apple and Disney were to merge into one company, the newly formed conglomerate would be able to pose a potential source of significant competition to the likes of Netflix – seeing as how Disney holds the rights to countless intellectual properties and subsidiary animation studios such as Pixar. According to Variety, current speculation has Apple eyeing to buy Disney for upwards of $200 billion in a deal that would create a company whose combined worth would equal $1 trillion. Such a move would facilitate the means by which Apple tech could be integrated into Disney theme parks and an immediate collaboration between Disney’s film properties and Apple’s user base – so long as RBC Capital Markets has their facts straight. If Apple does in fact buy Disney, then both parties would see highly accretive earnings amounting to a 15%-20% earning boost per share, provided there is a 40% premium deal price and Disney’s outstanding debts are low. Even though the deal would carry a hefty price tag, RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp are fairly certain that the added benefits of Disney’s theme parks and ESPN global streaming sports rights could win Apple over. Speaking to why the deal would be attractive for both parties, Cahall and Kulp commented: “We like Disney’s fundamentals. Assuming Apple sees the same thing and has the cash, investor anticipation of a prospective transaction only adds conviction to the momentum we see in Disney’s shares.” The idea of Apple and Disney operating as one larger company is certainly a hefty bit of information to take in, as the effects of such a merger would signal big changes for the entertainment and tech industries in the very near future. For now, here’s to hoping for the very best for everyone involved however things turn out. Source: Variety BY: Sean K.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Global Apple Accessories Market Expected to Grow at 4.6% CAGR, 2016-2020: FMI Valley Cottage, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/13/2017 — The global Apple accessories market is expected to grow at 4.6% CAGR over the forecast period, 2016-2020. Demand is expected to remain strong in China, where rapid adoption of smartphones, combined with an increasing preference towards the ‚Apple’ brand is pushing sales. The market in China is expected to grow at 8.5% CAGR through the forecast period. Globally, the demand for Apple accessories is expected to be positively influenced by the growing BYOD trend. Weak distribution channels in emerging markets have remained a longstanding challenge for manufacturers. However, popularity of e-commerce and focus on creating alternative distribution channels have positively impacted Apple accessories sales in emerging markets. The steady growth in these markets is expected to offset weak demand in developed markets of the U.S. and Europe. Apple accessories sales in Asia will be driven by rising popularity of e-commerce websites and apps. As is the case in Asia, steady e-commerce sales are driving Apple accessories sales in Brazil and Russia. These factors will contribute to the overall growth of the global market. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-3374 Future Market Insights identifies that undefined standards in terms of components and technology have led to price and product differentiation. Moreover, widespread availability of counterfeit and pirated products offered at a fraction of the original price in various developing countries can significantly inhibit demand for Apple accessories. The Future Market Insights report reveals that iPhone screen guards will continue to be the most-sought after accessory among consumers. iPad cases and iPad screen guards are expected to remain the other lucrative product types. Collectively, these three product segments accounted for over 50% revenue share of the global market in 2016, and the status quo will remain unchanged throughout the forecast period. Among these product types, iPad cases segment will only witness an increase in its revenue share by 2020. North America will continue to be the most lucrative market, with the US leading total sales. The North America Apple accessories market was valued at US$ 1.93 Bn in 2016, with the US accounting for US$ 1.38 Bn in revenues. Future Market Insights projects the North America market revenues to increase at a CAGR of 4% CAGR through 2020. The report further reveals that the Apple accessories market in Europe is predicted to register a CAGR of 4.0% in the span of next four years. However, the Apple accessories market in South East Asia is expected to witness relatively sluggish growth by the end of 2020. Send An Enquiry@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-3374 3M, Bose Corporation, Western Digital Corporation (SanDisk), Logitech, Otter Products, LLC., Decoded, Adobe, Bang & Olufsen, Incase and ACCO (Kensington Computer Products Group) are the key manufacturers operating in the Apple accessories market globally.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Next-gen AirPods might get some very cool new features Chris Smith @chris_writes April 10th, 2017 at 5:09 PM Share Tweet Apple’s AirPods are one of the hottest products Apple launched last year, but there’s always room for improvement. Apparently, Apple seems to agree, at least according to a new revelation that suggests the next-gen AirPods will bring over some of the features you’ve been waiting for. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus speed test: It’s not even close According to a new patent first found by Patently Apple the future AirPods will come with a brand new type of case. In addition to charging the AirPods when not in use, the case could charge other devices wirelessly, including the iPhone and Apple Watch. The feature essentially transforms the case into a power pack that could prolong the life of your iPhone by a few hours in certain cases. Naturally, the flip side is that AirPods charging would take a back seat. Image Source: Apple via USPTO “Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple’s iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple’s iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple’s iPad devices), laptop or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output,” Apple explains. That’s certainly an interesting finding, which seems to offer quite a few gems. Apple is apparently working on adding wireless charging to a bunch of devices, including iPhone and Mac. Furthermore, that holographic projection system sounds like some sort of augmented reality solution. The iPhone 8 is rumored to support wireless charging, so it’ll be interesting to see whether the next-gen AirPods case can be used as a mobile charger for the handset. On top of that, the patent indicates that Apple’s next-gen AirPods case may also be water-resistant. Does that mean second-gen AirPods will also be water-resistant? The US Patent & Trademark Office published a bunch of AirPods-related patent applications on March 30th, all filed in September 2016, including patent application number 2017009439 that mentions these potential new features.

Yesterday AAPL: 141.05 -0.75 PSA: Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter gets a firmware update to version 1.0.5 Jeff Benjamin - Apr. 13th 2017 9:40 am PT @JeffBenjam Lightning acessories View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit If you recently plugged in Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter, you were likely met with an alert requesting an update for the device. The update is performed over the air directly via the iOS device that the dongle is connected to. It’s not clear what new enhancements or bug fixes, if any, are included with the new update, but there are no glaring user-facing changes that we’ve spotted thus far. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? When you connect an official dongle, such as Apple’s USB Camera Adapter, you’ll find a new section in the iOS Settings app dedicated to the device under the General section. This area includes information pertaining to the device, such as manufacturer, model number, serial number, firmware version, and hardware version. Prior to agreeing to the update, the firmware version for the Apple USB Camera Adapter was at 1.0.1. After plugging the dongle into my iPad and agreeing to the requested update, the firmware saw an update to version 1.0.5. This new firmware appears to have been released sometime within the last month or so. When you first plug in the device, you’ll see an Accessory Update Available alert appear on-screen. The alert asks: “Would you like to update ‘Apple USB Camera Adapter'”? You can defer the update until later by tapping the Later button, or proceed with the update by tapping Update. The process of updating the Apple USB Camera Adapter firmware is simple, but it does take a minute or so to complete. Once the update is completed, you can venture over to Settings → General → Apple USB Camera Adapter. There, you’ll find that the firmware version has been updated to version 1.0.5. Keep in mind that this firmware release is for Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter. The standard USB 2.0 Camera Adapter did not receive a firmware update. To learn about the benefits of the USB 3.0-enabled adapter, be sure to read our full hands-on review. Firmware updated to version 1.0.5 Unlike an iOS update, Apple doesn’t provide release notes with its USB Camera Adapter firmware update. Thus, it’s unclear as to what the update fixes or changes, but there are no obvious changes that appear at the surface other than an updated firmware version. It could be possible that this update enhances compatibility with certain cameras, such as just-released high-profile products like Panasonic’s GH5, it could also have some bearing on audio compatibility since this adapter is primed for podcasting and voiceover workflows on the iPad. If we hear any specific details regarding what the update includes, we’ll be sure to update this post.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. It seem like Apple didn't fixed the major battery drain in 10.3-10.3.1 update. I swear, my battery wasn't behaving like that back in iOS 9! — Ian Kelly (@ianjsays) April 7, 2017 https://twitter.com/SaranMufc_/status/850568176555261952 @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 10 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world.

From doodling as a kid to producing illustrations for the Apple store, Dubai expatriate, Dina Sami, is fulfilling her dreams of being an artist. Sami, originally from Palestine, has created illustrations inside the new Apple Store in Dubai Mall, which is scheduled to open on April 27. The store has a uniquely designed barricade under the theme 'Creativity Connected' that features the creative community in Dubai from start-ups, independent art galleries, and local app developers to boutiques, cafes and food trucks. Sami's illustration shows creative brands in Dubai, such as Charicycles, SALT, Alabbar, ING Creatives and Made By Native. Sami, who grew up in Dubai, said: "I love that I witnessed Dubai transform and was here throughout the process. Illustrating is a passion of mine and I'm always learning new styles and techniques. I used to doodle a lot since I was a kid and my family used to tell me that they were good." "I lived in New York for six years and when I moved back here, an ex-colleague saw my illustrations and told me that I should do something about it. So, I reached out to Tom & Serg to let me do illustrations. I had no idea what I wanted to draw, but I knew I really wanted to work on a project with them as they brought a different vibe to the city. I ended up doing their chalk wall, which was an amazing experience." She added that it was one of her dream jobs. "Being approached by Apple was by far the best phone call I ever picked up because creativity and Apple go hand in hand. Their concept was awesome and worked so nicely with what the brands were portraying." "I know these brands, been to their stores, followed them and I am a huge fan of them. It was a privilege working with Apple representing creative community in Dubai. I'm super excited about this project. The response from my family and friends has been so positive and even strangers are overwhelming me with their compliments.

To others, useful entertainment purveyors. And if done right, headphones hit a home run on multiple counts, as good to look at as they are to wear and hear. That’s the holy grail that Gizmo Guy’s been pursuing this spring, stepping out with some snazzy sound makers wrapped around my ears. So what’s the fairest of them all? First, the Ground Rules: A variety of internet radio and subscription music services were deployed, using current artists as diverse as Hurray for the Riff Raff and Drake, as I tested for comfort and ease of use on my 25-minute walk to work. To keep the sonic comparisons even, though, I  subjected the entire bunch, repeatedly, to a single, truth-telling tune nabbed from the Deezer Premium + high-resolution subscription service: Philadelphia-raised jazz saxophone legend John Coltrane and all-acoustic cohorts (including homies Lee Morgan on trumpet and Philly Joe Jones on drums, plus Paul Chambers on bass, Kenny Drew on piano, and Curtis Fuller on trombone) blowing a beautifully fluttery “I’m Old Fashioned”  from the legendary 1958  Blue Train album.   Master of its Dynamic Domain: Penn grad (and collegiate-years La Terrasse manager) Jonathan Levine is the driving force behind the Master & Dynamic headphone brand, positioned, he says, “with one foot in luxury fashion and another in premium tech.” Inspired by WWII-era aviator headphones he spotted at the Smithsonian “on a college exploratory trip to D.C. with my son” (now a Penn senior), M&D’s aluminum-framed, leather-padded phones are such a thing of beauty you’ll be tempted to buy the companion stand ($59) to display them.   Apple put M&Ds into its stores “even after they’d bought Beats,” notes Levine. The Rolling Stones had him issue a limited edition (“their first-ever headphone endorsement”) last year, and Cadillac worked 'em into a current TV commercial for its future-concept Escala. Fine-tuned by an ex-Bose engineer, the corded MH40 Over-Ear Headphones ($399) have an admirably neutral and well-defined sound -- recommended for home use but maybe too clunky to lug around. For the latter application, the smaller and slightly less dynamic MW50 wireless Bluetooth model ($449) is likewise nouveau-retro stylish and about as comfortable as on-ear headphones ever get. A Juicy Apple: Looking like Apple ear buds that had their wires snipped, the Bluetooth-wireless connected AirPods ($159.99)  draw double-takes from passersby. I suspect the novelty will wear off if the company learns how to sell them in quantity (still with that six-week back order!). The tiny storage/battery recharging case that holds AirPods in place (with magnets) is a brilliant design. So are features like automatic music pause when one ear bud is removed and voice control awakened by taps on an earpiece. While lacking ear padding, AirPods are feather light, more comfortable than expected, and commendable for their sonic ambitions. I was crestfallen, though, to hear some speaker rattling on Mr. Fuller’s 'bone solo. I hope they can fix it. BTW -- iPhone calls came in loud and clear, best I’ve heard on a cordless Bluetooth headset.   Liberating Libratone: True to Danish modern design aesthetics and hi-fi history, the Libratone Q Adapt on-ear Bluetooth headphones ($249) look cool and score well in sonic accuracy. Also special: Four-stage electronic noise reduction lets you eliminate some or all of the outside world.   Cupping a hand over the right earpiece pauses music; cupping again restarts it.  E-Z! And volume is varied by spinning one finger around the perimeter of the earpiece. Not as comfortable as MW50s, though the compact Libratone ear cushions concentrate the clamping pressure on a smaller area. Yours Alone: At CES, a specialist for the “bespoke” British audio firm Snugs pointed a custom, 3-D laser-fired device into my ears to take a scan of both ears’ shapes (far from identical!). Then it used the tracings to mold silicon ear buds in an amusing color, turquoise, for fitting to Echobox's spiffy Finder X1 Titanium Earphones ($229), also finely adjustable with three acoustic tuning rings. With the Snugs pushed in and twisted “just so,” the Snugged-up sound is amazing, while the outside world disappears. And unlike everyday in-ear buds, these customs can be comfortably worn for many hours, ideal for a long plane ride.  The bad news: Until U.S. partners are finalized,  you’ll have to fly to England to be laser-fitted for Snugs, though the company is willing to work up a pair from wax molds made at your local audiologist, starting at $197 including house-brand ear buds. Good to the bones: Newtown-based inventor/marketer Tom Buroojy is behind the novel, horizontally wrap-around iHeadbones Bluetooth Bone Conduction Stereo phones (Series 501, $89.95). Speaker drivers are meant to rest on and resonate through the cheekbones right in front of your ears, not on the ears proper. So others can still chat with you, car horns are heard, and hearing stress is minimized. And if it’s already too late to prevent loss, you might find the (mildly vibrating) conductive transmission technology offers some hearing comeback; that's why they're "popular with seniors," Buroojy said.   501s work with a variety of  Bluetooth transmitters  (like the $25 TaoTronics) that connect to TV sets as well as with Bluetooth-enabled phones and tablets.  Bargain prices, mainstream appeal: Don’t want to spend a lot of money for tiny Bluetooth ear buds you could easily lose? The $29.99 list JVC Gumy Wireless are a deal, fit well, and don’t “rattle” Curtis Fuller’s 'bone any more than Apple AirPods do. And the brand-new $59.99 JVC HA-EC30s are totally smooth operators, water resistant, with a rubbery hook that wraps around ears for extra snugness when you’re exercising. Both come in cute colors, too – including yellow, red, and a nice aubergine blue.  Read more by Jonathan Takiff Published: April 13, 2017 — 12:00 PM EDT Thanks for your continued support...

Investors are growing impatient with Apple’s pile of cash. An analyst speculates on why buying Disney makes sense. By Emily Bary April 13, 2017 10:17 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large One analyst is wondering whether Apple could welcome Disney into the fold. Illustration: Mark Ashman/Disney via Getty Image When you’re an ordinary human, it’s smart to have some money to your name. But when you’re a public company, having a large cash balance starts to make investors impatient. That’s the situation Apple finds itself in as it sits on more than $200 billion in cash. Some of the money is parked overseas, and while it’s currently costly to bring those funds back to the U.S., President Donald Trump could make that process cheaper.

So what should Apple do with all the cash? One analyst recently did a 20-page deep-dive into the merits of an Apple buying Disney. “While odds are low,” RBC analyst Amit Daryanani says the deal has “greater than 0% probability” and could benefit Apple in a number of ways. “There are plenty of factors to consider, but such a deal would create a tech/media juggernaut like no other and instantly scale Apple’s services, content, and media portfolio, which would make the case for a higher valuation,” he wrote. The company has made its “Services” segment -- things like Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store -- a bigger priority, but it’s struggled to “replicate its music playbook to video,” Daryanani argues. Apple’s first two original programming efforts appear fairly uninspired. Owning Disney would give the company a massive boost on the content front. With the deal, Daryanani wrote, Apple “leapfrogs Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube.” Currently, Apple’s not even in the conversation. Disney is one of the few companies that can match Apple’s brand power, so the merger wouldn’t drag down either company from a branding perspective, wrote Daryanani. He estimates that Apple would have about $200 billion in cash to use for a deal after “repatriating” its overseas money back to the U.S. and using some of the funds for operational purposes. Daryanani predicts Apple could pay $157 a share for Disney, 40% higher than its current price of $104, using debt to fund part of the acquisition. All in, he sees a deal with a total value $257 billion. Skeptics would rightly argue that Apple doesn’t make giant deals. Having Disney in-house could also put Apple in an awkward position when it comes to dealing with its other content partners. Apple’s most likely use for its cash is most likely investing “organically” in content and continuing to return cash to its shareholders, another analyst wrote a few months back. Ultimately, Apple-Disney will probably remain a Wall Street fantasy, like other potential big deals. Big Picture: A Disney acquisition could make sense for Apple, though odds are low, one analyst says.

Nvidia's Hackintosh Support Is an Insurgency Against Apple's Un-Upgradeable Computers The most powerful graphics card on the market has Apple support but works with almost no Apple computers. For a site called Motherboard, we very rarely write about the various components that make up a computer—much less a driver update for a very specific video card. But in this case I think we should make an exception. Last week, Nvidia announced the TITAN Xp graphics card, a GPU is the most powerful consumer-grade card. It also announced that the TITAN Xp would come with drivers for MacOS, meaning you can put it in Apple computers. Nvidia will also make all of its Pascal-based GPUs compatible with MacOS. The catch here is that there's only one Apple computer that has the PCI slot for a new graphics card: The 2012 Mac Pro. So if you want to put a $1,200 GPU in a computer you can now buy on eBay for a couple hundred bucks, go for it. Or you could buy a series of dongles and cases, edit some system files in the MacOS terminal, buy an external display, and use the TITAN on a MacBook Pro. Or we could just reckon with the fact that Nvidia is now making graphics cards for Hackintoshes, because Apple currently does not make any powerful computers. The Apple developer community is pissed that the new MacBook Pros are underpowered and the Mac Pro hasn't gotten a significant upgrade in four years. A new, modular Mac Pro that could presumably support the TITAN isn't expected until sometime next year. Over on the Hackintosh subreddit, a post about Nvidia's MacOS support is the most upvoted thread of all time; people will no longer have to deal with the myriad compatibilty issues that have plagued GPUs used in Hackintoshes. Hackintoshes, meanwhile, have become the computer of choice for many Apple developers. "OMG, i'd thought i'd never see the day. Am i dreaming? Like seriously this can't be happening right now," Redditor spongeyperson posted in the Hackintosh subreddit. "Holy shit," Redditor EvaUnit01 wrote. "I can finally get a modern GPU so I can work more quickly? Best week on record." And so what you really have here is a revolt against Apple's closed ecosystem and unupgradeable designs. Apple is planning to reverse course and make the new Mac Pro upgradeable, and the Hackintosh movement has become so big, that the biggest GPU maker in the world is making products for it.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Apr 13, 2017 at 11:08AM A pair of Wall Street pros are playing matchmaker, suggesting that it's logical for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to acquire Disney (NYSE:DIS). RBC Capital analysts Steven Cahall and Amit Daryanani, covering Disney and Apple, respectively, are pondering the potential pairing of the two corporate behemoths.  The argument is based on the relaxation of cash repatriation taxation laws, freeing Apple to get creative with the massive sums of money that it's stockpiling overseas. Content-hungry Apple would strike the mother lode if it snapped up the global darling behind the biggest movies, most popular theme parks, and leading sports network. We haven't even gotten to Disney's undisputed market leadership in family friendly entertainment and its massive vault of content. It's a juicy notion, but it's not going to happen. Anything is possible. Daryanani argues that the proposed acquisition is "greater than 0%" but that's a mathematical formula that applies to nearly all scenarios. Let's go over a few of the reasons why reality may be closer to 0%.    Image source: Disney. 1. Apple may not be able to afford Disney Both analysts agree that Apple would have to pay about a 40% premium for Disney, a markup that would prop up Disney's enterprise value to roughly $270 billion. Apple is closing in on $250 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books, and it's obviously not going to get turned down if it wants to borrow some money or raise funds. However, why would Disney settle for a 40% premium for a deal that will take a long time to close -- if it closes at all. Legislation under the current regime may pave the way for smoother repatriation of cash earned overseas, but antitrust regulators can be meticulous and slow. We've seen some deals take as long as two years to close, and the acquisition targets in that time often wither in a rudderless state. Do you really think that regulators will simply sign off on the world's most valuable consumer electronics company shacking up with the world's most valuable content producer? This is going to be a long process, and a target that isn't out of favor is going to want more than just a 40% premium to take on the risk of time wasted and value shaved if a combination falls through. 2. Apple isn't going to play favorites We've seen that "content is king" for platform operators, but the same mantra may not apply to the companies making the hardware. Apple would be grabbing amazing content if it snapped up the House of Mouse. Beyond Disney's decades of homegrown brilliance we're talking about the Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar content that's dominant at the box office these days. However, it comes at a price beyond the buyout premium. Rival studios will not be happy. Apple needs media companies to play nice with its iTunes ecosystem, and that's already a challenge. Imagine how easy it will be for non-Disney studios to strike deals that enrich rival platforms since playing nice with Apple only fortifies Disney's parent. Apple needs to tread carefully if it starts going down the content acquisition rabbit hole.  Apple and Disney would make the ultimate Hollywood couple, but Appney os Disple just isn't going to happen.   Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Walt Disney.

 Apple is slowly killing the iTunes brand Kif Leswing Apr. 13, 2017, 11:31 AM 10,623 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's head of iTunes, Eddy Cue.Getty Images Apple is slowly moving away from its iTunes brand and software and towards a new "Apple" branding.  On Thursday, Apple renamed "iTunes Podcasts" to "Apple Podcasts," 9to5Mac reports. The new name is similar to Apple Music, the company's streaming music service.  There aren't any major changes to Apple's podcast service or app along with the rebrand. Some podcasters recently expressed concerns about Apple's podcasting platform, and the exec in charge, Eddy Cue, has promised future changes.  What's clear is that "Apple" is the company's preferred naming convention for music, podcasts, and other content distribution services. iTunes, which was first introduced in 1998, is on its way out, but it may take years to change all of the Apple products named after it, including the app that is still used to sync an iPhone to Windows or Mac computers.  A previous rumor suggested that Apple could kill the signature iTunes product, single song downloads, but Apple denied that report.  Here's the new logo: It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts. Podcasters, we've got a great new badge to help you promote your shows. 💜📻 pic.twitter.com/c9ZWVmSCsq — Steve Wilson (@StephenWilson) April 13, 2017 SEE ALSO: The 10 best iPhone apps of 2016, according to Apple More: Apple iTunes podcasts Apple Podcasts facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple is slowly killing the iTunes brand Apple is slowly killing the iTunes brand Apple is slowly moving away from its iTunes...

Apple drops the iTunes name from its Podcasts app Posted 15 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story LVH and 55 Capital raise $10 million to build investment solutions for financial advisors Apple has officially dropped the iTunes branding from its Podcasts app. It’s small change, and one that arrived with little fanfare from the company, outside of a few tweets from the department’s marketing head. But it certainly streamlines the offering a bit, keeping it in line with Apple Music and separating it out (in name at least) from the more legacy iTunes line. As 9 to 5 Mac notes, the rebrand could be part of a renewed interest in the podcasting space for the company, in line with “new features” promised by Eddy Cue a month or so back. And now would certainly be a good time for Apple to commit itself more fully to the space, as podcasts become an increasingly important part of the media narrative through shows like This American Life’s wildly popular S-Town, which current monopolizes the top seven slots on the iTunes charts. It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts. Podcasters, we've got a great new badge to help you promote your shows. 💜📻 pic.twitter.com/c9ZWVmSCsq — Steve Wilson (@StephenWilson) April 13, 2017 Apple is certainly well positioned to continue to own the category moving forward, though a renewed focus on that front would be welcomed as more companies like Spotify and Google have shown an increased interest in the space. Part of the new branding is a new badge, designed to promote the service through podcast pages. While Apple, naturally, won’t discuss its future plans, the branding is also interesting so far as the future of iTunes as its own category is concerned. The music software played a major role in reviving Apple’s fortunes alongside the iPod, but while the company has mostly moved away from the standalone music player, iTunes continues to play a major role in its software ecosystem. The company has already taken an important step in that direction when it opted for the simple Apple Music name after the Beats acquisition. The shift in name for Podcasts seems in keeping with that streamlining of the company’s audio offerings.   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iTunes Description iTunes is a digital media player app that can be used to play, download, and organize digital audio and more.

The big feature that has long been rumored on this device is a move to some sort of curved OLED display. The catch is that the display will require Apple to eliminate the normal Touch ID home button on the front of the screen. Early rumors suggested that Apple would do two things to bring biometric security back after ditching that home button. One is integrate facial recognition into the cameras of the smartphone. The other is more difficult and according to the latest rumors making the rounds, is giving Apple a very difficult time. This rumor says that the biggest bottleneck to mass production of the iPhone 8 is integrating Touch ID under the display glass. The source of this rumor is a research note by analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Arcuri says that he has done field work with the supply chain and that work shows that the yield for the Apple in-house AuthenTech-based fingerprint sensor solution is very low. The analyst says that Apple appears to be unwilling to use an outside sensor solution right now. Arcuri says he sees one of three things happening in the wake of the yield issue. Apple will either remove Touch ID from the iPhone 8 entirely and use only the facial recognition tech. Another option is Apple putting the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone in an easier to reach place than Samsung placed its rear fingerprint sensor for the S8. The third solution is that Apple will delay the launch of the iPhone 8, but still announce it in September along with the other iPhone models. This could mean that mass production of the iPhone 8 doesn’t happen until September rather than the expected July or August timeframe.

Technology giant Apple has lodged a complaint against Swiss watchmaker Swatch for using the phrase ‘Tick Different’ in one its marketing initiatives. The slogan is being used by Swatch as part of its marketing campaign to sell a wristwatch having a contactless payment chip. But the smartphone maker Apple said that the phrase has some similarities to its Think Different campaign, which was carried out during 1990s. Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek was quoted by Swiss news site Watson as saying that the similarity was purely coincidental. Hayek said that the slogan has references to one of the company’s own campaign from the 1980s: “Always different, always new”. From 1997 to 2002, Apple carried the Think Different phrase in its advertisements, which was considered as a response to IBM’s Think ad campaign. In 2015, Swatch received a trademark status for the phrase Tick Different in the US. The company also has the trademark for the slogan in Switzerland. In a complaint to the Swiss Federal Administrative Court, Apple’s lawyers Lenz & Staehelin said the tagline was regarded as “the core of the Apple brand” for many years. According to legal experts, Apple must prove that Swatch’s phrase use makes at least 50% of consumers feel that it has some association with Apple products in order to win the case. In September last year, Apple’s attempt to register ‘iWatch’ as a trademark in the UK was blocked by Swatch. The Swiss watchmaker claimed that ‘iWatch’ was too similar to its own trademarks ‘iSwatch’ and ‘Swatch’. The UK’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) agreed with Swatch, upholding its opposition which it filed in March 2014. In March this year, Bloomberg reported that Swatch was developing a watch operating system which will power its Tissot brand watches by the end of 2018. Hayek said that the company does not want to depend on Apple or Google for the operating system and would want to develop an alternative.

It's about longevity and much more -- in fact, all software should be free and open source! Read More , and Apple is smart enough to realize that. And they aren’t the only ones! You can find dozens, even hundreds, of cases where companies released source code for once-proprietary projects — and they usually benefited from it. Here are some of the more notable examples, many of which you’ll probably recognize. 1. Mozilla Firefox Firefox wasn’t always Firefox. Back in the 1990s, when the internet was still new and untapped, the most popular web browser was a proprietary software called Netscape Navigator. However, due to Microsoft’s successful push of the world towards Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator had all but died out in the 2000s.

Due to trademark pressure, Phoenix was first renamed to Firebird and eventually renamed a second time to Firefox. 2. LibreOffice Are you surprised to see LibreOffice on this list? Indeed, LibreOffice wasn’t always open source. It started as a proprietary word processor back in 1985 under the name StarWriter, which was part of StarOffice by StarDivision. The company was later acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999, who took the application and made it into an open source alternative for Microsoft Office, earning it the name OpenOffice. But then Oracle Corporation came in and acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. This prompted some OpenOffice users, who were unhappy with Oracle’s history and reputation as a software developer, to fork the source code and release as LibreOffice. Now here we are today, with LibreOffice as one of the best free office suites currently available Is LibreOffice Worthy of the Office Crown? Is LibreOffice Worthy of the Office Crown? LibreOffice is the king of free office suites. It's unlikely to replace Microsoft Office in a business environment, but it's an excellent alternative for casual users. Here's what's new in LibreOffice 5.1. Read More . 3. ICQ ICQ (“I Seek You”) is a popular instant messenger that launched back in 1996 and paved the way for the success of more well-known apps like AIM, YIM, and MSN Messenger. Surprisingly, ICQ is still used by over 11 million users worldwide. Not much is known about ICQ’s history, but here’s what we do know: ICQ was acquired by AOL in 1998, then sold from AOL to Mail.Ru in 2010, then open sourced by Mail.Ru in 2016. Not much has come from its open sourcing, mainly because most people simply don’t know or don’t care about it. In short, this move is the epitome of “too little, too late” and I don’t expect ICQ to explode in popularity ever again. But it is a nice move by Mail.Ru, so they do deserve some credit. 4. Blender Open source enthusiasts often point to Blender as an example of open source software done right. It serves as proof that open source software can be as good as professional-grade alternatives, and in Blender’s case, that open source software can be better than proprietary software. But here’s the kicker: it wasn’t always open source! Blender began as an in-house animation application in 1995, was released as shareware in 1998, and was shut down in 2002 when the developing company went bankrupt. As a last-ditch effort, the lead developer ran a fundraising campaign and promised to open source Blender if the community raised €100,000. The goal was met in just a few months and Blender has been open source ever since. Not only that, but the Blender community is more alive and active than ever.

The .NET Framework Five years ago, if you’d surveyed a bunch of people for companies who they thought would never embrace the open source philosophy, Microsoft likely would’ve topped the list. So when Microsoft open sourced the .NET Framework A GNU Beginning For Microsoft: What An Open Source .NET Framework Means For The Rest Of Us A GNU Beginning For Microsoft: What An Open Source .NET Framework Means For The Rest Of Us Microsoft just released a significant part of its code under a permissive open source license. This move breaks with years of tradition. But why and what does it mean for you? Read More in 2014, everyone’s jaws dropped. To understand why this was such a monumental moment, we need to know what the .NET Framework is and why it exists in the first place. Released back in 2002, the .NET Framework provides a ton of code that developers can use to speed up the development process. For example, if I want to create a business app, I don’t have to code all the logic for drawing the window to the screen — the framework can handle that for me. Check out our introductory guide to the .NET Framework Microsoft .NET Framework: Why You Need It and How to Install It on Windows Microsoft .NET Framework: Why You Need It and How to Install It on Windows You either need to install or update it. But do you know what the .NET Framework is? We show you why you need it and how you can get the latest version. Read More for more details. The downside is that .NET Framework-based code can only run on machines that have the .NET Framework Runtime Environment, and for a long time this was only available for Windows. But with the framework being open sourced, it can be ported to Mac, Linux, and other operating systems, making it possible to create cross-platform apps with one codebase. 6. Live Writer Microsoft’s foray into open source software wasn’t a one-time thing. In the years since open sourcing the .NET Framework, Microsoft has done the same for several other projects, including the beloved Windows Live Writer application. Back in the 2000s, Microsoft acquired and integrated a company called Onfolio and all of their software products. One of these applications, Onfolio Writer, was released in 2007 as Windows Live Writer, then updated annually until its last version in 2012. At that point, development ceased. Luckily for Live Writer fans, the app was open sourced in 2015 and forked into what is now known as Open Live Writer. This is a prime example of why open source software is great for end users: if the original developers stop working on it, someone else can fork it and keep working on it Open Source Software and Forking: The Good, The Great and The Ugly Open Source Software and Forking: The Good, The Great and The Ugly Sometimes, the end-user benefits greatly from forks. Sometimes, the fork is done under a shroud of anger, hatred and animosity. Let's look at some examples. Read More . 7. Xamarin Studio Here’s a third example of Microsoft doing right by the open source community. Xamarin Studio was a proprietary integrated development environment Text Editors vs. IDEs: Which One Is Better For Programmers? Text Editors vs. IDEs: Which One Is Better For Programmers? Choosing between an advanced IDE and a simpler text editor can be hard. We offer some insight to help you make that decision. Read More that simplified the process of creating Mono, Cocoa, Android, and iOS apps using C#. In early 2016, Microsoft swooped in to acquire Xamarin and all of its software products, then open sourced most of it. Xamarin Studio itself was discontinued because most of its features were incorporated into Microsoft Visual Studio. All of the other software in the Xamarin SDK was released under the MIT License. They even took Mono, a Xamarin-led reimplementation of the .NET Framework that was licensed under GPL and LGPL, and relicensed it under MIT. In other words, Microsoft took a well-known project whose parts were either proprietary or open sourced with restrictions and made most of it truly open source with no restrictions. 8. Visual Studio Code Good text editors for programmers are hard to come by. Sublime Text is excellent but costs $70, and open source alternatives like Atom and Brackets have always had problems (e.g. poor performance, buggy updates, etc). It wasn’t until Visual Studio Code that we could have the best of both worlds. Note: Visual Studio Code is completely separate from Visual Studio. Visual Studio Code first launched in June 2015 under a proprietary closed source license. But after much feedback and many requests from the community, Microsoft opened it up and released it on GitHub under the MIT License. Now it’s arguably the best text editor in existence and many former Sublime/Atom/Brackets users have jumped shipped in favor of it. I personally use it every day and I highly recommend it.

"The resultant company would be massive, with enough cash and balance sheet capacity to change the nature of the hardware, service, and content industries. If there's a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it." According to Variety, the analysts claim an Apple-Disney company would create an instant competitor for Netflix built around Disney content, while their theme parks would benefit from Apple technology. 37 Films to get excited about in 2017 37 show all 37 Films to get excited about in 2017 1/37 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Director: James Gunn Cast: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Kurt Russell Plot: Set two months after the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy travel throughout the cosmos and struggle to keep their newfound family together, while helping Peter Quill learn more about his true parentage.

Some Macbook Owners Say Their Computers Are Making “Popping” Sounds Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Some Macbook Owners Say Their Computers Are Making “Popping” Sounds Image courtesy of Apple April 13, 2017 11:27 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler apple finding problems issues macbook pro popping problems sounds support Some owners of Apple’s latest MacBook Pro offering say their costly devices came with an unwanted addition: an unusual popping sound. 9 to 5 Mac reports that owners of the new computer have begun complaining on Apple’s support page, Reddit, and social media that the laptops make a strange “popping” sound from somewhere within. The unusual sound, owners claim, is similar to what you might hear when squeezing a plastic bottle. “Hello, so I have had this machine for a few days now and I love it, but so far I have noticed that sometimes the machine will make a kinda static like singular pop coming from the one of the speakers or at least the side of the laptop with a speaker on it,” one Reddit user wrote last month. “The sound is very [quiet] and random coming from only one speaker at a time and mostly the right.” One owner writes on Reddit that they had one laptop replaced only to have the replacement make the same “popping” sound. “It’s like an intermittent, popping noise. Kind of like the noise it makes when you get shocked on a doorknob,” the owner wrote. “It’s sometimes very soft, and sometimes very audible.” Although some users say the issue occurs when listening to music or playing games, others say the popping sound occurs out of nowhere. Still, more say the sound seems to occur when the computer is warming up or cooling down. “It isn’t the noise that bothers me, but I’m worried that it is an indication of the batteries slowly coming unglued,” an owner says on Apple’s support forum. “It feels and sounds like sticky tape popping, to me.” In one case, an owner said on Reddit that their MacBook was replaced because the speaker had blown because of bad bootcamp audio drivers. Another MacBook owner says they had the same issue with a 2014 model that was eventually repaired for speaker issues. Some owners have shared their concerns with Apple on Twitter, describing the “popping” sound as occurring multiple times each day. Anyone else’s Touch Bar MacBook Pro make weird popping sounds every now and then? — Oliver Farrell (@oliverfarrell) April 7, 2017 @AppleSupport opened up MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) and heard a popping sound from the left side.

What's the problem? — Lauren (@lululindberg) April 7, 2017 As for Apple, the company’s support Twitter account has replied to some messages, asking users to contact them in a direct message or restart their computer in safe mode, adding that it was “not the experience we want you to have.” While Apple doesn’t appear to have replied to inquiries on the support page, some owners say they have talked to techs either via online chat or at Apple Genius Bars. “I took my laptop in to the genius bar for this popping noise,” one owner says. “They said it is caused by this small dent on the bottom casing hitting the fan.” The owner was told to replace the entire bottom casing at the cost of $130. “I really don’t think that’s the only problem. But hey… they’re the ‘geniuses,’ So check the bottom of your laptops…” the owner writes. However, the customer says that after getting the MacBook Pro back it still made the popping sound. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment on the issue, and will update this post when we hear back.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. It seem like Apple didn't fixed the major battery drain in 10.3-10.3.1 update. I swear, my battery wasn't behaving like that back in iOS 9! — Ian Kelly (@ianjsays) April 7, 2017 https://twitter.com/SaranMufc_/status/850568176555261952 @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 10 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world.

We’ve heard about augmented reality support, 3D photography, and face recognition unlocks, but that’s only scratching the surface. A few weeks ago, Apple confirmed that it acquired a popular iPhone app called Workflow that lets users automate several actions on the iPhone. At the time I speculated that the Workflow team, who’s going to continue working for Apple, might help Apple embed automation features right inside iOS 11. It turns out, however, that Apple has already been contemplating with such feature for some time. The only question is, will the iPhone 8 be the device to offer users advanced automation feature unlike anything seen on an iPhone so far? A recent patent discovery seems to indicate that Apple has been studying iPhone automation at least since early 2014, even though it failed to implement it at iOS level. Awarded to Apple on Tuesday, patent number 9,619,756 describes Methods and systems for managing and automating user customization of a device based on observed user behavior. Apple is essentially looking to use the iPhone as a tool that would be able to detect everything a user does with the help of various sensors, and then suggest automated actions based on repetitive day-to-day tasks and events. US Patent Office These automation tasks would help both the user, while also ensuring the iPhone operates more efficiently. After all, it’d be more efficient for the iPhone to suggest some actions than for the user to have to perform the same tasks with some regularity. Apple argues that “people are used to some regular routine in parts of their life,” which is why we could use automation. “[People] wake up and go to sleep around a regular time. People go to work at a specific location during a specific time frame, as well as perform some other predictable routine activities such as watching a television show during a particular time slot in the week,” Apple says. “There can be changes in life, so that a person might change to a different routine. But usually a person follows some constant routine for a period of time. After that period of time, which can be a number of days or perhaps even a number of years, the person might adapt a new routine and then follow that routine for a new period of time.” The iPhone could observe and learn about a user’s behavior repetitive operations by analyzing data it collects for a period of time. The phone could then suggest the activation of several automation processes. US Patent Office Apple offers a simple example of an automation suggestion. The iPhone could observe that a user turns the phone’s ringer off every day while at work during 8:00 and 9:00 AM. Background software could collect statistical that could then be turned into an automation suggestion. At that point, the phone could offer the user a prompt for a new automation setting. The user can choose to customize it and then enable it. The data the iPhone would collect can vary depending on the specific actions of the user. In this instance, factors like time of day, location, and call history, can be used to analyze and trigger the automation. Apple explains that the iPhone might monitor several aspects. “For example, if the trigger ‘battery level’ is low, then the action can be to turn off the WiFi connection, or some other battery saving operations. As another example, the triggers of ‘motion detector’ and ‘GPS’ can be used to detect that a user is in a car commuting, then the action can be to turn on the Bluetooth connection to an on-car speaker to listen to music or to an on-car device for hands-free calling,” Apple explains. US Patent Office   Even repetitive calendar items can be turned into triggers for certain automated actions. Furthermore, these automatons could be ported to other Apple devices, the patent explains, via simple iCloud synchronization. In fact, the software would also be able to tell users apart and load the appropriate automation features on a device operated by multiple users. The Mac is one such device, one where Apple already has an automation engine in place, which it recently said it’s not about to kill, as some people feared. Currently, you could argue that Apple already has automation features on the iPhone, including Do-Not-Disturb and Night-Mode. But these are part of the phone’s Settings app, and there’s nothing smart about them, at least not in the manner suggested by this patent. With that in mind, let’s not forget that Apple now owns a treasure trove of Workflow interactions that allow various iOS apps to automatically talk to one another. Integrating such automation features at the iOS level would offer iPhone buyers a very useful tool for managing daily habits. The patent also suggests that Apple’s committed to improving artificial intelligence and machine learning. The software needed to provide such automation feature would need to study the user’s behavior and learn his or her preferences. And probably Apple will do all that on the device itself, to protect the user’s privacy. Will such automation features be part of iOS 11? All the pieces seem to be in place for Apple to roll out such a feature. The company purchased Workflow, and the next-gen iPhones will have even more efficient internal components, which should make background monitoring activities like the ones implied by this patent a lot more efficient. That said, there’s nothing to confirm Apple will include automation in iOS 11 at this time.

The companies have terminated the 2014 master franchise development agreement for the development of Big Apple Bagels stores, and have signed a new exclusive licensing agreement for the development of Big Apple Bagels Cafés within the United Arab Emirates. The stores will offer, in addition to bagels, muffins and coffees, a full service dining experience and a broader menu than the typical Big Apple Bagels store. As a result of the termination of the 2014 agreement which extended exclusive development rights to nine Middle East countries in addition to UAE, the new agreement will apply only to UAE thereby releasing the rest of the Middle East for further development and the new licensing agreement will provide BAB with a fixed annual licensing fee for the existing store and each subsequent store developed.

Apple Podcasts promo materials now include a new "Listen on Apple Podcasts" badge, while most of the pre-existing graphics standards and podcast identity guidelines remain unchanged. The rebranding also stretches to the company's Twitter account, where iTunes Podcasts has now turned into @ApplePodcasts so users can get up-to-date recommendations on the newest and best podcasts right from their Twitter feed. The functionality and look of the official Podcasts iOS app appears to have remained the same for now. It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts. Podcasters, we've got a great new badge to help you promote your shows. 💜📻 pic.twitter.com/c9ZWVmSCsq— Steve Wilson (@StephenWilson) April 13, 2017 The new name falls in line with Apple's recent decision to place the company's name in front of the service or product in question -- like Apple Music and Apple Pencil -- and further distances itself from iTunes. During the Code Media Conference this past February, Eddy Cue admitted that Podcasts are seeing a "huge resurgence," and that Apple will "absolutely" do more with the medium in the future. Today's rebranding could be the first step in that direction for the company.

Rating: 5 Votes sully54 16 hours ago at 08:39 am If you think about it, evidence of the breakup of iTunes is right in front of us. iOS has separate apps for music, video (TV and Video apps), podcasts, and the App Store, which are all still currently integrated in iTunes on the mac side. I would be surprised if Apple did not announce this breakup at wwdc. Rating: 3 Votes macduke 16 hours ago at 08:14 am This sounds like they're finally breaking up iTunes at WWDC. My prediction for new apps on the Mac: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple TV (maybe like the TV app on iOS, and has all your "iTunes" movies and shows as well?), and something new for iTunes U. I almost put Apple U, but that seems a little weird. So perhaps a new branding. As for managing iOS devices, they'll probably include a utility for Macs and PCs for the users who still do that—which I imagine is a small but vocal minority. Rating: 3 Votes manu chao 12 hours ago at 11:42 am #1 - Autonomous cars are coming much quicker than 20 years. Saying that today is like the year being 2006 and saying it'll take 20 years for smartphones to become common. Take a guess, when did smartphones reach 50% penetration [in the U.S.]? In 2012, according to this overview ('http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Adoption-Rates-of-Consumer-Technologies.png'). If you want, you can put the beginning of smartphone at 2007 but you could also mark 1996 as the start when the first Nokia Communicator came out. Which would put the 50% milestone at 16 years. So one question is where are we in regard to autonomous cars? I'd say the Nokia Communicator moment in that regard was only a few years ago (adaptive cruise control + lane control). Then there is the question how long does it take from the iPhone moment (the first mass market implementation that is actually good) to the 50% marker? Here, you have to take into account how long the life cycle of a product is, ie, how frequently consumers replace it. For phones that is probably in the range of 2 to 3 years. For cars that is more like 5 to 8 years, ie, more than twice than that. Which would stretch to iPhone to 50% penetration rate from five (2007 to 2012) to more than ten years. Thus even if we had the first fully autonomous car in 2018, that would put the 50% mark at about 2020. And most new technologies have noticeably slower adoption rates. If we take the PC and use the Mac from 1984 as the mass market start, it took until 2000 to reach 50% penetration or 16 years compared to the 5 years of the smartphone (and the longer life cycle of PCs does not fully account for this). And that is before we consider that the regulatory burden (due to the much higher danger coming from cars compared to PCs or smartphones) will slow things further for autonomous cars. #2 - Running errands stops being a thing with autonomous cars. Autonomous cars will play the smaller role in this. Online shopping and virtual human encounters (eg, tele-medicine) will play a bigger part. I listen to music instead of podcasts while doing chores and exercise. Not sure if that applies to everyone or if it's just me. And other people listen to music (or the radio) while driving. They could conclude that autonomous cars would kill music. But the biggest problem with your prediction is that you assume the overwhelming time we spend on getting from A to B is spend sitting in a car. That might be true for most of the U.S., but globally, in big cities, public transport combined with walking and cycling has the bigger share.

Nobody will subsidize this technology. #2 what do you think errands are, and how would a new car eliminate them? #3 it is obviously just you.

The initiative, which has has been in the works for at least five years, was originally envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, CNBC reported , citing three people familiar with the matter. The aim is to develop sensors that can continuously monitor blood sugar levels without piercing the skin - something that is widely regarded as the "holy grail" for life sciences. Jobs envisioned a wearable device, like a smartwatch, being used to monitor blood glucose, but many life sciences companies have tried and failed to create such a device Diabetics normally have to pierce their skin to test their blood sugar (Photo: Getty) One of the sources told CNBC that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involve shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. If successful, the technology could turn the Apple Watch into a "must have" rather than a "nice to have" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar. CNBC said the engineers are working in a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, close to Apple's corporate headquarters. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The news comes at the time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring. Apple Watch Companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware, jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing bioelectronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves. US biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics have already shown early benefits of bioelectronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies playing around the idea of bioelectronics include Medtronic, Proteus Digital Technology, Sanofi SA and Biogen.

Yesterday AAPL: 141.05 -0.75 Apple rebrands iTunes Podcasts directory as Apple Podcasts, new badge for publishers to use Benjamin Mayo - Apr. 13th 2017 7:26 am PT @bzamayo Podcasting View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has today rebranded its iTunes Podcasts offering as ‘Apple Podcasts’, encapsulating the podcast directory and the client Podcasts app available on iPhone and iPad. Although today’s announcement is merely a branding change, it may indicate a renewed focus by Apple on podcasting. Full marketing guidelines for podcasters can be found here. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here In February, Eddy Cue teased that the company is working on new features for podcasts at the Code Media conference. Combined with this rebranding, it is possible that Apple is readying a big announcement for later this year, potentially at WWDC. Personally, I see iTunes as being the ‘legacy’ brand of Apple’s content offering — with all new stuff funnelled into new names with Apple prefixes. Named as ‘Apple Podcasts’, it clearly aligns the product in the same ballpark as Apple Music. This will immediately spark speculation that Apple could launch a podcast subscription service, mirroring their $9.99 Apple Music offering, to provide a platform for podcast monetization and premium shows. Whilst this would be an interesting direction for Apple to take, it is by no means a certainty. Apple could also add easy ways for publishers to make money from iOS listeners, almost like a Patreon service provided by Apple. This is of course all speculation but maybe Apple is also looking to break up iTunes on the Mac from the monster bloatware app it is today. This could include the release of a dedicated Apple Podcasts app for Mac to mirror its iOS clients. The new badge iconography includes a tweaked version of the Podcasts app icon, using darker shades of purple, potentially tipping the hat on a future update to the iOS icon. Podcasters interested in learning more about the new Apple branding should read the new marketing guidelines. It's official: iTunes Podcasts is now @ApplePodcasts. Podcasters, we've got a great new badge to help you promote your shows. 💜📻 pic.twitter.com/c9ZWVmSCsq — Steve Wilson (@StephenWilson) April 13, 2017 Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

 What Apple CEO Tim Cook sees as the 'holy grail' in health Kif Leswing Apr. 13, 2017, 10:49 AM 5,735 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple has a team of engineers working on a way to measure blood sugar, CNBC's Christina Farr reported on Thursday.  The 30-person strong team has been working on the problem for five years and is based in Palo Alto, according to CNBC, and reports to Johny Srouji, who is the senior vice president of hardware technologies at Apple. His specialty is designing chips and processors.  The report doesn't mention a product that will use these sensors, but it would make sense for the Apple Watch to measure a user's blood sugar levels. There have also been unverified rumors of a separate sensor-packed Apple medical gadget. This team may be separate from Apple's more public health project, which reports to Jeff Williams, Apple's COO. Apple's health team has lots of doctors and nurses and works on projects like HealthKit and ResearchKit, which are software for sharing health and medical data.  The team is working on a non-invasive blood sugar monitor that could read levels without drawing blood or piercing the skin. This technology would be a major breakthrough if it works, and it has major implications for the treatment of diabetes and even beyond if app developers were able to program for the sensor.  What Tim Cook says  The fact that Apple wants to make medical hardware should not be a surprise. Apple has been rumored to be working on a glucose sensor since before the Apple Watch was announced, and it's been hiring the biomedical engineers it would need to make it a reality.  Apple CEO Tim Cook has also spoken at length about Apple's medical plans, most notably at a conference in Amsterdam last year. Cook called health one of "society's biggest problems and challenges."  Apple's plan clearly revolves around hardware and sensors. Currently, all of Apple's health products are software, except for the heart rate monitor on the Apple Watch.  "I love the watch. One day, this is my prediction, we will look back and we will wonder: How can I ever have gone without the Watch? Because the holy grail of the Watch is being able to monitor more and more of what's going on in the body," Cook said.  "The things that interest us the most are things where we can bring our ability to integrate hardware, software, services into something that's magical, and enriches people in some way. If you look at some of the things that do not drive revenue, but have massive interest in them from our teams, health is very much one of those," he continued. The biggest obstacle  Verily's idea for a glucose-sensing contact lens.Google There are two big issues facing Apple: first, whether it can pull off a medical sensor breakthrough or if it's possible with current technology. Lots of companies have tried to build a non-invasive glucose sensor in the past, including Google cousin Verily, but none have succeeded.  The other big issue is that a device that could help people manage and treat conditions like diabetes would likely require some form of FDA approval. In 2015, Cook said that it was possible to imagine Apple putting a device through FDA approval in an interview with the Telegraph.  "We don’t want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process. I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it -- maybe an app, maybe something else," Cook said.  Apple mantains an open line of communication with the FDA. Apple officials have met with FDA officials several times over the past few years, and before the Apple Watch came out, they discussed what exactly would trigger FDA regulation of a device or app.  "[Apple COO] Jeff [Williams] has asked me to lead the thinking (or at least the conversation) on the intersection of the regulatory landscape (as it currently exists and where we hope we might be able to influence its movement) and our products and platforms,” an Apple lawyer wrote to the FDA in 2016, according to an email obtained by Mobi Health News.  SEE ALSO: Apple CEO Tim Cook reveals the Apple Watch's 'holy grail' More: Apple facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru What Apple CEO Tim Cook sees as the 'holy grail' in health What Apple CEO Tim Cook sees as the 'holy grail' in health Apple has a team of engineers working on a way...

Leaked design drawings reportedly show new Apple handset Schematic drawings claimed to come from Apple manufacturer Foxconn appear on Chinese social network. By Alistair Charlton April 13, 2017 15:51 BST Drawings of the new iPhone 8 have reportedly surfaced onlineiStock Apple's new iPhone is yet to break cover from the company's secret California design studio and test facilities, but that hasn't stopped the leakers, tipsters and rumour mills keeping themselves busy. So far, this has mostly resulted in analyst claims and fan-made renders. But now we might have our first glimpse at the real deal. Posted to Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, on 13 April, was a photograph which appears to show schematics drawings for an as-yet unreleased iPhone. Claiming to come from Foxconn, the Chinese company which produced goods for Apple, including the iPhone, the drawings show a handset with a much larger screen than on any current iPhone. The device has minimal bezels around the display, a rear camera with two lenses arranged vertically, and a home button located on the back, below the Apple logo. A set of measurements suggest the handset will be the same thickness as the iPhone 7 (7.1mm), but taller (149mm vs 138mm) and wider (72.5mm vs 67.1mm). The device shown here is described as EVT 03; 9to5Mac, the website which published the image, explains: "This is supposedly an image of design drawings for the iPhone 8's Engineering Validation test third revision. EVT is an early stage in the Apple product development cycle, the device must still pass through design Validation test and Production Validation Test stages to be finalised." Schematics reportedly from Apple manufacturer Foxconn claim to reveal the iPhone 8Weibo via 9to5Mac Rumours had until now claimed the new iPhone would feature a home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor embedded into the display, in a similar location to where the button is today on the iPhone 7. But claims Apple is struggling to produce such a system suggest the design you see here, with the home button on the back, is a backup solution if the situation can't be rectified in time. Apple traditionally announces the new iPhone in early to mid September and puts it on sale around 10 days later. Apple is expected to reveal three new iPhones this year. Two will act as updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (called the 7S and 7S Plus), while the third will feature the edge-to-edge screen seen in these drawings and have a higher price.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the team is part of a “super secret initiative” that was initially envisioned by Steve Jobs, and is located in a nondescript office several miles away from Apple’s corporate headquarters. Numerous life sciences companies have attempted to create such sensors with no success due to the challenges in accurately tracking blood glucose levels without piercing the skin, so the ability to do accomplish this would be a significant breakthrough. The project has reportedly reached the point that Apple has been running feasibility trials at several clinical sites in the Bay Area, and has also hired consultants to attempt to navigate the regulatory channels. Sources indicated that the efforts have been going on for at least five years, and it was the original vision of Jobs that wearable devices should be able to monitor important vitals. Apple acquired a company called Cor back in 2010 that was working on sensor technologies for health and wellness, along with its CEO Bob Messerschmidt, who became a team lead in the development of the Apple Watch. Early rumours also suggested that the Apple Watch would incorporate up to 10 sensors, including ones for blood glucose monitoring, and that Apple was waiting for FDA approval, but this was followed by a 2015 report which revealed that while Apple had intended to focus primarily on health and fitness, the company was forced to remove much of the functionality due to reliability problems and “unwanted regulatory oversight.” However, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested last year that Apple hasn’t entirely abandoned that vision for the future, which is likely where this new team comes in. The secretive team apparently reports to Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior VP of hardware technologies, and had about 30 people working in the group as of a year ago, but there’s speculation that the team has increased with Apple’s recent hires of about a dozen biomedical experts from various other companies. The team is apparently comprised of biomedical experts dedicated to the field of glucose monitoring along with engineers from the Apple Watch team. One source indicated that Apple is working to develop an optical sensor that would shine a light through the skin to measure glucose levels, however accurately detecting glucose levels without penetrating the skin has been an extremely elusive challenge that even top experts in the field have described as the most difficult they have ever encountered in their entire careers, and would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to succeed. Such a breakthrough would be huge, however, for the millions of people with diabetes, and could potentially turn the Apple Watch into an indispensable device.

Apple has emergency features built right into the Apple Watch, iPad and iPhone, and they can easily contact 911 or help you get out of trouble. We have a few tips that might help keep you alive, and they're particularly important as we head into the summer and start to spend more time outdoors hiking, heading to the beach and into the mountains. Here's how to prepare your iOS devices for emergency. SHARES Todd Haselton | @robotodd 16 Hours Ago SOS Apple Watch If you own an Apple Watch, there's an SOS feature you need to know about. It's kind of like the modern "I've fallen and I can't get up" alert that you can send out. So long as your iPhone is nearby (it needs to place the call) you can press and hold the side button on the watch until a menu pops up. The bottom option is "Emergency SOS." Slide it and you'll call emergency services. Or, if you can't slide it, continue holding down the side button and it'll call for you. Emergency responders will get your current location and your iPhone will automatically reach out to SOS contacts stored in Medical ID, a section of the built-in iPhone Health app. Todd Haselton | CNBC Medical ID inside Health app on iPhone If you don't know what Medical ID is, it's time to learn. First, open the Health app on your iPhone. Next, tap "Medical ID" on the bottom right. You'll be able to fill out medical conditions, add notes about allergies and reactions and enter in emergency contacts like your significant other or parents. There's even a section where you can say whether or not you're an organ donor. More importantly, you should know to look for this in case you ever see someone in distress. Grab their iPhone, swipe on the home screen, tap emergency, and you'll see what sort of information is in their Medical ID. Apple Use Siri to call 911 Finally, Siri can help you call 911 -- all you need to do is say "Hey Siri, call 911" And since Siri doesn't need you to touch the phone at all, this could be particularly useful if you've fallen, or cut yourself and aren't able to pick up the phone. Siri will begin a countdown before dialing your local 911 center, so you have some time to think about the situation, or bail in case it was a false alarm. If the situation is really dire, just tap "call," for a quicker connection. Todd Haselton | CNBC more from Tech Guide

Driver release 378.05.05.05 is now available for macOS Sierra. Despite the Pascal support, the driver release is somewhat of an odd duck, as driver updates tend to focus on updates for new hardware and performance improvements for newly-released software. However, since Nvidia cards haven't been inside Apple products for several years, all the hardware listed in the release notes is at least four years old. The driver updates are for Nvidia-equipped Mac Pro systems from 2010, 2009, and 2008. Additionally, Nvidia is offering beta support for select iMacs and MacBook Pro systems from 2013 and 2012. Nvidia also doesn't call out Pascal graphics cards explicitly in the supported hardware list. Instead, the supported products page contains a brief list of the hardware originally sold in the Apple systems several years ago. The list is headlined by the venerable GeForce GTX 680 and Quadro K5000. Regardless, some Reddit users are reporting success with using this drivers with graphics cards like the recently-released Titan Xp, so it is the promised Pascal update. Users with the right combination of Apple and Nvidia hardware can click over to Nvidia's site to download the driver release. There's a separate driver for those interested in making use of Nvidia's CUDA architecture. The rest of us might well wonder what's next for Nvidia and Apple. It's not unthinkable that the upcoming refresh of the Mac Pro might be equipped with an Nvidia graphics card. Tags: Graphics Mac Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Wall Street Revives Rumor of Mega-Deal Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor @xpangler Share This Article LinkedIn Email Print Talk Aflo/REX/Shutterstock April 13, 2017 | 07:00AM PT Apple could potentially find the cash to pull off a $200 billion-plus takeover of Disney — creating a company worth $1 trillion with “almost limitless opportunities in content and technology.” That’s according to a speculative analysis from RBC Capital Markets, which in a note to client Thursday said such a colossal tie-up would be contingent on Apple getting tax breaks to “repatriate” overseas cash. “Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney,” RBC analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in the note. A combined Apple-Disney would create an instant competitor to Netflix that would take advantage of the Mouse House’s content and Apple’s user base, the anlaysts speculated. Other benefits: integrating Apple consumer tech as experiences in Disney’s theme parks; and landing global streaming sports rights for ESPN via the combo of Disney-backed BAMTech and Apple distribution and a strong balance sheet. “Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand,” RBC’s Cahall and Kulp wrote. The M&A rumor mill got new grist last fall, when Apple chief Tim Cook (pictured above) told analysts that the tech giant was “open to acquisitions of any size.” In addition, Apple execs met with Time Warner honchos in late 2015 in a discussion that raised the possibility of a merger — before AT&T moved on its $85 billion bid for Time Warner. Related Rumor Patrol: Would Disney Acquiring Netflix Even Make Sense? The Apple-Disney M&A chatter comes as analysts in the last few months have debated the possibility that Disney would make a move to buy Netflix — a highly leveraged transaction that some view as needlessly risky. But would Apple shareholders support such a bet-the-company move? Assuming a 40% premium for Disney, the deal would carry a hefty $237 billion price tag. If Apple investors balk, Disney could consider spinning off assets like ESPN and theme parks to make the deal more palatable. Another caveat: Apple would need U.S. regulators to give it a “tax holiday” to repatriate offshore cash to fund an acquisition of Disney. Assuming Apple could obtain a 9% tax rate, it would effectively have access to cash of $223 billion, RBC noted. “Even though investors might expect higher cash returns in form of buybacks/dividends, strategic uses are likely to take precedence,” the analysts wrote. Per RBC, the merger of Apple and Disney would be highly accretive to earnings, to the tune of 15%-20% increase in earnings per share based on the presumed 40% premium deal price and Disney’s low debt load. “We like Disney’s fundamentals. Assuming Apple sees the same thing and has the cash, investor anticipation of a prospective transaction only adds conviction to the momentum we see in Disney’s shares,” Cahall and Kulp wrote.

Reply Report comment The Truth says: April 13, 2017 at 2:15 pm Some critics slam Iger-era Disney as being creatively bankrupt for re-making old animated hits in live action and Cook-era Apple for timidly refining Jobs-era innovations rather than developing anything new. Yet both companies are enormously successful industry leaders, and whoever the critics are and whatever they say is totally inconsequential. If Apple buys Disney, investors will be laughing at these irrelevant detractors all the way to the bank.

Reply Report comment Baron Munchausen says: April 13, 2017 at 10:55 am If you want the creativity and the imagination to stop, of course! Reply Report comment Daniel Quintanilla says: April 13, 2017 at 4:26 pm But if Apple buys Disney, then the barriers of Disney just creating family-friendly content for ABC, and family-friendly limitations on ESPN would end, and that would be the most healthiest thing for both networks. Then again, Disney could spin off ABC too along with ESPN and theme parks so investors are guaranteed the best palatable situation you can be in. Of course, Apple has trillions of dollars in cash, no matter where Apple accesses it, to make this Disney buyout happen.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) created a secret team that is tasked with treating diabetes. CNBC, citing "people familiar with the matter," reported that Steve Jobs himself envisioned the project prior to his death. Today, the "super secret" initiative appears to be in full motion at a nondescript office miles away from Apple's headquarters. Apple reportedly tasked biomedical engineers to develop sensors that can monitor a person's blood sugar levels. The company is hoping to create a non-invasive sensor, a difficult task to say the least as it is challenging to accurately track glucose levels without piercing a person's skin. Apple may be developing optical sensors, which shine a light through a person's skins to measure indications of glucose. Apple's project reportedly dates back at least five years and was part of Jobs' vision of developing wearable devices that can monitor oxygen levels, heart rate, blood glucose levels and other important vitals. Apple Is Making Progress The CNBC report further noted that Apple is actually conducting feasibility trials at various clinical sites. The company reportedly also hired consultants and experts to give management a better understanding of the regulatory pathways. Apple has also been active in poaching biomedical experts from companies like Medtronic, Vital Connect and others. Some of these experts were working as part of the secret team while others are working at Apple's office as part of the Watch time.

TheStreet Staff Apr 13, 2017 10:12 AM EDT RBC Capital Markets believes a merger between Apple (AAPL) and the Walt Disney Co.  (DIS) would make strategic sense for the iPhone maker. Disney's exposure in Apple's portfolio would give the company more exposure to media and entertainment content. Analysts say the odds of the merger taking place is low. If the deal were to take place RBC sees Apple paying a 40% premium to Disney's price. The company is valued at about $157 per share, implying an equity value of $237 billion.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows a user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published Monday by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Dr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Phone makers have acknowledged that fingerprint sensors are not foolproof, but said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant that more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Dr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. “Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,” he said. For a thief or spy to turn master fingerprints into smartphone keys would require a lot of additional work. “In order to launch this attack, you still have to make fake fingers,” Dr. Ross said. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Dr. Boehnen said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” The New York Times Vindu Goel More Posts Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related AppleGooglesmartphones Previous ArticleSuspects in Kim Jong Nam Killing Appear in Malaysia Court HearingNext Article10 Talking Points from the Weekend’s Upcoming Premier League Games What’s Trending Amaq – 24/7 News Agency Run by ISIS 39098 Saudi Sources: the Ultimate Solution in Yemen will Put an End to the Militias 28806 Crown Prince Patronizes Deluge 6 Exercise 24913 Air Strikes Target al Qaeda in Yemen, Troops Capture Aden District 23408 10,000 More Syrian Refugees to Be Taken in by Canada 22947 Join our social media 264kFans 126kFollowers 252Followers Subscribe to News Asharq Al-awsat Newsletter Email address PRINT SUBSCRIPTIONS DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISING TERMS & CONDITIONS PRIVACY STATEMENT ABOUT US SUBMISSIONS © Copyright 2016 Asharq Al Awsat - Sub Division of SRPC - Site Last updated April 14, 2017 8:01 am Middle East Opinion Saudi Arabia Features World Lifestyle This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Yesterday AAPL: 141.05 -0.75 Comment: Could Apple be left with no choice but to do the wrong thing with the iPhone 8? Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 13th 2017 6:32 am PT @benlovejoy Feature Opinion iPhone 8 Touch ID View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The last time a sketchy report suggested that Apple was planning to move the Touch ID sensor to the rear of the iPhone 8, I wrote an opinion piece saying that I didn’t believe Apple was dumb enough to do it. I set out the four reasons I didn’t expect it to happen. Alongside multiple reports of a Touch ID sensor embedded in the screen, and supporting patents for the required technology, I felt there were two reasons in particular to doubt the idea … NordVPN Apple is the ultimate PR machine. If there were persistent rumors about its flagship iPhone model introducing an exciting technological development, and the reality was instead a boring, low-tech approach used by pretty much every Android brand out there, it would want to dispel those rumors to avoid disappointment. It would be quietly tipping-off the usual suspects so that expectations are controlled. There’s been no sign of it doing so. Finally, a rear fingerprint reader is a terrible usability experience. You have to pick up the phone to activate it. You have to grip your phone awkwardly. You have to feel around for the sensor, to put your finger in the right place. It’s awkward to use with multiple fingers. And cases need ugly holes in them to allow access – which completely eliminates some case designs, like ones with card slots in the rear. But there have been a couple of reports this week that suggest Apple might have no choice but to opt for the rear-mounted position. The first was an analyst with at least some degree of credibility that said Apple was hitting yield issues with its preferred in-screen fingerprint reader. Cowen and Company’s Timothy Arcuri is claiming that yields of a new fingerprint sensor that would be integrated into the iPhone 8 screen are low and that Apple may consider other less-exciting designs if the production problems cannot be solved. The second, earlier today, claims to show actual schematics of a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor for the iPhone 8. If genuine, one possibility raised by that report is that this is a fallback design in response to the possibility that yield rates on the in-screen solution prove too low. That ‘if genuine’ disclaimer is important, of course. While the schematic does have the right kind of look, and this would be about the time we’d expect these to leak for a slightly-delayed iPhone launch, this is some random Weibo post, so there’s no way to assess the source. There’s also one reason that leads us to doubt the validity of the images: the position of the sensor. The usability problems I raised last time would be even worse with the Touch ID sensor mounted halfway up the phone rather than where the Apple logo is, which is a more natural position for your index finger. Perhaps, as one of our readers suggests, make it part of the logo. Positioning it so low down seems too much of a schoolboy error for Apple to make. But the earlier report is at least plausible, and perhaps this is merely one of a number of fallback designs the company has considered. While I stand by all the arguments I made before, there is one simple counterargument: perhaps Apple simply has no choice? Despite all the company’s patents, a fingerprint reader embedded into a display is bleeding-edge technology. The idea that it would hit production snags is a perfectly credible one. And while I personally think that even a near-bezel-free design wouldn’t justify such a poor usability experience, I can see how – in Apple’s position – I might feel that I had no choice. First, because it is so far down the redesign road now that making fundamental changes wouldn’t be practical. But, more importantly, because it has to provide that near-bezel-free look. It’s what everyone is expecting, so anything less would be a disappointment. Its biggest competitor, Samsung, has just done it in a much-admired new phone. And, as The Verge noted, even no-name Chinese brands are doing it now. So there’s no doubt that Apple is committed to the bezel-free design. And it’s perfectly possible that the in-screen tech simply isn’t proving practical. In which case Apple may be forced to do the wrong thing, opting for a terrible UI with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.

The initiative was reportedly initially envisioned by Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs before his death. According to CNBC, this team is working from a nondescript office in Palo Alto, miles from Apple’s corporate headquarters, reporting directly to Johny Srouji, Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies who joined Apple back in 2008. Three people familiar with the matter said that the “super secret initiative” might eventually result in advanced sensors that could non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. The company is reportedly focused on optical sensors that shine a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. The Cupertino company is said to have been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area. It’s also hired consultants to deal with regulatory approvals, indicating that these sensors might be implemented in a future Apple Watch. RELATED: The best iPhone apps for diabetics “Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose,” reads the article. These efforts have been going on for at least five years, said the source. Another one added that the group comprised about 30 people as of a year ago. Back in 2010, Apple quietly acquired a company called Cor and its then-CEO Bob Messerschmidt joined the Apple Watch team shortly after. Thus far, the iPhone maker has hired about a dozen biomedical experts from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo Corp, Sano, Medtronic and C8 Medisensors. The secret group was previously led by Michael D. Hillman, but Apple’s hardware chief Johny Srouji took over leadership following Hillman’s departure in late 2015.

Reportedly Struggling With New Touch ID Tech Cutting-edge innovation is tough to bring into mass production. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 13, 2017 at 8:30AM Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch three iPhone models. The first two -- widely referred to as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- are expected to be straightforward successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7, sporting improved performance and additional features in a design that's largely the same as their predecessors. The third model, though, is purportedly a premium model with all the technical bells and whistles thrown in. Among the rumored features are 3D sensing, a gently curved full-face display, and a fingerprint sensor built directly into the display. Image source: Apple. According to a report from Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri (via MacRumors), Apple is facing serious difficulties in integrating the fingerprint sensor into the display. Low yield rate The report, MacRumors says, claims that manufacturing yields of Apple's under-the-glass fingerprint sensor is "low" and that the company "seems unwilling to use an outside solution at this time." What a low yield rate means is that of all the sensors produced (or perhaps, devices with sensors integrated) in each batch, a small percentage of them function properly. This can lead to increased product manufacturing costs (since so many potential sensors need to be tossed out) as well as supply problems (as manufacturing capacity is not infinite). If Apple can't work those yield issues out in time, Apple will have three options, per Arcuri: ditch the Touch ID functionality altogether, move the Touch ID sensor to the back of the phone, or delay production of the premium iPhone until yield rates are satisfactory. What should Apple do? Arcuri reportedly said that removing Touch ID is "unlikely" due to security concerns and that such a removal would, in MacRumors' words, "potentially create issues with Apple Pay." I completely agree. Arcuri also reportedly says that moving the Touch ID sensor to the back of the phone would (again, using MacRumors' words), "not be a user-friendly or optimal solution to say the least." Again, I totally agree. The final option that Arcuri brings up is simply delaying the production of the phone. Although a production delay would be a bummer, especially given that this new phone sounds really exciting and customers are probably going to want to get it as soon as possible, this is likely to be the best option. Remember, Apple's job needs to be to build the most interesting, compelling products as possible to get people with older iPhone models to upgrade and to entice users of Android phones to convert over to iPhone rather than choose from the (arguably) quite feature-rich Android competitors in the market. If Apple has to delay commercial availability of a much nicer, more feature-rich device for a month or even two, then that's what it ought to do. Apple will still be able to take pre-orders for the devices, and it'll still have the new iPhone 7s/7s Plus to sell to the masses while it ramps up supply of the premium OLED iPhone 8 model. De-featuring the premium OLED iPhone to try to hit September availability is the wrong way to go, and as a potential Apple customer who is very excited for this new device (and I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who are just as excited about this device, if not more so, out there), I'd rather Apple take a little bit more time and release something incredible.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Mac vs PC: Which should you buy? If you're considering buying a new PC then one of the biggest choices is whether to invest in a Windows or macOS machine. In this feature, we take a look at the advantages and drawbacks of both. It's the age-old debate: Mac vs PC, but which one is the best for you? By Martyn Casserly | 13 Apr 17 It’s a battle that has raged across time and space. Two sides with sworn armies of loyalists, locked eternally in a struggle for dominance. We’ve seen it played out so many times: Android vs iOS, Xbox vs PlayStation, Canon vs Nikon, FIFA vs Pro Evo, ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64, but today we look not upon those minor conflicts. Instead, our eyes turn to the thunderous colossuses of Mac vs PC. Which is the better platform? Is there even a true winner? Some of these questions cannot be answered, but in this feature we will put the two platforms to the test so you can see which one is the best for you. You might also like Android vs iOS: Which is best? Hardware design This category might seem like a sure-thing for Apple, as its hardware is highly regarded across the industry, but things aren’t quite that simple. When Apple’s design guru Jony Ive first designed the iMac back in 1998, it came as a colourful and stylish alternative to the beige boxes that PCs favoured at the time. Since then there have been innovative designs such as the MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the various iterations of the original iMac - including an utterly beautiful angle-poise lamp style that remains one of the most gorgeous computers ever built. The current lineup though, leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, they are still powerful, fast machines, but the aluminum unibody designs that once looked so modern (and launched a thousand PC clones) haven’t seen an update in a number of years and now look, well, rather dull. Of course the ultra-slim MacBook does buck this trend somewhat - coming in a range of colours that include Gold and Rose Gold, or pink as most people would call it - but the lack of ports and a low profile keyboard that severely divides opinion among users means it’s something of an acquired taste. There are rumours of Apple updating the Mac range before the end of the year, so things could improve quickly if the California company introduces new models. By contrast, PCs are going through something of a renaissance at the moment. After the wild and wacky devices that accompanied the release of Windows 8, manufacturers have settled down and begun releasing some excellent machines. At the premium end of the market, where Apple also plies its trade, Microsoft has developed the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book both of which are hugely desirable creations. HP, who almost left PC manufacturing entirely a few years ago, has stunned the market with its svelte, luxurious Spectre 13, while Lenovo, Sony, Dell, and others all have high-end models that give MacBooks a run for their money. One of the best things about Windows devices at the moment is that they offer such variety to users. You can have traditional laptops and desktops (with the option of a touchscreen if you want), dedicated gaming rigs, ultra-thin models, or a device that converts between a tablet and PC. There’s even a Windows phone that can turn into a full blown Windows PC when you plug it into peripherals. Of course the platform has always had devices available at a range of price points too and this is still the case. In fact HP’s Stream laptop is currently available for £189 and offers a very respectable entry point for those who need a cheap and cheerful device. Yes, the Apple lineup is high quality, but Windows also offers that now, and much more besides. Bundled software While Apple’s shield may still be ringing from the surprising blows it took in hardware, this round finds it unleashing a few attacks of its own. There’s little argument really that when you take a Mac out of its box there is far more useful software onboard than on even the most premium Windows laptop. No bloatware or trial software is to be found, instead Apple includes apps for basic photo editing, video production, audio production, plus the full office suite of Pages, Number, and Keynote. All are full versions that offer an impressive amount of capability for any new user. On the Windows side of things it isn’t quite so rosy. There is a photo app, but it’s more for organisation than editing, and depending on where you bought your PC you might have a free year’s subscription to Office 365, but beyond that it’s a pretty barren landscape. Of course when you move out to third party software Windows has an enormous amount of apps to buy, far exceeding that of Macs, but the truth is that Macs come equipped with nearly everything you need for normal, consumer-level computing. Read next: Windows 7 vs Windows 10 Gaming Gaming has long been the province of PCs and with the arrival of Windows 10 the platform has only strengthened its dominance. Aside from an embarrassingly huge advantage over Macs in terms of available titles, PCs now have the ability to stream games from both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (Mac supports PS4 only at the time of writing). This category isn’t even close. If you like gaming then a Windows PC is hands-down the better choice over a Mac. See: Best free PC games of 2017 and Best Gaming PC 2017 User interface Here’s where it gets interesting. For years OS X and Windows have fought over the same ground, that of a standard desktop based environment. But since Windows 8 Microsoft has been taking its platform into new realms, incorporating touch and speech as significant factors. Cortana is now a resident feature on Windows 10, enabling users to create reminders, schedule appointments, conduct searches, and a range of other functions all through voice commands. See: How to use Cortana in Windows 10 Apple wasn't far behind though, as macOS Sierra features Apple's virtual assistant Siri, and offers similar features to that of Cortana. Where the two environments diverge the most is when it comes to touch. Windows has fully embraced the idea of tapping the screen, while Mac users have a wide range of multi-touch trackpad gestures available. True, Windows also shares some of these, but the implementation on Macs - especially those with force-touch trackpads - remains the superior trackpad experience. While Apple has staunchly avoided introducing a touch interface on macOS, it’s introduction on Windows has led to the creation of several interesting hybrid devices (2-in-1s that can act as laptops or tablets) with the Surface Pro 4 being the best example. This opens up things such as the use of a stylus to highlight or annotate web-pages on Microsoft’s Edge browser, writing and drawing freehand in OneNote, plus general navigation through websites, applications, and the operating system itself.  Both platforms are exploring new ways to create, interact and manipulate data, which means that there is no clear winner here, except for users who now have a fascinating amount of choice. Security This is usually the biggest stick that Mac users wield against their Windows counterparts, and it’s a fair point. Statistically there is far more chance of contracting a virus or malware when you use a PC. This is mainly due to the fact that Macs make up such a small percentage of computers worldwide, so it’s not worth hackers targeting them. But this could be changing. 2016 saw the emergence of the Keyranger ransomware that attacked OS X and encrypted all files on a hard drive until users paid an extortion fee. Yes this pales in comparison to the likes of Cryptolocker, but it’s an indication that Macs are beginning to appear on the hacking radar. Then there's the fact that many attacks these days use social engineering or fear mongering to fool users into giving away their account details, rather than installing viruses to cause havoc. It’s still hard to argue that Macs are not more secure than Windows machines, but complacency could mean that the users themselves might be equally vulnerable.   Value for money When it comes to any buying decision, one of the most important factors is value for money. On the Windows side there are a wealth of devices that start, as mentioned above, with the likes of the HP Stream (£189) and move up through various price points until you reach the premium strata of Microsoft’s SurfaceBook which starts at £1299. This means that there is a Windows machine for everybody, no matter the budget. Macs on the other hand start at £479 following a post-Brexit price hike, and this is for the Mac Mini which doesn’t have a keyboard, mouse, or display included. It’s no powerhouse either, with disappointing specs and slow performance, plus it hasn’t been updated since 2014. On the laptop side of things the cheapest MacBook is the 11-inch MacBook Air which will set you back £749. At the moment this doesn’t seem to offer great value for money either, mainly due to it featuring a small screen with a lacklustre 1366x768 screen resolution which feels far from premium these days. Moving up, the 13-inch MacBook Pro (£1249) beefs up the screen to a retina model and has internals more befitting of high-end device, and includes a new Touch Bar if you pay an extra £200. If you’re willing to buy at the Pro level then Apple’s current products do offer excellent performance, build quality, and support, but dipping below that seems to offer less value and more compromises than those prices justify. Which one should you buy? As you may have surmised from our look at these two platforms there is no clear winner, and that’s good. After all, computers occupy such central parts of our lives these days, and our needs all differ wildly, so there will never be a one size fits all solution (no matter what Jony Ive says about Apple’s EarPods).  What is clear is the amount of choice now available for consumers. Windows devices have so much variation in design and capability, while Apple continues to refine its lineup, and the rumoured iMac refresh could see the company finally introduce new designs. In the end it’s down to how much money you want to spend, what you want to do, and your preferred software platform. The good thing is that the market has matured to a point where it’s actually hard to buy a bad device now. A solid rule of thumb is to save up and spend the most you can afford, as the higher end devices really are on another level at the moment, but the budget market for Windows machines is also in fine fettle. Simply put, you’ve never had it so good. Read next: Nintendo Switch vs Xbox One Tags: Desktop PCs, Apple, Laptops, Windows Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Aside from the power of accessing apps right from your wrist, it also can track your health, and see how your heart is doing. With that in mind, it seems that Apple is exerting more effort towards using technology to better monitor your well-being. According to a report by CNBC, Apple has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to work in an office in Palo Alto to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. The Cupertino company has also reportedly been conducting feasibility trials at clinical stores across the San Francisco Bay Area, and has hired consultants to figure out regulatory pathways. This "super secret initiative" was initially envisioned by the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, and the effort has been going on for at least five years, say the sources close to CNBC. Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important body vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood glucose. Sources also state that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involve shining light through the skin to measure levels of glucose. In turn, this could help improve diagnosis of patients, as well as more accurate treatment for them. Should the initiative become a total breakthrough, it could make devices like the Apple Watch a must-have product, especially for people who suffer from diabetes, instead of making it simply an accessory that complements our smartphones and fashion sense. Apple , however, has not publicly commented regarding the report. The Apple Watch is already being used towards improving the health of people around the world. In London, England, a hospital was found to be using the Apple wearable to remind chemotherapy patients in taking their medication. Also, the watch's heart rate monitor was able to help save a man's life in California, with the device's findings matching up to a doctor's test.

Britta O'Boyle13 April 2017Phones Samsung / Apple Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus were announced at the end of March, bringing two new fabulous flagships to the smartphone party. How do they compare to their competition though? We've put them up against the LG G6, the Pixels and the iPhone 7 in previous features but here we are looking at how the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus compare to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Design All offer premium, beautiful designs All waterproof to some degree iPhone 7 Plus slimmer, but heavier and wider than both S8 and S8 Plus The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus share the same beautiful design with an almost all-screen front, very slim bezels, a solid, premium metal build and a glass rear. Unlike previous Samsung devices, the home button is built into the display rather than a physical button beneath the display and the fingerprint sensor has been repositioned to the rear of both devices, next to the camera lens. The S8 measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm and weighs 155g, while the S8 Plus is the slightly larger and heavier of the two at 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm and 173g. Both are IP68 dust and water resistant and they both feature lovely curved edges and a dedicated button on their left for launching the Bixby personal assistant.  The Apple iPhone 7 Plus also features a lovely design, though a little safer and more traditional than Samsung's two latest. Apple opts for an all-aluminium slim build with curved edges, rounded corners and a the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Home button on the front, beneath the display. There is a dual-rear camera setup on the rear in the top left corner, making for a little more subtlety than the S8 and S8 Plus array. Offering a water and dust resistant rating of IP67, the iPhone 7 Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm and weighs 188g. This means it is slimmer than both Samsung models, but it is also quite a bit wider and heavier than both and only slightly shorter in body than the S8 Plus, despite the Samsung models both offering larger displays. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Display S8 Plus has largest display, iPhone 7 Plus has smallest S8 has sharpest display in terms of pixel density at 570ppi S8 and S8 Plus have Mobile HDR, iPhone 7 Plus has 3D Touch The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED Infinity display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus has a slightly larger 6.2-inch Super AMOLED Infinity display, meaning both have a dual-edged screen that pumps out rich and vibrant colours. Both take on a 18.5:9 ratio compared to the standard 16:9, allowing them gain the extra inches diagonally without needing the width, hence why they are narrower than the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of measurements. The S8 and S8 Plus both opt for a Quad HD+ resolution, which translates to 2960 x 1440 pixels for pixel densities of 570ppi and 529ppi respectively, resulting in super sharp and crisp detail. Samsung also adds Mobile HDR Premium to the S8 and S8 Plus, meaning the two new flagships are compatible for viewing HDR content from the likes of Netflix and Amazon Video. Meanwhile, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display, which means an LED-backlit IPS LCD screen with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. The lower resolution means the iPhone 7 Plus has a lower pixel density at 401ppi, though we have never had any complaints with the iPhone's display during our experience with it so it isn't always about the numbers.  It is a flat display, though it has 2.5D glass covering it meaning the display joins to the edges of the iPhone's build seamlessly. The iPhone 7 Plus also has 3D Touch, which is Apple's version of a pressure-sensitive display, allowing for extra features and functions based on the force with which you press. There is no Mobile HDR though and no Always-On display for any notifications at a glance without turning the full display on, something the S8 and S8 Plus do both offer. Mobile HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Mobile HDR Premium explained Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Camera Dual-camera setup on the iPhone 7 Plus with optical zoom Wider aperture on S8 and S8 Plus for both cameras Higher resolution front camera on S8 and S8 Plus When it comes to smartphone cameras, the number of megapixels doesn't directly translate to how good the results are so that's always worth bearing in mind if you're buying a new device with the camera as your top priority. A lot comes down to processing and both Samsung and Apple smash it out of the park, delivering excellent image results across their latest handsets. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus therefore have high expectations on their heads, though we would expect them to be met. There is a 12-megapixel Duo Pixel sensor on the rear of both devices, with an f/1.7 aperture, phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilisation. The S8 and S8 Plus offer up to eight times digital zoom. On the front, you'll find an 8-megapixel sensor, also with an f/1.7 aperture, along with autofocus over fixed focus and iris scanning capabilities. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has already proved it can deliver in terms of camera, featuring two 12-megapixel sensors on the back, one wide-angle with a f/1.8 aperture and the other telephoto with an aperture of f/2.8. It too offers optical image stabilisation and it can provide two times optical zoom and up to 10 times digital. In terms of the front, there is a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera with an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash but no iris scanner. The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus are all capable of up to 4K video recording from their rear cameras, and up to 1080p from their front-facing snappers. Apple iPhone 7 Plus review  Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Hardware Powerful hardware on both, more RAM on S8 and S8 Plus iPhone 7 Plus and S8 Plus promise similar battery performance microSD and 3.5mm headphone jack on S8 and S8 Plus The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus both come with the Exynos 8895 chip or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, depending on region, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is microSD support for storage expansion up to 256GB. The S8 has a battery capacity of 3000mAh, while the S8 Plus has a capacity of 3500mAh, both of which are charged via USB Type-C and both of which support fast charging and wireless charging. According to Samsung, the S8 will offer up to 20 hours talk time or 14 hours Wi-Fi browsing, while the S8 Plus will offer up to 24 hours talk time or up to 15 hours Wi-Fi browsing. You'll also find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the S8 and S8 Plus, allowing the AKG in-ear headphones bundled in the boxes to be plugged straight in. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus runs on the A10 chip, with an embedded M10 motion compressor. There is 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB, 128GB or 256GB storage, none of which offer microSD for storage expansion. Apple claims the iPhone 7 Plus will offer up to 21 hours talk time or up to 15 hours Wi-Fi browsing, putting it in line with the S8 Plus. Charging takes place via Lightning, as does everything else including headphone connection as there is no 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple does however provide a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack adapter in the box so you'll still be able to use your old headphones as long as you don't lose the tiny adapter.  Samsung Galaxy S8 preview  Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Software S8 and S8 Plus run on Android with TouchWiz iPhone 7 Plus runs on iOS with quicker updates Both have personal assistants The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus run on Android Nougat with Samsung's TouchWiz user interface over the top, while the Apple iPhone 7 Plus runs on iOS 10. Different platforms and different experiences, but both are excellent. Many of the same features are offered across both platforms, but things are packaged in a slightly different way, such as access to settings. Apple is better at updating devices with its latest software builds almost as soon as they are released, while Samsung users tend to wait a little longer following a new Android build so that's worth bearing in mind if you like the latest features quickly. Which you will prefer will come down to personal preference, as well as whether you have other Apple devices or you use Google services, but as we said, both platforms are great. You can read our iOS 10 tips and tricks and our S7 tips and tricks to get a better idea of what both platforms will allow you to do. In terms of personal assistants, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will eventually come with Bixby, Samsung's new AI system, and Google Assistant, while Apple has the famous Siri. What is Bixby? Samsung's smart AI explained Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Price S8 and S8 Plus come in five colours, iPhone 7 Plus in six iPhone 7 Plus starting price cheaper but less storage in base model The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus costs £779 and it will be available in five colours, though not all will come to each country. The colours comprise Midnight Black, Orchid Grey, Coral Blue, Arctic Silver and Maple Gold. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus starts at £719, increasing to £919 for the highest storage capacity. It is available in six colours including Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and the special edition (PRODUCT) Red. The Jet Black and (PRODUCT) Red colours only come in 128GB or 256GB storage options though, meaning they start from £819. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Which should you choose? The million dollar question: Do you pick Samsung or do you go with Apple? Ultimately the answer will come down to which design you prefer and which platform suits you better. The Samsung devices are all about their displays, offering big screens in a relatively small body, while the iPhone 7 Plus is a slightly bigger device overall, but the front has more than just a screen and even if this doesn't follow the latest trend, its design will be preferable to some. All three devices aren't likely to disappoint though, no matter which you choose. They all offer, or have the potential to offer in Samsung's case, good performance, great cameras, lovely designs and excellent hardware. We were big fans of the iPhone 7 Plus and while we have yet to review the S8 and S8 Plus, we are expecting great things based on our first impressions.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER Search for: Apple iPad (2017) review (US$350) It might look like more of the same – from 2013, no less – but this iPad gets the power-to-price ratio just right 13 April 2017 by Stuff Staff The new iPad is now just plain old ‘iPad’. But in contrast to the revolutionary original, this latest Apple tablet looks like a regression – half-way between its two Air-branded predecessors. It might be easy to give this latest iteration a cursory glance and conclude it doesn’t do anything new, but take one look at the price and you’ll change your tune. 340 quid for this iPad suggests that Apple is shooting for the masses. Spend a few days using one alongside either iPad Air incarnation, and it’s entirely appropriate to wheel out two overused cliches: ‘beauty is only skin deep’, and there’s ’power under the hood’. DESIGN: DOWN TO EARTH From a design standpoint, though, this iPad offers no real surprises, bar Apple’s obsession with thinness apparently coming to a screeching, juddering halt. If you’d been expecting the new iPad to be so thin it might give you a nasty paper cut, prepare for disappointment. It’s 1.4mm thicker than the Air 2 and about 30g heavier, too. In other words, just like the original iPad Air. And honestly? Good. I’ve long been sick of devices getting thinner over and above practical considerations. This apparent compromise seems like the right choice. The tiny extra heft to this iPad doesn’t make it feel worse in use. If you can tell the difference when one tablet is the equivalent of a packet of crisps heavier than another, congratulations – you never need buy weighing scales again. The extra thickness does feel very slightly worse in the hand if you’re holding an iPad Air 2 or iPad Pro at the same time, but if you’re doing that regularly, it might be time to seek help. It’s a smart trade-off for a flush camera and bigger battery. Said battery does – marginally – outperform the iPad Air 2’s, whether you’re looping videos like a tech writer for Stuff, or doing sensible things like playing games and faffing about on Facebook. DISPLAY: ON REFLECTION A bigger concern with this latest iPad is the display. In many ways, it’s excellent. As anyone who’s used a Retina iPad before will attest, Apple does screens well. The 9.7in display used here is almost eye-searingly bright at maximum settings – more so than any iPad but the Pro. It’s clear, and with an identical resolution to previous iPads. In other words, content is pin-sharp, unless your nose is wedged against the glass. But presumably in an attempt to save costs, the new iPad’s LCD panel isn’t fused to the glass, and it lacks an anti-reflective coating. The first of those things supposedly results in lower contrast and less vibrant colours. But there’s little appreciable difference when using it alongside an iPad Air 2. You do get a noticeably hollow ‘thunk’ when tapping the display, though, and the newer iPad is much more of a fingerprint magnet than its predecessor. The anti-reflective coating is the bigger problem, reverting the tablet to being a mirror as soon as there’s even a hint of bright light nearby. To be fair, it’s not like the iPad Air 2 was perfect in this regard – no tablet that’s essentially a slab of glass can be – but this feels like a cost-saving too far, and I found this hard to get past when switching over from the older model. PERFORMANCE: RAW POWER Fortunately, things step up significantly when you hurl apps and games at the new iPad. In pure benchmarking terms, this new tablet meaningfully outperforms the iPad Air, at worst edges ahead of the iPad Air 2, and is no slouch compared even with the iPad Pro. Real-world testing has more subjectivity, but this was the area in which my disappointment with the display started to fade. So much for it being a ‘budget’ iPad. Feeding my Korg Gadget addiction, I fired up the app, and created a loop with several iterations of the notoriously processor-hungry Lexington gadget. The iPad didn’t bat an eyelid. On duly flinging the track across to an iPad Air 2, the older tablet choked horribly until some tracks were frozen. This pattern continued elsewhere. Games would at worst play identically to on the iPad Air 2, or sometimes a touch more smoothly. In Split View, there were no wobbles. The combination of the A9 first seen in the iPhone 6s and 2GB of RAM seems perfectly suited to current App Store goodies. And it also bodes well for Apple’s future plans – this isn’t another iPad 3-style compromise. FEATURES: JACK IT IN Elsewhere, the iPad essentially offers the same ports, connectivity and camera as found in the iPad Air 2. This means Apple’s ‘courage’ regarding headphones has yet to make its way to tablets, so you can plug in your best cans for a richer audio experience than the stereo speakers alone can offer. You get Touch ID, which was missing on the original Air. There’s an optional cellular model, of course. And then there’s the usual Lightning port for charging which, as ever, takes hours. It’s in this general area that the new iPad and iPad Pro are most clearly differentiated. This cheaper iPad has no smart connector, only two speakers, and doesn’t support Apple Pencil. Frankly, that seems fair enough, given the target market, and it’s not like you can’t find alternate keyboard cases and styluses knocking around anyway. The cameras are fine for animation apps, FaceTime and shooting 30fps HD video, but you probably don’t want to be using the rear one for a great deal of photography if you’ve got a smartphone on you. PRICE: CHEAP AS CHIPS As noted earlier, the price is a major shift for this particular iPad. Despite the massive kicking Sterling’s received since last summer, the new iPad still clocks in at 40 quid cheaper than the iPad Air 2, and is over $200 less than the iPad Pro. Apple’s still playing upsell games in urging you to part with an extra 90 quid for four times the storage (and if you can afford that, you absolutely should), but this new base level feels like the first time the iPad’s properly come off of its lofty perch and aggressively courted the mainstream. Sure, there are cheaper Android tablets out there, but it’s hard to find any properly comparable ones at this price-point – and that’s even more the case once you factor in the significantly richer app and game ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. The lack of an anti-reflective display coating is a great pity and perhaps a compromise too far, and the hollow thunk on tapping the screen knocks the iPad’s typically premium feel; but elsewhere, this iPad performs admirably, and as such seems well placed to tempt anyone with an iPad Air or earlier to upgrade. Frankly, if this model won’t get iPad sales moving again, it’s hard to know what will – beyond a radical rethink in terms of iOS for iPad and the very nature of the device itself. APPLE IPAD (2017) VERDICT Read what you like into Apple’s branding, but with this latest iPad being short of any modifier (Air! Mini! Pro! Just Buy It Already!), it feels like Apple’s saying this is the iPad for almost everyone. If you want something smaller, buy a mini, and if you need a Pencil, grab a Pro, otherwise just get this iPad. Is it the best iPad? No. That accolade still rightly belongs to the Pro. And occasionally (again: that reflective screen), Apple should perhaps have reconsidered some of its cost-cutting decisions. On the whole, though, it’s hard to grumble at the new iPad’s marriage of form factor, power, app ecosystem, and price. If you’ve an iPad Air or earlier, this is a strong upgrade; if you’re new to tablets, you won’t find anything better for the price. STUFF SAYS… Score: ***** It might look like a regression, but this iPad is affordable and has enough power within to serve you well for years.

According to reports by CNBC, the project was initially endorsed by Steve Jobs before his death. The project would involve a wearable device, such a smartwatch, that would track and log health data, such as blood glucose, heart rate and oxygen levels. The tech would use non-invasive sensors to monitor the body to detect diabetes in people, allowing timely treatment.  The firm has brought in a small team of biomedical engineers to work in Palo Alto. Any breakthrough made by the team would be a “holy grail” for life sciences, as the such previous attempts have failed. It's difficult to measure glucose levels without taking actual blood. Apple is said to have undertaken feasibility trails in the Bay Area and consultants have been brought in to help deal with regulatory matters. According to the reports, the project has been active for at least five years. In 2010, Apple bought a firm called Cor, after then-CEO Bob Messerschmidt reportedly sent Jobs an email on the topic of sensor technologies for healthcare. Messerschmidt has since worked on the Apple Watchm which does feature a heart rate tracker.  Sources familiar with the matter told CNBC the technology will use optical sensors that will work by “shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose”. The project is expected to cost Apple several hundred million dollars if not a billion dollars, but any breakthrough would stimulate new medical research and open up a market to people wanting to track blood sugar levels, making the Apple Watch a “must have” rather than a shiny toy. Google is also working on wearable technology to monitor blood sugar levels, although its technology has focused on a smart contact lenses that monitors glucose levels in tears.

Linksys Velop Wi-Fi router review: One of the best mesh network systems to date Video Control access to your network At a Glance Edimax AC1200 Wi-Fi USB Adapter Macworld Rating $24.99 MSRP $24.99 View on Amazon As the Mac 911 columnist at Macworld, I’ve received hundreds of emails from people who have had Wi-Fi fail on their computers. In August 2016, I wrote a column that provided all the advice we had to troubleshoot the problem, which is sometimes caused by system software, sometimes by failed hardware, and sometimes by a bad connection. If you’ve gone through all those stages or you want a second Wi-Fi connection on your Mac—useful for firewalls, relaying a Wi-Fi network, and other purposes—the Edimax AC1200 Dual Band Wi-Fi USB Adapter (model EW-7822ULC; $24.99 MSRP; available on Amazon) seems to be not only a good solution, but the only solution. Once, a variety of alternatives existed for the Mac, but there’s no simply not enough of a market for them, and Edimax continues to update driver and utility software, keeping it viable. The drivers for macOS 10.12 Sierra only appeared in January, if you had previously discounted this as an option. The same driver also support OS X 10.7 to 10.11, making it a great solution for owners of Macs that can’t be updated or they prefer to keep on an older release, and have had a Wi-Fi failure. Edimax Even better, the Edimax adapter isn’t an old flavor of Wi-Fi. Rather, it’s the very hippest and latest thing: it uses 802.11ac Wave 2 with MU-MIMO, terms which require some unpacking. You may know that Wi-Fi is a trademark used by a trade group to cover a variety of wireless LAN (WLAN) standards that start with 802.11. The first standards in the family, 802.11a and b, appeared in 1999; the latest, 802.11ac, starting appearing in Apple’s base stations and Macs in 2013, and later in iOS devices. (All current models for sale of Macs, iPhones, and iPads have 802.11ac.) However, 802.11ac has appeared in waves. Wave 2 adds new features that can increase throughput and help with network capacity, but not all routers (and none of Apple’s) support it. MU-MIMO allows a Wave 2 router to divvy up the simultaneous conversations it can have among multiple devices if those devices can’t occupy all the slots. A computer might fill the typical four slots available, while the Edimax AC1200 fills two and some mobile devices only use one. Edimax also includes beamforming, which lets an adapter and router focus more of their transmitting signal energy at each, producing a stronger (and thus often faster) connection. Edimax says the AC1200 adapter maxes out at 300Mbps in 2.4GHz (with 802.11n) and 867Mbps in 5GHz (with 802.11ac). On busy networks that have Wave 2 routers, your adapter will take up only half the simultaneous capacity while it’s communicating. If you don’t have 802.11ac or don’t have the newest wave, the Edimax future proofs your update. IDG The wireless utility mimics Apple’s Wi-Fi menu to manage network connections. You have to install a custom driver and then restart to use the adapter. After rebooting, you’ll find an old-style line drawing of an adapter in your menu bar, and you use that menu instead of the macOS Wi-Fi menu to manage the connection. (It looks a bit like an electronic cigarette releasing green vapor.) Behind the scenes, the driver updates network settings, so you can modify details (like DNS or other elements) via the Network system preference pane. You use the utility menu to change the network to which you want to connect, however. Unlike Apple’s hidden Option-click for its Wi-Fi menu to reveal more details about the currently connected and available Wi-Fi networks, Edimax’s just shows the names and fills in the wireless wave form to approximate signal strength. While connected, a tiny blue LED is lit on the adapter. If your router supports WPS for easy connections, you can select that from the menu, and the utility generates a connection PIN. IDG The Edimax utility includes its own profile manager to store Wi-Fi network information. I tested the adapter via both a Mac mini with USB 3.0 Type-A connections and a 12-inch MacBook with USB-C using a dock. The adapter worked fine even when plugged in through an intervening device, such as a USB keyboard on the Mac mini and the USB-C dock. With a nearby 802.11ac Wave 1 router, I routinely achieved speeds from 100-120Mbps from an Edimax-equipped Mac to another Mac that was connected to the same router via ethernet measured via the iperf utility. I expected faster performance, but testing with the same setup and using the MacBook’s built-in 802.11ac adapter, speeds bumped only to 150Mbps. Your wireless network environment and resulting performance will vary from mine—and minute to minute, too. I found the Edimax utility and menu a little funky. It mimics Apple’s menu and approach, but it fails more readily. On my MacBook, the menu disappeared, and I logged out of my account and back in to restore it. That worked, and then it was stable. I didn’t have this trouble on the Mac mini. I initially entered the network password incorrectly on one machine, and subsequent connection attempts noted the password was wrong without allowing me to re-enter the right one. The workaround is to select Open Wireless Utility, select the network, and enter the password there. (A note to Edimax: you have a typo in Network Name, which reads Netowrk Name.) Edimax earns big points by including an uninstaller along with its installer. This lets you remove the driver without having to use Terminal if you’re no longer using the adapter and don’t want the cruft of unneeded network software running. A big warning on size: the adapter is really tiny. I almost lost it in testing when it slipped out of my grasp. This is to keep it low profile, and the assumption is that most users will likely leave it in all the time. However, the small format means a tiny antenna, too, so you might find throughput is inconsistent depending on objects around the side of your Mac and its orientation to a base station. Wi-Fi signals penetrate objects, but the denser and object and the more of them between an adapter and a base station, the less power that gets through or can be received. Bottom line If your Mac’s Wi-Fi has failed and you’ve tried everything free, and it’s running OS X 10.7 to 10.11 or macOS Sierra, drop $20 and put yourself back in wireless business.

The so-called Galaxy X reportedly has a pair of OLED displays with a hinge in the middle allowing it to fold open 180 degrees. Samsung has already placed orders for components and is planning to build between 2,000 and 3,000 units before July, reports suggest. Scroll down for video  Samsung could be bringing back the flip phone with a new foldable smartphone that boasts two screens. The so-called Galaxy X reportedly has a pair of OLED display panels with a hinge in the middle, allowing it to fold open 180 degrees (artist's impression pictured) HOW WILL IT WORK?  Last year Samsung was awarded a patent for a radical design that allows a phones to fold in two. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it.    The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge. Samsung is preparing to test a prototype of the foldable smartphone this year according to a report in South Korean news outlet The Investor. 'Samsung seems to be testing the waters with the dual-screen device to gather ideas about its upcoming foldable phone,' a source told the publication. The company first filed a patent for a foldable device last year. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it. The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, using a large hinge.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next World's first fluorescent frog that glows bright green is...

Share this article Share 39 shares The device is described as something that can be 'folded or unfolded semi automatically.' The patent also referred to both a 'flexible' and 'secondary' display, which is supposed to activate when you fold the device. But the problem, multiple sources say, isn't with the technology but whether Samsung can work out marketing and profitability issues. Samsung is expected to release another new handset, one that folds in two like a notebook, as early as January next year. A screenshot from a conceptual video showing what the device may look like is pictured Last month it was revealed that Samsung has secretly been showing off a radical 'Foldable Valley' device and could unveil it later this year in a bid to deflect attention from Apple's iPhone 8. Apple is expected to unveil its 'iPhone Edition' in September - with the latest rumours saying Samsung could show off the folding design a few days earlier at the IFA show in Berlin. Samsung's unnamed smartphone was apparently showcased to a limited number of partners at MWC 2017, as the South Korean giant is trying to prevent leaks, according to BGR.  Korean site ETNews says the firm will begin widespread testing of prototypes later this year, and although Samsung could announce it as an Apple spoiler, the handset will not go on sale until next year. Earlier rumours claimed both Samsung and LG are planning to launch bendable phones later this year. Samsung's device, codenamed  'Foldable Valley' will turn into a 7inch tablet when unfolded, and is expected to launch in august, the report claimed.  It also said LG will unveil a similar product, and believes it can sell 100,000 foldable devices in the fourth quarter.  According to previous claims from Korean news site ETNews, the product is known internally as a 'smartlet' and has a 7inch screen when unfolded, which becomes a 5inch device when folded. Samsung will apparently start mass producing the 'smartlet' this year for a 2017 release, and has spent three years developing the technology. The patent drawings reveal a folding design similar to a concept Samsung is known to be developing. The design can be folded and placed on a table, depending on how much of the screen is needed. Dubbed 'Foldable Valley', the device is expected to take advantage of bendy plastic screens being developed by Samsung's display division. In a call with investors in January, director of Samsung's Display division Lee Chang-hoon said 'Development of Foldable OLED is taking place according to our plan...We are planning on mass-production and release this product by discussing with out partners.'  The South Korean tech giant previously said it will launch foldable devices in 2016 and trusted rumour blog SamMobile reported earlier this year that anonymous sources claim the device is already being tested in China. The source, who claims to have in-depth knowledge of the device, said it is being developed under the codename Project Valley.  And they added that two versions of the phone are being tested - one with a Snapdragon 620 processor and another with a Snapdragon 820. When folded, the handset looks almost like a wallet. Elsewhere, the device is rumoured to have 3GB of RAM, a microSD card slot and a non-removable battery. Samsung told MailOnline it doesn't comment on rumour or speculation.   Samsung has been teasing bendable screens for years and at CES in 2013 revealed a flexible Oled screen called Youm. The firm said at the time it could make high-resolution screens on extremely thin plastic, instead of glass, so it could be bent without shattering. The patents have led to rumours that manufacturers could be taking inspiration from 'clamshell' design phones that were popular in the 1990s. Pictured is the Motorola StarTAC handset, which was first released in 1996 However, a notebook style phone would need to bend at a very sharp angle and would need to withstand considerable wear and tear, leading some commentators to suggest the rumour should be taken with a pinch of salt. LG is similarly developing incredibly bendy screens. In 2014, it showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing. Samsung is not the only firm working on highly flexible screens. In 2014, LG showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen (pictured) that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. At the time, it said it could make its debut in 2017 This allowed the screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport.  At the time, the company said it could make its debut in 2017. In May, it debuted a a concept ultra thin 'wallpaper TV' less than 1mm thick, and at four lbs (1.9kg) it is so light it can be attached to the wall using just magnets. At IFA, a demonstration showed an LG employee pulling the screen away from the wall and bending it, to prove it carries on working.

'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple may have to delay ‘iPhone X’ due to Touch ID troubles Apple may have to delay ‘iPhone X’ due to Touch ID troubles Matthew Wilson 19 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News It seems that Apple’s upcoming 5.8-inch OLED iPhone may end up missing its September release date as Apple is reportedly having issues with integrating the Touch ID sensor within the display. This is being described as Apple’s “biggest bottleneck” in the build up to mass production of the next iPhone. According to research performed by analysts at Cowen and Company, obtained by MacRumors, supply chain sources have said that the current yield rate of Apple’s Touch ID sensor is too low and Apple appears unwilling to use outside manufacturing help as a solution at this time. According to the report, there are three potential scenarios if Apple can’t resolve its Touch ID manufacturing issues. The first, being removal of the feature entirely from this iPhone. Instead, Apple could rely on Iris or Facial recognition but given Touch ID’s security benefits, this seems like the most unlikely step. On top of that, removal of Touch ID would remove Apple Pay functionality. The second possible solution is to move the Touch ID sensor to the back of the iPhone, this would mean no more issues integrating it within the display but could make the sensor difficult to reach or use regularly. Finally, Apple may just delay production of this specific iPhone model until it can figure out the problem, though an announcement would still take place in September. Apple is apparently aiming to finalise its Touch ID specification by May and get on with mass production but if yield rates continue to be an issue, production could be pushed back to September. These issues may also be the reason we’ve not seen many supply chain leaks regarding this specific iPhone, which we still don’t have a final name for. The usual iPhone and iPhone Plus models should still launch on time later this year. These issues seem to be specifically affecting Apple’s upcoming ‘anniversary iPhone’, which will feature an all new design and larger OLED display. KitGuru Says: The Touch ID sensor is such an important part of the iPhone experience at this point, so removing it simply isn’t an option for Apple. Moving it to another location could work, but in doing so, the feature would become much less ‘user-friendly’. Either way, if this report is accurate, then it seems Apple could be in a tight spot.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple iPhone news Touch ID Previous Buffalo LinkStation Competition!

Three anonymous sources confirmed to the US news organisation that the silicon valley giant is currently working on a glucose sensor that constantly monitors your blood sugar levels without needing to draw blood. killerbayer via Getty Images Apparently, the project is already in the advanced stages of development with testing reportedly taking place in clinical states around San Francisco. While Tim Cook has always been a strong advocate for the use of technology as a health aid, CNBC claims that the glucose sensor was in fact the brainchild of Steve Jobs. It’s believed that Apple has a reasonably large team of around 30 experts working on the technology out of a top secret office down the road from Apple’s HQ. If you’re wondering how this technology would ever manifest itself the likelihood is that it would probably be connected to the Apple Watch. Related... Apple iPhone 7 Review: Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick Apple Watch Series 2 Review: Coming Of Age This Incredible Braille Smartwatch Lets People Feel Text Messages Apple’s first wearable gadget is already a health-focused device with heart-rate tracking, GPS for running and cycling and features that remind you to walk and then breathe. Glucose monitoring has long been considered the “holy grail” of smart health, however it has proven to be a particularly stubborn hurdle both for the pharma and technology industries. So difficult is the task, that an expert once told Reuters that to accomplish it would take ‘billions’ of dollars. If there’s one company that can invest that sort of money however, Apple is probably it. The Best Gadgets You Can Buy In 2017 Xbox One S Microsoft If you own a 4K TV and also own an original Xbox One then the Xbox One S is the console for you. It is quite simply Microsoft’s best Xbox ever, it’s also the cheapest 4K Blu-ray player you’ll be able to buy this side of Christmas. Your games collection will look stunning and if you trade in your old console the relatively small cost shouldn’t sting while you wait for Microsoft’s uber-console Project Scorpio to arrive next year. Apple iPhone 7 Apple This is Apple’s best iPhone ever, and if we’re honest it’s one of their most innovative devices yet. Its exceptional camera, combined with with a slim, water-resistant body mean that while it's not a leap in design it is a leap in just about everything else. No it doesn't have a headphone jack, but wireless audio is finally ready. Sky Q Sky Sky Q as a complete package is the future, not just one single feature.It’s knowing that everything you’ve ever recorded is available in every room. It’s knowing that you can download any recorded show onto your iPad. It’s also knowing that every Sky Q box also doubles as a WiFi hotspot.This is where Sky Q makes sense. This is an all-in-one system, it does literally everything. There’s no switching, no painful tinkering, it all neatly fits together and if there’s one thing us humans like it’s everything working just as it should. Google Pixel Google This is Google’s iPhone. It’s that simple. As such there are achievements and compromises. If you’re after an incredibly well-built, powerful Android flagship, Google have given you a truly five-star smartphone. If you’re a photographer, the Pixel’s camera and cloud storage option make this a no brainer. This is Google's first 'made by us' smartphone and it's absolutely brilliant. Hive Active Heating 2 Review Hive If your boiler is compatible and you’re willing to spend the initial £249 (including installation) then Hive is one of the most complete smart home systems we’ve ever seen. While Nest offers third-party accessories like Philips Hue, Hive almost fights back by keeping things simple: If it’s got the Hive logo on it you know it works. Components are reasonably priced and the entire system has been utterly rock solid, we haven’t had a single issue since installation. Amazon Echo Amazon Amazon Echo works best when you have other gadgets that it can utilise such as Hive, Nest or Philips Hue. On its own its an incredibly smart speaker, paired with these other gadgets though and it becomes the fully fledged conduit to your home. It’s also really good at doing homework. Alexa really is the first gadget we actually felt comfortable talking to. Roli Lightpad Block Roli Don't be alarmed by its alien appearance. This is actually one of the most innovative music-making gadgets we've used all year. A large transparent gel-like surface is both touch and pressure sensitive allowing you to create music in a way that's both utterly unique and incredibly intuitive. The accompanying app is properly easy to use and once mastered the Lightpad can become the only tool you need to create an entire song. Apple Watch Series 2 Apple The Series 2 is the complete package. It’s the smartwatch that we feel Apple always wanted to make. It’s a fitness tracker, health monitor and wellness device that’ll help you stay fit and, just as importantly, calm in mind. BeoPlay A2 Active By B&O Play Bang Olufsen At £299 this is not a cheap option, however for that money you’ll get a product that’s just as happy being your main living room speaker as it is keeping you company on a road trip. The sound quality is truly room-filling and at the high standard you would expect for a Bang & Olufson product. The A2 Active is quite simply one of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is powerful but won’t run out of battery, beautiful yet able to work underwater and capable of transporting you to alien worlds through the medium of virtual reality. If there’s a product that encapsulates all the of the best technologies on offer today it’s this one. Oh and it won't catch fire, so that's nice. PlayStation VR Sony At the moment, if you own a PS4 and are desperately excited to get into virtual reality, PlayStation VR is the only place to start. It’s comfortable, gloriously easy to use and when the hardware and software work in harmony it’s an utterly breathtaking experience. Visceral, emotional and yet entirely accessible, it’s a technological marvel. Bowers & Wilkins P9 Signature Bowers Wilkins Anyone who wants an industry-leading sound but without the usually eye-watering price tag. Yes, these are £699, but when you think that the average audiophile will spend upwards of £1000 on a pair of HiFi-quality headphones these make every bit of sense. They’re B&W’s best headphones ever and they’re quite frankly one of the best pairs of headphones we’ve ever used. PlayStation 4 Pro Sony If you’re looking for an affordable (it costs as much as the original PS4) entry into the world of 4K gaming then the PS4 Pro is a no brainer. Pair it with a 4K HDR TV and games look absolutely astonishing. At present most games are simply being given a new coat of paint but going forward there will be an army of titles designed with this console in mind. OnePlus 3T OnePlus The OnePlus 3T is simply a continuation of the ethos that makes OnePlus phones so good. It’s exceptionally well-built, powerful and offers you everything you could want in an affordable and meaningful package. No smartphone will give you more value for money. Beats by Dre Powerbeats3 Wireless Beats by Dre While Apple's AirPods might have got most of the limelight in the post-iPhone 7 world it's actually Apple-owned Beats who have given us the ultimate solution to the lack of a headphone jack.The Powerbeats3 are ultra-portable, durable, wireless headphones that are a doddle to set up and last for days then we’ve found the pair for you. They sound great, they’re comfy, they’re perfect for sports and they last for days. These are very, very good. Samsung UE49KS9000 Samsung TVs are massive these days. They're also really really expensive. The KS9000 then has a very special place in our hearts because at a very sane 49-inches it's the most living room-friendly TV we've seen in recent years. Oh and because it's part of Samsung's flagship range you're still getting probably one of the best 4K TVs on the market.  Sonos Play:5 (2nd Gen) Sonos While it was released in December of 2015, Sonos' newest speaker has played an undisputedly important role in how we consume music in 2016. This was the year of wireless and Sonos continued to show us that when it comes to ditching those wires, they were one of the best.  Withings Activite Pop Withings This is the anti-fitness tracker of fitness trackers. Boasting a beautifully minimalist design the Pop is all about getting the job done without shouting about it. A simple measurement dial at the bottom shows you varying metrics for how active you're being while Withings' app reveals just how much data is actually being collected. While Fitbit has led the way in Fitness trackers, Withings has been offering even the most resistant consumer a change to start taking better care of themselves./ More: Uk Innovation Apple Healthcare Diabetes Apple Watch Suggest a correction Advertisement Suggested For You by Gravity Comments Advertisement Suggested For You Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW UK TECH Learn more Newsletter 145 K 17.4 K 22.5 K Podcast Add us on Snapchat Advertisement Apple Reportedly Working On A 'Holy Grail' Technology For Treating Diabetes CONVERSATIONS Advertise RSS Careers FAQ User Agreement Privacy Comment Policy About Us About Our Ads Contact Us Archive "The Huffington Post UK" is provided by AOL (UK) Limited. © 2017 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors.

Is Making an Apple Watch for Diabetics (AAPL) Apple Inc. Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC Declines Apple Inc. Loses Top Smartphone Vendor Crown to Samsung (AAPL) View All Posts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly working on a top secret project that would incorporate blood glucose monitoring technology for the Apple Watch. The ability to check and monitor blood sugar levels without the need to use a needle to physically draw blood would be a medical game changer. Source: Apple An Apple Watch for diabetics would also make AAPL’s wearable a must-have for hundreds of millions of people. Diabetes: A Big Problem That’s Getting Bigger Diabetes is a chronic disease that’s on the upswing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), modern lifestyles with relatively little activity and increasing body weight is to blame for the majority of cases of Type 2 Diabetes — the most common version. The number of people affected is rapidly growing, with WHO reporting the 108 million cases globally rose to 422 million by 2014. Managing diabetes requires regular monitoring of blood glucose levels throughout the day, which means using a needle to prick a finger for blood needed for testing. That also means buying a blood testing monitor and ongoing purchases of testing strips. Few people like being pricked with a needle multiple times every day. An Apple Watch for Diabetics would upend the entire blood glucose monitoring process, making it easier, far less invasive and eliminating the ongoing cost of supplies. The Team Working on an Apple Watch for Diabetics CNBC broke the news that AAPL has a secret team working to develop sensors that can continuously monitor blood sugar levels –without having to draw blood. The project is focused on optical sensors that would shine through the skin to measure blood glucose levels. This sensor would be integrated into the bottom of the Apple Watch — in a similar fashion to the current model’s optical heart rate sensor. The resulting Apple Watch for diabetics would have the potential to be a game-changer in how the disease is managed. According to CNBC’s sources, this project isn’t pie in the sky. In the past year, AAPL has reportedly been adding biomedical experts from medical corporations to the initial team of 30 engineers. It is conducting trials at clinical sites in the San Francisco area, and has hired consultants to work on the regulatory requirements. What This Could Mean for Apple Watch Sales The impact of integrated blood glucose monitoring on Apple Watch sales would be huge. The Centers for Disease Control says that in 2016, 29 million Americans had diabetes and 86 million were pre-diabetic. No one enjoys needles, and while an Apple Watch for diabetics wouldn’t eliminate the need for insulin shots, it would eliminate the finger pricking to draw blood for testing multiple times per day. It also would eliminate the need to carry around the blood glucose testing kit and the ongoing purchase of testing strips. Constant blood glucose monitoring could also help those 86 million Americans realize they are pre-diabetic and help them to manage their lifestyle to prevent the onset of full-blown diabetes.

 Some MacBook Pro owners say their laptops are making a weird 'popping' sound Rob Price Apr. 13, 2017, 7:52 AM 2,420 facebook linkedin twitter email print The MacBook Pro, complete with Touch Bar.salchuiwt/Flickr (CC) Apple customers say there's a strange new problem affecting some MacBook Pros: They're making a "popping" noise. As previously reported by 9to5Mac, numerous people are complaining online that the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, released in 2016, is making the weird sound. It's not exactly clear what's causing the issue. Some are pointing to heat as a possible cause, noting it happens when their laptops are under stress. "Mine only exhibits the popping sound when it warms up under processor load, then I don't hear it again until it cools down," one user wrote on Apple's support forum in a discussion about the issue. "I concur, I think it's to do with expansion and contraction somewhere in the body of the casing." Another said that when they took their device in to Apple's Genius Bar customer service team, a dent on the bottom of their MacBook Pro was blamed, and they had to pay $130 to get it fixed. But others say their devices are popping even when there's no dent present. Just behind the MacBook Pro logo, on the other side," another user said. "When the Mac is heating up, without pressing, its pops exactly here too." One MacBook Pro owner told Business Insider it happens "multiple times a day. Notably when i open the laptop — usually after about 30ish seconds, but not every time. And then every 20-100 minutes after that." It's about as loud "as a trackpad click," they said. The problem seems pretty widespread, but — while annoying — it doesn't seem to be causing more serious issues for people affected. Their laptops are just occasionally making popping noises.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Next-gen Apple Watch may include glucose sensors, address diabetic market’s concerns Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, April 13th, 2017, 05:11 Category: Apple Watch, Hardware, iPhone, Rumor, Wearables The next-gen Apple Watch may feature glucose sensors. CNBC, citing sources close to the story, has reported that Apple has reportedly hired a team of biomedical engineers to develop noninvasive glucose sensors for integration in Apple Watch, a solution that could lead to continuous monitoring of blood sugar levels for users with diabetes. The small biomedical group is apparently part of a “super secret” initiative, first imagined by late cofounder Steve Jobs, to create a noninvasive glucose monitoring solution. The company is said to have been working on the project for five years now. At present, it’s difficult to track sugar levels without drawing blood and there have been several corporate attempts to achieve this without much success. The diabetes research team, stationed in an office building somewhere in Palo Alto, is said to be ready to conduct feasibility trials, a major step toward gaining necessary federal regulatory approvals. Apple could begin testing the process at clinical sites in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. Details remain scant, although sources claim Apple is using optical sensors capable of measuring glucose indications through a user’s skin. About 30 people were cited as part of the engineering team a year ago, though this number could have increased via acquisitions and recent hire. Apple last June hired Dr. Rajiv Kumar, a pediatric specialist who formerly worked for Stanford Children’s Health. Kumar was one of the first medical professionals to take advantage of Apple’s HealthKit platform, facilitating a ResearchKit study on Type 1 diabetes monitoring. Though his previous work focused on diabetes, it is unclear if Kumar is part of Apple’s glucose monitoring technology team. In 2013, Apple picked up several employees of defunct biotech company CB MediSensors, which specialized in non-invasive sensors capable of detecting substances within the body. These substances also included glucose. Since the debut of HealthKit in 2014, Apple has increasingly focused on health and fitness products. A report last year suggests the company’s interest in health sciences was sparked by a challenge from Jobs, who wanted to fix what he viewed as a disjointed healthcare system. Jobs believed technology could solve a data gap between patients and healthcare professionals, an idea that gave rise to HealthKit, ResearchKit and ultimately Apple Watch. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Apr 13, 2017 at 6:48AM The smartphone market has historically been dominated by Google's Android. In the most recent quarter, the Alphabet, Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) property controlled more than 80% of the global mobile operating system market. You might be tempted to believe that the company would be able to leverage its massive installed base of devices into a commanding lead in the area of mobile payments. While that would be an easy conclusion to draw, it's not actually the case.  When Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple Pay in 2014, it announced that the payment service was supported by Visa, Mastercard, and American Express (which represented 83% of credit card purchases in the U.S.) and was accepted at 220,000 merchant locations. One of the criticisms at the time was that the seemingly large number only represented about 2.4% of the approximately 8 million merchants in the U.S. that accepted credit cards. Apple touted its NFC antenna technology as groundbreaking, but the vast majority of merchants didn't possess the point-of-sale systems the would work with this technology. But from these humble beginnings and early criticisms, Apple has emerged as the leader in the mobile payments space. Image source: Getty Images. Apple Pay transaction volume up 500% During its most recent conference call, Apple revealed that the number of Apple Pay users had more than tripled over the last year and that transaction volume was up 500% year over year. The service has been rolled out in four new countries, for a total of 13. Apple admitted that while adoption has been slow, 4 million locations that cover about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S. now accept Apple Pay. Since Apple collects a piece of each transaction, this could eventually generate a significant ongoing revenue stream for the company.   A recent report by Statista revealed similar findings, with about 36% of U.S. retailers accepting Apple Pay. Google takes up the second spot with Android Pay, which is accepted at 24% of merchants, and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) offering Samsung Pay comes in third with 18%. Apple Pay's acceptance at a significantly greater number of merchants appears to be paying off, and is likely the reason for Apple's lead in the category. Monthly Apple Pay transactions grew 50% While one-off payments help growth, regular use will be a key driving factor. Consumer analytics firm TXN Solutions reviewed the transactions from over 3 million payments and reported that the number of monthly Apple Pay transactions grew by 50% between December 2015 and December 2016. How does this translate to overall consumer usage? Market research firm eMarketer revealed that fewer than 20% of smartphone users have paid using a mobile device in the preceding six months. That is expected to grow to 33% by 2020. Statista found that Apple Pay leads among consumers, with 12% using the service, while only 9% use Android Pay and 6% use Samsung Pay.  Apple leads in the growing mobile payments segment. Image source: Pixabay. Mobile payments slowly gaining popularity With the wide adoption of smartphones, many expected that mobile payments would gain fast acceptance, but thus far it has been slow to materialize. Numerous factors including concerns regarding personal data security and the potential for fraud have contributed to the slow rate of adoption by consumers. Still, Statista expects mobile payment transactions to grow at a rate of 52% annually to $866 billion by 2021.  The 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey (link opens PDF) by Accenture Consulting indicates that while consumers still default to traditional payments now, many report that they expect to making more digital payments by 2020. Several key trends are at play that will drive further mobile payment adoption. Fifty-six percent of consumers are aware of the technology and plan to use it in coming years. Millennials (those the report defines as being between the ages of 18 and 34) and mass affluents (those consumers with annual income of $100,000 or more after taxes) are pioneering the change to digital payments, with 35% of these groups regularly using their mobile phone to make online payments. This bodes well for Apple, as market research firm MBLM in its Brand Intimacy Report found that Apple is one of the most beloved brands among millennials. Finally, 73% of consumers trust their traditional credit card providers the most when considering mobile payments, which again bodes well for Apple Pay as it pairs with existing credit cards. Part of a growing trend Apple doesn't break out the revenue generated by Apple Pay, though its services segment, where it is located, reached a record $7.17 billion in the first quarter of 2017, up 18% over the prior-year quarter. Apple revealed in its most recent conference call that more than 2 million small businesses now accept invoice payments using Apple Pay and that Comcast would soon as well. CEO Tim Cook said the company's goal is to double revenue from the services segment by the end of 2020.  The acceptance of Apple Pay by a larger segment of retailers appears to have resulted in greater popularity for its service. That doesn't mean the company can rest on its laurels. Last month, Samsung launched Samsung Pay in India, the world's second most populous country, ahead of both Apple Pay and Android Pay, and LG announced that it would debut its own mobile payments service in June. The field is becoming more crowded, but Apple is clearly the top dog in mobile payments, and it has plenty of tailwinds to help it maintain that spot.

Apple is working on a new zopittybop-bop-bop secret N noninvasive way to track your blood sugar. One that won't require piercing the skin and could affect millions of Americans. Yep, and we are on the case and got the info so I think cautiously optimistic is the name of the game here. They're talking about using an optical sensor so basically a light that will go through the skin, measure the blood sugar levels for patients with diabetes, this is something that was apparently an intense area of interest for Steve jobs and put together 30 researchers several years ago and hard at work at this. When you're talking about diabetes, half a billion with a "B" people worldwide have this. Most of us have a smartphone so when you put the two together, this is an area of intense, intense research. Now, apple is not the only one working on something like this. No, everyone wants to get into the ring here on this. Apparently in 2014 Google submitted a patent for a contact lens that will measure blood sugar levels through the tears, literally everyone in the technology and biotech space is working on this because, again, when you incorporate the worlds of medicine, disease, wellness, technology, trackable device, chip, sensors, we are not living in sci-fi land anymore. Should be some game changers here. Absolutely and another game changer we'll talk about right now involves ordering pizza, whatever you are going to order from your favorite restaurant, don't be surprised about a robot brings it to your door. On Wednesday yelp unveiled its delivery service in San Francisco and David Kerley is joining us now and, David, yelp is joining post mate, they began testing this technology last month. You're with one of the robots they have roaming around Washington, D.C. How does this work exactly? Reporter: Whoever thought I would be following a robot around, Michael. The way it works, you call in an order for food or anything else you want and the supplier, I actually want my coffee this morning, will go ahead and load up the robot with whatever you've ordered and then the robot is programmed to go to wherever you are. Now, I happen to be standing here waiting for my coffee just up the treat from the robot. It's actually and this is part of the issue is dogs, people, everything getting used to these robots moving around. And the robot is going to come to you. On your phone you will have a code that allows you to open up. I wanted my coffee so postmates which has been doing it for about a month in D.C. Has now just delivered my coffee to me and that's the way it works and the robot takes off and goes off and does another delivery. And it's on the sidewalks. It's smart. It knows how to avoid areas that could be problematic, guys. But it's going to take some getting used to sharing the sidewalk. We have a very important question. How do you take your coffee? No, no, no. That's not the question. Reporter: This is a macchiato. There are concerns with this, right? Reporter: There are. And part of the reason is here look at how narrow the sidewalk gets. You know, people walking, whatnot so they're programming the robots to avoid areas like this and might go around another half block. I talked to a couple of folks walking by here today including a guy with his dog and he said the dog's even getting used to it at this point. It is a little bit of "Star wars" coming to a sidewalk near you. Yet I just don't want to take away anyone's job, you know. And the robot needs to go faster if it's bringing coffee. Keep that coffee hot, right? Hey, David, thank you. Thank the robot for us? This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

President Donald Trump… ED MORRISSEY: Trump Keeps Promise Not to Touch Social Security Reform – Or Did He?… » April 13, 2017 HEALTH: Apple has a secret team working on the holy grail for treating diabetes. Apple has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, miles from corporate headquarters. They are part of a super secret initiative, initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes, according to three people familiar with the matter. Such a breakthrough would be a “holy grail” for life sciences. Many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it’s highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. The initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways, the people said. From a business aspect, the most interesting part of this venture might be how Apple combines its penchant for secrecy with maneuvering through those regulatory pathways. It’s one thing to introduce another new bit of consumer electronics kit. It’s an entirely other thing to get a medical device — which I’m pretty sure this would be — past the FDA.

Yesterday AAPL: 141.05 -0.75 Purported iPhone 8 schematics show ‘bezel-less’ front, rear Touch ID, supposed dimensions Benjamin Mayo - Apr. 13th 2017 4:12 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In what is the first supposed leak of ‘real’ iPhone 8 technical schematics, an image posted to Weibo today claims to show technical drawings for the next-generation iPhone straight from Foxconn. The drawings depict an iPhone 8 front and back with minimal bezels on the left and right sides of the screen. Compared to an iPhone 7, the top and bottom bezels are also significantly smaller. On the back, the dual camera system and rear flash is stacked vertically in the top-left corner, with a gap for a Touch ID fingerprint sensor below the Apple logo. The image is labelled with dimensions for the chassis, which are comparable to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 — despite the significantly larger screen … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here As shown in the table, this is supposedly an image of design drawings for the iPhone 8’s Engineering Validation Test third revision. EVT is an early stage in the Apple product development cycle, the device must still pass through Design Validation Test and Production Validation Test stages before it is finalized. This is to say that all the design choices in the schematics shown here are not necessarily locked down. We’ve been hearing a lot about the Touch ID home button, Apple is apparently juggling different designs with the aim to have the fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, under the glass. If this is the case, EVT03 is likely a fallback design, ready in reserve, which simply puts that sensor on the back. The iPhone 8 drawings are annotated with dimensions which back up claims from KGI that the device would be about the same physical size as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, featuring a much larger 5.8 inch OLED screen by shrinking the bezels. From this drawing, the iPhone 8 device is measured at 149 mm tall, 72.5 mm wide and 7.1 mm thin (excluding the dual camera thickness, which still protrudes). To compare, the iPhone 7 is 138 mm tall, 67.1 mm wide and 7.1 mm. If this leak is to be believed, the device will be the same thinness as the current phone and about one centimetre taller. (Update: Ryan Jones points out that the table in the left is likely the specs for the iPhone 7S Plus, and that all the numbers in the right column are for the iPhone 8. This would suggest the iPhone 8 is 8.6 mm thick, including the camera bump. This would mean it is almost the same as the iPhone 7 Plus in thickness.) It’s worth noting that the general design here mirrors a sketchily sourced mockup we saw a couple of weeks ago, that also placed the Touch ID ring on the rear side and had similar screen bezel proportions. As with all Weibo leaks, we have to take care in believing anything at face value. That’s not to say Weibo hasn’t turned up the goods in previous years; schematics of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 all leaked by mid March in their respective years. Apple is widely rumoured to be introducing three new iPhones this year, two iterative updates with the same chassis as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and one major revamp. This latter device is what is pictured above, the ‘iPhone 8’ or ‘iPhone Edition’ or ‘iPhone Pro’ or whatever, and will apparently feature a 3D sensing front camera, wireless charging, 3 GB RAM, 521 PPI display and more in addition to the new external design. All three models are expected to be officially announced in the fall. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

Yesterday AAPL: 141.05 -0.75 Unlikely prospect of Apple buying Disney resurfaces, RBC says would create ‘unique opportunities’ Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 13th 2017 4:28 am PT @benlovejoy AAPL Company Disney View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Suggestions that Apple might buy Disney date back at least as far as 2006, and resurface from time to time. Latest to bring the idea back to life are analysts from RBC Capital Markets. NordVPN In a research note seen by Business Insider, RBC argues that such a deal would offer ‘some unique opportunities,’ but the actual reasoning seems incredibly weak. The best justification for such a mega deal, in our view, is the ability to do things together that neither company, nor any other company, could do. The sheer scale of a combined company offers some unique opportunities, and we’ve tried to identify some of the more compelling ones below. More importantly, Apple and Disney are each not just industry leaders in their own right but titans of industry on a global scale with truly unique products and services. Few people on earth are not already familiar with both companies’ products, yet they don’t compete in any meaningful sphere at the moment. The question therefore becomes what can they do together that they can’t do apart? The answer is they can do just about anything given the technology and financial resources. Potential benefits listed include diversification, boosting service business through acquiring a vast content library and enabling Apple to realise its streaming TV ambitions with something which would rival Netflix. But the analysts admit that the note is in response to queries from investors about whether Disney might be an acquisition target for Apple, rather than by any actual evidence that such a deal is being considered by either company. The idea seems incredibly unlikely, for two big reasons. First, Apple takes a highly-focused approach to acquisitions. Even Beats Music was in response to the fact that music downloads were being overtaken by streaming music, so the company had to get on board or have its highly important music business left behind. It doesn’t buy unrelated companies just to diversify. Second, the scale of the deal is hard to imagine even for Apple. Beats was the company’s largest ever purchase, at $3B. The only way for Apple to buy Disney outright, says RBC, would be to pay a 40% premium on the share price, which would add up to a cool $237B. Even Apple’s vast cash reserves wouldn’t cover that number, not even if Trump actually delivers on his promised 10% tax on revenue repatriated from overseas. RBC effectively admits as much, describing the odds as merely ‘greater than 0%.’ I’d agree on that – just not very much greater.

While we saw preliminary takes on this idea earlier this year, Westerlund’s newest video of the project shows the entire campus in its completed state. He explains that the project took him a total of 413 hours of work, first starting as a hobby then turning into a full-time commitment. Westerlund also cited that because of the spaceship ring design, the model was difficult to recreate with Minecraft cubes. He also offered the following comments: My humble tribute to Apple, I present Apple Park! After 413 hours of work starting in December 2015, here is the result. It started out as a simple project, something to do when I binged on Minecraft, but it slowly evolved into a full time project, with over 166 hours of work put in during the final month of the project. What drew me to this is my appreciation for end to end design and a crazy idea in my head that said ‘Hey let’s build the world’s curviest campus in a video game based on cubes.’ The model also sports the following features: – It’s a 1:1 full scale replica – This is built entirely by hand (no mods) – It’s terrain-accurate, based off topographical maps of Cupertino and the official landscaping plans – Each hill, path, and orchard are true to the construction plans, down the the placement of each handcrafted cherry tree. – All the general areas are fully furnished (so, the fitness center, atriums, cafes, maintenance building, Glendenning Barn, everywhere but the office space) – There are 28 cafes spread throughout main building, plus 2 outdoor cafes, 1 (presumably healthy) cafe in the fitness center, and of course the main cafeteria. – A megabuild is any Minecraft build utilizing at least one million blocks (people kept wondering). – Throughout the video, you can see nearly every aspect of Apple’s new campus, including the fitness center, Steve Jobs Theater, atrium, cafeteria, solar power cells, and much more, all in Minecraft-form.

But the device is still unaffordable for most people. Data from IntegraGO, a consulting agency in Argentina specializing in trade marketing, noted that iPhones cost roughly 150% more in Argentina than they do in the US. The prices start at approximately $1,370 for the 32 GB 6s model and reach upwards of $2,431 for the 256 GB 7 Plus, with prices varying among mobile phone operators and third-party retailers. In a country where the average salary is only $1,000 a month, most people will find the iPhone out of reach. “This wave of iPhone adopters in Argentina is predicted to come from the country’s affluent and aspiring middle classes,” said Enrique Carrier, director and founder of Carrier y Asociados. The iPhone’s debut comes after an eight-year ban on Apple products that were part of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s protectionist policies geared toward promoting local industry and preventing the flow of dollars out of the country. During this time, consumer electronics companies had to manufacture products in the remote region of Tierra del Fuego if they wanted their products to be sold throughout Argentina. And the government imposed tariffs of 35% on imports of desktops, laptops and tablets. Although Samsung and LG complied, Apple decided to leave. In short order, a black market formed. As the demand soared, smugglers began taking iPhones, iPads and MacBooks across the border. At one point in late 2013, Argentina was deemed to be the most expensive country in which to buy an iPhone: The iPhone 5s was selling for as much as $3,500 on MercadoLibre, Latin America’s most popular ecommerce site. But in February 2017, under President Mauricio Macri (elected in 2015), import policies changed. As part of Macri’s ambitious agenda to drive foreign investment in the country, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and Production announced that the government would eliminate the tariff for computers and tablets. This has allowed companies such as Apple to begin operating and selling their products within Argentina. But the tariff for smartphones remains. The import tariff alone is 18%, and that doesn’t include a 21% luxury tax and a 21% value-added tax (VAT). These taxes are charged at different stages of the commercial chain, so it’s not correct to just add them up and say the tax added is 60%. For now, the effect of the iPhone’s arrival is more of a political ploy showing that the market is opening up, rather than an effort to make the devices available to the populace, said Carrier in a blog post. For the time being, the iPhone is only affordable for an affluent minority. Nevertheless, Apple has persevered. With the change in import policy, local news outlets reported that Buenos Aires will be home to Argentina’s first Apple Store, which is expected to open in 2018. Apple has also been in negotiations to open new stores throughout the region in Guadalajara, Monterrey, Santiago and Lima. The result is that smartphone ownership is rising in Argentina. eMarketer estimates there will be 18.1 million smartphone users in the country this year, and by 2021, 53.1% of the total population will own a smartphone. Data from Kantar Worldpanel shows that Android devices have dominated the smartphone sales market in Argentina, holding a 94% market share in December 2016. (In the US, by comparison, Android’s share was 54.4% as of December 2016.) Officially, iOS accounts for only 3.3% of market share in Argentina. Of course, that does not take the black market into consideration. —Matteo Ceurvels New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week Ecommerce in the Grocery Sector: Retailers and Brands Innovate to Propel Growth in 2017 Shifts in how retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands think about ecommerce, combined with an accelerating acceptance among consumers for buying food digitally, have boosted online sales of groceries.

Since the release of the iPhone 8, many Apple fans have been clamoring to get their hands on the tenth anniversary iPhone. However, it looks like Apple is experiencing a series of technical difficulties with the said mobile phone. According to Apple Insider, the iPhone 8’s curved OLED display is proving to be quite difficult to manufacture. Especially with the fingerprint scanner sensor that is said to be embedded within the display. At the moment, Apple’s main supplier for the sensor is facing technical difficulties in merging the display and the sensor together. This results in a very low yield rate for the display. According to the same report, the yield rate for the display is so low that Apple is already considering contingency plans. One part of the plan is to unveil the iPhone 8 the same time as the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. However, this will still mean that the phone will arrive at a much later date, as reported earlier. iPhone TouchID sensor (via zshop,vn) Another idea was to relocate the TouchID sensor to the back of the iPhone 8, something an Android phone user will be used to. Finally, the last plan is to ditch the TouchID sensor altogether and just rely on the facial recognition in terms of security. While it will be next to impossible to predict which idea Apple would stick to, one can only guess that it will be the first plan; delaying the official release. While it may seem unlikely, Apple could also relocate the Touch ID sensor at the back. This trend is already common to most premium Android devices anyway. However, the idea of relying mostly on facial recognition is a big gamble. Unlike fingerprint scanning, a facial recognition feature is easier to circumvent. Even though Apple will be implementing 3D facial recognition on the iPhone 8, the technology is still very new. Apple will need a bit more time and testing to prove that 3D facial recognition is safe and will be able to prevent any hacks from happening.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « While Apple's iOS and iPhone 7 are King in the U.S., Android leaves iOS in the Dust in Urban China | Main | Apple's Latest Store in Dubai to Open on April 27 » April 13, 2017 Apple's Famed Audio Director, Inventor of Lucasfilm THX Sound System, Invents Next-Gen Audio System   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a key patent application from Apple that relates to a system and method for controlling the directivity of dialogue channels separate from music and effects channels in a piece of sound program content for movies and television. To understand the importance of this invention long term for Apple, you have to know the inventor that is now the Audio Director at Apple.   Apple's audio director is none other than Tomlinson M. Holman who is an American film theorist, audio engineer, and inventor of film technologies, notably the Lucasfilm THX sound system. He developed the world's first '10.2 sound system,' and now he's working on a new advanced sound system for Apple.   Naturally the question that's not answered in this patent filing is where and how will Apple bring this technology to market. In one patent point Apple notes that "the listening area may be a room within a house or a commercial establishment or an outdoor area (e.g., an amphitheater). That last point is very interesting considering that Apple's future flagship store in Milan is to incorporate and amphitheater, as noted in our cover graphic. More than likely the new sound system will be put to the test at this future location which will make the introduction of the amphitheater in Milan all that more exciting to see unfold.   With rumors of Apple working on a smart TV system for years now and with more recent rumors hinting of a new Apple Music TV-like service being close to being finalized (along with a new icon or logo being revealed in a trademark report yesterday), today's invention is all the more important long term.   The Problem   Apple notes that sound program content, including movies and television shows, are often composed of several distinct audio components, including dialogue of characters/actors, music and sound effects. Each of these component parts called stems may include multiple spatial channels and are mixed together prior to delivery to a consumer.   For example, a production company may mix a 5.1 channel dialogue stream or stem, a 5.1 music stream, and a 5.1 effects stream into a single master 5.1 audio mix or stream. This master stream may thereafter be delivered to a consumer through a recordable medium (e.g., DVD or Blu-ray) or through an online streaming service.   Although mixing dialogue, music, and effects to form a single master mix or stream is convenient for purposes of distribution, this process often results in poor audio reproduction for the consumer.   For example, intelligibility of dialogue may become an issue because the dialogue component for a piece of sound program content must be played back using the same settings as music and effects components since each of these components are unified in a single master stream.   Dialogue intelligibility has become a growing and widely perceived problem, especially amongst movies played through television sets where dialogue may be easily lost amongst music and effects.   Solution: Directivity Optimized Sound Reproduction   Apple's invention relates to an audio system that receives a piece of sound program content for playback from a content distribution system. The piece of sound program content may include multiple components or stems. For example, the piece of sound program content may include a multi-channel dialogue signal, a multi-channel music signal, and a multi-channel effects signal. In one embodiment, the multi-channel music signal may be combined or mixed with the multi-channel effects signal to form a combined multi-channel music and effects signal.   In one embodiment, the audio system or the content distribution system may determine a first set of directivity patterns for the multi-channel dialogue signal and a second set of directivity patterns for the combined multi-channel music and effects signal.   Each of the directivity patterns in the first and second sets of directivity patterns may be characterized by a directivity index. The directivity index of a beam pattern defines the ratio of sound emitted at a target (e.g., a listener) in comparison to sound emitted generally into a listening area.   In one embodiment, the first set of directivity patterns associated with channels of the dialogue signal have higher directivity indexes than the second set of directivity patterns associated with corresponding channels of the combined music and effects signal.   By associating dialogue components with a higher directivity than music and effects components, the system increases the intelligibility of dialogue for a piece of sound program content while allowing music and effects to retain conventional directivity having a typical ratio of direct-to-reverberant sound energy.   Patent Figures Illustrate various sized Audio Systems   Apple's patent FIG. 1A noted above shows us a view of a listening area with an audio receiver with, a set of six loudspeaker arrays with multiple transducers housed in a single cabinet; FIG. 8 below shows the production of a first set of directivity patterns for a dialogue signal/stem for a piece of sound program content and a second set of directivity patterns for a combined music and effects signal set for the piece of sound program content.   Apple's patent FIG. 6 noted below shows the flow and processing of each component of a piece of sound program content.   Apple's patent FIG. 7B noted above shows us the distribution of processed audio signals to two loudspeaker arrays.   Apple's patent application was originally filed back in October 2014 in Europe and published in Europe in November 2015. The U.S. filing was made in November 2016 and published today. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   One More Thing   In March Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Augmented Reality Team is bringing in more Specialists to work on their Future Platform." In that report we noted that Tomlinson Holman was one of the specialists brought on board the augmented reality team. According to today's patent, he's been with Apple for some time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.
