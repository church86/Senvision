The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Denisse Moreno International Business Times June 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple reportedly already is manufacturing its rumored Siri speaker and is integrating better sound to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google Home devices.More Apple and Amazon are fierce competitors, especially now that the iPhone maker has released its own home speaker. However, the companies seem to have been putting their differences aside lately. This year, Amazon and Apple introduced changes that goes beyond their rivalry, with the most recent move announced this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Read: iOS 11 And watchOS 4: New Apple Watch And iPhone Health Features Will Help With Your Workouts Amazon And The Apple TV Apple announced the Amazon video app will finally come to the Apple TV worldwide this year. The move makes it easier for users, since Amazon Prime subscribers previously had to use AirPlay on their device to stream video onto their Apple TV. Amazon’s Prime Video app will be available to those who own generation two, three and four of the Apple TV, Amazon said on Twitter. “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year,” Amazon tweeted. Apart from the Amazon video app, a BuzzFeed report said Amazon will also start reselling the Apple TV on its site. The online retailer stopped carrying the Apple TV and Google Chromecast devices in 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time that the company wanted its customers to be able to watch Amazon video on devices sold by Amazon. However, neither Amazon nor Apple have confirmed that this will happen. Siri and Alexa Apple and Amazon’s virtual assistants, Siri and Alexa, could work together in the future, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president of devices, suggested recently. He said the company believes there should be more openness among rival virtual assistant platforms. Limp said the online retailer is willing to work with Apple or Google to ensure Siri and Alexa are compatible. “You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X,’” he said. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns Limp's comments come after Alexa recently penetrated through the iPhone via the Amazon iOS app. iPhone and iPad users can use Alexa by tapping on the microphone icon on the right side of the search box. Alexa on the iOS app can help users with their shopping, track orders, give weather updates, play music and answer other commands. Alexa’s power is limited on iOS though, since it can only be used while the app is open. HomePod VS. Echo Devices When Apple revealed its new speaker at WWDC, it tried hard not to sell it as an Amazon Echo competitor. The HomePod is powered by Siri, but Apple didn’t mention until it was half way into the segment about the speaker. Apple’s HomePod competes with Amazon’s numerous Echo devices, including the latest ones, Echo Look and Echo Show. Amazon’s Echo speakers stream music from Prime Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and other services except Apple Music. Limp previously told Bloomberg Amazon would "love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration. Although there are some parts Apple and Amazon won’t let go of, the recent moves show we may see more cooperation between the two companies in the future.

While Apple recently revealed the 2017 Apple MacBook with Kaby Lake processor, Microsoft revealed its first Surface Laptop. Whether you prefer Windows or MacOS --  you now have both the alternatives available. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2017 costs $1,299, same as the Surface Laptop. A similarity between both is that they both offer expensive variants too. The MacBook Pro 2017 with 256GB SSD costs $1,499, while a Surface Pro Signature Type cover accessory will cost you 159.99. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Kaby Lake Processor, New Keyboard And More Apple introduces new MacBook and iMac line at WWDC. Photo: Apple, WWDC If we compare the hardware of the base variants of both devices, Microsoft has a slight edge over Apple — the MacBook Pro 2017 comes with Intel Core i5 processor, 128GB SSD, and 8GB RAM, while the Surface Laptop has an i5 processor and 8GB RAM, but a 256GB SSD. The Surface Laptop is also slightly lighter and thinner than the MacBook Pro – it weighs 3.02 pounds and has a thickness of 0.59 inches, while the Surface Laptop weights 2.76 pounds and has a thickness of 0.57 inches. Even the Surface Laptop display is slightly larger than the MacBook Pro – it measures 13.5-inches while MacBook’s is 13.3-inches. But if you want display clarity and vibrancy, MacBook would be a better choice since it offers a slightly better resolution – 2560 x 1600p in comparison to 2256 x 1504p resolution. The display density is also slightly better – the MacBook Pro has 227 pixels per inch display density, while the Surface Laptop has 201 pixels per inch display density. Both the devices have the same processors – 7th Gen Intel Core i7, but the MacBook has a better graphics processor — the base variant comes with an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, while the base variant of the Surface Laptop comes with Intel HD Graphics 620, although a version with the Iris Plus Graphics 640 is also available. Both the MacBook Pro and Surface Laptop have 8GB and 16GB RAM versions, but there is a more affordable one available for the Surface Laptop with 4GB RAM. In terms of battery life, the Surface Laptop is slightly better since it offers 14.5 hours of video playback, while the MacBook provides just 10 hours. While both the devices are equipped with special keyboards, the MacBook does have a slight edge in this department. Read: WWDC 2017 Keynote Time: iOS 11, Siri Speaker, New MacBook, Other Products Apple Could Unveil The MacBook Pro 2017 offers a full size backlit keyboard with an ambient light sensor, Force Touch trackpad and even a touch bar on high-end models; the Surface Laptop’s keyboard is relatively simple, except that it has Alcantara material around the trackpad, which makes it easier to rest your palms. Both devices have few ports – the MacBook Pro comes with 2 USB-C ports, while the Surface Laptop has just one USB 3.0 port. The key differentiator between both the devices is their operating system. While the MacBook comes with MacOS Sierra, with a better configured High Sierra coming soon, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10S. Both operating systems have their pros and cons, but the basic distinction is that if you are a gamer, the Surface Laptop will appeal to you more. To conclude, both the devices are pretty similar, yet have something different to offer. However, MacBook has a slight advantage in terms of visuals pips.  Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

We’ve all been there; you download an app, use it regularly, and find yourself frequently prompted to write an App Store review. It’s one of the most egregious things an app developer can do, but Apple now plans massively restrain the review prompt system to help protect users. The new App Review guidelines compel developers to use the official in-app rating UI that was added in iOS 10.3, and plans to “disallow custom review prompts” in the future. Previously, adopting the new App Store rating API was optional, but Apple is now fulfilling its earlier pledge to eventually make it mandatory. Developers aren’t entirely miffed about the change (first highlighted by 9to5mac), because the API allows for submitting app reviews without having to leave the app. That was previously one of the biggest drawbacks of submitting an app review. But Apple is also limiting the number of times that the rating prompt can be pushed to users. A user can only receive the prompt three times per year. And if a user leaves a rating, that user won’t receive another prompt for at least a year – and only if a new version of the app has been released. However, there’s an obvious failing with this system. If an app pushes an update that’s really bad and a user rates it negatively, developers won’t be able to prompt the user to write a new review once any issues have been fixed if the update falls within a year of the first review. Interestingly, it’s also possible for users to turn off app review prompts entirely. You just need to head into Settings > iTunes & App Store > In-App Ratings & Reviews and slide the switch off.

12/06/2017 Search our Archive Home News Sport What's On Deaths Motoring About us Contact us You are in: > Tipperarystar > Home On the bandwagon to the ballrooms of romance Reporter: Reporter 11 Jun 2017 Email: news@tipperarystar.ie 0 What was life really like for the bands and singers who packed the ballrooms of Ireland?  All glamour and glitter?  Or all illusion and unreality?   In 1978 to find out I locked up my typewriter, and joined up as a “roadie” (or a ‘horse’, as one bandsman called me) to find out how one band, the Kenny Ryder Superband, lived on the road.   It was a romance that was to last two years, and I became P.R.O.  of the band.    My brother, Seanie Ryan, who had played with groups such as Pyramid, was the drummer and comedian, and did a little song-writing too. Seanie had played with Tweed.    “It’s  all unreality,”declared Kenny Ryder, on the first night we were all  together (all nine of us) in a Ford Transit wagon, as we left Thurles at 3:45p.m. for the Boyne  Valley Hotel, Drogheda.     Said Kenny: “This  is a short gig up the road; Castletownbere  or Donegal would find us not talking at all in the wagon.”    I was to notice often, subsequently, that the mere mention of Donegal or Castletownbere,  a long way from Tipperary, in the heart of  the Midlands, was to invite hostile looks or an expletive or two from the band!   The lads played cards until it became dark, and there was the usual good-natured   banter about girls, soccer, other bands.   Bands had a remarkable bush telegraph system going for them;  they seemed to know   what every head (experienced bandsman) was doing from day to day.     “Yeah, we are all going for Big Apple,” said one band member.  Big Apple is the term bands use for number one status, which once could bring a top band up to £2,000 per night.  But Kenny had just formed his own pop band (when I was an unpaid assistant roadie, PRO hauler, etc  ) , and Big Apple was a long way off.   I  was first band PRO in Ireland. Today, Kenny is still  popular.  (He will be on stage  in Premier Ballroom, Thurles,  on June 17   when Paschal Brennan and his six piece band will also perform a Tribute to Joe Dolan.)   Kenny had been with Tweed, a band that was to figure in the National Song Contest, and the ”Late Late Show” and, on the strength of that name, he was able to get the bookings for a new band.     He made a number of recordings, and one, in my time with the band, went to number  29 in the International Top 30.  They had not the money at the time to push it with more promotion.   A band lives in a twilight type of world.  It is not the coming home at dawn, the travelling for a third of the day sometimes (“I have lived one- third of my life in a band wagon,” said Kenny) but the quest for that indefinable something to do with the  restlessness in the soul of man, and, on becoming aware of this  in an acute way, there is the need to assert a body, to hurl defiance at the gods.   Oh, sure, bands liked the money and wanted   to get into the big time, but any “head” I ever knew had the restlessness in him that even his most intimate conversations did not define.    The bandsmen  were  the seekers in a strange land, the men and women of the austere night, who came alive for two hours on a stage,  and then , like Dracula, went back into their lair (wagon) just before dawn.   There was many the husband   who saw his children going out to school in the mornings, and he is just too weary to even say   good luck to them.   The business has always been very competitive, and bands were really at war with one another, I  gathered.  Only a few ever made it to the top. It was always desirable that a band would have a Dublin management with all the contacts.  Contacts, I often felt, seemed  to be even more important than talent. And sure, isn’t  that true of every walk of life ?   “You will get a lot of lies in showbusiness,” declared Kenny once.   But there are some nice people in the business.  On one occasion when the Kenny Ryder band had a wagon breakdown near Urlingford (15 miles from Thurles) a top band who commanded  the respect of all heads, pulled in and gave a lift to the entire band to Thurles, the base of the Ryder Band.   And talking about band- wagons, it was customary to meet other bands at all hours of the day and night on the road.  We always seemed to be waving to Maurice Mulcahy band.   I have never known a bandsman whom I could imagine behind a desk, doing a 9 to 5 job. I could imagine them dying at the desk , though.   And that is a tragedy in itself. For any “head” will tell you that the lifespan of a bandsman, like a professional footballer, is only about ten years.    When one considers the show-biz longevity of Brendan Bowyer and Dickie Rock among others, it is truly remarkable from  every vantage point - luck, talent, experience, management, physical and mental strength - that they have survived for so long.   I have related that bands are travelling people and, indeed, my brother, Seanie, the drummer of the family, who, in his early teens practised by drumming on  jam jars and tin cans,  is still travelling all these years later, but this time from one American State to another from his new home in Texas.   If there is one thing a “head” thinks about even more than Big Apple and sensational success, it is probably what the meal is like in the hall the band is playing on the night of the gig.   God bless counties like Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Roscommon and a few others, but they always had a decent meal for us.  But there was at least one which was making  a great  profit, and  which would begrudge you a cup of tea.   I was amazed at the high cost of putting the show on the road.  The  expenses: light- show, P.A system, petrol, meals, wages, publicity,  recording expenses, rehearsal rooms, driver, and roadie, just for starters.   Kerry, Cork and the West of Ireland were great for the bands in those days, and particularly the Premier Hall, in Thurles, under the management of the late Sean Fitzgibbon, a man who was very decent indeed to the men of music and to this Pressman.   That was where the openings were, though Dublin was good for publicity . But the big money was in lucrative dates down the country. And you would see all the  showband  stars down country. Now let me dispel some   myths about bands. A band’s life can be  glamorous, sure.  But the truth is that most musicians had one thought at the end of the show - to get home for a well-earned rest before heading off to the next gig.   In our years travelling with the six-piece  Kenny Ryder Superband, which had a great brass section, the brother and I and various other musicians, were snow-bound in Wicklow; watched the soccer World Cup in God knows how many towns around Ireland.    And I really did see Ireland. We made many friends – punters and promoters - and, indeed, other bands. And we saw life from the twilight  zone.   And, now and again I have to admit, as I do my journalistic  stint, a strange gnawing, restless feeling comes over me,  and the itch   to get  into the bandwagon again.   And I wonder how roadies today are mixing the sound in some far-off town in the hills of Donegal or in the vicinity of the  Dingle Peninsula…  And I wonder will they get a crowd tonight, a long way from Tipperary and the Watery Mall.

In partnership with the Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce, Off the Grid Brewing Company hosted the event featuring about a dozen local and regional micro breweries, and surpassed the goal of 500 attendees. “The turnout has been amazing. Even more than we expected,” said Sabrina Schneider, representing Off the Grid, a brewery on John Glenn Road in Apple Valley. “Live music, games — giant Jenga has been a big hit. But of course, most important is the beer. So many people don’t drink craft beer and don’t support local breweries … We really want to expand the craft community.” Schneider said part of doing that means fighting against the misconceptions about brewfests. “It’s not a rager,” she said. “All people are doing is actually enjoying the flavor of the beer.” One of the most exciting new beers on tap Saturday was Off the Grid’s Hoppy Trails Apple Lager. Along the other booths were a variety of flavorful IPAs and crisp Wits, from the Redlands Hangar 24’s new blonde ale to the Wrightwood Brewing Company’s introduction of their apricot IPA. The handful of local breweries all help each other out, as several owners noted. “It’s a family thing,” Wrightwood Brewing Company owner Todd Grijalva said. “Once we had it in the works to open (nine months ago), the other local breweries were extremely helpful with tips and advice.” Sarah Waters, representing Desert Barn Brewery, noted that it was exciting for everyone involved to see the success of the Summer Hops event. “We haven’t had a brewfest of this magnitude in the High Desert before,” said Sarah Waters, representing Desert Barn Brewery. “We’ve seen a lot of regulars which is nice, but also some people who have never been to any of the breweries, so it’s definitely given us some exposure.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at clindsey@vvdailypress.com or 760-951-6245.

The Fire 7 comes with Amazons Alexa voice assistant ... more Photo: Amazon Amazon’s no-frills Kindle Fire is more a toy than a tool 1 / 1 Back to Gallery What can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix. Yet that is what Amazon has delivered with its Kindle Fire tablets, with starting prices of $50 for the 7-inch model and $80 for the 8-incher. The newest versions of these tablets, which are set to be released this week, are unabashedly slow and unflashy — but just capable enough to be worth this meager sum. This low-cost-for-no-frills strategy appears to be working well for the retail giant. Sales of Amazon’s touch-screen tablets jumped by double digits last year from a year earlier, the company has said. IDC, the research firm, said low-cost Kindle Fires had propelled Amazon to No. 3 in the tablet market, after Apple and Samsung. Amazon’s tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649. After testing Amazon’s Kindle Fire 7 and Kindle Fire HD 8 for a week, here’s my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you’re an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad. Here’s what you need to know about what you get — and what you don’t — from a $50 Amazon tablet. Business Channel The good stuff The best thing about the new Kindle tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the 7-inch and 8-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Kindle Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands. The Kindle Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about 8 hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about 4 1/2 hours of video before its battery drained. That’s modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the 8-incher has a battery life of 12 hours. While the Kindle Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn’t use a Kindle Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages. For internet speeds, the Kindle Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple’s $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Kindle Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Kindle Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books. And the bad The worst part of the Kindle Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter. The sluggishness also makes the Kindle Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don’t buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics. Another major component lacking from Amazon’s tablets is access to Google’s official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google’s Android that instead showcases Amazon’s App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon’s app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing — namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords. Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Kindle Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn’t a problem. But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Kindle Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.) Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the 7-incher or $80 for the 8-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls “special offers.” What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens. With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes. But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child’s hands off your fancy iPad.    Catch every San Antonio area moment! Click to like mySA on Facebook.

PHOTO: REUTERS Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday warned graduates at MIT, a pioneer in fields like computers and robots, about technology’s dehumanising aspects and urged them to infuse its development with their own values. “I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans,” Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence.” Apple opens store in Southeast Asia Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT’s Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge. “Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn’t want to do great things. It doesn’t want anything,” the Apple chief executive said. “That part takes all of us.” Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world’s most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Cook has criticised President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president’s expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 am,” Cook said. His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Apple says payouts from App Store total $70bn Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely.” Read more: Apple CEO , Tech , Tim Cook Read full story Recommended Stories Apple opens store in Southeast Asia Apple opened its first store in Singapore on Saturday Apple Music sets August 8 as new release date for 'Carpool Karaoke' The series for Apple Music is an adaptation of a popular segment of "The Late Late Show with James Corden" Apple says payouts from App Store total $70bn Customers are downloading our apps in record numbers, says Apple's senior vice president of marketing Schiller Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

The creator of Android explains how his new phone can take on Apple and Samsung Steve Kovach Business Insider June 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Andy Rubin at wired business conferenceMore (Andy Rubin at the Wired Business Conference with the new Essential Phone.Getty Images for Wired) Andy Rubin is best known as the guy who created Android, sold it to Google, and nurtured it into the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet. But Rubin left Google back in 2014, and now he's on his own. His latest gig is Essential, a startup he runs as CEO that's trying to become a new kind of gadgets company. It starts with a phone, called the Essential PH-1, and the plan is to expand into smart appliances and cars from there. Rubin spoke Wednesday at the Wired Business Conference in New York and shed a bit more light on Essential's plans. After the Essential Phone launches this summer, the company plans to release Home, a voice-controlled hub for all the connected appliances in your house. Rubin claims Home will be compatible with the wide variety of smart home platforms, ranging from Apple's HomeKit to Samsung's SmartThings, even though it'd take a wild level of technical wizardy to pull it off. Many are skeptical he can pull it off. He calls this new platform Ambient OS. Beyond that, Rubin teased that he'd like Essential to tackle the car, which is increasingly coming into focus as an area of growth for tech companies. And questions remain how the Essential Phone, which costs $699, can find success in a market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Business Insider and some other members of the press spoke with Rubin following his Wired talk. Below is a transcript of that conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity. (I've labeled each journalist's question as just "Question" since so many people were in the room asking questions. I put my name on the questions I asked.) Q&A with Andy Rubin, CEO of Essential Steve Kovach: I want to talk more about Ambient OS. You were talking a lot about how you’re really confident you’re going to be able to stitch all these various platforms together. Andy Rubin: I didn’t say I was confident. I’m definitely going for it. Kovach: If I’m understanding it correctly, especially with Apple, it’s actually impossible. What they allow people to build into now doesn’t allow what you want to do. Does this thing fall apart if they say no to you? Rubin: You have to understand this approach. There’s a client and a server. And what Apple has with HomeKit is a bunch of individual consumer electronics companies enabling HomeKit with their products. I don’t know what the percentages are, but they don’t all only speak HomeKit. They speak a whole lot of other stuff as well. And what Apple is trying to do is trying to be the screen that drives these things. And that’s excluding anybody in "Android Land" or Windows from driving those things. So the natural effect will be for those companies to support other products as well, and they’re the ones that are plugging into Apple’s APIs. So the trick that I talked about on stage is: I can produce the same APIs. And I can call it Essential Kit. And those same exact APIs that someone has already developed for their Sonos thing or whatever this point product is, I’m compatible with. Kovach: But isn’t that just another product like Samsung's SmartThings? Rubin: No, no, no, no. You know what this is? This is [like] Windows emulation [on a Mac]. This is Windows emulation for IoT. APIs for all these people who are building these islands. And if I emulate eight things and turn it on, I control 100,000 devices. Kovach: And have you been able to do that yet in testing? Rubin: I haven’t launched a product. I’m teasing a product, but it’s going to be awesome. These are all forward-looking statements. Question: How far in advance are you teasing? View photos essential home hubMore (A rendering of what Essential Home will look like.Essential) Rubin: We have round LCDs — big ones. What’s after that is basically everything that’s in a smartphone. Right? There’s a bunch of cool things about starting a company today. I have a system in my lobby where I can print badges for people. There’s some startup company whose job it is to do lobby registration now. And when I used to start companies, those guys didn’t exist. But the other thing that happened, obviously, is smartphones have driven the supply base, based on the volume of the component tree of smartphones. And you’ll find those things going into a lot of products like these home assistant products. So it’s kind of a new era as far as leveraging the economies of scale of smartphones into these other products. Read More Question: So Essential Home is a touch interface. Is it also a microphone? Rubin: Yeah it has far-field speech recognition. It has an array of microphones.  Question: Is there any plan to add video chat to something like that? Rubin: Really good question. So once you do this job of bridging these islands, you kind of rise above all these other UIs, and you become a kind of holistic UI for every other product that might be in your life. So if you think of it purely from a UI perspective: Who is your UI developer? I actually thing developing for smartphones is too difficult. It’s almost like you have to go to school to learn how to be an iOS developer or learn how to be an Android developer. The good ones have four or five years of experience, and the industry is not that old. So the reason we created a new OS is to basically solve the UI problem and redefine the definition of who a developer is. I want the guy who owns the home to be a developer, in some regard. I can tell you today, there’s a $13 billion industry of Crestron or AMX or Control 4, and they’re drilling holes in your wall and installing screens in your home. That’s an outdated approach. But the guys that are doing the UIs for those are the same guys that are drilling the holes in your wall. There’s this whole installer thing with these high-end homes which is not a mass-market consumer value proposition. So I need to change who the installer is. And I think we’ve built enough technology for a consumer to kind of do a drag and drop. Question: There’s this argument that’s been out there that innovation in smartphones has peaked, that they’ve already gotten so good and can do so many things. Where do you see things going? Where does it go from here? View photos essential ph-1 colorsMore (The Essential Phone.Essential) Rubin: When there’s this duopoly with these two guys owning 40% of the market, this complacency sets in where people are like, “Oh what they’re building is good enough. I’ll just go to them.” And that’s the perfect time to start a company like this, when people are complacent and it needs to be disrupted. And the real answer is you guys and the consumers need to tell me if there’s enough new innovation in [the Essential Phone]. I think the 360 camera and the magnetic accessory bus is a pretty good example of the innovation we’re thinking about. And there’s gonna be a string of those things. Let me broadly position this: In the era where smartphones were new and everyone was upgrading from their feature phone to their smartphone for the first time, the product cycle was every six months. There’d be some new thing coming out, everyone’s excited, there was a bubble kind of feeling that you were involved in something completely new and exciting. And then once everybody who wanted a smartphone got one, we’re in a saturated market — at least in the first world. In saturated markets, the upgrade cycle is every 24 months. And the problem with the 24-month cycle, which happens to snap to the carriers’ [ownership] of the consumer, is the consumer doesn’t get to see the innovation. It’s still happening in the background, but it happens every 24 months in these very lumpy onstage announcements. I think there’s a way, and the reason we built this magnetic connector to continuously produce innovation and show it to the consumer happening in real time. It’s almost like software updates for hardware. View photos Andy Rubin at wired business conferenceMore (Rubin and his Essential Phone.Getty Images for Wired) Question: Explain how the Essential Phone is different from a modular phone. From the consumer point of view, it’s, “I’m getting this phone and I can snap a camera on and I can snap on a better battery.” Does it matter if it’s magnetic or not? Rubin: That’s a good question. It’s two things. It’s kind of the core to the way we designed this from a product design perspective. The first one is what’s “modular.” [Google] Ara was the definition of modular, which is you can remove a core component of the phone, like its processor, and replace it with a faster one. We’re not doing that. You buy a phone, the phone works great as a phone. We’re adding stuff onto it. So that’s why I prefer accessory bus as an example. So that’s modular versus accessory. Now, connectors, in my view, are dumb because they get outdated. So a wireless connector is the holy grail. We’re close to that. We transmit power between two pins and everything else is wireless. Actually, the technology we’re using is wireless USB 3.0. So it’s 10 gigabits a second of USB, and we’ve built these transceivers that do that. The benefit of having a connectorless connector is I don’t suffer from what Moto Mod suffered from, which is every phone they come out with in the future has to have that 33-pin connector in exactly the same location so all the accessories you’ve invested in as a consumer still work. So they’ve painted themselves in the corner. They can never change the industrial design of their next phone because it has to match all these accessories. Or they have to trick the consumer into throwing away all their accessories and getting the new one that fits this new thing. A completely wireless thing means I can come out with a phone that’s invisible. And as long as it has this magnetic area on it I can use this legacy of accessories that I’ve purchased. Again, this is a pro-consumer brand. It’s not easy to articulate. We’re trying to do right by the consumer where they don’t have to throw away their stuff every time there’s a connector change. Or get some weird dongle. True story, I went and bought one of those beautiful new MacBooks with the OLED TouchBar. And that’s when they changed to the USB-C thing. And in the IT department in my company I needed to plug in to the Ethernet to get the certificate for the new laptop, and I went to the Apple store and I said, “Do you have a USB-C to ethernet dongle?” And they said, “Oh no we don’t have that yet.” So I had to buy a USB-C to Thunderbolt dongle, and a Thunderbolt to Ethernet dongle. So I had two dongles plugged into each other. And that’s the point where I’m just not feeling too good about being a consumer of those products. Question: Based on the conversations you had today and at the Code Conference, Essential is much more than just a phone company. How do you find that your brand is going to track these consumers? Rubin: It’s anti-walled garden. We chose Android because that’s a big component of that. We have a team of engineers, a lot of them, doing the job of other people to make our products work with theirs. These other companies, especially the walled gardens, they’re sitting here with their ecosystem and they expect people to come to them. And they get to be the toll gate guys and say “yes” or “no.” So we’re actively going out and making our products work with other people’s products because we know that’s how our consumers want to live. Kovach: You spoke a lot on stage today about home and the car as major new platforms, but you didn't mention AR. Rubin: There’s baby steps into AR, and then there’s all-in. Scoble’s all-in is the shower picture… so the glasses might come later. Cellphones have had augmented reality for a long time… What the real question is: 'What is the end product?' What is the developer going to build with augmented reality? And so far I’ve seen interactive media… movies and game-like movies, where you’re both a participant and a viewer, which I think is a little too mixed reality for me. There’s a lean back where you’re a consumer of this stuff and it happens, or you’re a participant like a game. The mixed part of it hasn’t been proven yet. I think when consumers are ready to wear things, whether it’s a motorcycle helmet that overlays a map… or if it’s some goggles that they’ll use for a board game… in the end for these big things I think… One of the problems is the price. It’s just crazy. It’s not ready for prime time. There will be a day where you might have a head mounted display and it costs $199, and you just plug it into your cellphone. And it won’t be 'I’m wearing this 24 hours a day.' It’ll be, 'It’s time to sit down and play Monopoly with the family or something.' It actually might be more social than what you would do with VR. Question: Is that why you started the 360 camera? Because it’s a taste of that? Rubin: This is all speculation, but I’m hoping there’s going to be a format change in the future. I think I can kind of move the needle a little bit in that format change by taking the world’s largest mass-market product and adding something onto it, rather than trying to create something completely new. So it’s more of a slipstream approach.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 11 June 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Apple product updates you missed at the WWDC Apple demonstrates the new Macintosh operating system macOS High Sierra at the WWDC 2017 developers conference in San Jose. — dpa Most of the excitement after Apple's WWDC summit came from the launch of the HomePod, a louder, fatter and pricier version of smart speakers already on the market.  But the Cupertino-based company is doing far more than just copying Amazon and Google hardware, as an overview of developments announced at the conference shows. Apple watch powered by Siri Just like Google does at its events, Apple sought to use its developer conference to highlight the leaps it has made in artificial intelligence and autonomous learning. Among the products to profit from better AI is the Apple Watch, which is getting more proactive with the information it displays thanks to a new Siri-powered watch face. Siri is also being upgraded with natural language to help it adjust to the individual user. At the same time the data will be secured and can only be called up by the devices used by a particular user, Apple executive Craig Federighi said. VR and better hardware for the iMac For the first time, Apple's iMac computer is being made compatible with virtual reality. Hollywood special effects studio ILM demonstrated how a user wearing special glasses can dive into a VR scene from the Star Wars universe on an iMac desktop. At the same time, Apple has updated the entire range of MacBook notebooks and iMacs with more rapid Intel processors and improved graphics. For those users demanding particularly high-performance computer - video professionals for example – there will be an iMac Pro at the end of the year, said to be "the fastest Mac to date." The company has recently faced criticism that it has neglected professional users, as the model aimed at this market segment – the Computer Mac Pro – has not been updated since 2013. Make payments to Apple users on a new iPad Pro For the iPad tablet there will be a new Pro model with a 10.5in screen, up from the current 9.7in. The iPad version of the iOS mobile system will be upgraded with a number of new functions, for example easy moving of contents and files between apps using drag-and-drop. Text written by hand with the Apple Pencil will be searchable, using machine learning for the user's handwriting. The notes app will get a scanner for documents that can then be changed using the pencil. Meanwhile the iOS photo app is also being improved with new effects backed up by learning capacity. And, as expected, Amazon's video streaming service will be on the Apple TV digital media player. Apple says it will begin setting up obstacles to the online advertizing sector in two ways: Apple's web browser can block the automatic launch of videos, and tracking can be blocked when the user gets the feeling that an advert on a particular theme is following them to all websites. Finally, Apple users can soon delete the PayPal app from their iOS. Apple Pay will enable payments between users, effectively challenging PayPal and other competitors. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Stepping to a great future Breath of fresh air: 4 ways to improve air quality at home 10 last-minute IKEA styling tips for Raya Reasons why mums are our heroes 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Slow down and enjoy the ride Hotel operators: Tourism tax model unfair Move to provide houses for middle-income group in Kuala Pahang advertisement Latest News Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Moto G5 Plus: The G force Most Viewed in Tech E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer Moto G5 Plus: The G force Android 7 Nougat for just US$100: Lenovo's new Moto C smartphone OnePlus 5 launches June 20, pop-up events in several cities Sweden beckons for investors seeking to bet on next Candy Crush Facebook’s Detroit status: Feeling determined to build auto ties Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. WWDC 2017 didn't just see a new Podcast app for iOS 11 — it saw new feed options and analytics for podcasters! Apple ended WWDC with a sneak preview of what's coming next for podcasters, and it was a good one. There's not only a new Podcast app on the way as part of iOS 11, but new options for episodes and seasons (!) for podcast feeds, and all-new analytics for podcasters. What's new in the Podcasts app? Apple's Podcast app, built into iOS for the last couple of years, is how most mainstream users browse, find, download, and listen to shows. It's getting a new design for iOS 11 and one that looks to be the biggest ever. It starts out with the new design language from iOS 11, but doesn't stop there. All the tabs have changed, haven't they? They have! But for the better! There's Listen Now, which is your new home base for anything you've started streaming, downloaded for later, or subscribed to regularly. Podcasts seems to understand that you might be doing any one of those things, and sometimes juggling between them, at any given time. So, along with big episode titles and cover art, there's a prominent progress bar and time remaining indicator. That makes it super easy to resume any show you've already started. The Music-style now playing bar, which pops up to the now playing card, also makes it easy to see what's current cued up. Can you still see your own library of shows, old school style? Sure can. There's a Library tab that lets you quickly get to Shows, Episodes, Downloaded, and any stations you've created, like Drive Time. You can also see Recently Updated shows. How do you find new shows to listen to? There's a Browse tab for that. In it, you can find all the usual featured and recommended shows as well as the top charts if that's your thing. A Search tab is also there, if you know what you're looking for and just want to find it. You can choose to search for all shows in the Apple Podcasts library or just the shows you've downloaded or subscribed to. What about machine learning? And seeing what your friends are listening too? Apple Music got a bunch of updates in iOS 11 geared towards providing you with better recommendations based on machine learning, but also what your friends are listening to. Apple Podcasts doesn't seem to have those feature sets but, since Podcasts has historically followed Music's lead, it's hard to imagine them not coming at some point down the road. Any sign of a Podcasts app for Mac? I wish! Apple Podcasts is still part of iTunes for Mac. What's new in the Apple Podcast feed specification? Apple's podcasts update this year isn't just client-side deep. The company is adding features at the feed level as well. Better still, Apple is also making these new features open so that other podcast apps can also add them and benefit from them. Hopefully, that'll increase adoption, even beyond the Apple ecosystem. What are the major changes to Apple's podcast feed spec? Seasons. Most podcasts started off being entirely episodic, much like blogs. They were based on news and current events and so, when you subscribed to them, it was only logical they'd give you the latest episode first. Podcasts have grown a lot over the years, though, and now many also come to resemble TV shows with seasons, meant to be listened to from the beginning. So, Apple is introducing a few new tags to the podcast spec to make those easier to handle. Tag: Episode number Tag: Season number (collects episode, precedent to latest season). Tag: Summary (describes episode in plane text.)— Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) June 9, 2017 What can you do for seasonal shows in the Apple podcast spec? You can now tag shows as either episodic or seasonal, and declare whether they should be downloaded in traditional reverse-chronological order or in season-respecting chronological order. So, where you'd previously subscribe and get the latest episode, now you'll be able to subscribe and get the first episode of the current season, for example. Podcasts can also have both episode and season number tagged. That way, clients like Apple Podcasts will also be able to offer full season downloads, if that's what you want. Are there new episode types as well? There are! Podcasts have also evolved to contain a wider variety of content. Sometimes new shows, or new seasons of existing shows, will upload a brief teaser about what's coming and what you can expect. Some shows also upload extras, like after dark or extended content. Now, when you upload, you can tag not just regular episodes but trailers and bonus episodes as well. That should let clients better sort and present content, so you can better tell what you're downloading or what you're about to play. What's Apple Podcasts Analytics? The biggest surprise at the Apple Podcasts session was the announcement of Podcast Analytics. Similar to App Store analytics, this will let anyone with an Apple Podcasts login see how their shows are doing — and a surprisingly deep level. How much does Apple Podcasts Analytics cover? Since it was just a sneak preview, there's still a ton of stuff we don't know about podcast analytics. Obviously, though, is that it can only source data from people who listen to podcasts through the built-in Podcasts.app on iOS, and iTunes on Mac and Windows. So, if your audience primarily listens through Overcast, Pocket Casts, Castro, or another App Store app, they'll be invisible to Apple Podcasts Analytics. What can Apple Podcasts Analytics show you? Some pretty cool stuff. In addition to the usual metrics, you can see precisely when listeners drop off during any particular episode. For example, when they skip an add or when they just stop because of a subject or presenter they don't like. Podcast analytics, yeah! pic.twitter.com/E0E9DT9McO— Emmanuel (@emmanuelvq) June 9, 2017 Wait, does that mean you'll be able to see which hosts should renegotiate their deals?! Maybe! Data is one thing. Analyzing it is something else entirely. If advertisers can see ads being skipped, will that jeopardize sponsorships? Hopefully not. Smart advertisers and the ones playing the long game focus on brand awareness. They know the likelihood of someone needing their product or service at the exact moment they hear an ad for it is purely coincidental. Much more likely is needing something and then remembering that you heard about it in a podcast. Repeatedly. If anything, fingers crossed it helps increase brand advertising in podcasts.

Kommt dieses Jahr noch. #WWDC17 pic.twitter.com/toMd6PepdL— Dennis Morhardt (@gglnx) June 9, 2017 What about privacy? Is Apple really tracking my podcasts? No. Apple's gotten really good at anonymizing user data over the years. Your Apple ID is never associated with Podcasts Analytics and you can reset the data at any time. When will Apple launch Podcasts Analytics? Later this year. Apple is in feedback mode right now so, if you're a podcaster, let the company know what you think! Where can you get more information?

After you've heard the same ad read for Casper or Linode or Audible or Squarespace for the thousandth time, you skip them. You just can't listen to them again. Also, when my podcast queue is getting too large, I end up deleting a lot of unlistened to episodes. Everyone does, I'm sure. Podcaster advertising rates are going to plummet, which means podcaster revenue will tank and podcaster listeners will find their favourite shows starting to disappear. 0 21 hours ago Reply delta4s Any changes to the play screen? What I mean is the scrubber bar and the current play marker is larger than a few pixels? The scrubber bar currently is pathetic. 0 21 hours ago Reply mavsguy842 Analytics will be great for the podcaster. They'll be able to experiment with format, try new segments etc and see if they're truly valued additions to the podcast, or if something they do only has a niche audience but causes everyone else to drop off. For example, a comedian whose podcast I listen to (Ari Shaffir) insists on doing plugs for his shows/Twitter, and those of his guests at the beginning of each episode. Most other podcasts (like iMore, Android Central etc.) do them at the end of the episode, when I assume a good proportion of listeners stop listening because they know there's no actual content remaining. Analytics should be able to show them if their current approach is working or not. 0 18 hours ago Reply basboyblair So I like to listen to my podcasts at 1.25 - 1.50 speed.

(Heritage Auctions' website/File) Texas-based auction house Heritage Auctions is offering rare Apple sneakers at its Beverly Hills premises with a bidding price starting from US$15,000 on Sunday. The shoes were said to have been created in the early 1990s by the tech giant Apple Inc. On the website, Heritage Auctions mentions that the US size 9.5 shoes were produced by Apple exclusively for its employees in the early 1990s. The sneakers are forecast to go for over $30,000 in the auction.

(Image: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) There is no stopping the Apple iPhone 8 rumours as another leaked preview of the upcoming Apple flagship smartphone is doing the rounds on the internet. This time, leaks suggest that the Apple iPhone 8 will come with a Vertical Dual-Camera setup, Facial and Iris Biometric Scan, and a Touch ID under the iPhone 8 display. The renders leaked by a website also show the iOS 11 being run on the iPhone 8 and as per the website, is nearly the exact match of the iPhone 8 set to release in the coming months. iPhone 8 may also support Wireless Charging as the schematics of the phone show a large ‘pad’ on the inside. The Dual–Camera Setup is also said to come with AR features, which the vertical setup will help in. iPhone 8 with iOS 11 render images.

The most recent ones though suggest a Touch ID technology built into the front facing glass. There are speculations about a sensor bar placed in the front, carrying a dual front camera, light sensor, proximity sensor and earpiece. The leaked images of the exterior design of the iPhone 8 still leave us wondering about the final product. Apart from the stainless steel trimmed edges, the colour options of the iPhone 8 may include that of its predecessor – a Jet Black iPhone 8. Rumours are high on what could probably be the smartphone of 2017.

The upcoming meetings are described as “tech week,” by sources familiar with the White House.

Other firms invited were Adobe, Akamai and Qualcomm, which is in a legal battle with Apple. Trump transition team adviser Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, will also attend the meetings. The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower. At that time Trump praised the tech sector, promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry and even told executives to call him or his people directly if they needed anything. The affection didn’t last long. Tech leaders expressed their outrage after Trump introduced his travel ban in January.

But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the one gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 per cent to US$152.56 (RM650.29) in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top US wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of one gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers — and the same technique to mask performance disparities — for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about one gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks — a year after Samsung Electronics Co. added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 per cent of Apple’s US$216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 per cent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving one gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Luring customers The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first one gigabit data service available in the US this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started one gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of one gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of one gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three one gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week E3 2017: Nintendo’s showcase — how to watch, what to expect Marissa Mayer fades out as Yahoo ends its run Microsoft challenges Sony with powerful new Xbox One X SGSecure app downloaded more than 550,000 times New iPhone said lacking tech to match rivals’ data speed (VIDEO) Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by summer’s end Cracked screen woes?

And unless it’s a newer model with recent software updates, your security could be at risk. Two competing operating systems own the real estate in our smart phones: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Apple’s phones are expensive — the cheapest model starts at $400, while some Android phones cost less than $50. Android users are more likely to have fragmented security updates than Apple’s streamlined ones. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The closed system Apple has built means that everyone who has an iOS device gets access to the same software and security updates at about the same time. Android, though, is much more fragmented. Mary Madden, a researcher with Data & Society, says low income people are more reliant on their phones as the primary form of Internet access. This is how they pay bills, connect with friends and family, and access education and work opportunities. “All of these differences in digital security are important because they can result in disproportionate levels of surveillance such as law enforcement monitoring during protests or a greater likelihood that low-income smartphone users will experience malware attacks,” Madden told CNNTech. More malware is written for Androids than iPhones. On top of that, almost half of the top 50 Android devices didn't have the most recent security updates by the end of 2016, according to Google. Even if your phone is only a year or two out of date, it’s vulnerable to some very simple hacks, says Nathan Freitas, a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. “It doesn’t take much for your adversary to get into your [Android] device, and that's a big problem.” When Google releases an update to Android, it takes a while to get to consumers, unless you have a Google-branded phone like the Pixel. Carriers and device makers customize Android with different apps and services, and there are at least 11 different versions of Android. Each customized version has to be updated separately by the carrier or device maker before rolling out to consumers. Google, for its part, is constantly working to improve device security. Recently, it introduced Google Play Protect, which monitors Android devices and alerts you if there are security risks. And its line of inexpensive laptops — Chromebooks — are regarded by experts as some of the most secure computers you can buy. Last year, the FCC and FTC launched an inquiry into mobile security updates, and asked mobile carriers and device manufacturers to explain the process of releasing security updates. The results have not been released, however the FCC told CNN Tech that they have received responses and are reviewing results. Android is slightly more popular in the United States than iOS, with 53 percent of smart phone users on Google’s operating system, compared with 45 percent on Apple. Globally, Android is significantly more popular — almost 90 percent of phones shipped in the third quarter of 2016 ran Android. But the demographics break out even further: College-educated people tend to buy iPhones over Androids; Androids are more popular with low-income Americans; and African-Americans are more likely to have an Android than an iPhone. This gap between the security haves and have nots is often called the “digital security divide,” which researcher Chris Soghoian described in a 2016 Ted Talk. And the security differences between Android and iOS are also a problem for developers. People who build apps — especially those with secure functionality — have to build multiple versions for Android and potentially decide not to support outdated phones. Beyond security updates, there are other differences between the brands, such as Apple’s default messenger is iMessage, which is encrypted when you chat with other iOS users. Texting on Android isn’t encrypted by default, and full-disk encryption isn’t mandatory on all Android phones.

The attorney general, George Brandis, says existing laws do not go far enough in imposing obligations of cooperation on internet giants such as Facebook and Google, and on device makers such as Apple, to assist authorities who want to break the communications of terrorists using their systems. “In the first instance, the best way to approach this is to solicit the cooperation of companies like Apple and Facebook and Google and so on,” Brandis told Sky News on Sunday. 'Handing victory to terrorists': lawyers warn over denial of bail and parole Read more “And I think there’s been a change of the culture in the last year or more. There is a much greater conscious proactive willingness on the part of the companies to be cooperative. “But we need the legal sanction as well.” Last week Malcolm Turnbull announced a special meeting of state and territory leaders to “comprehensively review” Australia’s laws and practices that are directed at protecting citizens from violent extremism. He made the announcement just days after an attack in Melbourne’s suburb of Brighton in which a woman was taken hostage, and three police officers shot, before gunman Yacqub Khayre was killed. Khayre had previously been in prison for a violent offence but was out on parole. When he committed the attack, he said he was acting for Islamic State and al-Qaida. Turnbull said the law would now be strengthened to create a presumption against bail and parole for people who have demonstrated support for or have links to terrorist activity. He said the reform was “a vital element in keeping these people who are a threat to our safety and our safety of our families, off the streets”. On Sunday, Brandis said he was “astonished” that Khayre was paroled. “This man’s terrorism antecedents were a publicly known fact,” he said. “Although he had been acquitted for his involvement in a conspiracy to mount a terrorist attack on the Holsworthy army barracks in 2009, at his trial he had openly admitted to training with al-Shabaab in Africa for six weeks with the intention of returning to Australia to perpetrate terrorist violence. “That was a publicly known fact. So why that was not something that the parole board in Victoria was aware of, I don’t know.” Brandis said deradicalisation programs were successful “up to a point”, and online radicalisation was a “very difficult” problem. He said online radicalisation involved constant monitoring of the internet. Presumption will be against bail and parole for those with terrorist links, Coag agrees Read more “That particularly requires proactivity by [social media companies] to take down radical messaging,” he said. He said there will be a Five Eyes meeting in Ottawa, Canada, in a fortnight’s time, and Australia will discuss the need for internet and tech companies to better assist authorities break the online communications of terrorists. When asked if, under the changes he is proposing, intelligence agencies would be able to access the encrypted online communications they desire without needing a warrant, he said: “Well that’s a discussion that we need to have.” The Labor frontbencher Ed Husic said people had to think differently about a whole range of things that keep people safer. “It’s striking balance,” he told Sky News. “I think the public is willing, more open to the notion that if we have to sacrifice some of our liberties to protect ourselves, we are willing to do it.” But Greens MP Adam Bandt said he was unhappy that government was seeking to take away liberties, and give itself more power, with every threat of terror. “The idea that somehow, by treating everyone as a suspect and saying that no longer are you able to have secure communications with someone else, no longer can you talk confidentially, that everything is potentially going to be open to the government is, again, very, very worrying,” he told the ABC.

The sauce has a sweet flavor from the apples with a bit of spicy finish from the cayenne pepper. For ribs, apply a thin layer of the sauce just before you’re ready to take the meat off the grill or smoker; close the lid. Leave the ribs only long enough for the sauce to dry. The rib recipe in “Praise the Lard” is 21/2pages long, but is extremely descriptive. One good tip for cooking the ribs is to put some apple juice in a spray bottle and mist the ribs every so often. 3/4 cup ketchup (preferably made with cane sugar, such as Red Gold or Hunt’s) 2/3 cup rice vinegar 1 1/2 cups apple cider 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/3 cup bacon bits (real, not imitation), ground in a spice mill 1/3 cup grated peeled apple 1/3 cup grated onion 2 teaspoons grated green pepper 2-3 slabs smoked baby back ribs cooked low and slow In a large saucepan, combine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple cider, cider vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, granulated garlic, white pepper, cayenne and bacon bits. Bring to a boil, stir in the apple, onion and green pepper, then lower the heat. Simmer the sauce, stirring often, for 10 to 15 minutes, until it thickens slightly. Pour into a jar, cover and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for at least a month. Warm or bring to room temperature before serving. Variation: To make this sauce a little hotter, add more cayenne pepper to taste, an additional 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon. Be careful: A little goes a long way.

But that won't be the case for Apple Inc.'s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company's most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device -- in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple's suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won't be ready for the iPhone's introduction, according to people familiar with Apple's decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent to $152.56 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm's chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it's seeking to loosen Qualcomm's grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That's why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won't enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn't public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple's decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers -- Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. --- The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that's 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year -- with the exception of iPhones. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 웹출판 :   2017-06-11 10:30   관리자 입력.편집 :   2017-06-11 10:27   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 유시민 황교익 '김무성 노룩패스' 풍자 합작 [사설] ‘현중 노사협상’ 촉구 나선 전국시도의장협의회 '46억원 배임 혐의' 유섬나 구속 이상우♥김소연 결혼식 사진 공개 6·10 기념식 간 文, '이한열 사진' 선물 받고 '광야에서' 열창 유시민 황교익 '김무성 노룩패스' 풍자 합작 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

We've been using the developer beta of macOS 10.13 for the last few days and scouring the web to uncover some of the hidden features coming down the pipe. Image: Gizmodo Tweak your photos, iOS-style Image: Screenshot In its bid to make Apple your one-stop shop for all your photo needs, Apples made sure macOS High Sierra includes all the little improvements being added to Photos in iOS 11 later this year. Specifically, that means loop and bounce effects for your Live Photos for more GIF-like images Open up Photos in macOS High Sierra, double-click on a picture and choose Edit, and you can see the new options in the menu in the lower-right corner, assuming you've taken a Live Photo in the first place. You also see the new editing features Apple has talked about. Always-on Reader mode in Safari A bunch of improvements are coming to Safari with High Sierra, including auto-play video blocking and extra privacy features to stop companies from easily tracking you across the web. One feature Apple didn't mention explicitly is a new 'always-on' mode for Reader. Reader strips out adverts and other fluff to leave just the text and key images on a page, and you can turn it on by clicking the icon on the address bar. In macOS High Sierra, you can also enable it permanently for specific sites from Safari Preferences under Websites. Flight tracking in Spotlight Image: Screenshot You've previously been able to track flights in macOS (and iOS) in a variety of ways, but with the release of High Sierra the functionality comes straight to the Spotlight search window — just type in a valid flight number to instantly pull up information about it. If the plane's in the air you can see where in the world it is, and the preview screen also shows terminal numbers, estimated and actual times for departure and arrival, and the operating airline. If the plane hasn't taken off, you can still see the planned route. Add tables in Notes If you've ever wished you could drop a table right into the Notes app on macOS, you're in luck — High Sierra makes it possible! When you're inside a particular note, choose Format then Table or click the icon on the toolbar to drop a basic two-by-two table into the text. The handles at the top of columns and end of rows let you format everything in those rows and columns at once, but otherwise formatting options are pretty thin on the ground. Also, you can now pin notes to the top of the interface, from the File menu or with a Ctrl+click. Get Siri to queue up the tunes Image: Screenshot Siri has some extra music tricks up its sleeve in macOS High Sierra. If you ask it to "play some relaxing music" or "play some party music" then it makes the appropriate choice from your iTunes library. You can also specify a particular genre, like rock or classical. Siri will also apparently improve its choices as you go, though we've only been using it for a couple of days. Record Live Photos in FaceTime That's right — you can now fill in those awkward pauses in conversation in your video chats by snapping a Live Photo. As on iOS, these images are actually mini videos, so you get a couple of seconds either side when you play them back in the Photos app on macOS. Snap a picture from the FaceTime interface and both you and the person you're talking to get a notification about the screen capture, so you can't use it for any sneaky snapping. After that, you can head to the Photos app to edit your conversation grab as normal. Share files from iCloud Drive Image: Screenshot A long-standing and hugely useful feature from services like Dropbox comes to iCloud Drive with macOS High Sierra: The ability to share files you've stored in the cloud with other users, as long as they're also signed up for Apple's iCloud service, of course. Simply right-click or Ctrl+click on a file in your iCloud Drive in Finder, then choose Share and Add People to bring up the list of sharing options. Your chosen recipient gets a link to the file on iCloud on the web, and you get various settings for access and editing rights. Hat tips to iMore, Redmond Pie, iDownloadBlog and Cult of Mac for spotting some of these features. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Everything You Need To Know About Lord Buckethead, The Spacelord Star Of The UK General Election James Whitbrook 10 Jun 2017 8:30 AM The United Kingdom has woken up after going to the polls to a shocking upset for Prime Minister Theresa May, and a hung Parliament -- an outcome where no party managed to achieve a singular majority. But if foreign audiences tuned in, they have been less perplexed by the electoral system than Lord Buckethead. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Cook didn’t just stick around campus, though. Before and after the ceremony, he checked out several spots around Boston, including the three-story Apple store on Boylston Street. Cook arrived at MIT at least a day before his June 9 speech, commending MIT students and faculty for “finding new ways to tackle the world’s biggest challenges” in a tweet on Thursday. So impressed by @MIT students & faculty who are finding new ways to tackle the world’s biggest challenges.

(Photo: Orlando Gutierrez) LIKE MANY MARRIED MEN, Norman Foster takes enormous pride in his garage. His is brand new, an immaculate structure made of German glass and polished Japanese mirror, built behind a petite 1902 palace in Madrid that has been refurbished to house the Norman Foster Foundation, an archive and research center inaugurated on June 1st, the illustrious British architect’s eighty-second birthday. The day before, itching to show the place off, Foster had some friends over. “Jony!” said Norman, greeting Jonathan Ive, the T-shirt wearing chief creative officer of Apple. The two tanned designers brought it in for a hug. Ive had just arrived, presumably from Apple’s new donut-shaped, Foster + Partners–designed headquarters in California. In short order the garage door, a two-and-a-half-ton slab of glass supported by one wheel, was pivoted open by four hired hands, sweeping past Umberto Boccioni’s Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, 1913, a Futurist man rushing in the direction of Le Corbusier’s original 1926 Voisin Lumineuse coach, which Foster acquired and had impeccably restored. The “Pavilion of Inspirations,” as it is referred to in press material, is a storehouse for memorabilia and miscellaneous Guy Stuff a dad, if he is wise, knows not to bring into the house. In the architect’s case, a large Andreas Gursky photograph of the Engadin ski marathon (Foster participates annually) and a large Robert Longo drawing of Russian fighter jets (Foster flies planes, the civilian type). Contained within a big vitrine are, among other mementos, miniature tensegrity structures and Dymaxion cars; models of Zeppelin blimps and Lionel model trains; an Olivetti typewriter; and, perhaps to tickle Ive, a first-generation iPhone. Come evening, the driveway played host to a cocktail reception. Ivorypress publisher Elena Ochoa Foster, the architect’s glamorous Spanish spouse, was parked between the front gate and the palace porch, wearing a gold Claude Lalanne collerette and oversized, squared-off glasses. She welcomed invitees with kisses and unreplicatable facial expressions. Foster had told me the choice to locate the foundation in Madrid was not determined, as many assume, by his wife’s nationality. But witnessing her cool, larger-than-life personality at the party—before wedding Foster, in 1996, she made a name for herself as a professor of psychopathology and the host of a TV show called Let’s Talk About Sex—it is hard to imagine it located anywhere else (let alone Brooklyn, which was under consideration along with Manhattan, Berlin, and London). Left: Outside the Norman Foster Foundation. (Photo: Nigel Young) Right: The Norman Foster Foundation. (Photo: Guillermo Rodríguez) Lord Foster, less comfortable with freeform conversation—he fidgeted with his white Apple Watch as we spoke—prefers to ground discussion in things. Fortunately, there were plenty of things inside the palace. A selection of Foster’s models and sketches are displayed in nine rooms across two floors, which the architect roamed, hobnobbing with esteemed guests like James Costos, the former United States Ambassador to Spain, and his partner, Michael S. Smith, the Obamas’ White House decorator; and billionaire captains of industry Alberto Cortina and Plácido Arango, companion of artist Cristina Iglesias, whose carbon-fiber canopy is suspended over the driveway. The usual accusation that architects are hopelessly complicit with power can’t be leveled against Foster: He is not some naive pawn of the powerful global elite but rather one of its members, with an estimated fortune of $220 million, according to last year’s Sunday Times Rich List. As for me, pitiful, unpedigreed freelancer—I was underdressed and underage. With a few exceptions—Ochoa and Foster’s two teenage children, and middle-aged old money like Pia Getty—the attendees were up there in years. Septuagenarian Bianca Jagger, dressed in a beige full-length coat and silver platforms, seemed spritely compared to the reclining bronze by Henry Moore next to her. By 8:30 the next morning, most of these eminences, plus legions of students, had packed the 1,700-seat Teatro Real. The foundation’s director, María Nicanor, who arrived from London’s V&A in January, kicked things off. Manuela Carmena, Madrid’s leftwing mayor, in her welcome, implored Foster to help “reduce inequality in our city.” But as the day went on, this plea for equality proved one of the few things the guru-participants—drawn from art, architecture, urbanism, academia, and the tech industry—could not care to imagine. Entitled “The Future Is Now,” the conference sought to demonstrate the foundation’s holistic, interdisciplinary approach to urgent global issues. The artists—except for Cornelia Parker, who kept it refreshingly kooky—spoke the studied managementese of consultants, discussing the “culture sector” (Olafur Eliasson) and its “very large return on investment” (Maya Lin). “First become a billionaire, then become a mayor,” advised Michael Bloomberg, who, after taking jabs at Trump, millennials, and other low-lifes, offered glowing endorsements of Elon Musk and similar visionaries. “You are one of them,” he said, gesturing to Foster, “Jeff Bezos is another one.” “The Future Is Now” conference at Teatro Real. (Photo: Orlando Gutierrez) Listening to Bloomberg and others talk, you start feeling like any apprehension about their future could not possibly be born of legitimate political or ideological difference. Instead, it’s some sort of character flaw—an indication of constitutional weakness. It took conservative historian and Ivy Leave TV pundit Niall Ferguson, part of the panel on technology, to shatter the liberal consensus. And that’s when things got bizarre. (Was I really agreeing with Henry Kissinger’s authorized biographer?) After sitting through a keynote by architect Matthias Kohler on robotic construction, a conversation between Financial Times managing editor Gillian Tett and a tight-lipped Jony Ive (“the change right now is… intoxicating”), and then a longwinded fried-eggs-versus-omelets analogy by MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, Ferguson pounced. “There’s other things to do with eggs,” he said, recalling how, the night before, Teslas chauffeuring conference participants were targeted by angry huevos-wielding cab drivers protesting Uber. The self-appointed “voice of doom,” Ferguson accused the people who work in technology of being historically ignorant, and warned of an impending backlash against their innovations by labor. “The rotten eggs have only just begun to fly!” Negroponte, giddy techno-optimist, dug in: “There is no question that twenty years from now, people will learn French by swallowing a pill.” What goes in must come out, and Foster, who in his opening keynote championed the great life-giving potential of sewage for urban agriculture, returned to fecal matters. “I was reminded that really there is a history of technology responding to crises,” he said in his closing remarks, explaining how The Great Stink of London (1858) was overcome by the construction of a new sewer system, and The Great Manure Crisis (1894) by the eventual transition from horses to automobiles. Will high-rise farms fertilized by human waste satiate growing urban populations and stave off ecological collapse? If there’s one thing optimists and pessimists can both agree on, it’s that the future is shit.  David Huber Permalink Comments diary picks must see critics' picks news video film passages slant Architecture Slant Performance artguide In Print Current Issue archives 500 words previews bookforum A & E 中文版 All rights reserved. artforum.com is a registered trademark of Artforum International Magazine, New York, NY

(Gary Reyes/ Bay Area News Group) By Seung Lee | slee@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 10, 2017 at 6:30 am | UPDATED: June 11, 2017 at 6:33 am Once again, Apple has shown up fashionably late to the party. This time it’s the party for smart home speakers. But can Apple use the same recipe it has used before to reshape and conquer a market when its key competitors are giants like Google and Amazon? “Apple is behind but the company rarely is first yet still won in music players, smartphones, and tablets,” wrote UBS analyst Steve Milunovich in a note to investors after the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference. “Apple appears to be playing defense but needed to enter this category with a twist.” Related Articles Can’t get into WWDC? AltConf provides free alternative for developers Apple’s new WWDC reveals pivot toward artificial intelligence Apple spaceship campus moves closer to completion as residents brace for more traffic With iPhone sales sagging and fans clamoring for the company’s legendary innovation, the company last week introduced HomePod, its first new product in two years. HomePod is a high-end smart home speaker that capitalizes on Apple’s success with digital music by offering acoustics that are superior to its competitors, the Amazon Echo and Google Home. It takes voice commands from Siri and can also control HomeKit-enabled accessories like smart lights, locks and thermostats. But at $349, nearly twice the price of the Echo and three times more expensive than Google’s device, HomePod will come out of the gate in December facing a price disadvantage in a fast-growing market.  Amazon Echo and Google Home already make up nearly 94 percent of the market, which has more than 35 million U.S. users, according to a May 2017 report from eMarketer. “My instinct is that HomePod is not going to reach anywhere near iPod penetration levels,” said Ken Cassar, principal analyst at Slice Intelligence. “There are too many people ambivalent about needing great sound quality and too many inexpensive options.” But the world’s most valuable publicly traded company has used the come-from-behind playbook before. The iPod and the iPhone both entered their respective markets years behind competitors. But their ease of use, elegant design and superior technology helped corner their markets. In 2006, five years after the iPod was introduced into a crowded digital media player arena, it accounted for about 75 percent of the U.S. market. With the iPhone, Apple crushed already established competitors like BlackBerry to assert itself as the most popular smartphone in the world within its first three years. Apple is still riding the coattails of the iPhone’s success a decade after its initial reveal — it is the company’s single-largest revenue generator.  But iPhone sales are sagging, adding to the pressure for a hot, new product. The Apple Watch, introduced two years ago, made up 50 percent of all wearables sales in 2016, according to the research firm Canalys. But the overall market has failed to gain traction. Analysts believe Siri, powered by artificial intelligence, is one major hurdle HomePod will have to overcome to be a success. Despite beating Amazon and Google in introducing a voice assistant in 2011, Apple has lagged behind the two competitors in improving the accuracy and breadth of questions Siri can answer. “For now, Amazon is ahead of the curve and more advanced with Alexa,” said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester Research. To avoid pitting Siri and HomePod against the smarter Alexa and Echo,  Apple introduced the HomePod as a music-first, smart speaker-second device, analysts say. Instead of immediately taking on Amazon or Google, Apple pivoted the HomePod so it’s more comparable to high-end speakers from Sonos. “That’s a shrewd move on Apple’s part,” said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber. “There’s a high chance they will fall short on smartness compared to Google Assistant and Alexa. But compared to Sonos, they are very likely to win the fight.” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with MIT Technology Review last week that he believes his company’s AI efforts are toe-to-toe with Amazon and Google. He said the perceived lag exists because Apple does not talk about its products until they are ready to ship. “We are not going to go through things we’re going to do in 2019, ’20, ’21,” said Cook in the interview. “It’s not because we don’t know that. It’s because we don’t want to talk about that.” The HomePod won’t be Apple’s first attempt at cornering the home as part of its ecosystem. The Apple TV and Mac Mini targeted the living room in the mid-2000s, but both fell woefully short of the high expectations the Cupertino tech giant always faces. Blaber believes Apple needs a foot in the connected home market — even if HomePod is not the next iPhone. “This is an important investment from Apple,” said Blaber. “They didn’t succeed with Apple TV. Now they need another pillar inside the home.”   Tags:  Amazon Apple Google iPhone Tim Cook Seung Lee Seung covers Apple and personal technology for the Bay Area News Group.

A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc. with a 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising. "If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever," said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signaled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.” Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Major Rulings But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truckmakers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager “has a keen eye to maximizing the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.” Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple -- which it’s appealing -- and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc. may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe. Top Spot Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of 1.06 billion euros. That represented more than 3 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up As Alphabet Inc. pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. Cash Pile While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance," said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. "I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance," he said. EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition "are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case "rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online" because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 percent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out U.S. companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. "We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against U.S.-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism," said Waller. "I think you’ll hear similar things" to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this.

By Denisse Moreno On 06/10/17 AT 5:47 PM Close Apple and Amazon are fierce competitors, especially now that the iPhone maker has released its own home speaker. However, the companies seem to have been putting their differences aside lately. This year, Amazon and Apple introduced changes that goes beyond their rivalry, with the most recent move announced this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Read: iOS 11 And watchOS 4: New Apple Watch And iPhone Health Features Will Help With Your Workouts The Apple logo is displayed at a store in the central business district of Sydney, April 6, 2017. Photo: Getty Images Amazon And The Apple TV Apple announced the Amazon video app will finally come to the Apple TV worldwide this year. The move makes it easier for users, since Amazon Prime subscribers previously had to use AirPlay on their device to stream video onto their Apple TV. Amazon’s Prime Video app will be available to those who own generation two, three and four of the Apple TV, Amazon said on Twitter. “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year,” Amazon tweeted. Apart from the Amazon video app, a BuzzFeed report said Amazon will also start reselling the Apple TV on its site. The online retailer stopped carrying the Apple TV and Google Chromecast devices in 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time that the company wanted its customers to be able to watch Amazon video on devices sold by Amazon. However, neither Amazon nor Apple have confirmed that this will happen. Siri and Alexa Apple and Amazon’s virtual assistants, Siri and Alexa, could work together in the future, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president of devices, suggested recently. He said the company believes there should be more openness among rival virtual assistant platforms. Limp said the online retailer is willing to work with Apple or Google to ensure Siri and Alexa are compatible. “You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X,’” he said. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns Limp's comments come after Alexa recently penetrated through the iPhone via the Amazon iOS app. iPhone and iPad users can use Alexa by tapping on the microphone icon on the right side of the search box. Alexa on the iOS app can help users with their shopping, track orders, give weather updates, play music and answer other commands. Alexa’s power is limited on iOS though, since it can only be used while the app is open. HomePod VS. Echo Devices When Apple revealed its new speaker at WWDC, it tried hard not to sell it as an Amazon Echo competitor. The HomePod is powered by Siri, but Apple didn’t mention until it was half way into the segment about the speaker. Apple’s HomePod competes with Amazon’s numerous Echo devices, including the latest ones, Echo Look and Echo Show. Amazon’s Echo speakers stream music from Prime Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and other services except Apple Music. Limp previously told Bloomberg Amazon would "love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration. Although there are some parts Apple and Amazon won’t let go of, the recent moves show we may see more cooperation between the two companies in the future.

Reports have indicated that Samsung is considering releasing its next generation Galaxy Note 8 ahead of the iPhone 8. Image Credit: Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) August release Whispers from Korea suggest that Samsung is rethinking its design schedule for the Galaxy Note 8, as it believes this will be of commercial benefit to the phablet. The Korea Herald suggests that Samsung will unveil the Galaxy Note 8 ahead of a late August release date, in a policy that it describes as being “strategically ahead of the debut of the iPhone 8 in September”. Continuing the revelations on this critical iteration of the Galaxy Note series, the Korea Herald suggests that the Galaxy Note 8 will benefit from a dual-lens camera located on the rear of the device. This will continue the photographic battle with Samsung’s great rival Apple, with the Californian corporation expected to include similar camera provisions in the iPhone 8. Safety will clearly be a critical aspect of this mobile after the fiasco associated with the Galaxy Note 7, and Samsung has been working on this as well. The Korea Herald reports that Samsung has undergone a specifically designed safety program with the Galaxy Note 8, that will build on the eight-point process that it had already revealed for the Galaxy S8. Galaxy S9 underway Speaking of the Galaxy S series, Samsung has also reportedly begun work on this next generation Galaxy S9, well ahead of its usual schedule. Reports from close to the Samsung supply chain even suggest that the Galaxy Note 9 is already under development, even a few months before the Galaxy Note 8 has emerged. There has been no official indication from Samsung regarding the Galaxy Note 8, so we will not know the release date of this device for some time. But Apple’s iPhone range has been released in September over the last few years, although reports have suggested that this device could be delayed due to problems with sourcing OLED display panels. Galaxy Note 8 renders Meanwhile, another Galaxy Note 8 leak from the mysterious PoyocoTech has provided further insight into the makeup of the device. This information must be shrouded in controversy to a certain extent, as the identity of this new Twitter account is currently unknown. But the rumors posted by PoyocoTech have certainly gained traction. The Twitter leaker claims that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature an extremely similar design to the existing Galaxy S8, with a huge Infinity display included. The account also confirms the rumors regarding a dual-lens camera, also suggesting that the fingerprint sensor in the device will be embedded under the display. PoyocoTech also asserts that Samsung will “attempt to perfect” the design by going for uniformly aligned ports on the bottom. And the Twitter user also suggests that the S Pen stylus will feature a build-in vibration motor, also providing support for Find My Mobile. There is no news on whether this means that the innovative speaker system that was linked with the S Pen previously will be included or not. S8 resemblance Elsewhere, a new render of the Galaxy Note 8 has also surfaced, although there is some debate over whether this is a concept design all the genuine article. Nonetheless, this image continues the theme of a strong resemblance between the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8, as the design is absolutely reminiscent of the flagship released earlier this year. While it makes sense for Samsung to unify the design of its devices, in the ongoing battle of branding, the similarity between the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 nonetheless poses conundrums for the manufacturer. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Samsung to distinguish between the two devices, even if the aforementioned S Pen stylus is one difference between the two. The Galaxy S8 Plus is very much in the phablet bracket, and reports suggest that the Galaxy Note 8 will be only marginally larger. This does suggest that Samsung will have to pack the Galaxy Note 8 with some outstanding specs and features if it is to attract consumers to this more expensive phablet. Meanwhile, the render confirms the notion of a dual-camera, with vertical alignment also noticeable in these images. Bezels are slimmed down to an absolute minimum, while the fingerprint scanner is conspicuous by its absence, suggesting that it has indeed been integrated into the display. Volume up, volume down and Bixby buttons are located on the left-hand side of this rendered device, with the 3.5mm headphone jack retained on the bottom. A Type-C USB port is also included, while a combination of metal and glass comprises the design of the smartphone. While this may not be the final design of the forthcoming Note 8, it is likely to be rather close to its ultimate design. iPhone 8 clues If Samsung indeed intends to release the Galaxy Note 8 ahead of the iPhone 8, we already have a good idea what to expect from the Californian corporation’s flagship. Apple has been speaking out on some of its biggest software products at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California. And some interesting information has given us a clue to the future direction of the iPhone 8. In particular, Apple has shown off new augmented reality features that are compatible with the iPad, but it is presumed by many observers and analysts that these will appear in the iPhone 8 as well. This has been hotly linked with Apple’s most iconic product since its CEO, Tim Cook, explicitly spoke out in favour of AR. The scene has certainly been set for a major battle between the two big players in the smartphone niche, and it will be intriguing to see what Apple and Samsung have in store for us with the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 when they indeed emerge.

President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Republican Congressional leadership at the White House in Washington, June 6, 2017. Photo: Reuters The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower. At that time Trump praised the tech sector, promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry and even told executives to call him or his people directly if they needed anything. The affection didn’t last long. Tech leaders expressed their outrage after Trump introduced his travel ban in January.

You may even now be seeing some favorite old app threatened with extinction. And you may be wondering why the developer doesn’t just update it for 64-bit and keep it alive. If the App Store no longer lists this app, there’s your answer: the developer is no longer paying Apple the annual $99 membership fee and thus isn’t actively maintaining the app. But even for an active Apple Developer Program member, updating an old app to 64-bit isn’t so simple. True, it’s usually trivial to turn on 64-bitness and recompile the app. But when an app project is opened and compiled with the latest version of Xcode, it is linked against Apple’s most recent system software development kit (SDK). That changes everything. The most recent system is iOS 10, and the app may not be ready for iOS 10. Reviving TidBITS News -- Let’s take as an example the TidBITS News app that I’ve just updated for iOS 10. It was last compiled against the iOS 6 SDK. So how did it manage to keep running in iOS 7, 8, 9, and 10? Basically, the device’s system has been giving TidBITS News a lot of help, essentially by pretending to be iOS 6. A screenshot of the old TidBITS News app next to the new one is a dead giveaway: On the left, you see TidBITS News 1.5 running under iOS 10; but it doesn’t look like an iOS 10 app. There’s a separate black status bar (and there’s a black linen-weave background, visible behind the date display, that Apple abandoned years ago). This is iOS 10 emulating iOS 6. Compare that to the new TidBITS News 2.0 app on the right. iOS 10 apps have a transparent status bar; the navigation bar, with its gradient background color, stretches up behind it. (I’ll talk about other interface changes later.) And the app’s look is the least of our worries. To compile and run as an iOS 10-native app, TidBITS News must speak iOS 10. Technically, it must adopt the iOS 10 application programming interface (API) — the way an app talks to the runtime. A lot has changed under the hood, since iOS 6, in how you do that. That’s why, following the publication of my developer book “Programming iOS 6,” I’ve had to write four subsequent editions (entitled “Programming iOS 7” and so on). To revive TidBITS News, therefore, I effectively had to rewrite the code from scratch as if I were creating the same app today, doing things the iOS 10 way. Luckily, TidBITS News is a fairly small, simple app; it has only three “scenes” — the master view (the list of article headlines and blurbs), the detail view (one complete article), and the player view (for listening to a recorded version of an article). But imagining a much more elaborate app, you can appreciate why a developer might not be willing to recast an old 32-bit app as 64-bit — it could be more work than it’s worth. (And the fact that Apple forces all updates to be given away for free means that it will generate absolutely no income from existing users. Is it any wonder apps are abandoned?) The rest of this article describes how the iOS 10 TidBITS News app differs from the iOS 6 version. If such technicalities don’t interest you, just download the new TidBITS News and check it out! Even if you’re not a developer, however, you might find the details to be an interesting illustration of how much iOS has changed in just four years. Language -- The iOS 6 programming language was Objective-C. With iOS 8, Apple introduced Swift, and I chose to rewrite TidBITS News in Swift because that has made the app’s code much easier for me to read and maintain. I’m sorry, diehard Objective-C fans, but I just find Swift a lot more elegant and legible. On the downside, switching to Swift makes the app a larger download, because a Swift app must include the entire Swift language — Swift isn’t yet built into your device’s system the way Objective-C is. Split View -- On an iPhone, the TidBITS News app is a navigation interface: you see just the master view, and when you tap a headline/blurb listing, it is replaced by the detail view. On an iPad, TidBITS News appears as a split view, with both those “scenes” together, the master view on the left and the detail view on the right. In iOS 6, the split view was an iPad-only widget. That meant that TidBITS News was effectively two apps in one, with two completely different interfaces and two distinct sets of code for dealing with them. Nowadays, the split view is native to both the iPad and the iPhone. To cope with the iPhone’s smaller size, the split view automatically collapses so that it looks and behaves like the old navigation interface. This change made the rewrite simpler, although managing a split view so that it looks and works correctly under all circumstances turns out to be rather tricky. Player -- The iOS 6 TidBITS News app plays an online recorded article using a widget called MPMovieController. Apple abandoned that widget some time back, replacing it with AVPlayerViewController. This change has given me more control over how the player view appears. There used to be an ugly QuickTime logo that I couldn’t get rid of; that logo is now gone. On an iPhone, the player view covers the screen; on an iPad, it is inset somewhat, with the rest of the interface visible darkly behind it. This is much less obnoxious on the large screen, I think. (You, the user, can make the player itself fullscreen, but my advice is: don’t. If I could have found a way to prevent you from doing this, I would have.) iPad Split Screen -- Return with me now to those halcyon days in 2010 when I first wrote TidBITS News. In those primitive times, developers worshipped a magic number: 320. The iPhone was 320 pixels wide, and that was an immutable fact — so much so that I had actually hard-coded it into the app. The iPad, too, came in only one size, and the split view master display was also 320 pixels wide. In effect, the iPad’s master display was an iPhone inside the iPad. Over the years, as Apple has introduced more hardware, iPhone screens have become wider and iPads have become bigger. As if this weren’t bad enough, iOS 9 introduced split screen mode, which lets users of modern iPads slide another app’s interface in from the right side. You can even resize the split to make two apps share the screen simultaneously. I found coping with this to be the hardest part of the rewrite — so hard, in fact, that for a time I contemplated opting out of this feature entirely. (There is a switch for turning it off in the app bundle’s system settings.) The difficulty is two-fold. First, depending on the device and the size of the split, the app effectively changes from an iPad app to an iPhone app, and then back again when the user removes the split, in real time. Second, the range of possible sizes, and in particular the range of possible aspect ratios, that the app can adopt is bewildering, ranging from exceedingly tall and thin to virtually square. This turn means that a split view’s master view can have even more possible widths. A modern app’s interface must, therefore, be planned so as to cope with these changes. I think I’ve managed to do that, but honestly, I’m not entirely certain. I wish Apple had never introduced this feature. Decisions, Decisions -- Other design changes were more or less elective surgery: I changed the fonts of the headline/blurb display in the master view because I wanted to adopt Dynamic Type — the font size depends on your setting in Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size. I removed the label at the top of the master view telling when you last updated from the RSS feed, freeing more screen real estate. That information is now visible when you slide the master table down to reveal the refresh control. The detail view now shows the article’s title statically at the top so you know what article you’re reading even as you scroll through its body. (The title is offset downward for a complicated reason: it’s a tappable link, but Apple extends the tappable area of the navigation bar buttons downward, so that in trying to tap the title, when it was flush up against the navigation bar, I found myself accidentally tapping a button instead.) The iOS 6 detail view displays an article’s content in a UIWebView. The modern-day analog is WKWebView; UIWebView still exists, but it’s no longer under active development by Apple, so I’ve chosen to adopt WKWebView. I don’t think you’ll be able to tell the difference. When you tapped a link in the detail view, you used to be rocketed into Safari. That was a pity, because it took you out of the TidBITS News app, perhaps accidentally. iOS 9 introduced the SFSafariViewController, which effectively allows a Safari process to be embedded inside another app; I’ve now adopted that feature. (If, however, you preview a link on a device with 3D Touch, you can still end up in Safari; I hope to change that in a future update.) One major feature of the iOS 6 version is actually missing in the iOS 10 version: state saving and restoration. This won’t matter to you until you run TidBITS News, background it to use another app, and come back later to find that iOS has killed TidBITS News in the background. In an ideal world, you wouldn’t even notice this had happened because you would be able to pick up right where you’d left off. In the new version, however, if iOS decides to reclaim the memory TidBITS News was using, you won’t return to the story you were previously reading. Instead, the app starts from scratch, goes out on the Internet to get a new copy of the feed, and starts over at whatever is now the first article. Fortunately, TidBITS News is relatively small, so it’s less likely to be expunged from memory than most apps. I hope, in some future update, to add state restoration back in. Give It a Try! -- I’m fond of the TidBITS News app. It’s how I read TidBITS! Just as important, I use it as a teaching tool, because it illustrates a number of fundamental aspects of standard iOS app architecture. So I wanted to keep it going, and I’ve used the threat of extinction under the new 64-bit regime as an excuse to do so. If the old TidBITS News app was too crusty for you, I hope you’ll give the new version a try. It’s free, and will remain so as long as I maintain it.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Sebastian Hagedorn  2017-05-18 10:10 I'm curious why you didn't update the app periodically? I understand that it takes time and effort, but all things considered, I would guess that it's easier to modernize an app in small increments for every new iOS release than to have to bridge as huge a gap as going from version 6 to version 10. Reply Matt Neuburg   2017-05-18 10:55 Well, in the immortal words of Marlon Brando, "What's my motivation?" There's no money in it, the app does nothing essential (you can read TidBITS in other ways), I'm busy with other things, and the app kept on working. And let's not read history backwards: we had no way of knowing that there would _be_ a "huge gap", and by the time the gap _was_ huge, it was, uh, huge. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-22 01:06 If you're ever looking for a project to take on to improve the app, have it show comments as well as the articles. I'm glad you updated it, if for no other reason that you got to write this up for TidBITS. Reply Matt Neuburg   2017-05-22 12:01 The app essentially just shows what's in the RSS feed. The comments, reasonably enough, aren't in the feed. The article title is a tappable link to the Web site, though, so the comments can be viewed that way; however, at that point you might as well have been using a browser to start with, I suppose. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-22 12:27 At the moment, there is an RSS feed of comments for every article, such as for this one: http://tidbits.com/commentfeeds/17235.xml However, that very likely won't survive any infrastructure change, so I wouldn't encourage building anything in the TidBITS News app to parse and display comments at this time. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-23 04:24 There is one thing that I have been meaning to suggest that for the short term is irrelevant - it relates to state saving. Perhaps you might consider it while redoing this. In the old app, each time I started it, it would show whatever was there before. I would drag down to cause it to refresh, and a bunch of new items would appear. However, they just appeared at the top of the list with no indication of which ones were new. Given that it may have been a week or two since I had last looked, I could never remember which ones I had read before. I know the articles are so good that they deserve reading more than once, but ... :-) I have noticed a number of apps now place a thickened line between the old items and the new items to indicate what is new. Is there any chance TidBITS News could do something like this? Reply Andrew Malis  2017-05-23 05:21 I just installed the new app, very nice! It would be great to receive a notification when a new article is posted. Thanks! Reply Michael Logue  2017-06-10 15:57 A number of the 32 bit apps that I am attached to that are going to be Steved are books. It seems that I will have to keep my old iPad Three to continue reading them. Where should I save them to keep them from being deleted. They are already gone from the App Store.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple iOS 11’s new image formats will prevent photos from eating up all your storage Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 10th, 2017 at 3:00 PM Share Tweet Even though Apple mercifully killed the 16GB storage tier on the iPhone last year, running out of storage still remains a frustrating issue for many iPhone users. Thanks to the iPhone’s ability to shoot 4K videos and take high-resolution photos — not to mention storage-hungry apps and the proliferation of podcasts — even users with 128GB of storage can quickly find themselves running low on storage space. In an effort to lighten the load, Apple with iOS 11 will incorporate new brand new camera formats that should go a long ways towards freeing up precious iPhone space. Originally introduced at WWDC earlier this week, the two new formats — HEVC (High Efficiency Video Codec) and HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) — will offer iOS users much better compression without sacrificing photo quality at all. During the WWDC keynote this week, Apple’s Craig Federeghi boasted that compression with the new photo formats is 2x better than what currently exists on iOS. In other words, iOS 11 may go a long ways towards ensuring that storage space remains in plentiful supply. Don't Miss: Major leak shows that Google’s Pixel 2 will be just as exciting as the iPhone 8 With developers and enthusiasts already busy exploring every hidden crevice of iOS 11, Greg Barbosa of 9to5Mac recently decided to put Apple’s bold photo storage claims to the test. When comparing two photos — one taken normally and the other taken with Apple’s newly adopted format — Barbosa found that the the former checked in at 2MB while the latter weighed in at a much lighter 1.2MB. With many iPhone owners taking hundreds of photos, those storage savings can add up incredibly quickly. If you’re currently running iOS 11 beta 1, you can verify this by switching between the High Efficiency and Most Compatible formats under iOS Settings → Camera → Formats. Under the High Efficiency format, images will be saved as HEIC and movies as an HEVC .mov file. Under Most Compatible, images will be saved as JPGs and movies as an h.264 .mov file. In testing I went out at night and took a photo and video of the New York City skyline. The outputted JPG image weighed in at 2 MB, while the HEIC image came in at 1.2 MB. Similarly, the h.264 encoded video was 61.2 MB, while the h.265 (HEVC) video was 33 MB. Notably, the new camera formats will reportedly only work on devices with Apple’s A9 processor, which is to say the iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, the iPhone SE, and both iPhone 7 models. The new photo formats aside, Apple has implemented a few other features in iOS 11 to help users save on storage space. As we detailed earlier in the week, iOS 11 has a feature that will automatically “offload” unused apps while retaining said app’s documents and data should a user want to download it at a later date. Additionally, iOS 11 makes it easier for users to search out and delete conversations, photos, and attachments that happen to be taking up a lot of space. Yuuus. Even better! You can seriously triage storage AND recommendations. pic.twitter.com/7UO0PFxzhz — Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) June 5, 2017 Tags: Apple, iOS 11 View Comments Trending 1 Deals You’ve never seen anything like this massive Amazon sale on Echo, 10 different Kindles, more 2 Deals Brilliant gadget lets you control any garage door opener you already have from your phone 3 Entertainment 25 most important announcements from the Xbox E3 2017 press conference 4 Tech Tim Cook says Apple’s AI is already watching you 5 Entertainment 9 most important announcements from Bethesda’s E3 2017 press conference Picked For You 8 most important announcements from EA’s E3 2017 press conference By Jacob Siegal 1 day ago NBA Finals 2017 live stream: How to watch Warriors vs. Cavaliers Game 4 online By Jacob Siegal 2 days ago A new iPhone 8 case leak shows us a very different design By Chris Smith 3 days ago Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Secondly, the surprise launch of Monument Valley 2 likely had many iOS developers scrambling to push the release date of their games back. In TouchArcade news, we posted our hundredth weekly Hearthstone roundup. Similar to these roundups on MacRumors, every Monday morning we pile together everything you need to know to follow along with what's been happening in Blizzard's remarkably popular World of Warcraft-themed collectable card game. The constantly evolving metagame, esports aspects, and much more have made Hearthstone a staple in our community. As mentioned, the release of Monument Valley 2 dominated everything this week. Apple stealthily announced the game during the WWDC keynote on Monday when they showed the new layout of the App Store, then mentioned the game was available immediately. Amusingly enough, ustwo studio head Dan Gray mentioned on Twitter that the game was actually available for download the week prior, but no one knew the magic URL. Ustwo also posted part one of a behind the scenes series showing both the people and the studio behind the game. There's loads of great looks at different aspects of the art in the game as well as discussions surrounding the evolution of the story in the series along with the addition of the mother and daughter characters. Monument Valley 2 also hit #1 on the iTunes charts much faster than the original Monument Valley. I'm not sure it's much of a surprise, given the success and popularity of the original, along with the absolutely ridiculous level of featuring it got from Apple. On launch day, Monument Valley 2 took over nearly every feature slot available on the App Store- A push we haven't seen since the launch of Supercell's Clash Royale. In other iOS gaming news, Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy had its second episode hit the App Store. If you've never played a Telltale game, they're really worth checking out. The Walking Dead is what put them on the map, but over the last few years they've released interactive story games that cover loads of popular IP ranging from Game of Thrones to Borderlands. Modern Telltale games play like a highly cinematic Choose Your Own Adventure book, and many of the first episodes of their games are available for free. On Wednesday, the Apple Design Award winners were made public, and we've got an article digging into the five games that won. What had us raising our eyebrows this year was that two of the five games were not mobile-first titles. Mushroom 11 launched on Steam first, and Severed started its life as a PS Vita exclusive. Both are fantastic on iOS, however, and those two games as well as the other three winners, Blackbox, Splitter Critters, and Old Man's Journey are all must-haves. If you're looking for something else to download this week, Xigma Games' Super Nano Jumpers was also released. We've seen tons of developers attempt to take a stab at the Super Meatboy tough-as-nails platformer genre, but this is among the best. Your character runs automatically, and instead of complicated virtual controls, you have two forms of input: Being able to stop, and jumping. The interesting twist is you can even stop in the air. It sounds strange, but it works incredibly well. While details on the game itself are few and far between, alpha footage of GRID Autosport for mobile was released this week. This racing game looks shockingly similar to its console counterpart, and if nothing else, serves as an incredible example of how far mobile games have come since the launch of the App Store in 2008. We're keeping a close eye on this, and expect to hear more information when we get closer to launch this fall. Last, but not least, is an interesting change to the wording of the App Store Review guidelines. way back in 2014, Apple suddenly decided to stop approving apps that incentivized viewing video ads for gameplay bonuses. Developers (and gamers) rapidly responded, and Apple relented. This new wording has loads of developers trying to figure out once again where in-game advertising lies going forward on the App Store. Given how many games rely on ads now, this is going to be a fascinating story to follow as it develops. That's about it for this week!

In a commencement address, Cook — who as Apple’s chief executive since 2011 has overseen the roll-out of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch — said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion. “Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with,” said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. “That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity,” he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. “When you keep people at the centre of what you do, it can impact,” he said. Cook said he isn’t worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. Humanities “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences,” he said. “That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead.” Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. “The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive,” he said. “Don’t let that noise knock you off course. Don’t get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don’t listen to trolls, and don’t become one. Measure impact in humanity” not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve.” More from Technology Microsoft's Xbox One X targets PlayStation 4 03:58 am Google executives brace for looming EU fines Tech without values is worthless: Apple CEO SoftBank buying Boston Dynamics A tech start-up boom in Iran Robots will change the nature of employment Doing good is the latest tech worker perk Snap said to buy Placed for $125m tags from this storyApple follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTechnology tagsApple follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TechnologyMicrosoft's Xbox One X targets PlayStation 4 Business Gallery China Beijing International High-tech Expo opens Pictures: Apple launches new gadgets and updates Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Microsoft's Xbox One X targets PlayStation 4 02Google Duo works in UAE — for now 03Individuals can access VPNs in UAE Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Take an onboard tour of the QE2 in Dubai Jan 10, 2012 7Images China Beijing International High-tech Expo opens Jun 08, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News CCTV footage of Abu Dhabi killer released Emirati-Qatari families to get assistance Expats in this country will pay monthly tax Countries to prosecute Qatar for terror support UAE hopes Qatar finally seeing sense 3 Pakistani men and their 96 children UAE calls on Qatar to end support to terror UAE blacklist may hit liquidity of Qatari banks New parking rates upset Marina Square residents Close Recommended For You ‘Planet of the Apps’ gets mixed reviewsPUBLISHED ON Jun 12, 2017 China arrests 22 over sale of Apple private dataPUBLISHED ON Jun 09, 2017 UAE hopes Qatar finally seeing sense PUBLISHED ON Jun 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Apple is losing ground in the smartphone market, and the next iPhone might not help it get any better. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Jun 10, 2017 at 1:22PM Market research firm Gartner's latest smartphone market share report clearly shows Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stagnating business. The iPhone maker's device sales were flat year over year during the first quarter at around 51 million, according to Gartner, even though the overall smartphone market grew 9% over the same period. Not surprisingly, Apple's smartphone market share dropped 1.1 percentage points from the prior-year period to 13.7%, as the Chinese triumvirate of Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo clocked massive gains. Company Q1 2017 Shipments Q1 2017 Market Share Q1 2016 Shipments Q1 2016 Market Share Samsung 78,671.4 20.7% 81,186.9 23.3% Apple 51,992.5 13.7% 51,629.5 14.8% Huawei 34,181.2 9.0% 28,861.0 8.3% Oppo 30,922.3 8.1% 15,891.5 4.6% Vivo 25,842.2 6.8% 14,001.0 4.0% Others 158,367.7 41.7% 156,654.2 45.0% Total 379,977.3 100% 348,224.1 100% Data source: Gartner, May 2017. Shipment figures are in thousands of units. China is a problem for Apple One of the main reasons Apple's sales are going nowhere is its declining sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market, accounting for a third of all global sales. Apple's iPhone revenue from Greater China has dipped year-over-year for five straight quarters, as homegrown manufacturers have taken the market by storm. Greater China revenue was $10.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter for Apple, about 20% of the total. But the revenue from the region was 14% lower than the Greater China haul from the year-ago quarter, when it made up about 25% of the total. Image source: Apple. What's more, Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are making a mark in emerging markets and in developed regions such as Europe, thanks to feature-packed phones at reasonable prices. Will Apple's next iPhone help it recover ground? Apple seems to have a smart strategy for the next iPhone Cupertino is rumored to be launching three iPhone models this year. Two of these models could be refreshed versions of the current-generation devices, carrying the 7s and the 7s Plus moniker, while the third could be the more impressive anniversary-edition iPhone 8. UBS forecasts that the iPhone 8 could start retailing from $870 and might go all the way up to $1,070. What's more, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich forecasts that the higher-priced iPhone could make up as much as 45% of Apple's total iPhone sales. A Morgan Stanley report calling for 50% of the upcoming iPhone models to be equipped with an OLED display backs up that forecast. This could be a big deal for Apple investors, as Apple could ship around 65 million units of the more expensive device, given other estimates of 130 million units in 2017. Therefore, Apple's revenue would get a nice boost if it can sell all of the iPhone 8 models it manufactures. It won't be surprising if the more expensive iPhone finds a lot of takers, because of the rumored tech that it could be packing. In addition, the average selling price of smartphones is rising, as customers are willing to shell out more money for better features, according to Gartner, and this trend could also play in Apple's favor. Meanwhile, the iPhone upgrade cycle is another catalyst investors shouldn't miss. Research firm Bernstein forecasts that 203 million iPhone users will be ready to upgrade to a new device next year, and that's where the 7s and 7s Plus models could come into play. A $1,000 iPhone might not bring in the volume  for Apple, as it might alienate existing customers who are more accustomed to the $649 base price. So it would be doing the right thing by launching two relatively cheaper models that can help it compete effectively against the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and push volume, while the more expensive flagship could help bring in more dough. China could weigh on the iPhone 8's success Apple's existing user base and the developed markets are definitely going to be a catalyst for the next set of iPhones, but it remains to be seen if the company can make a comeback in China. Even if Apple comes out with a highly innovative device that captures the imagination of the Chinese customers, its success isn't guaranteed, since Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo are strong players in the country. For instance, Huawei had close to 50,000 retail locations last year, with a huge majority spread across China. Oppo, on the other hand, has 200,000 retail locations in the country. Both of these companies have resorted to offering substantial incentives to retailers and distributors, creating a positive impact on sales. Apple, meanwhile, has just 40 stores in China and some estimates are that 40% of smartphone sales in China are done in a physical store. Apple's weak access to the Chinese smartphone market could be a constraint for the upcoming set of iPhones, apart from the premium pricing, so Apple might not be able to gain significant ground against its Chinese rivals even if it launches a cutting-edge device. Investors shouldn't bet on a resounding success for the upcoming iPhone generation, unless Apple finds a way to move more units in its second-largest market.   Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

By launching Business Chat, the Cupertino-based tech giant is trying to catch up with Facebook’s popular chat app, Messenger. Business Chat is a new feature that has been integrated into iMessage to make the app attractive to businesses. With the new feature, businesses can communicate and do a few other things that they were unable to do before now. “Business Chat is a powerful new way for businesses to connect with customers directly in Messages. Using Business Chat, your customers can get answers to questions, resolve issues, and complete transactions on their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Customers can find your business and start conversations from Safari, Maps, Spotlight, and Siri,” a message from Apple read. Recall that Facebook Messenger boasts a couple of features aimed at simplifying the process of doing business on the app. Messenger recently integrated PayPal payment into the app. The new feature allows select users in the U.S [more users and countries could soon follow] to easily link their PayPal and Messenger accounts. Users will also be able to receive payment alerts directly within the Messenger app. Last September, Facebook announced that its 30,000 bots can now accept payments natively without directing you to third-party websites. That move signified the company’s intention to move into the mainstream of offering businesses opportunity to close transactions without being redirected to a third-party website. Apple’s main objective with Business Chat is clear; to enable businesses add some of their app features within a chat. The new feature will also be integrated with other customer service, with a couple of partners already listed as pioneers. Some of the high-profile businesses [partners] that have been penciled down as pioneers include, Salesforce, Genesys, LivePerson, and Nuance, Apple said. Last October, Shopify stepped up its game when it started offering merchants big opportunity to make direct sales in Messenger. This move made the company one of the early birds to enable direct conversation between stores and customers via the popular Messenger; and now it has integrated a new way to help merchants make direct sales in the chat app. Speaking further on the collaboration [partnership with Facebook], Ready said: “This collaboration continues to showcase our march to be a customer champion. We will continue to execute on our vision of offering PayPal in more places where people shop online, in app and in store by partnering with companies who share our desire to create meaningful products that benefit both consumers and merchants.” Last week, Apple announced that it would integrate Apple Pay into iMessage as an app, which will basically allow you to request payment with your contact with a single tap. Most importantly, the new feature will show up a notification when someone says “you owe me $10” and will automatically prompt you to pay your debt. Integrating Apple Pay into iMessage will come as a big competition for Venmo; a company that has been offering similar service to users of the chat app for a while now. However, Apple seems to have the upper hand considering the fact that it owns iMessage as well as Apple Pay.

An anonymous reader quotes CNBC: The so-called "big five" -- Apple , Alphabet Class A shares, Microsoft , Facebook and Amazon -- lost more than $97.5 billion in market value between the close on Thursday and the close on Friday, according to FactSet, dragging the Nasdaq to its worst week of the year. Shares of Apple fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, while the other four companies fell more than 3 percent. For most of the day, only 3 stocks in the S&P 500 tech sector were in the green: IBM , Teradata and Western Union . Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet all traded more than 2 times their 30-day average volume... "They're just plain overbought," said David Bahnsen founder, managing director and chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, a private wealth management firm. "They are extremely stretched from a valuation standpoint." CNN notes the drop occurred "after a Goldman Sachs analyst questioned this year's run-up in the industry's five biggest names." They also added that "The top five techs today account for 13% of the market value weighting in the S&P 500, even though they are only 1% of the companies in the index." amazon apple business ← Related Links → No, Your Phone Didn't Ring.

The PE for the S&P is about 25. That is a 4% ROI. Apple's PE is about 18, which is an ROI of over 5%. Ten year T-bills pay 2.5%. So unless you think interest rates are going to soar, stock prices look reasonable. Amazon's PE is WAY higher (over 500) but Amazon is a growth stock. You don't buy AMZN for the dividends. If/when rationality returns to the market, it'll be a bloodbath. I have heard a lot of chicken-littles voice both of these opinions: 1.

Tech Companies Have Many Negative Investor Signals (Score:5, Insightful) by Anonymous Coward writes: on Saturday June 10, 2017 @12:59PM (#54592359) Why do people own stocks? There are three primary reasons: 1. Control. The mindset that prevails now among tech companies, and especially those founded by Silicon Valley types, is that investors are a necessary evil to be controlled. So they issue special shares to themselves to ensure that no matter how many shares somebody else owns, they still have control. It's a giant middle finger to the average investor whom the Silicon Valley types have zero respect for. Why would you want to invest in a company that doesn't care about you or your capital? It's like paying for the privilege of being abused. So in the case of these tech companies control is essentially impossible which eliminates this reason to own the stock. 2. Dividends. Another reason to own a stock is to have a claim to a share of the profits that are distributed periodically to the owners. Some tech companies pay a dividend and some don't but even those that do offer a relatively miserly amount compared to their profits and market valuation. A look at tech company balance sheets reveals huge war chests full of cash or equivalent short term liquid investments. Doesn't this money belong to the shareholders? Why do the tech companies need such large hordes of cash in what is essentially a low capital equipment expense business? Again, this signals a lack of respect for the shareholders. 3. Capital Appreciation. The final reason to own a stock is to have a stake in a growing business that will, by virtue of the business becoming larger and more profitable, grow in value over time. However, in the case of these tech companies, the lack of control makes any liquidation event, even in the distant future, a theoretical impossibility during the lifetime of the founder and probably for some time afterward too since tech billionaires like to put their shares into charitable trusts for long term social engineering projects. These trusts will probably continue to monopolize these assets for decades after the passing of the founders. Where is the capital appreciation if nobody can ever get control and liquidate the stakes? Given all of these factors, how is tech an attractive investment? It looks more like a vehicle for speculation to me, at least for the average investor.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS How Apple’s Siri will soon help you make payments and track personal finances Khari Johnson@kharijohnson June 10, 2017 9:41 AM At WWDC this week, we learned about ways Apple plans to make Siri smarter, many of which have to do with your money. Starting with iOS 11, Siri will be able to help you complete money transfers, as well as helping you stay on top of your checking, savings, and credit card accounts. “Users will now be able to transfer money from one account to another or search for account information,” said Sirikit engineer Sirisha Yerroju about changes coming to the public with the release of iOS 11, due out this fall. “If the user wants to know more about each account, you can just click on any of the items to get a detailed view. Search for account intent shows not just all the accounts but can also be used to provide specific account information.” The ability to search for and pay bills with Siri was added with version 10.3 of Siri, while send and request payment functionality came last fall with iOS 10. Yerroju spoke in a session Wednesday titled “What’s New With Sirikit?” that provided greater detail about the Siri updates first mentioned in the opening keynote address on Monday. Changes coming to Siri with iOS 11 include the ability to do on-the-spot translations and serve up personalized recommendations in native apps  — like Safari, Maps, and News. It was also announced that both male and female versions of the assistant will get a more expressive voice. Other Siri-related announcements made during the keynote address include the arrival of HomePod, Apple’s answer to smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo, and news that a Siri theme is coming to the Apple Watch. For the full rundown, here’s everything Apple announced at WWDC. Payments with Siri isn’t entirely new. In fact, the ability to send or request payments with Siri was initially introduced last fall with the release of iOS 10. What’s coming with iOS 11 is the ability to interact with apps that scan QR codes for payments. A QR code scanner will live in the native camera on iOS 11 and will be used for payments and social media contact codes like the kinds seen from Snapchat or Facebook Messenger. With iOS 11, Siri will also be able to recognize account nicknames and talk with a user about things like credit card reward points. Beyond the addition of banking category intents, Siri will now be able to do a lot more with lists and reminders, including creating reminders based on time and location. Say: “Remind me to print the slides when I get to work,” and Siri will remind you when you are physically standing at your desk. “We’ve added all the APIs to ensure users can edit, create, and manage their lists and notes and reminders. Not just that, but also users will be able to search in their lists and notes,” Yerroju said. Siri will be able to search for lists and reminders based on things like content type, location, title, and date and time. Also coming soon: Developers will be able to customize cards generated by Siri that let people interact with an app. Above: Examples of customized interactive cards developers will be able to create for iOS 11 Apple’s focus on finances at WWDC comes after both Google and Microsoft brought payments to their voice apps, followed by a rush of activity to enable payments on chat app platforms. Apple Pay for peer-to-peer payments is coming to iMessage this fall. Also on the way in iOS 11 or later is Business Chat for iMessage, which customers can use to contact and interact with businesses. Apple Pay will also be able to handle transactions in Business Chat.

(AFP) Google and Apple are not synonymous with failure but in the risky business of innovation, anything is possible. At Sweden's newly opened Museum of Failure, Google Glass and Apple Newton are two such devices that were either ahead of their time or the results of some bad ideas. Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 per cent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library. The Museum of Failure is open to the public in downtown Helsingborg.

Apple is laying the groundwork for a more advanced Apple TV Jeff Dunn Business Insider June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos apple tvMore (The Apple TV.Apple/Business Insider) Apple is throwing its weight behind a more modern video standard, and it may pave the way for significant upgrades to the next Apple TV box. At its annual developer conference this week, WWDC, Apple announced widespread support for High Efficiency Video Coding. The company says this is coming to the next versions of iOS and macOS, but its implementation on tvOS seems to lay the foundation for an Apple TV that supports 4K video streaming — one of the major areas where Apple’s current media streamer lags behind high-end, less expensive streamers from Roku, Amazon, and Google. HEVC, as it’s called, is a relatively new video compression standard that was designed with sharper, more pixel-dense 4K video in mind (among other advanced forms of video). Any company that deploys it has to pay a royalty fee, but various streaming players — including Netflix, Amazon, and Roku — have already lent their support. The idea is that, because 4K video eats up much more data and bandwidth than traditional HD, it needs a way to keeps file sizes manageable — or compress those files — without destroying the quality of the video itself. HEVC is one of those solutions. You can read this excellent CNET explainer for a look at how the whole thing works, but in short, using HEVC allows a video to keep similar picture quality as it’d have with the last major compression standard (H.264) in files that are roughly twice as efficient about how much data they consume. All of this can vary based on your internet connection, but ideally, this means you could stream a 4K video without it taking up unreasonably more space than a lower-resolution video. Alternatively, you could stream one of those lower-resolution (but more common) 1080p videos, and have it take up nearly half the space as it would otherwise. View photos RTSE2OMore (Beck Diefenbach/Reuters) None of this will allow the most recent Apple TV, released in late 2015, to stream in 4K, though. That box can take advantage of the reduced file sizes for traditional HD videos, but it still uses an older HDMI 1.4 port, which isn’t fully up to the task of pushing more pixels. Still, given that HEVC is really built for those 4K (and higher) resolutions, it would make a whole lot of sense for Apple to introduce an Apple TV that takes full advantage of the spec. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that the company was testing a new model that would do exactly that. In any case, any 4K device still has to deal with the relatively low amount of actual 4K content that’s available to stream in the first place, and the fact that 4K doesn’t provide much benefit unless you have a larger TV. The content side of things is improving, however. And with the Apple TV lagging behind its competitors in terms of sales, 4K (or HDR) support would allow the company to reach a level of feature parity that could better justify the price premium it has compared to Amazon's Fire TV, Roku's premium devices, and Google's Chromecast Ultra. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apps Can No Longer Use Custom Review Prompts; Apple Mandates Standardized Method By Ryan Christoffel In iOS 10.3 earlier this year, Apple introduced a new API for prompting users to give apps an App Store review. At the time, developers were allowed to continue using any custom review prompts they had previously implemented, with the warning that such permission would eventually be revoked. As reported by 9to5Mac, that day has already come. App Store policy has been updated to mandate use of Apple's standardized rating API going forward, disallowing custom review prompts. The updated language in Apple's review guidelines reads: Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts. In the few months since its introduction, adoption of Apple's review prompt API has been slow. Perhaps it is due to that lack of adoption that the company wasted little time before requiring its use. Apple's solution certainly provides a better user experience than custom alternatives, particularly since it allows rating an app without needing to visit the App Store. But the concern from developers may be the loss of control over when, or how often, that prompt is presented.

App Store Policy Now Allows Tipping Content Providers→ Linked By Ryan Christoffel Josh Constine reports for TechCrunch about an updated App Store policy that will enable apps to allow tipping of content creators, provided 30% of that tip goes to Apple. The newly updated policy from Apple reads: Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to "tip" digital content providers in the app. Constine explains that previously, tipping was a grey area, leading some developers to avoid implementing it for fear their apps would be rejected by the App Review team. But this new policy changes that, he writes: This means developers can add tipping features without fearing repercussions from Apple, as long as they’re willing to give the giant 30 percent. The grey area had kept tipping out of some popular apps who sought to avoid any tension with Apple. Now app makers can offer and promote tipping features with confidence. The developers will have to determine whether they themselves take a cut of the tips or pass the full 70 percent on to the content creators. Passing on 50 percent while taking a 20 percent cut could unlock paths to monetizing video where ads can be interruptive or tough to match with unpolished footage. The App Store has been rife with changes since Phil Schiller adopted responsibility for it, and this particular change will impact certain people in different ways. Some developers may appreciate the clarity concerning what they can or can't do in the realm of tipping, but for any apps currently allowing tipping without the 30% tax, both developers and content providers will be harmed.

Representative Image. (REUTERS/Adrees Latif ) Google and Apple are not synonymous with failure but in the risky business of innovation, anything is possible. At Sweden's newly opened Museum of Failure, Google Glass and Apple Newton are two such devices that were either ahead of their time or the results of some bad ideas. Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 percent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Also read: Nokia Active Wireless, Wired Earphones Revealed Before Smartphone Launch in India Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library. The Museum of Failure is open to the public in downtown Helsingborg.

June 10, 2017 9:14 AM By PCMag.com Reprints + - The new iMac Pro is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. Photo Credit: Getty Images / Justin Sullivan advertisement | advertise on newsday The iMac Pro was perhaps the most impressive announcement at WWDC this year; it promises to be the most powerful computer Apple has ever made when it arrives in December. The $4,999 starting price will leave many eyes watering, but the iMac Pro is packed with extremely powerful hardware and sports a beautiful display. Because of its design, size, specs, and price, it will go head to head with the Microsoft Surface Studio, the most comparable Windows PC. Most Popular Clare Rose dropped as distributor for Belmont Some LI firms give workers Friday perks Company recalling 294,744 pounds of chicken cutlets 3 smart financial moves for new grads Protecting your outsourced marketing content The most expensive Studio configuration (which is what PCMag reviewed) comes in at $4,199, so even the base iMac Pro is a pricier proposition. Which one is best for you? Operating system is the obvious difference, and you'll have to wait to get your hands on an iMac Pro, but there are several other key differences between the two to consider. Examining the specs, Apple's desktop does have a power advantage, with more recent (and generally faster) components. We dinged the Surface Studio for not having the most cutting-edge components at the time of launch, and the iMac will already had an advantage by coming out after the Studio. On the other hand, the Studio's innovative design—namely the reclining touch-screen display—might be more to your liking, and offers new avenues to creatives for systems of this type. To get more specific with the specs, let's first take a look at the most visible aspect—the displays. They make up almost the entirety of both machines, and the Studio was clearly inspired by the design of past iMacs. Both have extraordinary, better-than-4K resolutions, albeit at different aspect ratios. The Studio's 28-inch screen features a 4,500-by-3,000 resolution, while the iMac Pro's 27-inch screen is 5,120 by 2,880 (the same as the 2015 27-inch iMac). The brightness has improved on all new iMacs, and it now supports one billion colors. TechnologyCheck out Apple's just-announced tech products Quality-wise, the screens are just about a wash, as you'll hardly be left complaining about the resolution on either device, and they both support the P3 color gamut. That said, there's a huge departure when you consider the Studio's touch capability, which is an area Apple simply refuses to go with its computers. advertisement | advertise on newsday Touch—combined with ability to recline the Studio like a digital canvas—gives the Studio much more versatility for content creation, as discussed in depth in our review. If you only draw or design in programs with a mouse, touch may not be needed—but the inclusion does expand your future options. Streamlining the creative process from separate (and expensive) drawing tablets into one device can be very appealing if you're a digital artist. In terms of computing power, though, the iMac Pro has the Studio beat. Apple is positioning the iMac Pro as a true workstation, and its Xeon CPU backs up that claim. The base model includes an 8-core processor and 32GB of memory, which will be lighting fast. As stated, the Surface Surface Studio was slightly behind at launch—it lacks a newer Kaby Lake chip, though its Intel Core i7-6820HQ Skylake CPU is still fast. Compared side by side, though, the iMac Pro will be much more capable at quickly crunching through data, encoding video, and general multitasking. The iMac's powerful AMD Radeon Vega graphics really set it apart, as well: These (still somewhat mysterious) cards from AMD are meant to compete with Nvidia's top Quadro cards, so there should be tremendous 3D capability packed within the iMac Pro. The Studio does have discrete graphics, but its Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M, while capable, is not on the same level. The iMac Pro has a leg up in gaming, where these cards typically come into play the most, but that's not the target iMac Pro buyer. As a workstation, high-end graphics cards are for video and photo editors, animators, graphic designers, and more, as they accelerate rendering and load times in many of these processes. The Vega card will also be VR capable, something Apple pushed at WWDC, while the Studio's card is not. Business24 fun facts about Apple The two desktops are fairly similar in terms of port offerings—they both include USB 3.0, SD card slots, and Ethernet—but the Studio offers mini DisplayPort for video output and lacks any USB-C connectivity. The iMac Pro doesn't include mini DisplayPort, but USB-C is more versatile with adapters and is generally more useful for transferring media and other files. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff An important note is that the Studio configuration we tested comes with 2TB of storage, while the base iMac Pro only has 1TB. Overall, there's no doubt the iMac Pro packs more powerful, newer hardware than the Studio. It does so at a higher price, and is launching about half a year later, but the advantage remains nonetheless. That said, the Studio offers a whole realm of options the iMac does not thanks to its touch screen, making it more than just a speedy desktop. It can streamline the process of separate drawing tablets and other devices into one product thanks to its pen, the Surface Dial, and touch screen. The operating systems are of course another major distinction, but if that's not a restricting factor, the iMac Pro is the choice for pure power, while the less expensive Surface Studio can be your desktop and digital creation tool in one.

The agency hopes for a "passive mode," where phones automatically know who drives and who rides. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued draft guidelines in November about phones, tablets and other mobile devices inside a car. The agency hopes for a "passive mode," where phones automatically know who drives and who rides.(Ian Waldie/Getty Images) By The Seattle Times SEATTLE -- In the near future, your phone might be smart enough to know whether you are driving a car, or going along for the ride. Anti-distraction software by a tech startup called Cellepathy would automatically go into a restrictive "driver mode" when a phone is within a moving vehicle. Online features such as texts, video, games and social media would be blocked, as well as some or all nonemergency telephone calls. Your cellphone is like an airplane's black box. It contains a compass, a gyroscope, an accelerometer and GPS tracking. Using those features and the software, vehicle passengers could perform a verification task, lasting seven seconds or less, to unlock all the apps in "passenger mode." For instance, they would hold a phone level and type in a series of numbers. Cellepathy co-founder Dan Abramson recently moved from Tel Aviv to Sammamish, where he says the company will recruit engineers from this region. The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in Israel and some European firms are requiring employees to use Cellepathy, which he said has begun to market to customers in North America. "Our contribution to the world is our ability to differentiate between drivers and passengers," he says, a useful goal until self-driving cars someday rule the road. "We can prevent a lot of deaths, injuries and tragedies over the next 40 years, and if we can make an honest wage for our efforts, that's great." The quest for technical solutions comes while states gradually pass laws to reduce distracted driving, including Washington's Driving Under the Influence of Electronics act, which takes effect July 23. It bans watching video or using a handheld phone or other device while driving. In Oregon, drivers have been prohibited from talking on cell phones or texting while driving since 2010. Apple announced this week its "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, to be installed in iOS 11 software this fall. Once a phone owner has chosen this mode, the iPhone would know when it's in a moving car and automatically reply to an incoming call or message: "I'll see your message when I get where I'm going." Cellepathy-equipped phones would automatically go into driver mode when a car moves, unlike Apple's feature, which is voluntary. No law now requires a driver's phone to be disabled. Device makers oppose any government guidelines or mandates that call for software that automatically locks phones in moving cars. "Ultimately, this is a behavioral problem," said Jamie Boone, government affairs director for the Consumer Technology Association. "There are tons of different distraction problems. Daydreaming, eating, putting on your makeup." Cellepathy is marketing to companies that seek to improve safety and avoid liability for employees who drive on the job. That applies not only to fleets, but traveling salespeople, or anyone using private cars to deliver food or packages. Employers can order settings to allow calls, such as those to and from the boss. Calls to 911 would not be restricted. Employers typically allow finger or voice-activated maps, and music apps. Employers could configure Cellepathy software to either allow or block hands-free calls via Bluetooth, Abramson said. "I also have the curiosity and compulsion to see who has texted me, and to check emails all the time," confessed Hilla Nissani, general manager of AstraZeneca Israel, on a newscast there. "The software really lets me drive in peace without knowing that mails are coming in, without the ability to read the texts." Cellepathy is developed for Android phones and being beta-tested on Apple products, according to Abramson. Staffers from the Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC) are informally trying three Cellepathy-equipped phones on drives around Olympia. Facing addiction Of course, turning off your phone is a voluntary form of driver mode. You may toss your phone in the trunk, or study a map before turning on the ignition. Few people do so. "Ideally we would say put it away," said Shelly Baldwin, legislative liaison for the WTSC. "That's a little like promoting abstinence. That's 100 percent effective — if you follow the code." The goal is harm reduction, she says, as a public-health strategy. On a brief drive with commission staff leaving downtown Olympia, Washington, one Cellepathy-equipped phone announced "driver mode" after traveling one block and another after three blocks, locking out many uses, including Google search. Erika Mascorro, anti-distraction program manager, set her thumb on her phone, held it level, and typed numbers to allow passenger mode. She could easily make the verification test fail by tilting the phone 10 degrees. "I've had it about a week, and I'm already accustomed to it," she said. They were surprised driver mode let people type an address within a navigation map. (The new state law limits drivers to "minimal use of a finger.") In real life, Cellepathy buyers would decide which mapping apps they would deem safe for employees, Abramson said. One question is passenger collusion. What's to stop a friend or spouse from attaining passenger mode, then handing the driver a phoneload of temptations? That situation is rare, Cellepathy Vice President Sean Irtold a national conference, because 60 percent of vehicles contain one person, and federal surveys show three-fourths of riders feel unsafe enough to tell a texting driver to stop. Universal tech At least in theory, passenger-verification software could become ubiquitous on cellphones — which is why Baldwin said she was eager to give Cellepathy a test drive. Think about that. Your phone would be disabled once a car moves, until a passenger takes action. Some motorists would consider that an imposition on their freedom. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued draft guidelines in November about phones, tablets and other mobile devices inside a car. The agency hopes for a "passive mode," where phones automatically know who drives and who rides. Drivers might be identified by bodily electric current, or camera images of where people sit in a car. If that's unworkable, the guidelines would recommend a passenger verification task. Abramson said the country could wait 10 years for such passive-driver detection, compared with a couple of years to reach millions of people through software updates or new phones. NHTSA is willing to tolerate 1.5 seconds per glance at a screen, totaling 12 seconds for multiple glances — compared with choosing a satellite radio station. Texting consumes an average 36 seconds. The Consumer Technology Association endorses state enforcement against distracted driving. But it argues NHTSA lacks authority to issue guidelines for nonautomotive products. That would limit innovation, industry groups say. "Who decides which apps get blocked? Who decides which maps are usable and which aren't? It's a big ecosystem and a whole lot more complicated than it looks," Boone said. Carmakers have advocated features that connect phones to built-in dashboard infotainment systems. The National Safety Council objects that pairing enables the myth that hands-free calling is safe. Council President Deborah Hersman wrote that widespread adoption of automatic driver mode for smartphones is maybe the "best hope" to overcome a dangerous compulsion. "NSC believes we must go beyond education and laws if we want to successfully solve the problem. Technology created this problem, but it can also provide the solution." -- The Seattle Times View Comments About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

'If you go into what I call a bubble boom, every bubble bursts.' - Margaret Thatcher Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Doug Noland / Crowded Longs, Shorts and a New Z1 Crowded Longs, Shorts and a New Z1 By: Doug Noland | Sat, Jun 10, 2017 Share Print Email It was a week that saw Mario Draghi cling stubbornly to ultra-dovish monetary policy, the UK's Brexit strategy thrown into even greater disarray after Prime Minister May's failed election gambit, and the former Director of the FBI essentially testify that our President is a scoundrel. And then there's the Middle East... In the midst of it all, after trading at a 24-year low 9.37 Friday morning, an abrupt reversal had the VIX ending the week at 10.70. Looking at the S&P500's slight (0.3%) decline for the week, one might be tempted to think comfortably "boring." Market internals, though, were anything but boring or comforting. Friday's session saw the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) swing wildly. After trading to an all-time high 5,898 in the first hour of U.S. trading, the index sank over 4.0% to 5,658 before closing the session down 2.44% at 5,742. Amazon traded in an intraday range of 1013 to 927. Looking at "FANG" plus Microsoft and Apple, major market cap was evaporating in a hurry. By the end of Friday's session, Facebook had declined 3.3%, Apple 3.9%, Amazon 3.2%, Microsoft 2.3%, Netflix 4.7% and Google 3.4%. The semiconductors (SOX) traded at a multi-year high 1,149 early in Friday's session, then sank 7.0% before recovering somewhat to close the day down 4.3% at 1,090. Biotech (BTK) rose 1.5% in the morning to an all-time high and then closed the session slightly lower. Yet it was not just Friday - and not only tech. After trading Tuesday morning at a low of 88.38, bank stocks (BKX) surged over 6% before closing the week up 4.9% to 93.79. The broker/dealers jumped 3.6% this week. The small cap Russell 2000 traded Tuesday morning at a low of 1,387 before rallying 3.3% to end the week with a gain of 1.2%. It was an unpleasant day and week for the Momentum Crowd all crowded into outperforming technology stocks. It was even worse for those long momentum and short the underperformers. Long tech versus short financials had been a big winner until the late-week "rip your face off" - with Friday trading seeing bank stocks up 2.3% and the Morgan Stanley High Tech Index down 3.0%. Long big technology against short small caps had also been easy money - until the last few sessions. This week saw the NDX drop 2.4%, while the small cap Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. And it's worth noting some of Friday's winners: Dillards (10.2%), Urban Outfitters (7.8%), J.C. Penny (6.8%) and Barnes & Noble (6.0%) - all heavily shorted in the despised retail sector. Moreover, the leading gainers in the S&P500 - including Kohl's (7.2%), Chesapeake Energy (4.9%), Nordstrom (5.7%), Tractor Supply Company (4.7%) and Murphy Oil 4.7% - are popular short targets. It was a rotten day and a poor week for many long/short strategies. As for the ECB decision and the UK election, I'll this evening posit the briefest of thoughts. Mario Draghi has been kicking the can down the road since 2012, and he clearly is in no mood to see what happens when his leg turns weary. We'll apparently have to wait until later in the year to have a clearer understanding of the ECB's stimulus program end-game. The Wall Street Journal ran an interesting pre-meeting article - with the catchy headline "ECB Critic Holds His Tongue as Race Nears for Bank's Top Job" - discussing how the Germans have set their sights on the end of Draghi's term in 2019. June 7 - Wall Street Journal (Tom Fairless): "Jens Weidmann, the German central-bank chief who made his name by loudly attacking the European Central Bank's crisis-fighting efforts, has become a quiet defender of the ECB against its German critics. The shift has been subtle. Mr. Weidmann still criticizes the bank's radical stimulus measures. But his tone has softened as evidence accumulates that the ECB's policies are working—and as the race to become the institution's next president approaches. 'There is currently no doubt that an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate,' Mr. Weidmann said..., while suggesting he might not agree with his colleagues on the details. Only five years ago, he was boasting of clashes with fellow policy makers, and comparing easy-money policies to drugs and alcohol. As ECB officials gather Wednesday and Thursday in Estonia, what was once a bitter argument over the bank's far-reaching monetary stimulus is expected instead to be a pragmatic discussion about whether to start reducing it." And why the big surprise from the dismal Conservative party showing in the UK election? Has there been any brightening of the underlying dour public mood? Folks suddenly content with the "establishment," "elites" and the status quo? Feelings the "system" is working more fairly? Market and media complacency returned after Emmanuel Macron's huge market-pleasing victory in the French presidential election. I would suggest the Mr. Macron owes his presidency and apparent mandate to Mario Draghi. I wouldn't, however, wager on a long honeymoon period - let along some new golden age in French (and European) policy management. The political instability that had pundits fretting coming into 2017 is merely in a bit of remission. Wait until the ECB tap goes dry and the Draghi Bubble bursts. Closer to home, there was a new Federal Reserve "flow of funds" Z.1 report this week. From my perspective, interesting data raised more questions than were answered. Certainly not inconsistent with downshifting GDP (Q1 1.2% vs. Q4 2.1%), Credit growth somewhat fell off a cliff. Total Non-Financial Debt (NFD) growth slowed to a 1.4% pace in Q1, down from Q4 2016's 2.8% to the slowest expansion in years. In seasonally-adjusted and annualized (SAAR) dollars, NFD expanded $676bn in Q1, down from $1.338 TN in Q4 and $2.406 TN in Q1 2016. Seeing such data, I would normally be chronicling a dramatic tightening of Credit Availability and financial conditions. It's yet another example of these being the most abnormal of times. Household mortgage Credit expanded at a 3.0% rate during Q1, second only to Q4's 3.2% going all the way back to the pre-crisis era. Consumer (non-mortgage) Credit expanded at a 6.5% pace, matching Q4 (strongest since Q3 '15). Corporate borrowings bounced back strongly from Q4's abrupt stall (0.2%). Q1's 6.9% growth rate surpassed Q3's 6.3% and was the strongest expansion of Corporate borrowings since Q1 '16 (10.7%). Data just don't speak to a tightening of Credit conditions. Q1 saw Federal government borrowings contract at a 3.3% pace and State & Local borrowings fall at a 3.5% rate. It was this atypical decline in government Credit that largely explains Q1's tepid overall Credit expansion. At least at the federal level, a significant drawdown in deposits helps to explain the one-quarter hiatus from market borrowings. A Q2 bounce back in government borrowings should push system Credit growth significantly higher. To see booming securities markets in the face of 1.2% pace NFD growth is strange indeed. But while overall Non-Financial borrowings slowed to a crawl, the financial sector seemed to be frantically scurrying about. The Domestic Financial Sector's "Net Acquisition of Financial Assets" surged an unusual SAAR $4.840 TN (vs. Q4's $291bn and Q3's $2.716 TN). After three straight quarters of contraction, Net Interbank Assets expanded an extraordinary SAAR $1.589 TN. The Financial Sector also increased Miscellaneous Assets SAAR $1.811 TN, while expanding Debt Securities holdings SAAR $452bn and Fed Funds and Repos SAAR $158bn. Depository Institutions' Loans expanded a robust SAAR $924bn during Q1, up from Q4's SAAR $595bn but somewhat below Q1 '16's booming $1.241 TN. Clearly, booming asset markets had much more to do with a booming financial sector than a robust real economy. It would be quite unusual for booming markets not to provide some degree of economic stimulus, though bubbling markets create myriad fragilities. Securities markets remain the epicenter of this cycle's historic inflation. Q1 saw Equities increase a nominal $939bn to a record $40.755 TN. This boosted Equities as a percent of GDP to a record 214%. This compares to the previous peak levels from 2007 and 1999 of 181% and 202%. Total Debt Securities increased nominal $320bn during Q1 to a record $41.464 TN. Debt Securities-to-GDP at a near-record 218% has been relatively stable over recent quarters. Total (Debt and Equities) Securities ended Q1 at a record $82.220 TN and a record 432% of GDP. This compares to the cyclical peaks of 379% at Q3 2007 and 359% at Q1 2000. The Household Balance Sheet continues to be a centerpiece of U.S. Bubble Economy analysis. U.S. Household Assets ended Q1 at a record $110 TN, increasing $2.383 TN during the quarter. And with Household Liabilities up $36 billion (to $15.152 TN), Household Net Worth surged another (remarkable) $2.347 TN during the quarter to a record $94.835 TN. It's worth noting that Household Net Worth has now inflated $39.1 TN, or 70%, since Q1 2009. Over the past year, Net Worth inflated $7.259 TN, or 8.3%, one of the largest one-year gains on record. By major component, Household Financial Assets increased $1.781 TN during Q1 to a record $77.115 TN, with a notable one-year rise of $5.734 TN (8.0%). At 125% of GDP, Real Estate holdings gained $499bn during the quarter to a record $26.866 TN, with a large one-year rise of $1.794 TN (7.2%). Q1 Household Net Worth reached a record 498% of GDP. For comparison, Net Worth/GDP ended the ("decade of greed") eighties at 379%, Bubble year 1999 at 446% and peak mortgage finance Bubble 2007 at 461%. Unless something dramatic unfolds over the next few weeks, Net Worth/GDP will have cruised through 500% during Q2. It's worth noting that Household Total Equities (equities and mutual funds) holdings have doubled from 2009 levels to approach the record 129% of GDP from year-end 1999. Helping to offset tepid domestic Credit, Rest of World (ROW) had strong Q1 flows into U.S. financial assets. At SAAR $1.20 TN, Q1 ROW flows compare to an outflow of SAAR $187bn in Q4 and an inflow of SAAR $501bn in Q1 2016. Curiously, Treasury purchases (SAAR $344bn) dominated flows into U.S. debt securities and were the strongest since 2014. Purchases of U.S. corporates slowed to SAAR $132bn, down from Q4's SAAR $433bn. After big Q4 outflows (SAAR $480bn), ROW increased U.S. equities holdings SAAR $219bn during Q1. It's difficult to comprehend that ROW holdings of U.S. financial assets have grown to almost $25 TN, inflating about ten-fold from the mid-nineties. Returning to the markets, players will spend the weekend pondering whether Friday's tech swoon was a mere flash in the pan or the beginning of something more serious. That intense selling manifested from market dynamics rather than in response to some news event might make it more difficult to spin. Rotations have become a common feature of this speculative marketplace, and the bulls will spin rotations positively. This week saw previous underperformers gain momentum, while the highflyer Wall Street darlings saw melt-ups rather abruptly indicate potential trouble below. When the Crowded Trade phenomenon has finally made it to the top of the food chain - to a select group of speculative favorite megacaps - a big rotation away from the darlings will present a formidable market challenge. From my vantage point, such dynamics are consistent with equities (and risk markets) working toward putting in a major top.   For the Week: The S&P500 slipped 0.3% (up 8.6% y-t-d), while the Dow added 0.3% (up 7.6%).

Trump Administration Watch: June 6 - Wall Street Journal (Kristina Peterson, Stephanie Armour and Louise Radnofsky): "Republican senators left their first decision-making meeting on overhauling the nation's health-care system Tuesday deeply divided over the fate of Medicaid, a fissure that threatens to thwart their ambitions to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The divide among Senate Republicans over Medicaid was wide enough that some GOP lawmakers and aides said they now believe it may be impossible to broker a deal to unwind the health law known as Obamacare. Some senators are already preparing to move to another goal, an overhaul of the tax code. 'It's more likely to fail than not,' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said of the health bill... 'We need to bring this to an end and move to taxes.'" June 6 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth and Ben McLannahan): "Investors are growing more sceptical that the Trump administration will be able to nurture an economic bounce, with Treasury yields and the US dollar sagging to new post-election lows and the US equity market increasingly dependent on technology stocks to maintain its highs. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped as low as 2.13% on Tuesday, its lowest since the immediate post-election surge in November." China Bubble Watch: June 3 - New York Times (Ryan McMorrow): "When a Chinese tech company with global ambitions began to run short of cash last year, it sought billions of dollars from new investors. One of them was a music teacher. Li Shenghong, who teaches out of a mall storefront in southern China, was already a fan of the smartphones and televisions sold by the company, an internet-and-gadgets conglomerate called LeEco. When LeEco also began selling investment products online, Mr. Li snapped them up, even though the company said little about where the money would go. 'Whenever I have leftover money from my salary, I'll invest it,' Mr. Li said, explaining that he had invested $7,000 in the company. 'My spare change? I put it in.' LeEco, buffeted by rapid expansion, has turned to murky and potentially risky ways to stay afloat, including tapping China's shadowy informal banking system, which many people believe threatens the Chinese economy." June 4 - Wall Street Journal (Chao Deng and Lingling Wei): "China's crackdown on debt is driving some companies to a murkier form of financing as it gets harder to secure bank loans or tap the bond market. New loans from so-called trusts, firms that raise money from individuals and corporations to plow into riskier areas of the economy, reached 882.3 billion yuan ($129.5 billion) in the first four months of this year..., nearly five times as much as the same period in 2016. Trust firms, which often charge borrowers higher rates than banks, occupy a middle ground between banking and asset management. They are licensed and loosely regulated by China's banking watchdog, but they lack some of banks' protections, such as government deposit insurance, and they have more flexibility to invest in risky areas than banks do." June 6 - Wall Street Journal (Shen Hong): "A sharp rise in the cost of borrowing in China's bond markets is the latest sign of conflict between Beijing's effort to rein in financial-system risk and its long-term goal of modernizing the economy. In a little-noticed shift, Chinese companies in recent weeks have been able to take out medium-term bank loans at a lower interest rate than bond investors demand. The average yield on AAA-rated five-year corporate bonds, currently 4.90%, has been above the central bank's corresponding benchmark lending rate of 4.75% since May 3... The highly unusual reversal—it hadn't happened since records began in 2006—is largely down to Chinese regulators' attempts to tamp down speculation by investment funds that borrow heavily to leverage their bets." June 5 - Reuters (Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo): "Activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in fourth months in May thanks to a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed, helping to offset worries about unexpected weakness in manufacturing. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.8 in May from April's 51.5, breaking a four-month decline and marking the highest reading since January." June 7 - Reuters (Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao): "China's foreign exchange reserves rose in May for a fourth consecutive month and by more than markets had expected, as stringent capital control measures and a weakening in the dollar helped staunch outflows. Reserves rose $24 billion in May to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion, compared with an increase of $21 billion in April... It was the first time since June 2014 that reserves climbed for four months in a row, and the biggest gain since reserves moved back above the closely watched $3 trillion level in February." June 7 - Bloomberg: "China's overseas shipments accelerated from a year earlier in May, aided by more buoyant global demand, and robust imports signaled resilience in the domestic economy. Exports rose 8.7% in May in dollar terms, more than the 7.2% increase forecast... Imports surged 14.8% in dollar terms, more than the 8.3% forecast. The trade surplus widened to $40.81 billion." Europe Watch: June 7 - Reuters (Jesús Aguado and Francesco Guarascio): "European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue on Wednesday by Santander, the country's biggest lender. Owners of Popular bonds faces losses of some 2 billion euros, while Santander will ask its shareholders for around 7 billion euros ($7.9bn) of capital to absorb Spain's sixth biggest bank." June 7 - Reuters (Francesco Guarascio and Stefano Bernabei): "European Union regulators believe their rescue of Spanish lender Banco Popular has strengthened the case for intervening in Italy's two weakest lenders, but expect it will be harder to use the same approach, a senior EU official said... EU regulators arranged for Spain's biggest bank, Santander, to take over Banco Popular, but only after wiping out the investments of the troubled lender's shareholders and junior creditors -- a move welcomed by financial markets which saw it as a possible template for other EU banking crises." June 8 - Reuters (Gavin Jones): "A proposed Italian electoral law that looked set to usher in early elections has lost the support of major parties, sending shares and bonds higher and easing nerves among investors wary of yet more political uncertainty in Europe. 'The accord on the electoral law is dead,' Emanuele Fiano, a deputy from the ruling Democratic Party... told reporters after his group lost a parliamentary vote on a proposed amendment." June 8 - Bloomberg (Carolynn Look): "German industrial production rose more than analysts predicted, with a fourth consecutive increase in manufacturing adding to signs of underlying strength in Europe's largest economy. Output... jumped 0.8% in April after an upwardly revised drop of 0.1%... The typically volatile measure compares with a median estimate for a 0.5% gain in a Bloomberg survey. Production was up 2.9% from a year earlier." June 7 - Financial Times (Mehreen Khan): "Things are on the up for the eurozone economy. With growth accelerating, unemployment steadily falling, and inflation at comfortable levels, the European Central Bank should be resting easy that its more than two-year stimulus experiment is bearing dividend after years of concerns about the eurozone's political stability. But there are still some worries for the central bank of 19 eurozone countries. Among them is a growing headache over the implementation of its QE measures and more specifically, a shortage of available German bonds. Latest data from the central bank's QE holdings show the ECB fell short of its monthly target for German bond purchases for the second month in a row in May, raising concerns about the longevity of the aggressive stimulus policies in place since 2015." Brexit Watch: June 9 - Reuters (David Milliken and Kate Holton): "British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would lead a minority government backed by a small Northern Irish party after she lost an election gamble days before the start of talks on Britain's departure from the European Union. May called the snap election confident her Conservative Party would increase its majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit talks. Instead, Thursday's vote damaged her authority and made her negotiating position more vulnerable to criticism." Global Bubble Watch: June 6 - Bloomberg (Miles Weiss): "High up in a New York City skyscraper, China's biggest bank is playing in the shadows of American finance. The prize for Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. isn't stocks, bonds or currencies. It's the grease in the wheels of all those markets: repurchase agreements. By exploiting a loophole in rules intended to keep U.S. banks from getting 'too big to fail,' the state-owned ICBC has become a go-to dealer in repos in just a few short years, alongside longtime powerhouses like Goldman Sachs... The short-term loans allow investors to borrow money by lending securities, serving a vital role in day-to-day trading on Wall Street. ICBC's rise reflects not only China's global ambitions in high finance, but also how post-crisis rules have let a whole host of new players profit from the murky world of shadow banking, largely beyond the reach of bank regulators." June 5 - Bloomberg (Noah Smith): "In the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin asks his dad how engineers determine the weight limit on bridges. The dad answers that they do this by driving heavier and heavier trucks over the bridge until it breaks, then rebuild the bridge after discovering what it took to break it. This isn't how engineers actually figure out the safety specifications of bridges -- since they know a lot about how physics works, they can predict how much it would take to break a bridge without actually breaking it. But the same isn't true in the financial world. No one knows the basic laws that govern asset markets, so there's a tendency to use new technologies until they fail, then start over. Calvin's dad was effectively describing the process by which we test financial innovation. Mortgage-backed bonds are a good example... In the years since the crisis, financial markets have started to be transformed by a new innovation -- exchange-traded funds." June 6 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "Is leverage, the poison that brought the global economy to its knees less than a decade ago, creeping back into financial markets? The global economy is enjoying a rare spell of broad if not strong growth, financial markets are tranquil, corporate earnings are buoyant, and monetary policy remains supportive. As a result, the MSCI World equity index sits at a record, up more than 11% so far this year, while bond markets are becalmed. Yet some investors, analysts and economists fret that beneath the calm surface there are some worrying cross-currents that could turn the sea choppy once more. In particular, signs that leverage — in the form of borrowed money or derivatives when they are used to amplify bets on asset prices — is creeping up. 'The low volatility frightens me, because I know what it does to people's behaviour,' says Robert Frey, chief investment officer at FQS, a fund-of-hedge-funds... He compares it to building a flimsy oceanfront house because there have been no storms recently. 'Eventually a hurricane will hit and the house will fall down.'" June 7 - Bloomberg (Beth Jinks and Simone Foxman): "Billionaire investor Paul Singer said 'distorted' monetary and regulatory policies have increased risks for investors almost a decade after the financial crisis.'I am very concerned about where we are,' Singer said... 'What we have today is a global financial system that's just about as leveraged -- and in many cases more leveraged -- than before 2008, and I don't think the financial system is more sound.' Years of low rates have eroded the effectiveness of central banks to contend with downturns, Singer said..." June 7 - Bloomberg (Enda Curran): "Central bankers and investors are grappling with a $100 trillion question: why consumer price inflation remains so low in most parts of the world even as economic growth quickens. Compounding the riddle, question marks are now emerging over the one part of the global inflation picture that had been moving higher -- producer prices. That's because two engines of that turnaround -- China's resurgent factories and prospects for tax-cut fueled stimulus under President Donald Trump -- are showing signs of fading. Which way the inflation mystery unravels is crucial for the global monetary policy outlook and the world's $100 trillion bond market." June 5 - Bloomberg (Greg Quinn and Erik Hertzberg): "Toronto's housing fever is showing signs of cooling as price gains slowed and new listings surged in May, the first full month reflecting a new tax on foreign buyers and a crisis at mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. The number of new listings soared 49% last month from a year earlier to 25,837, the biggest increase since 2010... The average price rose 15% to C$863,910 ($640,076), compared with annual gains of 25% in April and 33% in March. The benchmark price index, which measures more typical mid-priced homes, rose 29%, also down from a 32% gain in April." June 7 - Wall Street Journal (James Glynn): "Data analyst Ben Reid recently took out a 25-year loan on a home outside Sydney despite a frothy housing market in Australia, believing in the market's staying power. Payments on the $500,000 mortgage will consume about half his take-home pay. 'I'd like a new car in the next couple of years but not sure where that cash will come from,' said Mr. Reid... Big personal debts and spending worries like Mr. Reid's are a gathering storm over Australia's economy, threatening a 25-year streak without recession. Growth rose an anemic 0.3% in the first quarter.., putting annual growth on track to be the weakest since September 2009... Australian household debt has risen to a record 212% of income, according to the latest available data... That's the fourth-highest globally..." June 7 - Wall Street Journal (Lynn Cook): "American oil exports are emerging as a disruptive new force in global markets. The U.S. exported 1 million barrels of oil a day during some months so far this year—double the pace of 2016—and is on track to average that amount for all of 2017... In another era, a domestic glut and low prices, currently hovering under $50 a barrel, might have caused companies to slow the pace of drilling. But since Congress lifted a ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, shipments out of Texas and Louisiana have skyrocketed, taking the fruits of the U.S. fracking revolution to new markets." Federal Reserve Watch: June 5 - CNBC (Jeff Cox): "President Donald Trump appears ready to remake the Federal Reserve in an image that will be considerably different than what investors have known for many years. The president is prepared to nominate Randal Quarles and Marvin Goodfriend to two of three vacancies at the central bank, according to multiple press accounts... Quarles likely would assume the role vacated by Daniel Tarullo to oversee the nation's banking system... Should Trump nominate the two men and they receive confirmation, it will represent the first steps in a possible substantial remaking of a Fed that has practiced ultra-loose monetary policy for the past decade but has been tight on banking regulations. Trump will have the opportunity to name one more person now, then can fill two even more critical vacancies in 2018 — that of Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. If the Quarles and Goodfriend moves are indicators of what's to come, things could start getting less comfortable for Yellen. Both are considered solidly conservative, in line with the Republican president and Congress but perhaps not with Yellen." U.S. Bubble Watch: June 7 - New York Times (Landon Thomas Jr.): "Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google. Not only do they dominate our daily lives, but as their stocks continue to soar, these technology giants may also dictate our financial futures. In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes — Amazon leads the way, up 206%; Apple trails the pack with a 67% gain — as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies. But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause... 'There is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,' said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist... 'No one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.'" June 4 - Wall Street Journal (Lev Borodovsky, Ben Eisen and Tom DeStefano): "By now it's no epiphany that technology stocks are in favor. Apple recently passed $800 billion in market value for the first time, and both Amazon.com and Alphabet, the parent of Google, are each hovering around the rarely seen $1,000-a-share level. What you may not know is that by one measure, the 2017 tech-stock rally is already at levels last seen in 2000. The S&P technology sector accounts for nearly a quarter of the S&P 500's market value. The last time that happened was 1999." June 6 - CNBC (Diana Olick): "This spring may be one of the hottest sellers' markets in history, but even off-the-chart-demand can't put every potential buyer in a home of their own. If the house is too expensive for the region's demand, it won't sell. That is becoming the case in more and more neighborhoods this spring — and is likely behind the first sign that big price gains are starting to shrink. Home values rose a healthy 6.9% in April compared with April 2016, ...but that is a drop from the 7.1% annual gain in March... 'I think we are beginning to see it in selected markets,' said Frank Nothaft, CoreLogic's chief economist. 'You just can't have house prices grow at 7% year after year, when income growth is 2-3% a year.'" June 6 - Bloomberg (Vince Golle): "If you're building or renovating a home in the U.S. these days, you've got plenty of company. Americans' spending on residential construction projects -- from the pouring of foundations to home improvement -- just hammered out its strongest three-month period since 1994. Solid job growth, low borrowing costs and a recovery in home equity since the market crash a decade ago are generating momentum... While a report... showed a 2.9% drop in April outlays for improvements from the prior month, such spending was still 32.3% higher than it was a year ago." June 6 - Bloomberg (Sho Chandra): "An increase in U.S. job openings in April to a record high indicates demand for workers remains strong in the world's largest economy while the supply is tightening, a Labor Department report showed... Number of positions waiting to be filled rose by 259k to 6.044m (est. 5.75m), from revised 5.785m in March, according to Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS..." June 6 - Bloomberg (Patricia Laya): "Chief executive officers of some of the largest U.S. companies are becoming even more sanguine about sales and spending, a good omen for the economy after a lackluster first-quarter expansion, according to a quarterly survey from the Business Roundtable... Main index gained 0.6 point to 93.9, highest since 2Q 2014..." June 7 - Bloomberg (John Gittelsohn and Erik Schatzker): "U.S. markets are at their highest risk levels since before the 2008 financial crisis because investors are paying a high price for the chances they're taking, according to Bill Gross, manager of the $2 billion Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund. 'Instead of buying low and selling high, you're buying high and crossing your fingers,' Gross, 73, said... Central bank policies for low-and negative-interest rates are artificially driving up asset prices while creating little growth in the real economy and punishing individual savers, banks and insurance companies, according to Gross." June 6 - Bloomberg (Matt Scully): "After bingeing on credit for a half decade, U.S. consumers may finally be feeling the hangover. Americans faced with lackluster income growth have been financing more of their spending with debt instead. There are early signs that loan burdens are growing unsustainably large for borrowers with lower incomes. Household borrowings have surged to a record $12.73 trillion, and the percentage of debt that is overdue has risen for two consecutive quarters." Japan Watch: June 8 - Bloomberg (Toru Fujioka and Masahiro Hidaka): "The Bank of Japan is re-calibrating its communications to acknowledge that it is thinking about how to handle a future exit from monetary stimulus, without giving the impression that this is on the agenda anytime soon, according to people with knowledge of discussions... With inflation still far below target, the BOJ is contending with increasing debate about exit in markets, the media and among some lawmakers. Officials realize it's unrealistic and unconstructive to try to remain silent on the issue and the BOJ now wants to make it known that it's conducting simulations internally on how an exit could play out... Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who has been called before parliament 18 times this year, was grilled by lawmakers last month on his thinking about post-stimulus policy. Kuroda responded by saying he would carefully consider external communications..." EM Watch: June 3 - Reuters (Anthony Boadle and Lisandra Paraguassú): "Former Brazilian lawmaker Rodrigo Rocha Loures, a close aide and friend of President Michel Temer, was arrested at his home on Saturday in a corruption investigation that also targets the president... In a police video released in May, Loures was seen running out of a Sao Paulo restaurant carrying a bag with 500,000 reais ($154,000) in cash that prosecutors say was a bribe from the owners of the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA. Plea bargain testimony by two executives of JBS's holding company J&F Investimentos SA implicated Temer and other politicians in graft..." June 6 - Bloomberg (Arabile Gumede, Amogelang Mbatha, and Aarti Bhana): "South Africa's economy fell into a recession for the first time since 2009 after it contracted for a second straight quarter in the first three months of the year as all bar two industries shrank. Gross domestic product receded an annualized 0.7% in the first quarter from a contraction of 0.3% in the previous three months..." June 8 - Reuters (Andrew Torchia): "Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt... as the riyal currency fell to an 11-year low amid signs that portfolio investment funds were flowing out of the country because of Doha's diplomatic rift with other Arab states. S&P cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications..." Leveraged Speculator Watch: June 5 - Bloomberg (Miles Weiss and Katherine Burton): "The walls keep closing in on John Paulson. A decade after Paulson shot to fame betting on the collapse of the U.S. housing market, the hedge-fund mogul is struggling to persuade investors to stick with him after a string of missteps on everything from gold to European bonds to drug stocks. Since the end of 2015 alone, assets at Paulson & Co. have fallen by $6 billion from losses and client withdrawals. The decline, underscored in the firm's most recent regulatory filing, leaves Paulson and his employees with just $2 billion in client money." Geopolitical Watch: June 5 - Financial Times (Erika Solomon): "Qatar paid up to $1bn to release members of the Gulf state's royal family who were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip, according to people involved in the hostage deal — one of the triggers behind Gulf states' dramatic decision to cut ties with Doha. Commanders of militant groups and government officials in the region told the Financial Times that Doha spent the money in a transaction that secured the release of 26 members of a Qatari falconry party in southern Iraq and about 50 militants captured by jihadis in Syria. By their telling, Qatar paid off two of the most frequently blacklisted forces of the Middle East in one fell swoop: an al-Qaeda affiliate fighting in Syria and Iranian security officials. The deal, which was concluded in April, heightened concerns among Qatar's neighbours about the small gas-rich state's role in a region plagued by conflict and bitter rivalries." June 7 - Financial Times (Monavar Khalaj and Erika Solomon): "Iran's Revolutionary Guards ratcheted up the tensions with Saudi Arabia as it accused Tehran's regional rival of involvement in Wednesday's double terrorist attack in the capital... Gunmen and suicide bombers launched simultaneous attacks on the parliament building in Tehran and the nearby shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's founder. The attacks were claimed by Isis, in what would be the jihadi group's first significant strike in the Islamic Republic. However a statement from the Revolutionary Guards linked the 'brutal attack' to Donald Trump's visit last month to Riyadh, where the US president singled out Iran for fuelling 'the fires of sectarian conflict and terror'." June 4 - Reuters: "China has expressed its strong dissatisfaction with what it labeled 'irresponsible remarks' on the South China Sea by U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis during a security forum at the weekend. Mattis accused China of having contempt for other nations' interests and disregarding international law. He told the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that the construction and militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea undermined regional stability."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.

In a change to the App Store rules this week, Apple said it will now enforce hard limits on how review prompts show up and how often users have to see them. The changes were first spotted by 9to5Mac. Popular Searches Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 53.01 +0.17 +0.32% Keppel Corp Ltd KPELF ▼ 4.62 -0.11 -2.37% SembCorp Marine Ltd SMBMY ▼ 12.29 -0.52 -4.06% Sembcorp Industries Ltd SCRPF ▲ 2.28 +0.09 +4.11% Under the new rules, developers will no longer be able to display review prompts however and whenever they’d like. Instead, there’ll be two key restrictions that should reduce headaches for everyone: First, apps will be required to use a new Apple-made review prompt, which allows users to leave a rating without exiting an app. That’s a huge convenience that may well get a lot more people to leave ratings. Apple introduced the rating prompt a few months ago, but it’s been optional up until now. This seems like a win-win for developers and users The second restriction is on how often that prompt can show up. An app can only display the prompt three times a year, regardless of how often it’s been updated. And once a user has left a rating, they’ll never see it again. Users also have the option to completely disable app review prompts inside the iOS Settings app, preventing the prompts from annoying them at all. This seems like it should be a win-win for users and developers. People have been annoyed by app review prompts for years, and this update seems to remedy the problem. It may even make people more interested in leaving a review, because it can be done without exiting the app and because it means they’ll be done with the prompt for good. If that results in more reviews — and reviews from users who aren’t annoyed about switching apps — that’s a good thing for developers, too. Part of the reason developers have their apps show review prompts so often is because Apple has always reset an app’s rating after every update, even very minor ones. With the redesigned App Store, developers will have the option to change that, so that their app’s ratings are maintained between updates. That’s likely to become a common choice — for good apps, at least — since users will only be able to get prompted for a rating once. Here’s what the prompt looks like in an app: Request reviews with iOS 10.3’s SKStoreReviewController: https://t.co/HgugUTrN81pic.twitter.com/gYjVfJu1Xq— Xamarin (@xamarinhq) April 20, 2017 Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The iMac Pro was perhaps the most impressive announcement at WWDC this year; it promises to be the most powerful computer Apple has ever made when it arrives in December. The $4,999 starting price will leave many eyes watering, but the iMac Pro is packed with extremely powerful hardware and sports a beautiful display. Because of its design, size, specs, and price, it will go head to head with the Microsoft Surface Studio, the most comparable Windows PC. The most expensive Studio configuration (which is what PCMag reviewed) comes in at $4,199, so even the base iMac Pro is a pricier proposition. Which one is best for you? Operating system is the obvious difference, and you'll have to wait to get your hands on an iMac Pro, but there are several other key differences between the two to consider. Name Apple iMac Pro Microsoft Surface Studio   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $4999.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $2999.00 MSRP Editor Rating   Processor Name Intel Xeon Intel Core i7-6820HQ Processor Speed 4.5 GHz 2.7 GHz Operating System Apple macOS High Sierra Windows 10 Pro RAM 32 GB 32 GB Storage Capacity (as Tested) 1 TB 2 TB Graphics Card AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M Screen Size 27 inches 28 inches Resolution 5120 x 2880 4500 x 3000 Storage Type SSD HDD, SSD   Read the Review Read the Review Examining the specs, Apple's desktop does have a power advantage, with more recent (and generally faster) components. We dinged the Surface Studio for not having the most cutting-edge components at the time of launch, and the iMac will already had an advantage by coming out after the Studio. On the other hand, the Studio's innovative design—namely the reclining touch-screen display—might be more to your liking, and offers new avenues to creatives for systems of this type. To get more specific with the specs, let's first take a look at the most visible aspect—the displays. They make up almost the entirety of both machines, and the Studio was clearly inspired by the design of past iMacs. Both have extraordinary, better-than-4K resolutions, albeit at different aspect ratios. The Studio's 28-inch screen features a 4,500-by-3,000 resolution, while the iMac Pro's 27-inch screen is 5,120 by 2,880 (the same as the 2015 27-inch iMac). The brightness has improved on all new iMacs, and it now supports one billion colors. Quality-wise, the screens are just about a wash, as you'll hardly be left complaining about the resolution on either device, and they both support the P3 color gamut. That said, there's a huge departure when you consider the Studio's touch capability, which is an area Apple simply refuses to go with its computers. Touch—combined with ability to recline the Studio like a digital canvas—gives the Studio much more versatility for content creation, as discussed in depth in our review. If you only draw or design in programs with a mouse, touch may not be needed—but the inclusion does expand your future options. Streamlining the creative process from separate (and expensive) drawing tablets into one device can be very appealing if you're a digital artist. In terms of computing power, though, the iMac Pro has the Studio beat. Apple is positioning the iMac Pro as a true workstation, and its Xeon CPU backs up that claim. The base model includes an 8-core processor and 32GB of memory, which will be lighting fast. As stated, the Surface Surface Studio was slightly behind at launch—it lacks a newer Kaby Lake chip, though its Intel Core i7-6820HQ Skylake CPU is still fast. Compared side by side, though, the iMac Pro will be much more capable at quickly crunching through data, encoding video, and general multitasking. The iMac's powerful AMD Radeon Vega graphics really set it apart, as well: These (still somewhat mysterious) cards from AMD are meant to compete with Nvidia's top Quadro cards, so there should be tremendous 3D capability packed within the iMac Pro. The Studio does have discrete graphics, but its Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M, while capable, is not on the same level. The iMac Pro has a leg up in gaming, where these cards typically come into play the most, but that's not the target iMac Pro buyer. As a workstation, high-end graphics cards are for video and photo editors, animators, graphic designers, and more, as they accelerate rendering and load times in many of these processes. The Vega card will also be VR capable, something Apple pushed at WWDC, while the Studio's card is not. The two desktops are fairly similar in terms of port offerings—they both include USB 3.0, SD card slots, and Ethernet—but the Studio offers mini DisplayPort for video output and lacks any USB-C connectivity. The iMac Pro doesn't include mini DisplayPort, but USB-C is more versatile with adapters and is generally more useful for transferring media and other files. Related Buy a New Apple iMac or Wait for iMac Pro? Buy a New Apple iMac or Wait for iMac Pro? An important note is that the Studio configuration we tested comes with 2TB of storage, while the base iMac Pro only has 1TB. Overall, there's no doubt the iMac Pro packs more powerful, newer hardware than the Studio. It does so at a higher price, and is launching about half a year later, but the advantage remains nonetheless. That said, the Studio offers a whole realm of options the iMac does not thanks to its touch screen, making it more than just a speedy desktop. It can streamline the process of separate drawing tablets and other devices into one product thanks to its pen, the Surface Dial, and touch screen. The operating systems are of course another major distinction, but if that's not a restricting factor, the iMac Pro is the choice for pure power, while the less expensive Surface Studio can be your desktop and digital creation tool in one.

But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device -- in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent to $152.56 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers -- Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers -- and the same technique to mask performance disparities -- for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks -- a year after Samsung Electronics Co. added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 percent of Apple’s $216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 percent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Luring Customers The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast: Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year -- with the exception of iPhones. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tech Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: June 12 Puerto RicoPuerto Rico Votes in Favor of American Statehood, But in a Non-Binding Plebiscite with a Low Turnout PoliticsU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions Will Face Questioning Over James Comey and the Russia Inquiry Fortune 500Here’s Microsoft’s New Xbox One X Video Game Console Fortune 500 Hardware Steals the Show at Apple’s Software Confab Don Reisinger Jun 10, 2017 Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) was supposed to be a software affair. It wasn't. After more than two hours on Monday, Apple's 2017 looked much different. There were new operating system announcements, of course, including a new version of the company's mobile operating system iOS and desktop operating system macOS, but the tech giant also fired its first shot into the smart home market. Apple also showcased some new iPads and new computers, and said that it's planning to offer its most powerful Mac ever later this year. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter But it wasn't all about WWDC this week. Apple CEO Tim Cook chimed in on President Donald Trump's decision on the Paris climate accord and the company even released an ad to make that point clearer. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Read on for this week's biggest Apple news: One of Apple's (aapl) biggest hardware announcements centered on the company's line of iMac desktops. Apple said that its new iMacs come with brighter screens and faster processors, which should translate to better visual quality and performance, respectively. Additionally, Apple, which also announced MacBook Pro updates, announced a new high-end iMac, called the iMac Pro, that the company says, will offer the best performance of any Mac it's ever released. The minor iMac and MacBook Pro updates are available for customers to order now, but the company won't release the iMac Pro until December. Apple has made some sizable changes to its line of professionally focused iPad Pro tablets. First up, the company said that it's eliminated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in favor of a 10.5-inch model. Apple also said that it's improved the display for both the 10.5- and 12.9-inch models, so they're brighter and can display better graphics. An update to the screen's refresh rate, or the amount of time it takes to show different frames of movement, has increased to 120Hz, which Apple says, should make its Apple Pencil stylus feel more responsive. The new iPad Pros are available now to order. Apple is entering the smart home market to compete against Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. At WWDC, the company announced a new smart home speaker called HomePod that can both play music and other audio, as well as respond to voice commands through communication with the company's virtual personal assistant Siri. Apple says HomePod will communicate with smart home devices, like smart lightbulbs or thermostats, allowing users to control them with only a voice command. HomePod will be available in December for $349. Apple's first big announcement at WWDC centered on watchOS, the company's smartwatch operating system. Apple said that watchOS 4, which will be available as a free download in the fall, will come with improved watch faces that will deliver information, like upcoming events and app notifications, based on how the Apple Watch owner typically uses the operating system. Also in the fall, Apple will release macOS High Sierra, its latest desktop operating system. The update includes some design tweaks that will make using the operating system more intuitive, as well as faster app and file response times. Apple's mobile operating system iOS 11 will look nearly identical to last year's iOS 10, but include some important tweaks, including an improved Control Panel that will make it easier for users to control apps and operating system functions. Apple's texting app Messages has been redesigned, and iOS 11 will support person-to-person money transfers through Apple Pay. The software is coming to iPhones and iPads this fall. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Bloomberg in an interview this week that Apple aided the U.K. government in its investigations into recent terrorist attacks across the country. He said that the U.K. government used a "lawful process" to obtain data from his company's servers, but he didn't disclose the nature of the information shared with authorities. One more thing...Apple isn't pleased with President Trump's decision to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. And it's responded with a new ad narrated by famed astronomer Carl Sagan.

Both the OnePlus 5 and iPhone 8 are likely to exceed the capabilities of the Galaxy S8, marginalizing the Samsung smartphone competitor. And a benchmark published on the popular Geekbench site suggest that a forthcoming Motorola device will also exceed the Galaxy S8. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 2 is also on the horizon. Image Credit: AndroidPolice.com iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8 vs. OnePlus 5 specs comparison Statistics relating to this Motorola offering suggest that the device will outperform the Galaxy S8. Geekbench data indicates that the handset in question earned a score of 1,879 on the single-core Geekbench tests and a score of 6,503 on the multi-core tests. This compares favorably with the Galaxy S8 version available in the Western marketplace, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon series, which only achieved a score of 1,304 in the single-core test and 4,059 on the multi-core quotient. And both the forthcoming OnePlus 5 and iPhone 8 will also challenge the Galaxy S8, compromising its position in the smartphone needs. Many of the specs for the OnePlus 5 have now been established, with good estimations available for the iPhone range as well. And it must be borne in mind that the OnePlus device will be significantly more affordable than either the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8. Display The OnePlus 5 will likely deliver a 5.5-inch display with 2,560 x 1,440-pixel QHD resolution. This is marginally smaller than the Galaxy S8 screen, but nonetheless compares pretty favorably in terms of pixels per inch rating. This must be of concern to Samsung considering the much smaller price tag for the OnePlus 5. Meanwhile, indications are that Apple will switch to OLED technology in 2017, delivering an iPhone 8 designed with a wraparound screen and slimmed down bezels. This could have a massive impact on the iPhone 8 generation, with the smartphone from Apple attracting new consumers with its interesting new design. Apple is also expected to increase the display size of the iPhone 8, meaning that it will match the Galaxy S8. If the iPhone 8 is also a quad HD smartphone, it will definitely diminish some of the advantage that Samsung has traditionally enjoyed in this department. Camera It has been confirmed that the OnePlus 5 will feature dual-rear cameras, while an eight-megapixel front camera has also been linked with this smartphone. This means that the affordable handset will deliver pretty outstanding photographic capabilities, which should exceed those of the Galaxy S8. The 12-megapixel camera included in the Galaxy S8 was certainly decent, with the optical image stabilization function particularly praised. But the dual-lens in the OnePlus 5 could render the photographic ability of the Galaxy S8 rather limited by comparison. It is early for the camera system in the iPhone 8 to be anything like confirmed, but it is strongly believed that Apple will include a dual-sensor. This would leave the snapper in the Galaxy S8 rather lagging behind both the OnePlus 5 and iPhone 8. Processor A Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor has already been confirmed for the OnePlus 5 release, exactly the same processor that is already utilized the Galaxy S8 series. The chip used in the Galaxy S8 was an octa-core processor, with one bundle of 2.35GHz Kryo cores and four 1.9GHz cores being used for background tasks that are less processor-intensive. While the Galaxy S8 will compete perfectly well with the OnePlus 5 in this department, the fact that the latter will be significantly more affordable will be a massive advantage for Samsung. Furthermore, the A11 chip to be included in the iPhone 8 is expected to be both significantly faster and more efficient with power than the existing generation. Manufactured on a 16-nanometer process it will deliver both better performance and improved battery life, making the iPhone 8 release an exciting one indeed. Memory The OnePlus 5 has been linked with a pretty stonking 8GB of RAM memory. At the very least, the smartphone is expected to include 6GB of memory, meaning that it will significantly outrank the Galaxy S8 in this department. With Apple also increasing the RAM memory in the iPhone 8 to 4GB, this means that the once upon a time spec-heavy Galaxy S8 will be at least matched by two of its big rivals, with the potential for the OnePlus 5 to include double the memory of the Samsung handset. This will certainly translate into performance improvements, and it makes one wonder why Samsung didn’t include the 6GB of memory that was frequently linked with the S8 as well as the forthcoming Galaxy Note 8. Battery The 3,600mAh battery that will be included in the OnePlus 5 is significantly larger than the 3,000 mAh cell that features in the Galaxy S8. With the iPhone 8 likely to close the gap on the Samsung competitor, with a 2,700 mAh battery and power-saving functionality being linked with the Apple smartphone, an area in which Samsung has held the edge appears to have dissolved completely. Prices of iPhone 8 and OnePlus 5 Finally, the price of the OnePlus 5 is a massive plus point for the developer of this handset, starting at an incredibly competitive for $499. With the Galaxy S8 still retailing at between $700 and $800 on Amazon.com, this obviously means that the forthcoming handset will significantly undercut the Samsung flagship. This is one area in which the iPhone 8 probably doesn’t particularly threaten the Galaxy S8, with reports suggesting that this significantly redesigned Apple handset will retail at over $1,000. Nonetheless, in a technology landscape in which things move fast, it is clear that the Galaxy S8 faces massive challenges from both the OnePlus 5 and the iPhone 8 in the coming months, while the Motorola Moto Z2 also looks like a nifty and powerful handset.

Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris   Elizabeth Dwoskin The Washington Post     SAN JOSE, Calif. -- In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when the firm's co-founder Steve Jobs launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's long-standing penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday -- the same event where Jobs introduced Siri -- the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new stand-alone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" -- an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultrafast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling -- was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute -- or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software tool kit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind -- and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protégé of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates -- Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks -- but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise -- or bad information -- into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days -- there is plenty of time to catch up."

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post WP Bloomberg     Hey Siri, what did Apple announce this week? The firm is jumping into a whole new product category -- the home hub. Chief executive Tim Cook on Monday introduced Apple's voice-enabled smart speaker, the HomePod, at the company's annual developers conference, finally entering the home hub fray. The announcement was the most notable from the event, which packed in a lot of hardware and software updates. Apple's new product is a competitor to Google's Home and Amazon's Echo line of smart speakers, which have taken an early lead in the young product category. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Just like its competitors, the HomePod will be able to answer basic questions such as what the weather will be like or how bad traffic is. But the real selling point, as far as Apple is concerned, is the HomePod's sound quality. The $349 HomePod looks to provide an alternative to high-end speakers from competitors such as Bose and Sonos as well as the cheaper home hubs from its fellow tech giants. In that way, Apple is sticking to its normal playbook and focusing on consumers willing to shell out more cash -- a strategy that can mean fewer sales but generally leads to greater profits. Onstage, Apple's worldwide head of marketing, Phil Schiller, described how the speaker analyzes the song it's playing and adjusts its output. For example, with a vocal-heavy track, it may emphasize middle tones, while a song with a driving beat will get more emphasis on the bass. The idea is that consumers will never have to mess with settings to optimize their speaker output. HomePod owners also won't have to tinker with the speaker to fit its position in a room, Apple said. The speaker is able to detect the surfaces around it and will beam sound to the right spot. If you link multiple speakers, they will adjust to one another's positions. The company, however, did not show off the speaker's Siri-enabled features Monday, saying it would release more information at a later date. Some analysts said they don't expect the HomePod to catch on as quickly as its cheaper competitors. "Apple will carve out some sales in the smart speaker market with HomePod but will continue to stand far behind Amazon and Google by the end of 2017," Ronan de Renesse, of the analysis firm Ovum, said in an email. Apple, unlike Amazon or Google, is more interested in selling hardware than in using its devices to attract users for its services. The voice-activated-speaker market is projected to reach $2.1 billion by 2020, according to an October report from the analysis firm Gartner. By 2020, 3.3 percent of global households are expected to have one. At the event, Apple also announced updates to its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Mac operating system. The company also refreshed the operating system on the Apple Watch -- which will have more Siri integration -- and the Apple TV, which will now work with Amazon Video. Another expected update came with the company's MacBook, Mac and iPad Pro lines. The new iPad Pro has a larger screen than its predecessors -- 10.5 inches instead of the standard 9.7 inches. There is also a 12.9-inch model; both come with a slew of new productivity features that make them more appealing as laptop replacements. Apple last updated the iPad Pro last fall, when it introduced the smaller model, but the iPad Pro hasn't had a significant performance update since its 2015 release. The company rounded out its computer announcements with devices focused more on the professional market. They include a faster MacBook and MacBook Pro and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro for $1,300. Three iMac models got a processor bump. The company also released a new computer, the iMac Pro. The high-end desktop will cost $5,000 and will ship in December. The HomePod also will go on sale in December.

In the past year, demand has dropped as consumers turn to newer devices with more functions. Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris.   Selina Wang Bloomberg     Fitbit fell to third place in the wearable-device market in the first quarter, losing out to rival connected watches and fitness bands from Apple and Xiaomi Corp. Fitbit's share slid to 12 percent of all unit sales from 23 percent a year earlier, according to data from market researcher IDC. The San Francisco-based company saw its dominance fade even as the overall device market grew 18 percent to 24.7 million shipments worldwide. Xiaomi and Apple tied for first place, with about 15 percent each. Despite the emergence of new competitors, Fitbit had managed to hang on to its lead in wearables for several years, benefiting from its early arrival in the rapidly growing market. In the past year, demand has dropped as consumers turn to newer devices with more functions. Sales also took a hit last year because of manufacturing mistakes. The company's stock, which soared as high as $51.90 following a 2015 initial public offering, has plunged as investors lose faith in Fitbit's ability to resuscitate demand with new products. "Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products," Ramon Llamas, an IDC analyst, wrote in the report. "This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide." Chief Executive Officer James Park is betting that Fitbit's impending smartwatch will reinvigorate demand and reach new consumers. The company has acquired startups Coin, Pebble and Vector to help produce its first smartwatch. Though Fitbit has a loyal base of users, its foray into the new category will face intense competition from Apple Watch and multitudes of cheaper Android watches. As Fitbit tries to differentiate its newer products with its focus on fitness, Apple has also been doubling down in health tracking. Last month, Apple acquired Beddit, a maker of sleep-tracking hardware and software.

It allows companies and customers to communicate with each other without the need of a social media presence. If you want to get in touch with a business, all you need to do is search for them on Spotlight, Siri, or Maps. Business Chat will let you do everything from simple inquiries, get customer support, schedule appointments or deliveries, or make transactions right from your Apple device (using Apple Pay, of course). While setting up appointments using the tool will pull up your own calendar to see if you can make it, other more complex shopping or scheduling requests can also be fulfilled within Business Chat. Similar to how Facebook is encouraging companies to make apps and bots within Messenger, a company can create a custom-built app for iMessage. The likes of LivePerson, Salesforce, Genesys, and Nuance have already integrated Business Chat into their customer service platform.

obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu HOT TIPS Apple’s new App Store policies target China’s online tipping economy Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession Messaging June 10, 2017 Wagging the fingertip. (Reuters/Thomas Peter) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession Messaging June 10, 2017 Apple has a tip for China—all online tips must go through Apple before they go anywhere else. This past week the hardware giant unveiled two new policies that appear directed largely at WeChat, China’s most popular chat app, where peer-to-peer payments, or “tips,” are transferred every day. The rules suggest that Apple’s relationship with Tencent, WeChat’s owner, could grow more tense. And that could ultimately affect the company’s broader fate in China. Neither Tencent nor Apple responded immediately to Quartz’s requests for comment on this piece. Apple maintains tight controls on what iOS apps can and can’t do, but for a while, its policy towards tipping on iOS apps remained unclear. One of the new rules, in Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines updated this week, remove any ambiguity. Tipping is now considered an “in-app purchase,” and must go through Apple’s internal App Store payment system: If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” digital content providers in the app. Apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP. Tipping in apps is a massive trend in China, where users pay content creators small sums of money as digital “thank you’s” via mobile wallets. It’s common on many of China’s livestreaming apps, as well as on WeChat, which has a grip on China’s online publishing industry much like that of Facebook elsewhere. Now tipping is only allowed when one purchases virtual coins from WeChat, using Apple’s internal payment system. These virtual coins can then be sent to content creators, usually writers, as donations. For all iOS apps, Apple collects a 30% take on every purchase—whether it’s off-the-shelf from the app store, or inside the app. There’s not much good data tracking tipping on WeChat, but it’s safe to say it’s popular and the total sums transferred in a year may be quite considerable. The app now has over 938 million monthly users. According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, 10.7% of WeChat’s users have used the tip feature. Among that group, 37% say they give five to ten yuan ($0.72 to $1.45) every month (link in Chinese, .pdf, pg 32). And since iPhone owners tend to be wealthier than Android owners, it seems fair to assume that they’re doing most of the tipping—meaning Apple has been missing out on a pretty penny. Elsewhere, authors on the microblog platform Weibo received more than $7 million in payments over a year. It’s not clear if or how WeChat will implement Apple’s policy. A key question will be whether virtual currency tips can be converted back into cash. If not, WeChat’s creative users will likely be upset—not only will their income be cut by a third, it will be useless outside the confines of WeChat’s walled garden. Other questions abound—now that tips are considered in-app purchases, WeChat must serve as a middleman between the person making the donations and the receiver. Depending on how WeChat implements the policy, WeChat might be responsible for distributing donations after Apple takes a cut. Will WeChat have to count those tips as revenue? Meanwhile, in-app purchases are taxed in China—will this mark a boon for the government? Will a virtual coin system be cumbersome to use, and cause tip sums to drop? And given how indispensable WeChat is in China, is there any way upset users could really rebel? This specific policy change comes after an incident in May, in which Apple forced Tencent to remove a button that allowed users to tip publishers on WeChat (though they could still send tips using QR code transfers). That move now looks like a stopgap measure before the recent policy change. In addition, also this week, Apple released a new policy in its Apple Developer Program License Agreement (accessible only to Apple app developers) that appears to target WeChat’s new mini programs. Launched in January, mini programs are “apps-within-apps” that could potentially pit WeChat against Apple’s App Store. Already, mini programs exist for Didi Chuxing (China’s answer to Uber), Starbucks, and even fighting fake news. The new restrictions, which say these programs can’t be offered in a “store or store-like interface,” suggests that Apple remains anxious about controlling who gets to make money from iOS. These anxieties are well-founded. Apple’s revenue from the iPhone is declining, particularly in China. It needs new revenue streams to make up for the sales slump, and that means doubling down on software. As one of the world’s largest consumer markets, China is critical for the company’s long-term growth. And if Chinese consumers are going crazy for tips, Apple will want a piece of the action (especially now, before this craze can spread to the rest of the world). Despite this, Apple might still tread lightly when it comes to enforcing these policies in China. The Chinese government regularly punishes foreign companies it considers a threat to domestic players, using a mixture of arbitrary law enforcement and bad press. And recent run-ins between Apple and the government suggest that Beijing may well consider Apple a threat—to Chinese smartphone companies, and perhaps even to Tencent. The same week these policies were unveiled (and the same week China’s controversial Cybersecurity Law went into partial implementation), 22 Chinese individuals were arrested for allegedly selling Apple users’ private data. And right around the time Tencent removed its tip button from WeChat, Beijing authorities stated that Apple was “next on a list of inquiries” regarding pornographic content on livestreaming apps. Policy is one thing, enforcement is another. And with sales slowing and political pressure mounting, Apple will face a choice—give Tencent a free pass and appear toothless, or crack down on them and run further afoul in the eyes of the government. Neither option is a good one. Most Popular The days and nights of Elon Musk: How he spends his time at work and play Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

By Mike Elgan Contributing Columnist, Computerworld | Jun 10, 2017 3:49 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock More like this Why your next business phone will be an Amazon Echo Samsung unveils Bixby voice assistant for upcoming Galaxy S8 Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Video XYZ da Vinci Jr. 2.0 Mix 3D printer timelapse Everybody talks about (and often to) the Big Four virtual assistants — Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant. But many other companies are working on virtual assistants, too. Huawei is working on a virtual assistant for the Chinese market. Samsung offers Bixby on its Galaxy S8 or S8+ smartphones. Voice recognition giant Nuance offers an enterprise ready virtual assistant called Nina, which specializes in knowing the limits of A.I. and kicking queries over to a team of human assistants when necessary. Nuance this month announced a Nina "skill" on Amazon's Alexa platform. European telecom Orange offers a virtual assistant called Djingo. A french startup is building an x.ai-like meeting scheduling virtual assistant called Julie Desk. And noHold makes a highly customizable virtual assistant called Albert. There are dozens of others. The problem with choice in voice-based virtual assistants is that you have to choose one and stick with it. And you shouldn't have to. The memorize-the-magic-words option "You should be able to tell Alexa, 'Ask Siri'," Amazon senior vice president of devices, David Limp, said at a conference this week. Limp's sketchy vision for how virtual assistants should work together is wrong in three ways. First, he imagines the user telling one all-purpose virtual assistant to "ask" another specific all-purpose virtual assistant. In this imagining, Apple would create a Siri "skill" and become an adjunct to the Alexa platform, something that's inconceivable. Apple maintains Siri to provide an interface feature to Apple hardware like iPhones, iPads, Apple TV and Macs -- not to provide benefits to Amazon Echo users. Siri will never be an Alexa "skill." Second, this is how "skills" work on Alexa, and it's fatally flawed. In order to use "skills," the user has to specify the service, then say the magic words that enable that "skill" to produce the desired result. Alexa has thousands of skills. But Amazon is relying on users to somehow find skills and memorize their commands. This is why most "skills" are barely used at all. Third, the only successful models for the future of virtual assistants that work together is either branding awareness (an assistant functions as part of a wider range of features or another product) or direct subscription payments. Current all-purpose assistants are monetized through hardware sales and advertising revenue. The idea that virtual assistants of the future will work like Alexa's "skills" is very unlikely. Limp's scenario is one of several suggesting that virtual assistants need to work together. The open-source option Playground Global founder and CEO Andy Rubin founded both Danger and Android, and ran Android for Google for years. Now he's got a billion-dollar startup called Essential that recently announced a line of smartphones and other devices. One of those devices is a virtual assistant appliance called Essential Home, which Rubin says should run Siri, Alexa, Google's Assistant or any virtual assistant customers want to use. The virtual assistant appliance is for consumers, but the concept could be applied to businesses as well. The model is: We build the virtual assistant appliance hardware, but you (the customer) figure out which virtual assistant to put on it. Based on what Rubin has said, he has no solution to the problem of getting virtual assistants to work with each other, only to get existing virtual assistants to work with his own Home device. He's offering choice, but the actual decision is left to the user. The bring-your-own-assistant option Dennis Mortensen is the CEO and founder of x.ai, which makes a virtual assistant that schedules meetings via email. Mortensen envisions the coming age of BYOA — Bring Your Own Assistant. In his model, the value of each employee or executive in the future will be not only based on their skills, experience and knowledge, but also on the quality of the virtual assistants they use and their skill in using them. In other words, virtual assistants used in business will not be developed or mandated by the company, but chosen by the employee and carried from one job to the next. This vision is almost certainly accurate, although I would also imagine that companies will deploy and even build their own assistants to add to those chosen and used by employees. Mortensen also doesn't address the core problem: How do you choose which assistant to use, or decide which module, plug-in or "skill" is best? The choose-it-for-me option It's clear that the major tech companies -- Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung and others -- are working on general purpose virtual assistant services and that their strategy is to open their platforms to third-party add-ons. It's equally clear that if each add-on has to be discovered and conjured up individually, this entire approach is dead in the water. Even smartphone apps, which hold the advantage of reminding the user with an icon and providing visual interface reminders, are far too difficult to discover and remember to use. The virtual assistant equivalent of apps -- plug-ins or add-ons that are invisible and require memorization (command-line interfaces) -- simply won't be used. And as a result, the incentive to even create them in the first place won't exist. The obvious solution is for the general-purpose virtual assistant to select the app for the user. Right now, virtual assistants make decisions about which source of information to use. For example, when you ask for the weather, it won't check your calendar. It will recognize the category of query and reach out to whatever weather service the assistant is hard-wired to use. Virtual assistants should work initially like apps, then later not at all like apps. At first individual users should find, and in some cases pay for or subscribe to, specific virtual assistant services such as a meeting scheduler or a flight-booking add-ons. Once installed, however, the user of those services should be the virtual assistant, not the human. It should be possible, in fact, to install or subscribe to several flight-booking add-ons. Later, when you want to fly somewhere, you should tell your assistant, "book me a flight to Chicago next Wednesday," and the assistant itself should query all the add-ons to arrive at the best price or best combination of cost, travel time, flight schedule, airline carrier and other factors. Although this general approach is obvious, it's not obvious that current virtual assistant artificial intelligence is up to the job yet. We may have to wait a few years. But when it does arrive, we'll find ourselves in Mortensen's BYOA world, where employees will choose the vertical assistants or assistant plug-ins. Employees will choose them, but the assistants will use them. Related: Computer Hardware Artificial Intelligence Emerging Technology Mike Elgan writes about technology and tech culture.

In fact, you could as well get a new phone instead of the damaged one. However, the trend is changing we believe. According to a detailed Reuters report, Apple customers might have to pay a very less amount for repairing their damaged iPhones. And how will it achieve such feat? Well, the report notes that by the end of 2017, Apple will put its proprietary machines for mending cracked iPhone glass in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple's 4,800 authorized service providers worldwide over the next few months. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year. So if that happens, it should significantly make it easier for customers to get their broken iPhone screens fixed easily and at a cheaper rate. Moreover, it looks like the company is also aiming to reduce long wait times for iPhone repairs at its retail stores. Interestingly, Apple also has stated that its process aims to make the display look like it just came out of the box. Thus a Reuters' reporter was allowed to see the repairing machine in action and he has revealed the process of repairing an iPhone. In his own words: "In a smaller training room, a technician laid out the tools Apple uses to fix iPhone screens: special screwdrivers for the iPhone's five- and three-lobed screws, a custom suction-cup for loosening the screen without tearing the delicate ribbon cables behind it, and a press to squeeze iPhone 7s to ensure waterproofing." "Once the new screen is mounted, the iPhone goes into the Horizon Machine, which allows Apple's software to communicate with the fresh hardware. Over the course of 10 to 12 minutes, the machine talks to the phone's operating system to pair the fingerprint sensor to the phone's brain. While that unfolds, a mechanical finger jabs the screen in multiple places to test the touch-sensitive surface. The machine also fine tunes the display and software to match the precise colors and calibration of the original." In any case, Apple is now trying to deliver a customer experience that exceeds anything its competitors are trying to do.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple’s Bezelless Technology is Noticeably Different than those Offered by the Rest June 10, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Windows 10 Latest Build Reveals the Biggies of Fall Creators Update One Plus Poised to Raise the Bar with Flagship Model Yet Again Apple’s revelation of the iOS 11 last week made it clear that the upcoming OS will come heavily optimized for bezelless displays. That quite asserts the fact that iOS 11 will be shipping first on the upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone that is all set to be Apple’s first edge-to-edge display device. There are already more than a handful of renders that claims the look of the upcoming device. Add to that, we have a new render which interestingly holds a different take of the bezelless display. Unlike the rest, the latest render from iDropNews presents the render with a cut-out that expands inwards to the display. Accordingly, this cut-out at the top will be to accommodate the front camera and additional sensors for face and iris recognition. Earlier reports have suggested that these would be placed beneath the display. But the latest render designates a distinct spot on the top for these sensors inside the display. This would make it interesting as of how Apple would manage the top bar of its display. Apart from that, the render also confirms that the iPhone 8 will feature glass-embedded sensors, contrary to some of the previous reports that hinted for a rear fingerprint sensor on the device. If true, Apple will be ahead of its rival in the race to get embedded fingerprint sensors. But all doesn’t sound great with the iPhone 8, as there are other reports which suggest that Apple will be featuring Intel modems instead of the ones from Qualcomm due to the company’s  rift with the latter. That would mean that the iPhone 8 will arrive sans the fastest gigabit speeds offered by Qualcomm modems.

When Apple launched the 2016 MacBook Pro the model was somewhat limited in comparison to other laptops that were already using Kaby Lake chips. The HP ProBook 400 range, Dell XPS 13 Touch, Acer Aspire E, and Asus ZenBook 3 all had Kaby Lake chips, while Apple’s MacBook Pro offered the earlier Skylake processors. Eight months later Apple has updated the MacBook Pro (and the MacBook) to use Kaby Lake processors, which should result in a decent performance bump. Read on for our test results below. So far we have tested the top-of-the-range 15-inch 2.9GHz MacBook Pro, as we get the test results in from the other models we will add them here. The results of our tests were as follows: 15-inch 2.9GHz MacBook Pro Geekbench 4.1 64-bit Multi-Core Score 15,719 Geekbench 4.1 64-bit Single-Core Score 4,739 Geekbench 4.1 32-bit Multi-Core Score 14,034 To get a idea of how this new model compares with the previous year’s 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (which wasn’t the top of the line model - that was the 2.7GHz version but we don’t currently have results for that model). Geekbench 4.1 64-bit Multi-Core Score 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2017) 15,719 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (late 2016) 12,541 2.5GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2015) 13,364 That's a notable difference (and we particularly note that last year’s model actually seemed to do worse than the one before it). There is still one area of disappointment with regards to processors though. For a range of laptops with pro status, it is disappointing that while the 15-inch models have quad-core processors, the 13-inch models still have only dual-core processors. The 13-inch models also only offer integrated graphics cards, begging the question: does the 13-inch MacBook Pro (which, topping out at almost £2,000 certainly has a pro price) really deserve to be called Pro. We’ll look in a bit more detail at the price later on. Graphics Speaking of graphics, Apple has essentially bought the graphic processors into line with its rivals, with the 15in models now offering the Radeon Pro 555 or 560 (replacing the Radeon Pro 455). But there are some encouraging changes afoot. Apple’s forthcoming version of macOS - High Sierra - has a focus on graphics. Indeed, Apple seems keen to get onboard the VR bandwagon. Of particular interest to anyone working in the creative industries will be the fact that the new OS will support external graphics. Geekbench 4.1 Open CL Intel Integrated Graphics Score 20,976 Geekbench 4.1 Metal Intel Integrated Graphics Score 19,225 Geekbench 4.1 OpenCL Discrete Graphics Score (Radeon) 42,194 Geekbench 4.1 Metal Discrete Graphics Score (Radeon) 26,416 Cinebench OpenGL(fps) 87.08 BlackMagic Write (MBps) 1,951.14 BlackMagic Read (MBps) 2,397.08 Looking specifically at the OpenCL (Radeon) test and the Open CL Cinebench tests gives us some insight into the improvements in terms of the graphics card. Geekbench 4 OpenCL (Radeon) 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2017) 42,194 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (late 2016) 42,827 2.5GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2015) 28,948 Cinebench OpenCL (fps) 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2017) 87.1 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (late 2016) 70.4 2.5GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2015) 61.4 These are impressive results. Whether the MacBook Pro is really suitable for graphics is a question though. In the past Apple has made a lot of noise about the Retina display, with its 2,560 x 1,600 and 2,880 x 1,800 pixel counts depending on whether you have the 13-inch or 15-inch model. Embarrassingly, there are PC laptops that have 4K displays now, so Apple has a bit of catching up to do. We’d like to see Apple launch a 4K 15-inch MacBook Pro next, with 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, like some of its rivals. RAM Another area where the MacBook Pro can seem underpowered in comparison to some of its rivals is RAM. All the 13-inch models offer 8GB RAM (although there is a build-to-order option for 16GB RAM). The 15-inch models ship with 16GB RAM as standard with no upgrade options. There are calls for Apple to offer up to 32GB RAM in the MacBook Pro, with fingers pointing to Dell’s Precision 5520 laptop, which has a 32GB RAM build-to-order configuration. Back in November 2016 Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller spoke out after criticism that the MacBook Pro topped out at 16GB RAM, saying that if Apple was to offer more RAM it would be detrimental to battery life. This is because the higher amounts of RAM would require a power-hungry memory controller. Schiller said: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.” Unfortunately even the Kaby Lake processor upgrade for the MacBook Pro could not increase the RAM cap of 16GB because the Kaby Lake processor doesn't support LPDDR4 RAM either. Touch Bar It’s disappointing that rather than focus on features that would make the MacBook Pro a truly pro machine, Apple has instead focused on features that seem gimmicks rather than really useful. One such gimmick, in our eyes, is the Touch Bar, which seems to be Apple’s alternative to a touch screen, but is actually more difficult to use than a touch screen as you need to have your eyes both on the keyboard and the screen. The Touch Bar isn’t completely pointless though. Along with Touch ID capabilities, there is integration with a number of Apple apps, such as Safari, which gains forward and backwards buttons, or Mail that gains auto complete suggestions. What really matters to pro users, though is apps like Photoshop, and Adobe is working on integrating Touch Bar controls into Photoshop. You can already use the MacBook Pro Touch Bar in Photoshop, but the features are currently only in Preview (e.g. beta). We expect that the launch of MacOS Sierra will bring more in the way of Touch Bar integration with apps. However, if Apple’s recent introduction of a second non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro at the 13-inch level may be in response to slower than expected sales of the new Touch Bar enabled MacBook Pro models. There have been reports suggesting that Apple customers are picking the non-Touch Bar models over their more expensive siblings, and it may well be that Apple is responding to the interest in the non Touch-Bar equipped laptops. It’s also been noted that Apple didn’t introduce a new Touch Bar enabled keyboard with its updated iMacs, something that had been anticipated. So perhaps the Touch Bar hasn’t been the success Apple was hoping it would be. Ports One other thing that could be beneficial to pro users is USB-C with Thunderbolt 3. Two ports in the case of the non-Touch Bar 13-inch models, four in the case of the Touch Bar 13-inch and 15-inch models. For every one else this may be a bit of a hinderance because currently not many devices have USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, while existing devices that us older USB standards will require an adaptor. Price When Apple launched the 2016 MacBook Pro the entry-level price of the 13-inch Skylake model was £1,449/$1,499. The company continued to sell the older 2015 Broadwell MacBook Pro though, with the older 13-inch model starting at £1,249/$1,299 (and the older 15-inch Broadwell model priced at £1,899/$1,999). For 2017 Apple has dropped this old 13-inch Broadwell MacBook Pro offering customers a brand new 13-inch Kaby Lake MacBook Pro for the same low price. The 15-inch Broadwell model remains in the line up and hasn’t seen its price drop, however. The pricing is as follows: 13-inch MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Kaby Lake i5 dual-core processor, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, £1,249/$1,299 2.3GHz Kaby Lake i5 dual-core processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, £1,449/$1,499 3.1GHz Kaby Lake i5 dual-core processor, Touch Bar, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650, £1,749/$1,799 3.1GHz Kaby Lake i5 dual-core processor, Touch Bar, 8GB RAM, 512GB storage, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650, £1,949/$1,999 Build-to-order options: 3.3GHz Kaby Lake i5 dual-core processor + £90/$100 3.5GHz Kaby Lake i7 dual-core processor + £270/$300 16GB RAM + £180/$200 1TB SSD + £400/$400 15-inch MacBook Pro 2.2GHz Broadwell i7 quad-core processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB storage, Intel Iris Pro Graphics, £1,899/$1,999 2.8GHz Kaby Lake i7 quad-core processor, Touch Bar, 16GB RAM, 256GB storage, Radeon Pro 555, £2,349/$2,399 2.9GHz Kaby Lake i7 quad-core processor, Touch Bar, 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, Radeon Pro 560, £2,699/$2,799 Build-to-order options: 3.1GHz Kaby Lake i7 quad-core processor + £190/$200 1TB SSD + £360/$400 2TB SSD + £1,080/$1,200 Verdict If you bought a new MacBook Pro last October you might be a tiny bit miffed. After all your machine has just been surpassed within months. Does it really matter though? Probably not because chances are you aren’t a creative professional who needs the best processor and graphics card as well as a ton of RAM. And if you are, we’ll maybe you are holding out for the hoped for MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM. The MacBook Pro is for a demanding user who needs a decent amount of power. If all you do with your Mac is surf the web and open emails then probably a MacBook or MacBook Air will suffice (although the MacBook Air hasn’t had a significant update in a while). If it’a the 15-inch screen that’s attracting you perhaps a 13-inch MacBook Pro, or other Mac laptop paired with a bigger display would do the job just as well. Perhaps it’s portability you need. The MacBook Pro isn’t the lightest laptop Apple makes (that’ll be the MacBook Air) but it is a lot lighter than it was back in 2015. And if you were thinking of buying the older 2015 model that’s still on sale - that’s the £1,899/$1,999 15-inch model with a 2.2GHz Broadwell processor, bear in mind that it’s quite a bit heavier. With all that in mind though, and despite everything we’ve written above, if it’s a Mac you want we still think that the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a better option than both the MacBook and the MacBook Air currently. And if you want a bigger screen and would benefit from a discrete graphics card, rather than one of the integrated ones (which wouldn’t be as good for things like games and creative work), then the 15-inch MacBook Pro is a great choice. We just wish is wasn’t so expensive! OUR VERDICT It's excellent news that Apple has moved to the seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processors. Of course the eighth generation chips probably won’t be that far away but if we always waited for the next big thing we’d never get anything new to play with.

At Sweden's newly opened Museum of Failure, Google Glass and Apple Newton are two such devices that were either ahead of their time or the results of some bad ideas. Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 percent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library.

One important announcement the company made was that with iOS 11, it introduced two new camera formats — HEVC and HEIF, which it claims would save at least 50 percent storage space on the device, without any loss in image quality. Apple instructed developers to start supporting HEIF and HEVC in their applications Thursday. To support the formats, iOS devices need at least an A9 processor. Read: iOS 11 Release Date Features: Highlights From Latest iPhone OS At WWDC 2017 iPhone users have been forever complaining about the lack of storage space and storage options on the device. Unlike many Android devices, Apple does not support an external SD card on its devices. But why is Apple changing its camera formats and what are HEVC and HEIF? Apple has been, for a long time using an h.264 video compression for videos and JPG for images. The introduction of HEVC and HEIF at this point might be an indication of the upcoming iPhone 8’s camera. The iPhone 8 is expected to have a dual-camera. Apple has been using the HEVC format for its FaceTime app starting with the iPhone 6. The use of the format resulted in cleaner and clearer videos. HEIF or High Efficiency Image File Format is a file format which was finalized in 2015, while HEVC or High Efficiency Video Coding has been around for long. These formats allow Apple to improve image and video quality, while not affecting the device’s storage as they only use half the storage of previous formats. This makes the device more capable of live streaming too, since it can endure the bandwidth better. HEVC and HEIF are expected to lead up to the HDR10 format, which will need a device to be capable of playing HEVC video and support 10-bit graphics. Two of Apple’s new devices, announced at WWDC 2017 — the new iPad Pro and the new iMac. The iPad Pro supports HDR video, while the new iMac supports 10-Buit graphics. All of these features are expected to eventually be ported to its flagship device. According to Streaming Media, Apple might even re-encode its entire library including SD and HD videos, which would result in small files streaming to an Apple TV or iOS device. This would in turn, make for smoother streaming and users will have to worry less about data speeds while streaming. Read: AirPods iOS 11 Update: Headphones Will Automatically Sync With Apple TV With tvOS 11, Plus More If you have signed up for iOS 11 Beta 1, you can check the feature out, by navigating to Settings -> Camera -> Formats. You will find HEIC and HEVC under the High Efficiency Format. iOS11 is currently in Beta, but the public preview of the operating system is expected to release later this month, with a full scale launch expected in September.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) Share Written by Mike Murphy June 10, 2017 Over the past week, thousands of designers, developers, and engineers, along with a few reporters, crammed into concrete convention center to hear what’s next for Apple at the company’s annual developer conference. Many went to learn how to build better apps and programs for iPhones, iPads, and Macs; some went to network with like-minded people similarly hoping to become the next Silicon Valley success story. Others just wanted to see what aluminum-cased objects Apple will be selling in the near future. There was lots to talk about: promised software updates, a refreshed line of Mac computers, toolkits for developers to build augmented-reality apps, and a few new partnerships that might hint at where the company is headed. But much of the media attention went straight to the new smart-home speaker Apple unveiled during its keynote address Monday, the HomePod. The interest in the squat, mesh-covered device was understandable, for reasons beyond the world’s insatiable hunger for Apple innovation. The company’s last attempt to enter the speaker market, a decade ago, was widely received as a dud, and in the time since it has been lapped by competitors. The first true hit product of its kind was the Amazon Echo, first released for Amazon Prime subscribers in late 2014, while Sonos and Bose have held onto their dominance in the connected home speaker market. Just catching up with the competition might have been seen as an accomplishment, even if just a modest one. But Apple didn’t release the HomePod as a me-too product. It’s meant to be a game-changer in how people listen to music at home, just as the iPod reinvented the concept of portable music with the release of the iPod almost 16 years ago. Though Apple seemed to singlehandedly conquer the music world with its monolithic-white-rectangle-and-earbuds sets, the success of the iPod was built on the portable music players that came before it. Arguably the first successful one was the Diamond Rio PMP300, a surprise hit in the 1998 holiday season, selling 200,000 units at a time when many people were still transitioning from tape decks to portable CD players. The Rio was released three years before first iPod and four years before the first iPod that worked with Windows computers, the latter of which opened the device up to hundreds of millions of Microsoft users. Apple did spur one completely revolutionary idea with the iPod, however—the atomization of the music album—by selling song downloads for $1, which essentially kickstarted the current streaming-music era (along with pirate sharing networks like Napster). This has generally been Apple’s strategy since Steve Jobs retook the helm of the company in the late 1990s: Approach established markets and dominate them with simpler products that are better built and marketed. The plan for the HomePod won’t be any different. Completion shade at Sonos and Amazon in the speaker market #WWDC17 pic.twitter.com/pixGsHJTxq — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 Regardless of whether you think that Apple has lost its way since CEO Tim Cook took over from Steve Jobs, the strategy has pretty clearly stayed the same. Microsoft and Samsung release a tablet with a keyboard; so will Apple. Samsung and others release large smartphones and small tablets, so will Apple. Samsung and FitBit release smart wearables, so will Apple. Samsung and others release wireless earbuds, so will Apple. (You might be noticing a trend here.) Not every recent product announcement from Apple has felt as stark as when Jobs first told the world that one of the original personal computer manufacturers would be entering the portable music player business, but each has followed a similar trajectory. It’s too early to say whether the HomePod, or any of the new pieces of software Apple announced this week, will be as massive a success as the iPod, iPhone, or even the iPad have beenin the past, but given that even Apple’s “Other Products” bucket (which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods) is the size of a Fortune 500 company—it generated nearly $11 billion in revenue in 2016, though it is the company’s smallest business segment—there doesn’t seem to be any good reason for Apple to change its approach to new products now. Apple has been criticized of falling behind in the emergent technologies of recent years, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, and self-driving cars. But Apple has been shown to be working on all of these technologies. It has registered vehicles with the California transportation department to test self-driving cars; it spoke at length about its machine-learning efforts at its developers conference (and has held meetings at AI events in the past), and had working demonstrations of both VR and AR applications running on Apple products at this year’s developers conference, with the intention that developers will build products off these new capabilities. Will that be enough to satisfy the skeptics? Cook sounded doubtful about that, if also unfazed by it, in an article published Friday in MIT Technology Review. Cook says the fact that the press doesn’t always give Apple credit for its AI may be due to the fact that Apple only likes to talk about the features of products it is ready to ship, while many others “sell futures.” Says Cook: “We are not going to go through things we’re going to do in 2019, ’20, ’21. It’s not because we don’t know that. It’s because we don’t want to talk about that.” This has been Apple’s standard operating procedure as long as the iPod has been in existence. When Apple is still breaking its own records with the cash it’s bringing in, why change?

Chinese law enforcement detained 22 people on suspicion of infringing the privacy of Apple users and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to local police in southern Zhejiang province. The authorities did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple users. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were employees of companies who worked with Apple, who allegedly used internal systems to gather users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs and other personal data, which was then sold as part of a scam worth more than 50m yuan (£5.8m). A co-ordinated effort, following months of investigation and involving police across the Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, saw the 22 suspects apprehended, their “criminal tools” confiscated and their online network dismantled. The suspects worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, and allegedly charged between 10 yuan (£1.15) and 180 yuan (£20.76) for pieces of the illegally extracted data. The sale of personal information is common in China, which implemented a controversial new cybersecurity law aimed at protecting the country’s networks and private user information on 1 June. In December, an investigation by the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper exposed a black market for private data gathered from police and government databases. Reporters successfully obtained a trove of material on one colleague, such as flight history, hotel checkouts and property holdings, in exchange for a payment of 700 yuan (£80.77).

Digital Trends Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 review The Matebook X is proof Huawei can build world-class PCs Share The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. Highs Precise design Excellent keyboard Color-accurate display Lows Too expensive for its hardware So-so battery endurance DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 review By Matt Smith Posted on 06.09.17 Research Center: Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 Huawei is a name that you’ve probably heard of, though if you’re not deep into smartphones, you may not know from where. The Chinese giant has earned a small following in the west, built on the back of its affordable yet feature-rich smartphones. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro, which recently received a Recommended award from us, is the perfect example. It packs the latest hardware and a dual-lens camera, yet sells for hundreds less than an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8. The company doesn’t want to be limited to smartphones, however. It’s eyeing the PC, and launched its first efforts in North America last year. It put the brand off to a rough start. The original Matebook tried to serve as a budget alternative to Microsoft’s Surface Pro, but terrible hard drive performance and a small battery left it unable to compete. Huawei hasn’t backed down. It’s returned this year with several new products, one of which is the MateBook X. Don’t be fooled by the name. Instead of targeting the Surface Pro, the MateBook X is going after Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, and Asus’ Zenbook 3. To do so, it equips the usual set of hardware for a high-end, super-thin PC. That means an Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB hard drive. Frankly, internal components won’t make-or-break the MateBook X. Huawei’s notebook competes in a category that’s all about attractive design and long battery life. Does it have what it takes to make it out on the open road? Similar, but not a clone It’d be easy to dismiss the Matebook X as a MacBook clone. The two systems look very similar, right down to all-metal unibody design and Huawei’s suspiciously spacey take on the color gray. The two systems even place the speakers in the same location. There are subtle differences, however. The MateBook X has thinner display bezels, which gives it a smaller overall footprint, and helps it retains an upscale feel. Despite that, Huawei found room to squeeze in an extra USB Type-C port (the MacBook only has one). Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Admittedly, it does lack the precision refinement found in the 12-inch MacBook. Apple’s industrial design is famous for a reason, and as a result, the MacBook feels more robust. This is present in subtle touches like the overall balance of the chassis, and the smooth action of the display hinge. Even so, the MateBook X is well crafted. It seems solid no matter how it’s held and resists even purposeful attempts to flex the chassis. In fact, we prefer it to the Mac’s design – while not quite as refined, its thinner bezels and extra port add functional benefits. We do think it a step behind the Asus Zenbook 3, however, which is still the slickest laptop we’ve laid hands on. Thin on ports, of course Aside from the two USB Type-C ports previously mentioned, the MateBook X also has a headphone jack. And that’s it. There’s no card reader. Wireless connectivity includes 802.11ac Wi-FI and Bluetooth 4.1. Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 Compared To Lenovo Yoga 720 13-inch Origin EON17-SLX Acer Chromebook 15 Asus VivoBook V551LB-DB71T Acer Aspire V7 Sony Vaio Pro 13 Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (2013) HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook HP Spectre XT TouchSmart ASUS Zenbook UX51Vz Acer Aspire S3 Apple MacBook Air 13.3-inch… Sony Vaio S Series Apple MacBook Air (11.6-inch) Sony VAIO C1MW PictureBook Huawei says some markets will receive a small MateDock 2, which adds extra ports, and/or a USB-C to USB Type-A adapter. Our review unit didn’t ship with either accessory. A surprisingly superb keyboard Ultrathin laptops like the MateBook X look good, but they often have problems when it comes time to use them, with the keyboard at the heart of the issue. A thin profile means limited room for each key to move, and that can seriously annoy touch typists. We prefer the Matebook X to the Mac overall. Apparently, no one told Huawei about the problem. It simply isn’t here. The keys boast 1.2 millimeters of travel, which is slightly limited compared to devices like the Dell XPS 13, but superior to the MacBook’s 0.5 millimeters, and the Asus Zenbook 3’s 0.8 millimeters. In fact, the Huawei’s keyboard felt great. Blindfold us, and we’d never know it belongs to a laptop less than half an inch thick. Keyboard backlighting is standard. The lighting looks even beneath each key, and there’s minimal light leak. However, only two brightness settings are available. While that is not uncommon, we prefer to see more choice in brightness selection. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends A large touchpad can be found under the keyboard. It supports all Windows Precision Touchpad features and proved responsive in day-to-day use, including multi-touch gestures. That’s good, because a touchscreen is not available, even as an option. Clicking the touchpad produces a slightly hollow sound, so Huawei could do more work to tune that action – but that is a minor complaint. Above the keyboard is a fingerprint reader which serves as the power button. It’s Windows Hello compatible, and worked incredibly well – better than any Windows-compatible fingerprint reader we’ve tried in years. It’s a convenient extra that shaves a few seconds from the time between when you open the notebook and when you start using it. Great to look at… Huawei ships the Matebook X with a 13-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, which means it’s taller relative to its width than the more typical 16:9 notebook screen. Its pixel density works out to about 200 pixels per inch. That’s a bit behind the 12-inch MacBook, which boasts 2,304 x 1,400 resolution, and quite a bit better than the Asus Zenbook 3, which is stuck at 1080p. Though it’s at a slight pixel disadvantage against the MacBook, it’s hard to tell the difference in normal use. The display looks extremely sharp in all situations. Better still, it also looks vivid and bright. High-resolution photos appear crystal-clear and look just as they should in real life. While the Macbook looks every bit as vibrant, the Zenbook 3 is at a disadvantage, as red and blues look dull on its screen. Our tests confirmed what our eyes told us. We found it offered excellent color accuracy, hitting an average color error value of just 1.25. Lower is better in this test, and anything below one is difficult to notice with the human eye, so that’s a great result. We also saw a solid brightness of 377 nits and a color gamut that covers 100 percent of sRGB. Both figures are right in line with top-tier competitors like the Zenbook 3, or even Dell’s XPS 13. There’s just one weakness – contrast. Our test showed a contrast ratio of 660:1, while most competitors exceed 900:1. It didn’t make a noticeable difference in most situations, but the background of a dark movie can often look rather gray, instead of inky black. The category standout in this area is Samsung’s Galaxy Book, which has an OLED display, and boasts deeper black levels than any other laptop or 2-in-1 we’ve tested. …and great to listen to Audio is another place Huawei doesn’t follow the ultrathin notebook script. The MateBook X features Dolby Atmos branded speakers that put out surprising oomph. While it obviously can’t compete with a decent pair of desktop speakers, the notebook’s tiny sound system serves up serious volume and even a hint of bass. Push the volume up far enough, and the limits of the system break down into distortion and an ever-present hiss. But the audio becomes more than loud enough before it reaches that point. The Core i5 performed as expected Our review unit arrived with a Core i5-7200U processor and eight gigabytes of RAM. That is, at this point, a completely normal loadout, even for a laptop this thin. Yet thermal design can impact performance, as shown below. All the systems in the graphs have some form of Core i5 processor. The benchmark scores are tight in Geekbench 4 single-core testing. Huawei’s Matebook X comes in at the bottom with a score of 3,703, but that’s only 8 percent below the fastest system, Dell’s XPS 13 with Core i5-7200U. Geekbench 4 multi-core, scores are similarly closed, but the Huawei gained some ground here with a mid-pack performance. Again, though – the differences are minor. Blindfold us, and we’d never know the keyboard belongs to a laptop less than half an inch thick. Handbrake, our most strenuous test, put the Matebook X in front of the Asus Zenbook 3, but behind larger peers like the Dell XPS 13. This test, which involves transcoding 4K video from h.264 to h.265, took over 20 minutes to complete. That’s enough time to start seeing the thermal limitations in each notebook, and the scores spread as a result. With that said, though, the Matebook X is not ideal if video transcoding or encoding is task you’d often perform. The Core i5-7200U will do in a pinch, but a quad-core processor would be preferable, and that’s not available in any half-inch thick laptop. What about the MacBook? We did not test it in Geekbench 4 at the time we reviewed it, and it’s been updated since then. However, it’s fair to say all 12-inch Macbook models would prove slower if we tested them today. They use variants of Intel Core processors that draw less power than most, and run at lower clock speeds. A fast hard drive Huawei has smartly decided on a solid state hard drive that connects over PCI Express, and that results in strong performance. In fact, the Matebook X performed very well next to similar systems. It beat them slightly in read speeds, and significantly in write speeds. This is not a difference that’s noticeable in day-to-day use, but it would matter when moving large files. It also helps the Matebook X boot in less than ten seconds. Again, the Macbook is not part of our graphs as it’s been revised since our last review. Hard drive performance is a strong point for Apple, though, so we’d expect it to beat the Matebook X. It might even do so by a wide margin. Don’t buy this for games – of course If anyone says the Matebook X is a gaming laptop, call a doctor – they’re suffering from a serious fever. Still, we run every notebook through 3DMark’s Fire Strike test to see how they compare. The results aren’t inspiring, but they are reliable. These systems run Intel HD 620 graphics, so they all perform almost the same – except the Asus Zenbook 3, which falls behind. The Matebook X can load and play many 3D games, but it won’t be able to play at high detail, even at 1080p resolution. To provide an example, we loaded and ran the benchmark in Civilization VI at 1080p resolution and minimum detail. The game turned in an average of 16 frames per second, which is technically playable, but certainly not enjoyable. As for the Macbook – while the test systems in our graph aren’t good, the 12-inch Macbook is truly hopeless. It runs an even less powerful version of Intel HD graphics (Intel HD 615). Even games that are several years old will prove a major challenge. Small laptop, small battery The Matebook X is, alongside the Asus Zenbook 3, one of the lightest and most portable 13-inch notebooks we’ve ever seen. Its weight, at 2.31 pounds, is slightly heavier than the Macbook and Zenbook 3, both of which weigh about two pounds. Still, it’s not a PC that’ll burden you when it’s thrown in a bag. Huawei has squeezed a 41.4 watt-hour battery into the notebook’s thin frame. That’s on par with its competitors, but smaller than notebooks like the Dell XPS 13, which has a 60-watt hour battery. Reducing capacity is necessary to keep the Matebook X thin. So, what does that mean for a battery life? As shown in the graphs above, it means compromise, though the compromise is not too severe. The Matebook X lasted almost five hours in the Peacekeeper web benchmark loop, and just over nine hours in a 1080p video loop. These results are likely enough for many users, but they do come in slightly behind most competitors. The Asus Zenbook 3 lasted just a few minutes less in Peacekeeper, and about a half-hour longer in the 1080p video loop. What about the MacBook? Again, our test results are no longer representative of the current model, so we can’t say for sure. However, Apple also claims to use a 41.1-watt hour battery, and boasts up to 12 hours of movie playback. We have found in past reviews that MacBooks last longer than Windows laptops with the same battery capacity, so the newest MacBook is likely to beat the MateBook X. Barely there software There’s no reason to worry about bloatware here. Our review unit came only with the MateBook Manager, a utility to adjust various settings and also update the laptop’s firmware, including the BIOS. It also supports an “instant online” feature for tethering to a smartphone’s Internet, but this requires a Huawei ID, and we did not have chance to use it. Warranty information Huawei ships the Matebook X with a one-year warranty, as is typical for the category. Our Take Huawei’s Matebook X is a wonderful second try at making a beautiful, high-end PC. Sleek, light, and fast, it’s simply a great day-to-day system. Battery life is only ok, as is true of its peers, and comes behind thicker laptops that can hold more juice. However, there is one potential problem. The price. Huawei did not quote us a final U.S. price in time for this review, forcing us to fall back on the European price of 1,400 Euros. That currently works out to about $1,560 dollars, which is way too much. Even $1,400 would be pushing it. We hope that Huawei will drastically slash the U.S. price, and asked for clarification during this review. Huawei was not able to provide the U.S. price, but we will update this review that information becomes available. Is there a better alternative? The Razer Blade Stealth is an alternative for gamers, but will require the purchase of an external graphics dock. Asus’ Zenbook 3 is a bit more attractive, but it’s keyboard and display aren’t quite as good. The MacBook is smaller and lighter, but not as powerful. We prefer using the Matebook X to these systems, but at its current target price, it’s hard to recommend it over any aside from the 12-inch MacBook. The Asus Zenbook 3, for instance, can be purchased with almost identical hardware for only $1,000. How long will it last? We thought the Matebook X felt sturdy in our tests, and its hardware is up to date. It should last three years without issue, and may even still be useful after a half-decade. Should you buy it? Not at its current expected price. We must assume it will be expensive until told otherwise, and the fact it currently seems more expensive than competitors is a major issue. It’s a great laptop, but it’s hard to imagine paying $500 more for the Matebook X over an Asus Zenbook 3, when the two systems offer similar performance and battery life. We will update this review when Huawei releases U.S. pricing.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple's iMessage is getting even safer than… Apple's iMessage is getting even safer than it already was — here's how By Christian de Looper — Updated June 9, 2017 5:12 pm Subscribe Share The best part of this minimalist Pacific Northwest cabin is outside the window The 50 best NES games of all time Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple wants to keep its iMessage platform as secure as possible, and is poised to make it even safer with iOS 11. Apple’s iMessage app has long been one of the more secure ways to send messages to your friends, but now it looks like the company could be preparing to improve the security of the app even more by closing a major loophole, according to a report from Motherboard. While iMessage has long supported end-to-end encryption, there has long been a catch to that encryption — backing up your messages to iCloud allows Apple, and any government or hacker who forces his or her way into Apple’s system, to read your messages. That kind of defeats the purpose of encryption in the first place. Apple, however, is changing that with the launch of iOS 11, its latest and greatest mobile operating system. All of your conversations in iOS 11 will now be synced automatically across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other Apple devices. With that automatic syncing, however, comes new security challenges. Does it mean that Apple will be able to read your messages? Apparently not. “Our security and encryption team has been doing work over a number of years now to be able to synchronize information across your, what we call your circle of devices — all those devices that are associated with the common account — in a way that they each generate and share keys with each other that Apple does not have,” said Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi in an interview with Apple blogger John Gruber. “And so, even if they store information in the cloud, it’s encrypted with keys that Apple doesn’t have.” How is this possible? Well, we don’t know just yet, but we’ll likely hear more about it in the coming months before the official launch of iOS 11.

The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from what happened at WWDC to how Britney Spears got hacked — it’s all here. New iMacs at last! And the $5,000 iMac Pro is the most powerful ever Apple held its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week, and as usual revealed a slew of new features coming for its various platforms. While WWDC tends to focus on software, Apple’s Mac hardware wasn’t left out of this year’s event. The iMac is one of Apple’s more important MacOS hardware products, representing the tech giant’s main presence on PC users’ desktops. While the Mac Pro remains in limbo, the iMac got some serious love at the event, with refreshed models available today and a sneak peek at an upcoming iMac Pro. Read the full story here. The best fuel efficient car you can buy When it comes to saving fossil fuels, we now have quite an array of choices. Automakers currently offer a slew of hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric cars, and even a couple of hydrogen fuel-cell models (in California, at least). But the good ol’ internal-combustion engine isn’t done yet. Even without electric assist, gasoline and diesel engines can achieve impressive fuel economy, and this list proves it. What we have here is a diverse array of vehicles — including a hatchback, a convertible sports car, a luxury sedan, a pickup truck, and a small SUV — each of which emphasizes fuel efficiency and best-in-class gas mileage without sacrificing performance or practicality. These vehicles do not feature hybrid or electric powertrains, but if either of those options sounds more appealing to you, feel free to check out our best hybrids and best electric cars lists.

For the first time since the 1980s, we’re excited about a music synthesizer Roli, the London firm best known for its iOS apps and portable MIDI controllers, went all-in with its Seaboard series three years ago. The soft-touch music keyboards, which swap out tactile piano keys with continuous-touch, silicon “keywaves,” are among the most customizable musical instruments on the market. But they aren’t exactly affordable synthesizers around — the cheapest model, the Seaboard Rise, starts at $800 (the Seaboard Grand is $3,000). Later this month, though, that’ll change with the introduction of the Seaboard Block. The Seaboard Block, which Roli announced on Thursday, is the smallest, lightest, and most compact Seaboard yet. It’s also the first to be compatible with Roli’s modular Blocks system and, at $300, it’s also the company’s most accessible synth yet. Read the full story here. NASA’s Mars Rover concept looks like it was designed by Bruce Wayne When automakers want the public to get excited about the future, they build concept cars. Now NASA is proving that idea works not only for next year’s sedans and SUVs, but for Mars exploration as well. NASA’s Mars Rover concept won’t actually turn a wheel on the Red Planet, but its eye-catching design will get people’s attention. The vehicle will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex to promote the complex’s “Summer of Mars” program, according to a NASA blog post. The program was created to educate the public on NASA’s Mars exploration efforts. The Mars Rover concept was built by Parker Brothers Concepts, a Florida-based outfit that previously built a replica of the “Tumbler” Batmobile, which a Saudi team unsuccessfully tried to enter into the Gumball 3000 rally. The Tumbler seems to have influenced the design of the six-wheeled Mars Rover, which looks decidedly more macho than real-life space vehicles. Read the full story here. Airbnb is making it easier than ever for you to host a person in need Airbnb is making it easier to be a good samaritan. On Wednesday, the short-term rental company launched Open Homes, a platform that allows hosts to volunteer to give shelter to a person in need. Whether a guest is displaced due to a natural disaster, an immigration ban, or has just fallen on hard times, Airbnb wants to help put a roof over his or her head. And now, you can help. This is by no means the first time the company has allowed its vast community to demonstrate their benevolence. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy left tens of thousands homeless on the east coast of the U.S., and Airbnb hosts made moves to provide lodging for those affected by the disaster. Similar acts of kindness have taken place since then, largely with the help of the company’s Disaster Response Tool. But with Airbnb’s latest tool, relief organizations can connect those in need directly with Airbnb volunteer hosts, which ought to lead to a more efficient process.

But the big-ticket item, Apple’s highly anticipated new smart speaker, was saved for last. Dubbed the HomePod (not the Apple Speaker) Apple’s new device boasts voice-activated smarts, Wi-Fi integration, and Homekit functionality to manage everything from your drapes to your door lock. Apple’s tagline for the HomePod is that it offers “The chance to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home,” but there’s an obvious problem with that claim: the way we enjoy music in the home has already been reinvented, and it wasn’t by Apple.

Facebook launches ‘disaster maps’ to provide vital data in the midst of a crisis In an effort to bridge the gap between obtaining crucial information quickly during a crisis and acting accordingly, Facebook has announced the launch of “disaster maps.” The company is partnering with multiple organizations such as UNICEF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, among others, to gain feedback on the most useful data to aggregate. Disaster maps serve the purpose of providing a more concrete visual for relief organizations to work off of when making important decisions during an emergency. The data used to create the maps is shared at regular intervals — not quite in real time, but close to it — as a disaster unfolds. Tracking this information can potentially better identify where resources such as food and water are needed, the directions most people are heading to find safety, and congested areas to avoid in order for help to arrive at the scene quicker.

That’s because scientists from the University of Adelaide in Australia have used deep learning technology to analyze the computerized tomography (CT) scans of patient organs, in what could one day serve as an early warning system to catch heart disease, cancer, and other diseases sooner, so that intervention can take place. Using a dataset of historical CT scans, and excluding other predictive factors like age, the system developed by the team was able to predict whether patients would die within five years around 70 percent of the time. The work was described in an article published in the journal Scientific Reports. “The goal of the research isn’t really to predict death, but to produce a more accurate measurement of health,” Dr. Luke Oakden-Rayner, a researcher on the project, told Digital Trends. “A patient’s risk of death is directly related to the health of their organs and tissues, but the changes of chronic diseases build up for decades before we get symptoms.” Read the full story here. Hackers use Britney Spears’ Instagram to hide instructions for malware attack Hacking groups are always working on new ways to perpetrate attacks, and now there’s evidence that a Russian outfit known as Turla has figured out a method of using Instagram to carry out its activities. Earlier this week, a report was published that suggests Britney Spears’ account on the photo-sharing service was used as a staging area for a Trojan attack. The information published by antivirus developer Eset revolves around a Firefox browser extension, according to a report from Ars Technica. The extension purported to offer enhanced security, but in fact served to give the hackers a method of seizing control over an infected system. A bit.ly URL directed the extension toward its command and control server, but the address was not actually present in its source code. Instead, it was hidden away in a seemingly random comment on one of Spears’ Instagram posts. Read the full story here. The bedbugs won’t bite thanks to this smart IoT track-and-trap device From smart thermostats that intelligently control the temperature in a room to smart devices like the Roomba vacuum cleaner that hoover up dirt, connected devices are capable of carrying out all sorts of functions in the places we sleep. Here’s one we’ve not come across before, though: a Wi-Fi enabled system smart device that’s designed to alert you of any bedbug outbreaks in the making. Developed by the company Delta Five, the currently available Automated Insect Monitoring System takes the form of a small, 3-inch box that monitors for insects around the clock. The device uses heat, vapors, pheromones, and other odorless methods to attract insects. It then captures them by closing its chamber door, takes a picture of the bug to identify it, and sends an alert to the relevant person, either via text message or email. “Given our initial focus on hospitality, and our core competencies in robotics, unattended sensors, computer vision, and machine intelligence, we recognized a significant gap between available products and actual need as it relates to bedbugs,” Jason Janét, Delta Five’s CEO, told Digital Trends.

They celebrate shallowness, enshrine the worst people as idols, coarsen even love into just another game show. And in some ways Planet Of The Apps — Apple’s first foray into producing its own TV show, which is available via Apple Music — reflects those criticisms. But its real problem is that it celebrates something far more culturally toxic than even the most vapid show about thrown wine. The concept is fairly straightforward: App developers, hoping for a shot at some venture capital, start delivering their pitch at the top of an escalator and have exactly 60 seconds to sell the four judges (Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba, Will.I.Am, and the one actual tech mogul in the proceedings, Gary Vanyerchuk) on their dream. The judges vote yes or no on their iPads; four nos, and you’re gone. But even one “yes” lets you pitch your app in more detail, possibly turning heads. Then, the lucky few get a celebrity mentor and we see the allegedly thrilling build-up to their big venture capital meeting. If the whole thing sounds like a series of meetings, that’s more or less what it is. Planet Of The Apps has two strikes against it right from the start. The first: as Apple’s first show, expectations are through the roof. The second: it’s built from the ground up to be a lengthy ad. Apple products are everywhere, every single developer on the show gets a nice chunk of airtime to promote their app, even if they don’t get funding, and Apple, of course, pushes the show through Apple Music. The problem is that it has no grasp of why reality shows endure. A show like Survivor, or American Idol, or this show’s blatant inspiration Shark Tank, work because they cater to our fantasies of being a Robinson Crusoe-esque hero, the star of a Cinderella story, or serving as the CEO of our own successful company. People want to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple wants employees, not competitors.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) - Bulletin false The Pandora Media name appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) 6399222 A-A+ By Michael J. de la MercedNew York Times News Service Pandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company. It was nice while it lasted. Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts. In a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it much-needed cash — and, perhaps down the line, become its owner. In taking a $480 million investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio provider, Pandora has secured a crucial infusion of money it needs to cover basic expenses. And the deal has allowed Sirius XM — controlled by the shrewd media mogul John Malone — to become the leading candidate to one day buy Pandora outright. “With this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry’s most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth,” Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said in a statement. Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: “This gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing.” The investment is the latest deal to shake up online music streaming, an industry that is popular with entrepreneurs and investors but has proved to be a financial sinkhole. Pandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year’s first quarter, to 76.7 million. Spotify, which lets users listen to specific tracks on demand — in addition to themed stations, like Pandora’s — has raised billions of dollars and is preparing for an unconventional listing on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Tidal, a similar streaming service purchased by Jay Z, sold a stake to Sprint this year as it continued to hemorrhage cash. Amazon, Apple and Google have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition. Pandora was particularly slow to adapt. In recent years, the success of Spotify and Apple Music made it clear that on-demand services that let customers pick virtually any song to listen to at any time would lure customers away from Pandora’s internet radio offering. Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year. “Pandora’s done something sensible,” Mulligan said, “but sensible doesn’t always get enough credit.” Internet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify. This year, Pandora rolled out Pandora Premium, a $10-a-month product that largely matches what its competitors offer. Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit. Enter Sirius XM The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price. The deal announced Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman. All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months. “Longer term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,” said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie. For Sirius XM, the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. 17454660 Share this story By Michael J. de la MercedNew York Times News Service More from Business Bend cannabis businesses growing, evolving, owners say Property transactions for Jefferson and Deschutes counties Last call for Juniper Brewing Co.

Taylor Swift got back together with Spotify on Friday, returning her music to streaming services almost three years after complaining publicly they did not pay artists enough, and on the same day rival Katy Perry released a new album. Swift, one of the world's best-selling pop stars, also made her music available on Pandora, Amazon.com and Tidal streaming services, her management team said. Her catalog had previously only been available on Apple Inc's Music service. The pop star's management said the latest decision to return to all streaming services was taken to celebrate her album "1989" selling over 10 million copies worldwide. "Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services at midnight," her management's Instagram account called Taylor Nation said late on Thursday. The move coincided with the release on Friday of "Witness," a new album by Perry, Swift's pop industry rival with whom she has a long-running personal feud. Swift, 27, has no new album to promote. Swift pulled all her music off Spotify and other streaming services in November 2014 after writing an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal saying that "piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically... Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free." Six months later she struck a deal with Apple Music for her "1989" album after Apple bowed to pressure and agreed to pay artists during a free trial of its new streaming music service. The announcement by Swift may ramp up rivalry with Perry, 32, who released her new album's first single, "Swish Swish," last month. She told talk show host Jimmy Fallon the song was "a great anthem for people to use whenever somebody's trying to hold you down or bully you." Swift's 2014 single "Bad Blood" has been seen as directed at Perry, and the "Firework" singer admitted recently that the two were not friends. "That's true, there is a situation. Honestly, it's really like she (Swift) started it and it's time for her to finish it," Perry told talk show host James Corden in May. She said the feud stemmed from a disagreement over backup dancers.

Here are the must-read highlights from Apple's event. By Cory Bohon | June 9, 2017, 2:20 AM PST Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus At every Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in recent years, Apple has announced a new version of Xcode and App Store services, but this year the company has outdone itself: Besides a newly rewritten Xcode, Apple unveiled substantial changes to the App Store in the way users access apps and also in what developers can offer on their App Store pages. Here's what these announcements mean for developers who provide apps through the iTunes App Store and write software for Apple's iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms. Plus, we cover news about macOS High Sierra, Swift Playgrounds, and Swift 4.0. SEE: WWDC 2017: The 3 biggest product announcements (TechRepublic) Xcode 9 Xcode 9 is a completely re-written version of Xcode that features a brand new source code editor that has been written in Swift. This is one of the biggest changes for developers, because of the many new features and support it adds for Swift code formatting, editing, and refactoring. Some of the new source code editor changes include: the ability to edit Markdown documents right from within Xcode with full highlighting support; the ability to automatically spot issues with Swift code as you type, removing the need to compile first to see build time issues, as well as providing more details if Xcode spots issues; and it offers more helpful automatic fixes. There's also a new source code refactoring system built in. For the first time, this includes the ability to easily refactor Swift codebases. Image: Apple, Inc. Xcode 9 is chock-full of other niceties. Here are some of the highlights: Faster indexing with the ability for Xcode to index a project while building. New build system written in Swift that will improve caching and parallelism to decrease Swift build times significantly. GitHub and GitHub enterprise support for cloning codebases, displaying the entire working copy, and the ability to perform branch updates right from within the Source Inspector. Main thread sanitizer to offer hints when Xcode detects that UI code is running on a thread other than main. Xcode Server is now bundled in Xcode 9, making it easier than ever to create and edit continuous integration bots. UI testing is 3x faster and up to 10x faster with new testing suites. iOS simulator can support multiple booted devices. Xcode 9 can deploy debug builds wirelessly to networked iOS and tvOS devices—you only need to plug the devices in once to prepare them in the Devices section of Xcode. I'm sure I echo the sentiments of Apple developers everywhere when I say that Xcode 9 looks like a stellar release. I'm extremely happy to see Apple taking the time to fix issues that have bugged developers from the beginning of Swift development. SEE: CNET's coverage of WWDC 2017 (CNET) Swift Playgrounds 1.5 and 2.0 Two new releases of the Swift Playgrounds app for iPad were announced this week: Swift Playgrounds 1.5 and 2.0.

This $50 case turns the Pi into a desktop Special report: The cloud v. data center decision (free PDF) Apple pre-announced Swift Playgrounds 1.5, which adds Bluetooth connectivity support for drones, Spheros, LEGO toys, and other devices. This allows users of Swift Playgrounds to bring their code to life with real-world toys and enhance the learning ability when Swift and Swift Playgrounds are used in conjunction with programming courses that Apple has developed for high schools and colleges. This version of Swift Playgrounds was immediately made available for users to download from the iTunes App Store. Apple also unveiled Swift Playgrounds 2.0, a new major version of the app that will be released in the Fall 2017. An early beta of it was released to developers, and access can be requested through the Apple Developer Download portal. Swift Playgrounds 2.0 adds many new features, including: integrated API documentation for code; Swift 4.0 and Swift 3.2 support for existing and new codebases; support for the new iOS 11 SDK; and support for Camera and ARKit for augmented reality programming. SEE: How to use the Swift Playgrounds iPad app to code on the go (TechRepublic) Swift 4.0 Apple unveiled Swift 4.0 at WWDC 2017. The most important change in this version of Swift is that there is no code conversion for Swift 3.x projects in Xcode 9; Apple achieved this by creating Swift 3.2, which lets existing Swift 3.0 projects build without issue in Xcode 9. When you're ready to do the Swift 4.0 conversion to get the new language features and improved performance, you will have a little bit of work to do, but it will not be nearly as difficult as the Swift 2.x to 3.0 transition. Other features include the ability to use the new Codable protocol to add the ability to serialize struct data seamlessly using JSONDecoder and JSONEncoder. Swift 4.0 also includes: Multiline String literals; a new String that uses collections; improved dictionary functionality; and improved keypaths for key value coding. Learn more about Swift 4.0's features in WWDC 2017 Session 402 ("What's New in Swift"). SEE: Job description: iOS developer (Tech Pro Research) App Store Developers everywhere have been clamoring for App Store changes for years, and that's exactly what we got this year. iOS 11 will have a completely revamped App Store that will feature developer interviews for apps, and offer a more curated experience that separates games from other apps. SEE: Gallery: Everything iOS 11 from Apple's WWDC 2017 keynote (TechRepublic) Developers will also have more control over the way their apps appear in the store. Through iTunes Connect, users will be able to customize the look of their pages, add marketing materials, videos, in-app purchases, and other assets that appear and match the new look of the store. One of the biggest changes to the App Store is the ability to implement a Phased Release of your app. This means that you can set the number of devices that should receive your app when you submit an update in order to test infrastructure and ensure a positive rollout. Get more details about how this customization can happen by watching WWDC 2017 Session 302 ("What's New in iTunes Connect"). macOS is going 64-bit only Apple announced during the Platforms State of the Union that all macOS apps will be going 64-bit only soon. macOS High Sierra was unveiled at WWDC '17, and it will be the last major version of macOS that will support 64-bit apps without compromises. What does this mean for developers? Apple announced that no new 32-bit apps can be submitted to the App Store after January 2018. Any 32-bit apps already on the store can be updated through June 2018, at which time Apple will no longer accept 32-bit binaries through iTunes Connect.

Major marketing makeover Microsoft must passionately market Surface Laptop to take on Apple Surface vs. Mac How does the Surface Laptop stack up to Apple's MacBooks? On The Ups High-end Surface Laptop shipping date moves up to June 30 Timing is everything Should Microsoft launch Surface Pro and Surface Laptop on the same day? < > Surface Laptop Surface Pro Windows 10 Creators Update Best Laptops Best VPN Services Best Antivirus Surface Book Surface Pro 4 Lumia 950 XL Lumia 950 Windows 10 Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro Surface Laptop > MacBook Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. Apple MacBook (2017): Tech spec smackdown By Richard Devine Friday, Jun 9, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 204 Comments It's PC versus Mac once again, as Microsoft's first traditional notebook enters the premium laptop arena. At first glance the Surface Laptop is more like the MacBook Air than Apple's 12-inch MacBook. But because the latter seems to be a forgotten product at this piont, we're comparing the Surface Laptop to the 12-inch MacBook. The target market audience may be a little different, because Microsoft is going after the students directly. However, Apple laptops have long been a favorite of those with student loans. So the comparison seems fair. Let's take a quick look at these two laptops side by side. Updated June 7 2017: We modified this story to reflect the refreshed hardware in the Apple MacBook following WWDC 2017. See at Microsoft See at Apple Surface Laptop and Apple MacBook technical specifications Category Surface Laptop Apple MacBook Display 13.5-inch Pixel Sense display 10 point multi-touch 12-inch Retina Display Display resolution 2256 x 1504, at 201ppi Aspect Ratio: 3:2 2304x1440, at 226 ppi Aspect Ratio: 16:10 Software Windows 10 S macOS Sierra Processor 7th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 7th Gen Intel Core m3, i5 (Y series) or i7 (Y series) Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Solid State Drive (SSD) 256GB, 512GB PCIe SSD Memory 4GB, 8GB or 16GB RAM 8GB or 16GB RAM Graphics i5: Intel HD graphics 620; i7: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel HD graphics 615 Ports One full-size USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, Headset jack, Surface Connect One USB-C 3.1 Battery 14.5 hours of use 12 hours of use Pen Surface Pen No Weight 2.76 lbs 2.03 lbs Dimensions 12.13 inches x 8.78 inches x 0.57 inches 11.04 inches x 7.74 inches x 0.52 inches Price From $999 From $1,299 We've not spent enough time with the Surface Laptop to get any real feel for it, but looking at it just on paper next to the 12-inch MacBook makes several things clear. The 'Apple tax' is very real with the MacBook next to the Surface Laptop. Any concerns about the price of the Surface Laptop can be quickly washed away by looking at pricing for Apple's laptops. The entry-level MacBook is more expensive, and that's with an Intel Core m3 processor. However you look at it, the Kaby Lake Core i5 in the Surface is just better. All around, in fact, Surface Laptop is better equipped. The base model loses out in storage and RAM, but at every other step on the ladder it's more powerful than the MacBook. The bump in the MacBook specs as of WWDC 2017 closes the gap, but we're still looking at Y series chips, better known as the new versions of Core m. The Windows 10 S version of the OS could be limiting for some, not like macOS, but it's also easily upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, which levels the playing field. For a notebook that's not a lot larger or heavier, the Surface Laptop promises better battery life, as well as a performance edge over the MacBook. Ultimately, if you want a Mac you'll get a Mac. But Microsoft came out swinging with its first traditional laptop.

They should be throwing any SSDs with a minimum of specs equal to Samsung's 950 EVO. Its like they get caught up on microengineering and just grab any random SSD they have laying around on the shelf.  0 2 days ago Reply Michael Pelto Compare the hardware all you want. It's obvious that the Surface has better specs. I have a new Alienware laptop that's uber fast and ridiculously powerful. Yet it has more downtime due to blue screens and setup malfunctions, bad updates, driver issues, etc. than does my MacBook Pro. I bought the Alienware after being away from Windows (and gaming) for 20 years. I'm currently selling my Alienware at a drastically reduced price and never going back to a Windows machine ... like ... ever. I'm not even going to buy an XBox. I'll stick with the PlayStation line. I despise Apple's pricing and warranty-breaking do-it-yourself upgrade policy, but the OS works and I never have downtime or troubles of any kind. Macs are truly plug-and-play too. Everything works right out of the box. And I can even run Windows on a Mac should I ever choose to torture myself again.  -9 1 month ago Reply torbach1 You and I both. That's the point I've reached. Before I had my Surface Book, I had a Dell XPS 13 and a Dell XPS 15 - both constantly gave me all sorts of issues. I've wasted so many hours troubleshooting basic things that should just work. I'm done with that. -3 1 month ago Reply paliotti Hey WHO LET YOU ON THIS SITE?!?!?!?! JK :D 0 2 days ago Reply torbach1 I've had a Surface Book with Performance Base, a very expensive MS product. I'm a former MS employee, and very technical, but I've had nothing but trouble with this laptop, from it not going to Sleep when told to (a known issue that MS has not addressed in 2 years), to the "Sleep of Death" issue, to bluetooth issues when connected to the Surface Hub, Surface Keyboard, and Surface Arc Mouse, that I'm having with two hubs, 2 keyboards and 2 mice (one at the office, and one at work), where I have to remove each device every time I start the day, and sometimes mid-day, restart, then readd each, sometimes having to restart more than once. As much as I love the Surface hardware, MS, unlike Apple, seems to not have benefited much from having their own hardware running their own software. I'm seriously considering switching to a Mac because of this at this point despite their insane prices, lack of Touch screen support, etc. Very disappointing experiences. If it's just me, I'd love to hear from others that say they're not having the Sleep issues, or Sleep of Death issues.... Maybe my unit is defective, and I can still get it replaced if so through my warranty. MS has not been able to resolve these issues, but my warranty is through Best Buy/Geek Squad. -4 1 month ago Reply SenorGravy It's totally fascinating to me that Microsoft produced products are the ones that seem to be the buggy-est. You would think that controlling the whole widget would make for the best experience. Sadly...no. -1 2 days ago Reply Calebdaddy I have a Surface Book, Surface Pro 3, and 4. While I had the sleep issue on the first frimware of the Surface Book. That issue has long passed. I think you also may have an issue with your BT card. I would definitly get the unit replaced. As an ACMT as well I can ensure you this has happened an uncountable amount of times with Macbooks as well. It's simply impossible to not have lemons when mass producing.  I think your biggest issue may be that you bought the machine from BB and went with the Geek Squad warranty. I have had nothing but issues with Geek Squad refurbs in the past and refuse to ever use their warranties again. That being said a warranty I due trust and have good success using is the Microsoft Complete Warranty for Surface much like Apple Care but it also covers accidental damage. I returned my initial Surface Book two separate time until I didn't have backlight bleeding on the LCD. They sent me a new Surface Book each time.      1 1 day ago Reply Hirox K Menu (context) key (count as hardware right?) is one of the reason I'll never go for a Mac. Alone with other shortcut keys, Windows is much keyboard-user-friendly than Mac. -1 1 month ago Reply akdj I'm a fan of the Surface Pro and the Book --- as to this comparison, as soon as you DO upgrade your Surface to the same amount of storage and RAM - the price is paritied.  The 'm' series processors allow for a fanless design, they're a 4.5watt part (compared with the i5's 15 watts) and while not a 'touch' display, Apple's display is much sharper and it's OS, macOS, matured with both stock and third party apps to provide for excellent scaling and usage of the display. So far a major issue with Win10 - while better with stock apps the devs aren't moving real quick on resolution independence for W10. Color management system wide in the OS provides a better, more accurate display and 'promises are promises' - MS promising double digit hours of operation is no different than the marketing BS I was given both with SP2 and SP4 as well as my Surface Book i use both OS's but I don't get these comparisons with the 12", two pound MacBook! Why not just compare with the MacBook Pros using the same processors? And when comparing remember storage and memory are extremely important elements of s build. Not everyone is rendering 4, 5, amd 8K footage or working with a hundred layers of a 50mpxl medium format raw file, or dealing with building a casino usin CAD! The MacBook certainly won't meet those requirements but neither will the Surface! When it comes to tasks most folks still do on a computer - email, surfing, file management, media consumption or photo/video organization and 'minor edits'... with software like PS Elements, GarageBand, iMovie, Windows Media Creation tools or third party shareware. Most don't subscribe, like we do, to the full Master Auite from Adobe.  You won't be gaming on the Surface. It has no forward thinking ports; Thunderbolt, USB C, and the ports it does have will soon be outdated during a time we keep our gear longer than ever.  I agree, there's an Apple Tax. Buy as a user of both for nearly four decades --- Apple IIe in '84 - 286 in 1990, I can honestly say that the Surface line has given me many more headaches than the MacBook Pro and MacBook I've owned during the same time period. I don't blame it all on the hardware but the OS, like Apple, is made by the hardware OEM and IMHO should be MUCH better optimized than past iterations. Hopefully this one shows less than earlier versions but don't fall for silly battery life promises and 'lower pricing '. The support post purchase with Apple is significantly better than dealing with MS - and resale ...a consideration down the road isn't a fair comparison. I recently sold my 2012 15" first generation retina MacBook Pro, and I sold it for nearly 60% it's original price - a nice boost for the new purchase.  I'm unable to even donate five or six year old Windows gear ;) i don't mean to troll, I use em both along with a coup,e VMs, Linux and the two primary mobile OSs, Android and iOS. Simply put, MS should get back in the mobile arena of for nothing morethan the vertical and horizontal integration and aggregation Apple's had such success with between iOS and macOS and tvOS and watchOS. It's an impressive and wildly efficient way to manage my business, my life and my family's life.  Not to mention the lack of 'tech support' as Dad I'm needing to do theses days with everyone else using the Apple ecosystem  im an avid fan of Windows as well, don't get me wrong - Xbox is a great product as are the Surface products (I'm in love with the Studio but as the author discusses how underpowered a computer that is made and admittedly, by its OEM, not a powerful machine in the MacBook, and its expense (although double the SSD and RAM) --- he/she is, I'm sure aware of how A) expensive and B) underpowered the beautiful Surface Studio is.  And lastky, rightfully, the author points out Apple is do for a refresh, as the comparisons made in the review are comparing a 14 month old laptop to one that's on pre-order and just announced, soon to be released that would have been a much better comparison with the low end MacBook Pro from last fall --- at least you're less than a year old in your comparisons! J 0 1 month ago Reply bdfortin Agreed on the comparison choice. Clearly the closest competitor to the Surface Laptop isn't the MacBook using a 4.5 W Core M chip, it's the one using the same 15 W Core i5 and i7 as the Surface Laptop. It's disingenuous for Windows Central to compare a thin & light laptop against an ultra-portable. 1 4 weeks ago Reply Dillan K A lot of what akjd has said here is truth.

MacBook 12" isn't better than Surface Laptop too. These is two different product, two different category, and two diffferent philosophy. Macbook is more than a half pound lighter (a lot!), thinner and it is COMPLETELY SILENT, because it have a fanless processor.  Surface Laptop should be compared more to 13 inch MBP without touch bar, if we talk about specs. MB 12 philosophy - extremely light computer with decent batery time and amazing Retina display. SL philosophy - all in one computer (touchscreen, more ports, great ESTIMATED battery life, but in thicker, heavier, louder (but still thin and light vs other competitors) package.  2 1 month ago Reply fabiomarp Gee, totally​ agree. It would better be a comparison between Surface Laptop and HP Spectre X360. That makes sense! 0 3 weeks ago Reply Griffin Anderson Well, what about the people that are debating between getting Surface Laptop or 12-inch MacBook?n that case the comparison is important to those people. But the readers of this site can never be happy. Can they? 0 2 days ago Reply NoFlames2 The weight difference is going to mostly be about the different sizes, 12" Vs 13.5". 1 1 month ago Reply Enza Knight Interesting comparison. Surprised by the weight difference and the SL being slightly thicker.

Yes, laptop and touch work great together, but the precision of the pen has never felt right on this form factor. 0 1 month ago Reply coip It's a pity they didn't employ a hinge that would've enabled the Surface Laptop to fold back onto itself and turn into a tablet, similar to the Lenovo Yoga line. That would've been more in tune with what the Surface line is about. After having owned 2-in-1 devices for the past four years, I just can't go back to a normal laptop. 0 2 days ago Reply PachecoCorporationCeo My siblings have pre-ordered 2 surface laptops for school lucky them. 6 1 month ago Reply NoFlames2 Change the configuration to match RAM and SSD and the prices are the same.

Apple focused on mobile and basically stopped caring about computers. It's the opposite that MS did. 2 1 month ago Reply Keith Wallace This should have been put against the Macbook Air, if anything. Same class of display size, carries an i5 itself, and starts at the same $1,000. It's back on Boardwell still, but for the same $1,000 you DO still get double the RAM and storage. I'd take those over the Kaby jump myself. Then again, I'd rather just get something from a different Windows OEM and get the better RAM and storage of the Macbook and the better CPU/iGPU of the Surface Laptop, while spending less than either costs. They're both terrible values, even when put against the same class of hardware. -4 1 month ago Reply Dont Fear the Future   Actually, the $999 Mac Air starts with 128gig of SSD, just like the Surface Laptop at $999, but does have 8 gigs of ram.  However, I think the trade-off is in the display.  The Surface Laptop has a 13.5 inch, 2256x1504, 10 finger multi-touch display.  The Mac Book Air has a 13.3 inch, 1440 x 900 display (sub-1080p display).     1 1 month ago Reply Keith Wallace Might have misread it, my mistake. Regardles, I would take 8 GB of RAM over a touch display. However, regardless of THAT, I'd take going with another PC OEM, where I save money on these options, get the OS I want (Windows) and get the greater RAM allotment, storage space, and keep things like the touch display, while having some options that are hybrids or have fingerprint scanners. I made a mistake, but not one that changes the reality that the Surface Laptop is overpriced hardware on a crippled OS at a price that doesn't justify either compromise, let alone both. No reason for this to be missing 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. -1 1 month ago Reply pjhenry1216 It's not necessarily overpriced. They just spent money on things that you personally don't care about. I, too, would allocate funds differently and get a different machine as well. However, to simply ignore the value of something simply because it doesn't appeal to you is somewhat odd. 1 1 month ago Reply lbp775 You should remove the Surface Pen from the comparison since it does not include one. 4 1 month ago Reply xsikal And since the form factor will make it not very suitable for using the pen anyway. -2 1 month ago Reply Skie77 Maybe not very suitable, but the option is there if you need it. 1 1 month ago Reply Keith Wallace That would require unbiased reporting. -4 1 month ago Reply pjhenry1216 what is unbiased about including something that is true? The most I'd say is that they should have said "Pen compatibility" *or* included a footnote saying Pen not included. Either way, the pen compatibility is a differentiator. I've used a pen on the SP4 while setup in the laptop form factor. So people might care. 0 1 month ago Reply pjhenry1216 but it is compatible with one. i've used a pen on the surface while in 'laptop' mode, so its not unheard of. there is no pen that is compatible with the macbook at all. so. its still a differentiator and should be noted. 0 1 month ago Reply JaimitoFrog Unless there is a reason to use iOS, the mac is just too ancient without touchscreen or inking. Touch bar is silly. The rest of the stuff, build quality and design, the SL matches up or is even better. And yes, there are far more choices in the PC world, some cheaper or better specs. That's the beauty of PCs. At least now, there are PCs that match or beat the premium design of macs, and not just Surface, but Hp, dell, Samsung etc have began to make more premium laptops. In the old days, the best was a ThinkPad. 3 1 month ago Reply Sin Ogaris macOS* 0 1 month ago Reply Northcliff I imagine you won't be getting those battery life figures on Windows 10 Pro 1 1 month ago Reply JaimitoFrog That's a good question.

You can also get a Lenovo Yoga with the same i5/8/256 setup, a 15.6-inch screen, plus a dedicated Nvidia GPU and hybrid design, and it'll only be $725 (on-sale from $850). Or you can grab an ASUS laptop with a 14" screen (though at a low resolution and without touch), i5, 8 GB of RAM, and 256 GB SSD, plus a fingerprint scanner, and it'll only be $750. I can keep going with the $800 Dell and Lenovo stuff that adds a few things like a fingerprint scanner on their end as well, but the point is that I can go to Best Buy, save a couple hundred bucks or more, and get better hardware from OEMs I trust more. 0 1 month ago Reply ddn123 However, the engineering of the Surface Laptop is superior than the OEMs.  Better thermal control.  Didn't I hear that the SSD is actually integrated onto the mortherboard?  But do you want to spend $500 bucks more for a Surface over a Dell? 0 1 month ago Reply Keith Wallace What do you base any of those claims onn though? Surfaces have had pretty serious flaws with things like power management early on in their lives, for example. I've got nothing to say that I think MS builds better devices than Lenovo, Dell, ASUS, or HP. They all put out high-end devices, and the specs usually kick the pants off the $1,000 Surface Laptop model. You talk of the great engineering of Microsoft, but remember that they needed TWO revisions on their "perfect" Xbox One controller, and they didn't update that $150 Elite Controller that turned out to have some notable design flaws. This is also the company that had the RRoD fiasco, the creaky chassis of the 950 family, and I'm sure I'm forgetting things. As for thermals, again, based on what? Did you see any thermal testing? Have other OEMs had issues with long-term damage from poor thermal management? Didn't a line of Surfaces have fan issues that would kick on loudly pretty commonly as well (I think they were too sensitive to temp changes, not overheating)? You're makign these claims with nothing to back them up. Oh, and an integrated SSD? That's a BIG negative. That means non-replaceable, meaning if your drive dies, your laptop's dead. If you overrun the storage, you're out of luck. A non-integrated SSD could be more easily replaced in the event of a failure, or a cavalier tinkerer could open the thing and upgrade the drive size, if desired. That's like arguing for soldering on the RAM, which is awful. I was at MicroCenter a couple weeks back, and some Mac fan was there to buy RAM to upgrade his Macbook. Employee dashed his dreams once he told him it was non-upgradeable. That's a BAD thing, not something to argue for. I don't want to spend $100 more for something than is necessary, let alone the $300-ish gap between the Dell and Microsoft options. Microsoft has been a mess on the hardware side lately and done a lot of general things that have bothered me. They are no longer a "premium" or "preferred" brand for me. They are now in a lump with the other brands I'll consider. They haven't fallen onto the list of ones I won't touch (HP, Lenovo, Apple, Google, Samsung), but they haven't done anything that impressed me since the Surface Book, maybe even all the way back to HoloLens. -1 1 month ago Reply Skie77 As I remember all laptops had problems with power management and battery life. There was a problem with the new Intel CPUs. The SSD is integrated for a reason explained below by Panos. Never done before on other laptops, and why this laptop has better battery and performance than competition. People just see specs and say: "Only 128GB that is expensive". They have no idea that MS actually push technology, just like with the upcoming Xbox.

I still find the board integration to be trash. It's anti-consumer, just like soldering RAM. What was a meaningful statement is that they're using a PCIe drive, not SATA, and those are more expensive, faster SSD solutions. That matters. The power consumption statement likely offers VERY little gains, maybe a matter of a couple minutes in a battery test. Maybe. The chosen bus matters for performance, but the placement likely doesn't do a whole lot for performance either. End of the day, it's a little better than I first understood, but it's still not a $1,000 laptop to me. As for Xbox, I'm not giving them credit until it's released and I see the results. I'm still leery on the specs of it, given it's a $200 GPU and the same garbage cores in the CPU, just overclocked. They're going to have to do some widespread convincing that the software magic and custom design are going to pull off what they claim, because it's not a setup to write home about yet. That means I want to see that third-party stuff pulls off great visuals at high resolutions and framerates, and that MS didn't build this thing by just gutting all of its dev teams, leaving us with very little to play on the exclusive side. -1 1 month ago Reply Skie77 I am pretty sure the engineers at MS didn't spent time integrating things if end result only was a couple of minutes. More likely pushed efficency 5-10% which is somewhere between ½ - 1½ hour. As for the Xbox yes we will have to see the end result, but I don't see why they would lie about the 6TF performance. It is also way more than just an overclock of old tech. You don't get a 4x performance from just an overclock. DigitalFoundry did a good job explaining all the work that was put into all this. They promised us 6TF, nothing more nothing less. I don't care what processor they use, whatever it's a Ryzen or an old Amiga 500 Motorola 68000 CPU they push to reach the promised performance. Time will tell. They don't get credit for much of their really amazing work though.        1 1 month ago Reply pjhenry1216 show me the inspiron in the surface laptop form factor & weight and *then* i'll consider your argument that it's overpriced.

Photo: Andrew Harrer Sirius XM buys stake in music streaming site Pandora 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service just a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company. It was nice while it lasted. Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts. Now, in a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it some much-needed cash - and, perhaps down the line, become its new owner. In taking a $480 million investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio provider, Pandora has secured a crucial infusion of money it needs to cover basic expenses. And the deal has allowed Sirius XM - controlled by the shrewd media mogul John Malone - to become the leading candidate to one day buy Pandora outright. "With this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry's most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth," Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said in a statement.

Business The sugar wars are still raging, and this candy maker is just Uber board mulls leave of absence for CEO In Silicon Valley, power industry is next target for disruption Changing markets challenging Houston power companies Sirius XM buys stake in music streaming site Pandora Taxpayer gains murky as San Antonio, Houston spend millions to Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: "This gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing." The investment is the latest deal to shake up online music streaming, an industry that is increasingly popular with entrepreneurs and investors but has proved to be a financial sinkhole. Pandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year's first quarter, to 76.7 million. Spotify, which lets users listen to specific tracks on demand - in addition to themed stations, like Pandora's - has raised billions of dollars and is preparing for an unconventional listing on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Tidal, a similar streaming service purchased by Jay Z, sold a stake to Sprint this year as it continued to hemorrhage cash. Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition. Pandora was particularly slow to adapt. In recent years, the success of Spotify and Apple Music made it clear that on-demand services that let customers pick virtually any song to listen to at any time would lure customers away from Pandora's internet radio offering. Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year. "Pandora's done something sensible," Mulligan said, "but sensible doesn't always get enough credit." Internet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify. This year, Pandora rolled out Pandora Premium, a $10-a-month product that largely matches what its competitors offer. Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit. Enter Sirius XM. The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. The deal announced on Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman. All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months. For Sirius XM - part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media - the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM's traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars. Although Pandora was one of the first to let customers legally stream music online, it has grappled with a host of challenges. Among them has been battling with music labels over the royalties it pays each time it plays a song. The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora's major backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service. Pandora will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday's series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work.

It’s time for a break Anyone fancy a breather? Take five? I'm thinking five years. Seriously. Five years of doing absolutely nothing groundbreaking on the tech front. Mothball the R&D labs, sign an amnesty on launching new products, give ourselves a chance to catch up with what we have. The thought occurred to me after a recent PC Pro podcast in which we were discussing the legacy of Steve Jobs and how things hadn't changed dramatically at Apple since his death five years ago. No TV, no self-driving car, no VR nonsense: Apple is still largely reliant on the same iPhone, iPad, Mac lineup as it was when Jobs passed. Indeed, we've grown so used to rabid innovation that a period of (astoundingly profitable) product refinement makes it look like Tim Cook's fallen asleep at the wheel – even though products such as the smartphone, tablet and even the laptop are still barely out of puberty. When my parents were born just after the war, the dominant methods of media consumption were radio, newspapers and, by the time they were teenagers, television. Books were books, and music came via the wireless or on vinyl platters. I showed up some 30 years later, and barely anything had changed. Tape had begun nibbling away at vinyl and video recorders were in their infancy, but it was largely as you were. The media world my children are now growing up in, on the other hand, is almost unrecognisable. Today, for instance, I walked into my office first thing this morning and received a news update simply by asking the Amazon Echo to give me my "flash briefing" – a quick audio summary of the latest news headlines. I set to work on my laptop, read and answered a dozen emails, browsed the web for while, took calls on my smartphone, recorded the PC Pro podcast with colleagues via Skype, streamed Spotify as I walked the dog, and settled down in the evening to watch Netflix, while keeping an eye on the football scores using my tablet. None of this was possible a generation ago. It was barely imaginable. I watched a lot of Tomorrow's World when I was growing up in the 1980s, and I'm pretty sure Judith Hann never said that one day we'd get our news headlines by speaking to a virtual assistant inside a cylindrical black speaker, which transcribes speech near-instantaneously using a huge server farm located on the other side of the planet. It was all jetpacks and robots that play snooker. The level of disruption that this tidal wave of technology has caused is immense. Whole industries have been knocked sideways – high-street retail, print media, the music industry and broadcast television will be next. The social impact of our new digital lifestyles has been equally traumatic. Kids walk home from school glued to their smartphones; revolutions start over social media; jobs are being outsourced by the tens of thousands; and perhaps most alarmingly of all, Rick Astley has never been more popular. We don't have time to get used to all this new stuff before something comes along to topple it. Books and newspapers have been around for centuries, radio since the early 20th century, television for decades. When I was growing up, we had the same TV set for 15 years. The idea of any piece of technology lasting that long these days seems ludicrous. In fact, whole genres of devices are lucky to last even a fraction of that time. eBook reader sales are already on the slide, as are tablets. MP3 players have come and gone, email is dead to anyone under 25, and who knows if the open web will make it through another 25 years, or be replaced by something else? My opening plea for a worldwide veto on new product launches is, obviously, about as likely as George Michael opening an MOT centre in Mosul. But would a period of calm, measured refinement of existing products be that bad? Instead of the "next big thing", I'd settle for a smartphone battery that lasted a week, a version of Windows that could update without crippling my computer, a spreadsheet that let me say "divide the sum of this column by this cell" without having to learn arcane formulae. Me and what's left of my industry are as guilty as anyone of prodding Tim Cook to do something special, something Jobs-like, something that will get us a gazillion clicks and sell a few thousand more magazines. But maybe Apple knew what it was doing when it put Mr Dependable in charge. We're wandering around dazed after the past 20 years of ceaseless innovation and none of us knows what we're doing with this stuff yet. HarperCollins can trace its lineage back to George III, while most app publishers are barely older than Prince George. Let's take stock, work with what we have. Sometimes a rest is as good as a change.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Bloomberg News Jun 9, 2017 at 3:33 pm | Print View Verizon, AT&T and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones. Thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second — speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent, to $152.56, in New York on Friday, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple in theory could use Qualcomm’s chips. But it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Like what you're reading?

Everyman is gifted for something. Education will never make you wealthy; it will only give you a platform to express your gift. Real wealth lies not in your job but in your gifts. We must educate the youth to discover their latent gifts and potentials instead of wasting their precious time and ‘destiny’ looking for jobs that only exist in the figment of their imagination. The job you are looking for is not out there, it is right within your gifting! As an entrepreneurship coach, I normally tell graduates during some of my training sessions that they are not unemployed because they can’t find a job; they are unemployed because they have not started using their gifts. Unemployment has little or nothing to do with job vacancies; it is a function of whether we are putting our gifts to use or rendering them dormant. I have at several fora, reached out to people in government that we need to re-define the meaning of unemployment in order to solve the nagging issue. Unemployment is not the inability to find a job, but rather the inability to discover and use one’s gift productively and maximally. It is a gross waste of human resource and latent potentials when gifted and talented individuals spend a chunk of their life looking for jobs. The menace of unemployment has turned youths to economic fugitives. Salary is becoming increasingly unsustainable and undependable. Any life that is designed around salary makes the victim live in a vicious circle. Apart from the sober truth that the proceeds from salary is unsustainable, you could actually get fired from your job! Find your gift and you’ll always have work to do. The key to personal success is the discovering of your personal gifting. Steve Jobs was “ejected” from Apple, a company that he started with Steve Wozniak but was later reinstated when it was very glaring that Apple couldn’t move forward without his unique gift. The firing of Jobs and his reinstatement eventually became the two defining moments in the history of the personal computer industry. Steve Jobs was just 30 years old, wildly successful, fabulously wealthy and a global celebrity. And then it all came crashing down. He had revolutionized personal computing and created an iconic brand – only to be forced out of the company he had built into a billion-dollar colossus. Steve Jobs’ career followed a different and unusual trajectory: a meteoric rise, a humbling fall, and then one amazing comeback, perhaps the most spectacular comeback of all time. After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs and his buddy Steve Wozniak launched the company from his family’s suburban California garage in 1976. Jobs lived his whole life trying to put the computer in a phone. Nobody thought the cell phone could do what a normal household PC does until Steve Jobs changed the game. Jobs was Apple’s chief visionary, a role that put him in charge of the team developing Apple’s next revolutionary product, the Macintosh computer. In 1981, Apple Computer went public. Just two years later, Apple cracked the Fortune 500 and Jobs recruited John Sculley, the head of Pepsi-Cola, to be its new chief executive. As the President and CEO of Pepsi-Cola, it was not easy ‘poaching’ away Sculley from the much adored corporation but record has it that it took Steve Jobs just a question to unsettle even Sculley’s confidence in a drink that he has come a long way to believe in. “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?” Jobs famously asked. With the passage of time, the friendly relationship between Jobs and Sculley got sour due to power tussle. In an unusual and pathetic twist of fate, Sculley later masterminded the ejection of the same man that hired him! As power struggle erupted between Sculley and Jobs, the loyalty of some Apple executives became polarised. In the spring of 1985 Apple’s board sided with the CEO (Sculley), removing Jobs from his command of the Macintosh group for his unguarded drive, disruptive lifestyle and overzealousness. Apple’s new world was emerging without Jobs and seemingly, Jobs’ world came crashing. Jobs captured what transpired in one of his famous speeches when he said, “We had just released our finest creation – the Macintosh – a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so, at 30, I was out! What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.” Jobs left Apple and spent the summer of 1985 in a ‘midlife crisis’, a crisis that later gave him the impetus to rise. He alongside few other loyalists went on to create NeXT, a company which focused on making high end computers targeting education, science and finance market. In the 1990s, Apple was a sinking ship. With a sprawling product line and a host of dysfunctional products, apple incurred heavy losses and was in deep financial mess. Under Sculley’s leadership, Apple sunk down like a ship with a hole. Apple had lost its market share and the respect that came with it. The company was no more innovative, having not actually created anything after Jobs left. Microsoft had launched its incredibly successful windows 95, which was way more sophisticated than the Mac counterpart from Apple. Microsoft eventually became Apple’s nightmare! By then NeXT had begun licensing its NeXT operating system and had all the features that Apple needed. Realizing their mistake, the Board ousted Sculley and bought NeXT for a handsome price (427 million dollars) and requested Jobs to become CEO of Apple again. The decision to sack Sculley was tough but there were greater odds against him. One of US greatest investors, Larry Ellison, along with Prince Talaweed of Saudi, had bought a large chunk of depressed Apple stock and threatened a hostile takeover unless Jobs was brought back. So, Apple ended up buying NeXT at a highly inflated price to get Jobs back in as the CEO. This time, he didn’t only become the CEO, they also made him the iCEO! Jobs did not only bring back Apple, he turned it into an empire, driving the company to its greatest successes, from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. There are some life situations that put a demand on our creativity. Some people need to be fired in order for them to be fired-up. In his memorable speech to Stanford graduates, the “tech revolutionist” said, “I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter into one of the most creative periods of my life”. Education is not the solution to unemployment, the discovery of your gift is! Any education that does not teach us to discover, nurture and develop our gifting and uniqueness is a waste. We need to redesign our educational sector in such a way that it allows for the nurturing of individual gifts. Each year, the Nigerian educational sector keeps churning out ‘graduates with certificates’ but with no intrinsic value. The aspect of self-discovery and entrepreneurship training must be blended formally into our curriculum. Education cannot solve the problem of unemployment, entrepreneurship will. In fact, education without entrepreneurship training aggravates unemployment. When it comes to job creation, it is not the government’s responsibility, it is the entrepreneur’s. Government is only needed to create the conducive environment. It is entrepreneurs that generate jobs, not government. Our individual gift is an indicator of our purpose and calling in life. In the words of Sam Adeyemi: ‘‘You will only shine in the area of your gifting”. I dare say that salary is the bribe we are paid to forget our gifts. In order to live a fulfilled and impactful life, we need to work harder on our gift than our job. We need to discover our gift, develop it and sell it. We can retire from our jobs, but we cannot retire from our gift. We can get fired from our job, but we cannot be fired from our gift!

The new app review guidelines stipulate that developers may no longer create their own pop-ups to ask for a rating. Apple is making it mandatory to use its official in-app rating function in the Apple API. This will only allow apps to show review pop-ups three times a year, and will block apps from presenting the pop-up if you have already rated them. Users will also be able to opt out of receiving pop-ups entirely.

You can’t possibly remember everything you come across. But when something is important, it helps to have a quick way to remember it. Smart technology is dumbing down the human race Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? As a child, you memorized your friend's phone numbers; now you just add them to your phone. You used to memorize directions; now you just use your GPS. Are humans becoming stupid? Read More , but it’s also about how you use it. Offloading the non-important bits of your memory to a device will free up room for you to retain other information. There’s no reason for you to remember John the assistant’s birthday or your mother-in-law’s favorite color, so let one of these apps do it for you instead. 1. Google Assistant (Android, iOS): The Best “Remember” Voice Command Google Assistant, the company’s answer to Siri, is the most remarkable piece of artificial intelligence in any phone. You probably don’t know the remarkable things Assistant can do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do Android's version of Siri -- Google Assistant -- is more powerful than most people realize. Read More . One of those is smartly remembering things for you — and we don’t just mean reminders. As usual, this works via voice commands. Say “OK Google” followed by “Remember,” and then speak whatever you need it to remember. For example, “Remember I parked the car on level 2 bay P-3.” Later, ask Google Assistant, “OK Google, where did I park the car?” and it will spit out the answer. Android users will need the Google Allo app to use Assistant Google's Most Interesting: Apps, Projects, and Services You Must Know About Google's Most Interesting: Apps, Projects, and Services You Must Know About Google always has dozens of projects going at any given time and it can be hard to keep track of them all.

Wonder (Messenger, Google Home, Amazon Echo): The Anti-Google Antidote If you don’t want to offload more of your private information to Google, there’s another app that does what Assistant does. Wonder is a bot that works with Facebook Messenger, and smart voice controllers like Google Home and Amazon Echo Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We'll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Read More . Wonder calls itself a search engine for your personal life, but it’s not as invasive as it sounds. You need to actively command the things you want it to remember. You will again use the “Remember” command, whether typing it in Messenger or saying it out loud to Echo or Home. Wonder uses natural language processing, so you don’t have to be robotic about how you feed it information. But be warned, it doesn’t work as well as Google Assistant does. 3. Reminder Team (Web): When You Don’t Want to Sign In What do you do when you want to remember something for later, but don’t have one of your gadgets or a reminder app with you? Reminder Team is the easy no-signup website that you need 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use Do you like websites which have no sign-ups, no registerations, and no downloads? Then, you will like these hassle free web apps and sites which make daily productivity a lot easier. Read More . What you’ll do is write an email to yourself from Reminder Team. Key in your email address, the message, and when to send it. That’s right, you can schedule the email to be sent later. You can also make that email come to you every month, every quarter, or every year. It’s a ridiculously simple web app that you should bookmark for future use. In fact, make your life easier and remember “ReminderTeam.com” so that you don’t need to remember anything else. 4. WorldBrain (Chrome, Firefox): Full-Text Search of Your Browser It has happened to each of us. You were browsing something on the web a long time ago, and you need it now. But you don’t remember the website’s name or anything else about it. Don’t worry, WorldBrain will remember it for you. WorldBrain calls itself a “(Re)search-Engine” because it’s all about searching your own personal data. While you browse the web, WorldBrain will be quietly remembering everything you do. Don’t worry, all the data is stored locally, it never goes to the cloud (unless you specifically want it to). Plus, it stores all the text of every page, so you are actually searching the whole page, not just the title. When you need to look anything up, search WorldBrain through the omnibar of your Chrome or Firefox browser. And yes, it also works with Opera or other Chromium browsers How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it. There's one small problem: extensions. What if you could install Chrome extensions in Opera? It's easy, so here's a quick guide. Read More . Download — WorldBrain for Chrome | Firefox (Free) 5. Cozi and Process Street: Premade Checklists for Anything To-do lists keep you productive, but what happens when you forget to add things to to-do lists? Some tasks are so small and repetitive that you don’t add them, and then you don’t complete them. Instead of trying to remember every small piece of an item, use pre-made checklists and to-do lists. Two apps do this better than any others to help forgetful people remember things 12 Apps To Help Forgetful People Remember Things 12 Apps To Help Forgetful People Remember Things Organization can prove tricky for forgetful people. From recalling birthdays to putting faces to names, here are 12 awesome apps that can help you remember pretty much anything. Read More .

From grocery staples to vacation planning, there’s a checklist for almost anything that a household needs. Process Street (Web) is pretty new, but anyone who works in an office will love it. This app is meant more for companies, so the checklists are made accordingly. For example, there is a “Daily Store Opening Checklist” or a “Client Onboarding for a Marketing Agency” list. It covers most of the top industries, with detailed checklists for each. The free version gives you five checklists at a time, but you can pay to use unlimited checklists.

If not, then now is the time to prepare because it will have a huge impact on ASO. A few days ago, Apple unveiled the iOS 11. It is their upcoming iOS operating system update due this fall. It comes with new improvements such as the new cards layout, the removal of the top grossing chart in the main navigation, new ratings and reviews look, app preview updates, IAP purchases updates, and the metadata overhaul. In this post, we’ll just talk about the improvements that will impact ASO, so let us begin. iOS 11 Update – Changes in the App Name In iOS 11, the Title field will be reduced from 50 to 30 characters. And to make up for the loss Apple added the Subtitle field that can hold up to 30 characters. With this in mind, prepare a new title for your app, as well as the subtitle. Make sure to not spam it with keywords. Use relevant keywords and maximize the space allotted. I suggest that you target long tail keywords and use exact match. iOS 11 Update – Changes in App Preview Apple decided to give more focus on the app preview. They will show up before the screenshots, so while you still can, create an awesome app previews for all your apps. Apple decided to give more focus on the app preview. They will show up before the screenshots, so while you still can, create an awesome app previews for all your apps. iOS 11 Update – Changes in the In-app Purchases If your app does not have IAPs, now is the time to rethink. IAPs can boost your ASO rankings because this will appear in the search results and will be indexed by Apple. You can have up to 20 IAPs and both the name and the description are going to be indexed. IAPs Name can hold up to 30 characters, while the description can hold up to 45. Imagine how many keywords can you put in there! iOS 11 Update – Changes in the App Description The app description looks promising because Apple might index this field in their next update. Why did I say so? Apple said that we have to upload a new build whenever we make an update on the description. I don’t know, but it seems like a hint to me.  There will be a Promotional Text field as well, where you can add notes about your app’s latest news and promotions. This will not be indexed though. Final Thoughts So there you have it. That’s everything you need to know about the upcoming iOS 11 update – ASO wise! iOS 11 means a lot to the users, but it will be even more revolutionary for ASO providers looking to push their apps to the top of App Store rankings. So what are you waiting for? Gather your team and start preparing a new ASO strategy for your apps while you still have time!

REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Reuters) Reuters REUTERS Friday, June 9, 2017, 12:53 PM By Ross Kerber CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday warned graduates at MIT, a pioneer in fields like computers and robots, about technology's dehumanizing aspects and urged them to infuse its development with their own values. "I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence." Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge. "Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything," the Apple Inc chief executive said. "That part takes all of us." Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world's most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Cook has criticized President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president's expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.,” Cook said. His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely."

How safe is your Appl Watch in your hands? Is it safe from hackers? If it's stolen, how easily can a thief reset or steal the data from Apple Watch? Below are the 5 precautions you need to take on Apple Watch security. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Activation lock If your Apple Watch is stolen, the first thing to do is to take out your iPhone open the Apple Watch App -> choose "Apple Watch" from My Watch -> select Mark as a Missing option. This option will disable the Apple Pay options and activates the Activation Lock feature. This makes the Watch useless until the correct Apple ID and password are entered. Passcode Always make sure that you enable a passcode on your watch if you are not sure about it. It has different options ranging from a 4-digit password, more than 4-digit password and an option to unlock the watch from your iPhone. These options are available from the Apple Watch app on your iPhone in the "Passcode" menu. Erase Data after 10 failed attempts If you don't want anyone to see the data after it gets stolen, it is better to enable "Erase Data" option from the passcode menu. This will delete your watch's data when someone enter the wrong passcode more than 10 times.

Not only because cracks make it difficult to use your phone as a very expensive mirror, but also because Apple has made fixing those cracks a time-consuming nightmare that involves sitting in an Apple store for hours. Now, Reuters reports that butter-fingered iPhone users may be able to spend hours in a Best Buy instead.   Apple is finally letting other vendors fix their phones, giving authorized third-party repair stores access to their proprietary glass-fixing devices, called Horizon Machines. By the end of 2017, there will be 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, Apple executives told Reuters, including Best Buy. It's hard to say whether Apple has seen the error of its iPhone-fixing ways or if they are simply acting preemptively as more states sign on to so-called "right to repair" bills that are intended to help consumers fix their very expensive mirrors despite efforts by tech companies to monopolize the repair market.  [Photo: Flickr user mjayspanet]  ML Apple 06.09.17 | 4:14 pm A drone crash knocked out power to City Hall and 1,600 utility customers in Mountain View: police Police in Mountain View, California, say an errant drone crashed into a power line Thursday night, cutting power to City Hall and a public library, as well as 1,600 utility customers. Authorities say the crash caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage, with repairs finished early Friday morning. Officers say flying the drone in the area was "not permitted," citing FAA regulations. They're asking for help finding the suspected pilot, described as a white man with white hair driving a white hatchback. [Photo: via Mountain View Police Department] SM Drone Seize the day!

For the second time in a month, the network has cut ties with someone for publicly espousing anti-Trump views. June 9, 2017 ">First it was Kathy Griffin; now it's Reza Aslan's turn. CNN said today it will not move forward with a second season of Aslan's show Believer after he called Trump a "piece of shit" on Twitter. Aslan deleted the tweet and apologized, but conservative groups like Media Research Center have been demanding his head. Now they have it.

Yesterday, Comey testified before the Senate and divulged many bombshells about his interactions with the president. Trump is now denying these claims. Two very important things to note: One, Trump also said he'd release his tax returns and make Mexico pay for a giant wall, neither of which has happened yet. Two, the United States impeached a president 20 years ago because he lied under oath.  Who knows what the future holds?

The capability comes courtesy of Nuance, the speech recognition and virtual assistant provider that already integrates with several other messaging services, including Facebook Messenger, WeChat, and text messaging. Nuance's Nina platform powers customer service bots for about 6,500 companies and organizations, including many telecoms, banks, and airlines. "If you call a bank and can speak to a virtual assistant, that's almost certainly our technology," says Nuance EVP Robert Weideman. Nuance claims that Nina-powered bots can resolve 80% of customer requests, such as transferring money, or changing airline seats. The Apple deal comes just over a week after Nuance announced that Nina-powered bots will be available on Amazon Alexa smart speakers and eventually on Google Home. Could Siri and Apple HomePod be next?

At the same time, Pandora is selling TicketFly, the ticket-selling service it acquired in 2015, to Eventbrite for $200 million. So much for the idea of Pandora getting into the ticketing business and rewiring the way concerts get booked and sold. For now, it seems like the streaming pioneer's biggest priority is sorting out its core business and trying to become a legit player in the on-demand subscription market dominated by Spotify.  JPT pandora 06.09.17 | 12:39 pm J.K. Rowling just said what every woman online thinks in an epic 14-tweet rant There is one thing that unites women of any age, background, or political allegiance who are in the public eye: being the recipient of online vitriol from men. It's so bad that every 10 seconds, someone on Twitter calls a woman a "slut" or "whore."   Today, beloved Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling addressed a frustrating element of that trend: When men who identify as liberal (and maybe even feminist) use those same degrading slurs against conservative women.  Her 14-tweet rant laid out how the words men use to insult women speak betray their real values even if they profess to be liberal. "I don't care whether we're talking about Theresa May or Nicola Sturgeon or Kate Hooey or Yvette Cooper or Hillary Clinton: femaleness is not a design flaw. If your immediate response to a woman who displeases you is to call her a synonym for her vulva, or compare her to a prostitute, then drop the pretense and own it: you're not a liberal." Just unfollowed a man whom I thought was smart and funny, because he called Theresa May a whore. 1/14— J.K.

He spoke about his career trajectory and how working at Apple—and meeting Steve Jobs—helped the technology guru find his life's purpose. While the speech revolved around finding one's purpose in a profession, Cook also warned about technology's potential ills. "Technology alone isn't the solution," he said, "sometimes it's even part of the problem." He named some specific culprits including fake news and "social media that becomes antisocial." Cook concluded this line of thought by imploring the graduates to imbue future technology with humanity and empathy. "I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," he said. "I'm worried about people thinking like computers without values or compassion."

Shares of the social media, er, camera company fell to near-record lows of $18.09 this morning after some press outlets picked up on reports that downloads of the Snapchat app are in decline. According to Fortune—which cited an investor note from Nomura's Instinet—app downloads have dropped by 22% in the last two months. Even more startling, Snapchat downloads on Apple's iOS tumbled more than 40% in the first two months of the second quarter. Stagnate user growth has been a chief concern for Snap investors since its IPO earlier this year, and with Facebook and Instagram cloning Snapchat features like there's no tomorrow, it's hard to see how things improve.  [Photo: Flickr user Anthony Quintano] CZ Snap Inc 06.09.17 | 9:15 am Facebook posts mocking the Thai royal family lead to a 35-year prison sentence A social media user in Thailand was given 35-year prison sentence over Facebook posts that mocked the country's royal family. The 33-year-old man allegedly posted a series of photos, comments, and videos using a fake account that impersonated another person he was in a fight with, according to TechCrunch, which cited a report from the local reform group iLaw. The group identified the man simply as Whichai.  Thailand has strict lèse majesté laws that make it illegal to mock the royal family, and the military-run government has been cracking down, going so far as to threaten to jail Facebook users who like, share, or even look at offending posts on social media, the Bangkok Post reported last month. Whichai's 35-year sentence is the most severe yet, BP reports. Initially, he was sentenced to 70 years but the court cut that in half after he confessed.  [Photo: hanibaram/iStock] CGW Facebook 06.09.17 | 9:00 am Uber is interviewing engineers from Luxe valet service  Despite the damning headlines and all the controversy over sexist workplace issues, Uber is continuing business as usual. That includes considering an acquisition of some of Luxe Valet's engineers and technology. The company is currently in talks with Luxe about a solution that involves short-term car rentals, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Founders Curtis Lee and Craig Martin will apparently retain the Luxe name and some of its technology with plans to relaunch. RR Uber 06.09.17 | 7:37 am This leaked memo sent by Uber’s Travis Kalanick set guidelines on having sex with employees The "Miami letter," which was obtained by Recode, laid out ground rules on sexual activity for about 400 Uber staff members who were attending a company event in Miami in 2013. The memo, a reflection of the ride-hailing giant's frat-house culture, was reportedly notorious at Uber and included such lines as "You better read this or I'll kick your ass." Among the guidelines was: "Do not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic "YES! I will have sex with you" AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command." Other cringeworthy lines from the memo: • "Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML [Fuck My Life]." • "There will be a $200 puke charge for any public displays on the Shore Club premises."  • "Do not throw large kegs off of tall buildings."  MB travis kalanick Advertise Privacy Policy Terms About Us Site Map Fast Company & Inc © Mansueto Ventures, LLC

Planet of the Apps is a marketing tool, not compelling television. By Emily Bary June 9, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay Apple has been late to the game with original content. If its initial effort means anything, the company remains lackadaisical about creating quality TV. Apple premiered its first show -- Planet of the Apps -- on Tuesday. The 10-episode run is available only to Apple Music subscribers, a rather small base of customers. The new show is unlikely to compel additional sign-ups. (The pilot episode is available free for a “limited time.”) More from Barron’s Next You Won’t Have to Wait for That iPhone 8 iPhone Users Have Seen the Galaxy and They’re Not Impressed How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Planet of the Apps follows iOS app developers as they try to earn the support of celebrity panelists and ultimately win venture-capital funding for their apps. Hopeful developers make a 60-second “escalator pitch” for their products as they descend down a moving walkway to reach judges Jessica Alba, will.i.am, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Gary Vaynerchuk. Following the pitch, the star panel votes on whether it wants to hear more about the app. As long as there’s one “yes” vote, the judges begin peppering the developer with questions about business models, user counts, and competitive advantages. I’m fascinated by new technology and Apple products, and still I was bored while watching this show. Maybe it’s entertaining to watch celebrities critique bad singers on The Voice, but the concept doesn’t extend to apps, as just about anyone but the Apple programming team could have predicted. It might be fun to watch people take risks on stage, but it’s hard to get emotionally invested in software. The show’s presentation doesn’t do much to help. Definitions of tech words get flashed on screen throughout the pitches, which makes the whole thing feel like a college lecture. In the first episode, terms related to “augmented reality” popped up on multiple occasions. The AR primer felt like a promotional gimmick to get people more excited about the technology. AR, of course, is one of the big new iOS features Apple talked about in its keynote address this week. Apple seems more interested in scoring marketing points for iOS than creating original television, and that’s not going to fly in a TV market that’s already saturated with great content. From a business perspective, Apple’s aim is also unclear. Is it to grow Apple Music’s base to better compete with Spotify? Is it to create a credible streaming alternative to Netflix, Amazon.com, or Hulu? (Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The company has another original coming in August, when it rolls out a series based on the Carpool Karaoke segments made popular by James Corden.

(We love, for example, their Apple Watch.) These days, every iteration of the iPhone becomes a must-have item before it hits the store, creating a fervor for the products that is unmatched in the tech world. (Judging by the hype, the iPhone 8 will be no exception.) However, the latest Apple object of everyone's desire isn't particularly sleek and futuristic. In fact, it's a chunky, retro edition that is positively dated by today's standards of design. We're auctioning off a vintage, rare pair of #Apple sneakers, made only for employees in the 1990s: https://t.co/OXgFMLPMJe via @SneakerNews pic.twitter.com/8TTVtd9AAn — Heritage M&C Art (@heritagemandc) June 3, 2017 Advertisement Advertisement Daily Dose Keep this field blank Enter your email address You may unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy | About Us We're referring to this pair of Apple Sneakers, which is being auctioned off for $15,000 by Heritage M&C Art. They're big, all-white low-tops with what looks like solid heel cushioning and a puffiness typical of many '90s sneakers. And it's their vintage appeal and novelty that is surely what's driving that price tag up. For reference, the latest pair of Yeezy Powerphase Calabasas sneakers, which bear some resemblance to these kicks, retailed for $120. Perhaps Apple's original rainbow logo just has that much more cachet than Adidas' three stripes. Stunningly, the Verge points out that Heritage actually believes the shoes to be worth double their starting price. Yes, $30,000. These shoes are like a fine wine. Of course, if these sneakers are out of your price range, you aren't the only one. Here's one pair of cheaper alternatives that will be able to serve as your shoe for the summer. Or, you can try one of these five pairs of nice warm weather kicks instead. Tags: sneakersnewstech Privacy Policy  |  About Us Copyright © 2017 Rodale Inc.

Apple made a change that could save 50% of your iPhone's camera storage Alex Heath Business Insider June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share iPhone 6 Gold cameraMore (George Frey/Stringer/Getty Images) What if you could save half of your iPhone's camera storage without doing anything differently? That's what Apple is promising with iOS 11, the next major software update for iPhone and iPad coming this fall. Thanks to a technical change, Apple is promising that photos and videos you shoot will require 50% of the storage they do now. That's because Apple is switching from the h.264 video compression and JPEG photo formats to HEVC and HEIF. We were first alerted to the change by 9to5Mac, which tested iOS 11's developer beta and found that the new formats cut the file size of photos nearly in half while maintaining image quality. That's good news for iPhone and iPad owners who are concerned with saving storage. It also paves the way for Apple to bring higher-quality 4K video, which uses HEVC as well, to the Apple TV. The only catch is that these new photo and video formats will only work on Apple devices running the A9 processor or newer. That means you won't get this storage-saving change if your device is older than the iPhone 6s or 2017 iPad.

A Beijing court said the case has been brought by a production center that alleges that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast a film that depicts Chinese fighting against Japanese soldiers in northern China in the early 1930s. The plaintiff also sued the developer and operator of the Youku HD app available on Apple’s App Store that it said enabled users to watch the film and caused it “huge economic losses,” according to the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court. The court said it has accepted the case brought by Movie Satellite Channel Program Production Center that comes under the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. The plaintiff alleged that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast “Xuebo dixiao,” which loosely translates as “Bloody Fight with the Fierce Enemy” and was first shown in 1994. The production center is also suing Heyi Information and Technology (Beijing) Company Ltd., which developed and operated the Youku HD app, the court said in an online statement Thursday. The app is sold by Youku.com, according to information on Apple’s iTunes site. The Youku site is one of China’s best known movie and TV program streaming sites and is owned by Youku Tudou Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The plaintiff wants the two companies to immediately stop broadcasting the film and is seeking compensation of 50,000 yuan ($7,500) plus its “reasonable expenditure” of 20,158 yuan ($3,000) in attempting to stop the infringement of its rights, the court said. Emailed requests for comment to Apple spokespeople were not answeredSaturday, and a spokesman for Youku Tudou was not able to immediately comment. Apple Inc. has recently faced legal setbacks and other obstacles in China, its second-biggest global market. In April, it suspended its iBooks and iTunes Movies services, reportedly due to an order by Chinese regulators. In May, a Beijing intellectual property tribunal in Beijing ordered Apple to stop selling its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city after finding they look too much like a model made by a small Chinese brand. Sales of the phones are continuing while Apple appeals. Also that month, Apple suffered another setback when a court ruled that a Chinese company is allowed to use the iPhone trademark on bags, wallets and other leather goods.

Analysts and pundits were off the mark with that prediction, as instead Apple chose to release the i Phone 5C as a replacement for the i Phone 5, which in the past the company would have continued to sell at a $99 price point on contract.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (21) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter. Accuracy and consistency wherever you type.

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:49 I think you're spot on. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:48 Yes, it is in the 27-inch model. But RAM in the 21.5-inch model is not user-upgradeable (although it's not soldered to the motherboard either). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Henrik Munster  2017-06-09 10:46 There is "not user upgradeable" and then there is "not user upgradeable". I have myself opened a few MacBooks and even PowerBooks, but opening an iMac seems to me to be quite frightening. My suggestion would be to at least take a look at the instructions at iFixit before attempting to do anything. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 22:00 Always do. When I am going to crack open any Mac (or any other Apple product or even some non-Apple products these days although they tend to cover every Apple product but not so much for non-Apple products), iFixit is the first stop when I even start to think about it. It was their guides that helped me replace the fan on the 2006 MBP and upgrade the WiFi card for that same Mac. iFixit is an excellent source for determining what kind of trouble I might get into. ;-) Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered). Reply Scott Randell  2017-06-09 15:13 Hey Adam, the hardware part of the announcements were of little interest to me. Mostly because of the price points. The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it. The price points on the regular iMac are ridiculous. The 27 inch with 512 GB SSD is a much better value than the 21 inch with the same add ons. Especially when you consider you can install extra 8 GB of ram yourself for about $60.00 vs the $200.00 Apple charges. With the same add ons the 27 inch is only $260.00 more than the 21 inch. Unless space is a consideration the 27 inch is a much better value, and you can add more ram down the road. I personally hope they come out with a reasonably priced user upgradable tower you can buy as much or as little as you need. Regards to all Tidbits staff. Reply David   2017-06-09 15:45 "The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it" Er...yes? I don't think it's particularly aimed at the average user.

Shares of Apple fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, while the other four companies fell more than 3 percent. For most of the day, only 3 stocks in the S&P 500 tech sector were in the green: IBM (IBM), Teradata (TDC) and Western Union (WU). Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet all traded more than 2 times their 30-day average volume. It's a rare down day for a sector that's soared this year. The technology select sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is still up nearly 16 percent so far this year, while the information technology sector is the leading gainer in the S&P 500, up more than 18.5 percent. "They're just plain overbought," said David Bahnsen founder, managing director and chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, a private wealth management firm. "They are extremely stretched from a valuation standpoint." The high-flying sector has made investors jittery with "valuation anxiety," The New York Times noted this week. Goldman analysts wrote that the tech sector momentum "has built a valuation air pocket." "There is a sense that a lot of investors think there's safety there " Bahnsen told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Friday. "A lot of managers are afraid to not own these names, and I can understand that." Still, the Dow Jones industrial index closed at a record high, and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) on track for its best week of the year. "You just have to wait until these big — I don't know if it's ETF-driven or index-driven — selloffs create some buying opportunities," Tim Lesko, principal and portfolio Management at Granite Investment Advisors, told "Closing Bell" on Friday. — Reporting by CNBC's Patti Domm, Chris Hayes, FredImbert and Robert Hum.

But today one report is focusing on a feature that the next iPhone might lack. Apple’s next iPhones won’t include support for gigabit LTE speeds, claims sources speaking to Bloomberg. That’s because while Qualcomm currently offers a modem with support for 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Intel doesn’t yet have such a modem available. Apple has been using both modems in its devices, and the company reportedly doesn’t want to rely on a single supplier for parts in its flagship device. Apple and Qualcomm are currently in the middle of a legal battle, with the former company claiming that the latter one has been abusing its position as a manufacturer of important cellphone chips to ask for unreasonable patent licensing terms. So Apple will likely end up using modems from both Qualcomm and Intel in its next iPhones. And while those Qualcomm modems may be capable of 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Apple probably doesn’t want to end up offering one version of iPhone that can achieve gigabit LTE speeds and another version that can’t. All four major US carriers are working toward offering gigabit LTE speeds, with some claiming that we could see this service launch in 2017. We’ll have to wait and see if that pans out for the carriers and if Apple does end up shipping its new iPhones without gigabit LTE support, but even if those things happen, the lack of gigabit LTE may not be a huge deal for Apple’s new iPhones. LTE is still plenty fast for a lot of folks, and it’s unclear how widespread the carriers’ gigabit LTE coverage will be initially.

Allegedly sold to a lucky Apple employee, these unique sneakers have rarely been seen, or even photographed since they were made in the early 90s. The white sneaker has since resurfaced, being recently spotted in an online auction with a starting bid of $15,000. The nostalgic pair of sneakers are made from the white leather material that was popularized in the early 90s, and features the company's original rainbow logo printed on the tongue, and the side. The soles of the shoes are made from rubber that allegedly don't leave skid marks. These vintage branded apple sneakers are estimated to sell at over $30,000, appealing to lovers of nostalgic vintage clothing, and rare collectors items.

And, the owner has his own prediction that if the Warriors do win it all, people will celebrate in the streets without causing any major damage. (KGO-TV) KGO By Eric Thomas Friday, June 09, 2017 07:18PM OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- The NBA Finals mean serious business for some Bay Area police officers. Customers at Oakland's Big Apple Café are predicting a sweep. And, the owner has his own prediction that if the Warriors do win it all, people will celebrate in the streets without causing any major damage. "Enjoy the win. That's' the best thing, not to harm other people," shop owner Khalil Hamadeh said. Khalil had windows broken during political protests at an old location, but never at this new location, and never related to the Warriors. That's why he has no plans to board the place up Friday night. The city hopes to keep it that way. Mayor Libby Schaaf says if there is a sweep, Oakland will be ready. "We're excited. We're positive. We're prepared. But, we are very confident that things will go very beautifully tonight," Schaaf said. Oakland police called in every available officer and briefed them Friday afternoon on what to expect. "You will see a lot of officers throughout the city of Oakland; not only Oakland police, but we have BART, Alameda County Sheriffs and the CHP," Oakland Police Officer Johnna Watson said. When the warriors last won the title in 2015, fans poured into the streets - some jumping on cars, others setting off fireworks. Both of those activities are illegal, and police say they won't be tolerated. "We want to make sure everybody has a safe place and a safe celebration," Watson said.

The next iPhone won't be the absolute fastest phone for downloading files or streaming music, because it will likely lack a gigabit LTE modem, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Apple sources its modems from two different suppliers, Qualcomm and Intel, and while Qualcomm's latest modems can take advantage of gigabit-per-second download speeds that some mobile carriers are now offering, Intel's gigabit modem isn't quite ready yet. Rather than use Qualcomm's modem exclusively for its next iPhone, Apple will continue to use Intel's modems in some models even though they are slower, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with Apple's decision. The decision is not entirely unexpected, since Apple has varied its modem suppliers for many previous iPhone models. But it is particularly noteworthy now because of two recent developments: Apple is locked in a legal battle with Qualcomm, which it accuses of monopolistic and illegal business practices, and one of the iPhone's chief competitors, the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a modem that already supports the gigabit speeds that several carriers are now advertising. Related Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to a request for comment, and Qualcomm declined to comment. For its part, Apple portrays its smartphones as better than Samsung's, and judging by the queues of eager customers outside Apple stores following a new iPhone announcement, the market for high-end handsets doesn't seem to care much about the device's innards. Those who do care might be able to divine the type of modem in their handset based on which mobile carrier they use. The Intel 7480 modem, one candidate to show up in the next iPhone, doesn't support Sprint or Verizon's CDMA technology, so it's likely that it will power the GSM iPhones for AT&T and T-Mobile, while Qualcomm modems will power the CDMA version. The modem kerfuffle could all be sorted out next year, when Intel's new 7560 gigabit modem is ready. The 7560 supports both GSM and CDMA, which puts it in the running to take over from Qualcomm as the iPhone's only modem.

Will QR code reading save Apple sales in China? June 9th, 2017 | Add a Comment 0000000 The iPhone maker is finally working its way into the barcode scanning culture to appeal to Chinese shoppers. QR code reading is a regular part of daily life in mainland China, but Apple hasn’t taken part in this trend. Now, the company has become one of the last to look to quick response codes to try to appeal to the over 700 million mobile device users in the country. The barcodes haven’t seen nearly as much use in the western world as they have in China, where they are regularly used. Apple has been watching its share slowly taken by rivals in the country. As a result, it has been working hard to develop a strategy to appeal to Chinese consumers. Among the points in that strategy is a focus on QR code reading; something that has never seen much – if any – time in the Apple spotlight. That said, Apple is now rather late in the QR code game. Its rivals have all had the chance to develop their technology and their positions within the market. The success of the Apple QR feature within the country will greatly depend on the number of app developers interested in collaborating with the company. Moreover, even among those that do take part, it will depend on how broadly they wish to do so. The new QR code reading feature was the central option directed toward the Chinese market this week. Apple’s iOS 11 operating system preview at its Worldwide Developers Conference centered around the QR codes and the ability for users to scan them with iPhone cameras. That feature will launch officially along with the iOS 11, this fall. The idea is to make barcode scanning faster and more convenient for iPhone users. They will be able to scan the quick response codes without having to launch a dedicated app as is currently the case. The new iOS 11 also includes a handful of other “localized” features geared toward the Chinese consumer. For example, a phone number can be used as an Apple ID, there will be an SMS fraud extension (to spot possibly fraudulent texts), and it will support Shanghainese dictation. “It is a wise move for Apple to embrace QR code as a way to better localize [its features] in China, given the decline of its iPhone shipments in the country,” said IDC China research manager Jin Di in a statement regarding the QR code reading and other localized options in iOS 11.

Apple rumors: What's coming next! By Serenity Caldwell, Rene Ritchie Friday, Jun 9, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT If you like to spoil yourself over Apple's upcoming product and software lines, you've come to the right place. Updated June 6 2017: The WWDC 2017 keynote has come and gone and that means there are far fewer rumors left on our list — for now. Rumors about Apple's various iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and software ventures abound: Whether it's a leak from the supply chain or a hint from a case manufacturer about upcoming design changes, you can't go a day without running into a new bit of information. If you love to know the very latest from the Apple rumors space, you've come to the right place. If you don't, well, here be dragons: We'd advise clicking away. Phones, Watches, and Apple TV | Macs | Accessories | Software and Services RELIABLE There are enough reliable sources and historical data that we feel confident in this product's projected launch date. UNRELIABLE There are conflicting data sources or not enough data to confirm this product's projected launch date. NO DATA There is not enough data to offer a projected launch date. Phones, Watches, and Apple TV iPhone 8 September 2017 iPhone 7s — iPhone 8 — iPhone X — whatever Apple ends up calling the next and "tenth anniversary" iPhone, it's expected next fall, and with a new design and new set of features. But what will they be? iPhone 8 rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple Watch series 3 October 2017 It's been just about seven months since the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and as is my wont, I'm already thinking about the next version. What will it look like? What new features will it have that pique my fancy? Don't get me wrong: I love my current Apple Watch. The Series 2 offered huge battery improvements for both 38mm and 42mm users, and I use it to track my workouts and respond to notifications almost every day. But if I had my druthers, I wouldn't mind seeing an Apple Watch series 3 in the fall with a few new features. Apple Watch Series 3 rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple TV 5 2018 The current Apple TV tops out at 1080p. It's a rock-solid 60 frames-per-second (fps) 1080p, but it's still 1080p. Likewise, it only supports the sRGB color standard. Wouldn't it be great, though, if the next-generation Apple TV 5 could do more — if it could handle 4K and DCI-P3? Apple TV 5 rumors — Everything you need to know! Laptop and Desktop Macs Mac Pro 2018-2019 Apple broke with decades of tradition to spoil its upcoming product line to the world. And not just any product line: The company gave a sneak peek of its plans for the future of Mac Pro. I'm going to repeat that: A new Mac Pro. And new pro displays, branded by Apple. What can we expect, and when can we expect it? Let's break it down. Mac Pro rumors — Everything you need to know! iMac Pro December 2017 Apple took the wraps off of the iMac Pro, an all-in-one aimed at high-end professional tasks. While Apple didn't offer an exact release date, they did say that the iMac Pro would ship in December. iMac 2018 Apple just updated its all-in-one desktop lineup with Kaby Lake processors, more memory options, and better graphics, so it's likely we won't see an update for the iMacs until next year. MacBook Pro 2018 Apple just updated its laptop lineup with Kaby Lake processors and better graphics, so it's likely we won't see an update for the MacBook Pros until next year Mac Mini Unknown The Mac mini hasn't been updated since October 2014, when it was made even more appliance-like than previous generations. Since then Apple's bring-your-own-mouse-keyboard-and-monitor Mac has been missing in action. Here's what we know. Mac Mini rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple Accessories Apple Pencil 2 Summer-Fall 2017 We've heard enough about iPad rumors — let's talk about my favorite accessory: The Apple Pencil. There are claims that new Apple Pencil components are in Apple's Chinese supply chain — possibly for a later 2017 release alongside rumored iPad Pros. Spoilers!!! Except, no: I don't feel all that spoiled. Because of course Apple is going to refine the Pencil for 2017 alongside new iPad Pro models. Apple Pencil 2 rumors — Everything you need to know!

Updated June, 2017: All the choices on this list are still top-notch. If you have any better suggestions, though, hit us up in the comments below! As we say goodbye to the SD card reader, Thunderbolt, and so much more with the Late 2016 MacBook Pro, we also say hello: to many, many USB-C ports. USB-C connectors are great tools in that they can connect multiple types of devices to your MacBook, and when you're done, you can simply detach the port and go on your merry way. But if you're using your MacBook Pro at home, you may want to avoid the constant fun of disconnecting and reconnecting a million devices; instead, connect just one USB-C device to your Mac — a hub — that then controls everything else. There are several great USB-C hub options depending on your lifestyle: Below, we highlight our favorites! Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub AUKEY USB-C Hub Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB Highly rated (with 5 stars on Amazon), fast, and compact, the Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB is a reliable option for those looking to pick out a USB-C hub for their MacBook Pro. Anker did it again. Another great quality product from these guys that I just love. They have great product, but mostly great customer service if anything happens. I have bought tons from them either on Amazon.ca or .com over the years and have proven to be of the highest standards. Designed to transfer data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps – which is fast enough to transfer an entire HD movie in just a few seconds – the Anker USB-C hub provides three additional USB ports along with an ethernet adapter, making it the perfect partner to pair with your MacBook Pro. If something goes wrong with your Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB, then never fear: This little piece of tech comes with an 18-month warranty and highly-praised customer service. See at Amazon HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub Instantly turn your single USB-C port into an SDXC port or micro SDXC port, and double the USB space with the HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub. Sleek and slim, this little hub instantly attaches to your MacBook Pro, while it's brushed metal finish matches it perfectly. It's even the same thickness as the new MacBook Pro, so nothing sticks out or feels overly bulky and protrude-y. The HyperDrive comes in three different colors that match Apple's shades spot-on, including silver, gold, and space gray. See at Amazon AUKEY USB-C Hub If you're looking for some more USB space, AUKEY's USB-C Hub has got you covered. At around the size of a credit card, this pocket-perfect USB-C hub has over-current protection to protect connected devices from power surges, while the hub also supports incredibly fast data transfer rates. Plus with four ports, you have more than enough room for everything you need! See at Amazon Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub With its modern, Apple-riffic design, instant connectivity, and pass-through charging support, the Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub is a great option to consider for your MacBook Pro. Just attach your Satechi straight to your MacBook without any wires, and you'll instantly be able to use your SD and micro SD cards, have full access to two USB ports, and more. You can even easily charge your MacBook Pro, too! The Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub comes in four different colors to really match your sense of style, including space gray, silver, rose gold, and gold. See at Amazon Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter With the Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter, you'll always have a USB-C hub at the ready. Coupled with its compact design and LED charging indicator, the Moshi is a solid multiport adapter option to keep in mind. Designed with a sleek aluminum look to match your other Apple products, this fast-charging, data transferring hub works well with the MacBook Pro. With its folding cable, you can easily unplug and tuck away your Moshi, and when it's plugged in, you can use it without having it take up a ton of space. Utilizing the latest USB-C chips, this multi-function adapter supports crystal clear 1080p and 4K video output to any HDMI-enabled monitor or TV. A standard USB port is included to charge/sync your smartphone or connect other legacy devices such as an external USB hard drive or hub. See at Moshi HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub CNET: This accessory fixes everything that's wrong with Apple's new MacBook Pro. ExtremeTech: This multi-port accessory adds back everything Apple removed from the latest MacBook Pro. BGR: One MacBook Pro 2016 accessory that will save you from dongle hell. If you're looking for a USB-C hub that's been widely praised, has been supported by over 20,000 people, and that aims to 'fit the MacBook Pro aesthetics pretty well', then you're going to want to take a peek at the HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub. The HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub claims to be the world's most compact and faster USB-C hub that's designed specially for the 2016 MacBook Pro. With the HyperDrive: Thunderbolt, you get a HDMI video output, a thunderbolt 3 outlet, USB-C, a slot for your SD card and microSD, and two USB 3.1 gen 1 ports. Measuring out at around 114.5mm long and 28.5mm wide, HyperDrive is the perfect accessory to bring from home to the office to a friend's place, travelling, and so, so much more! Oh, and did we mention that there's a version for your silver or your space gray MacBook Pro?! The HyperDrive hub isn't available on Hyper's site yet, but you can still check out its Kickstarter page and watch Hypershop.com for availability. See at KickStarter So… What's your pick? Is there a USB-C hub that you can't get enough of? Something that you're crazy about that we didn't feature on our lovely lil' list?

The OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock and the similar Thunderbolt 3 Belkin unit. All of these, except the last one from Kickstarter, are simply USB.

It has gigabit Ethernet, USB 3, USB 2, USB-C, HDMI, VGA, SD card reader, two jacks for microphone and headphone, and even a 90 W charger is included. Not cheap but it gives me all the connectors I missed with new MacBook Pro 2016. Sent from the iMore App 0 3 months ago Reply Ginseng108 I posted but the post was deleted for some reason. In any case, do a search for HyperDrive Thunderbolt Hub Kickstarter and you'll find what you're looking for. 0 4 months ago Reply rickstr I thought there's one that looks like the Satechi but with two USB C's going into the pro. Has anyone seen this? Link? 0 4 months ago Reply Ginseng108 Note: I preordered on the CalDigit company's US Storefront. The special pricing is not available on their Amazon storefront as far as I could tell. 0 4 months ago Reply Ginseng108 I've been looking for a Thunderbolt 3 hub for my late-2016 MBP 13 TB and have identified the following candidates as of the end of January 2017. The critical features I need are DisplayPort, gigabit ethernet, laptop charging, 2xUSB 3, 2xTB3. Nice to have are headphone output, USB 3.1, SD card reader. 1. Elgato TB3 Dock - https://www.elgato.com/en/dock/thunderbolt-3, has all the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack. Expensive at an anticipated $300. Flat format case. 2. Belkin TB3 Express Dock - http://www.imore.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbelkin.7eer.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F... has all of the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack. Insanely expensive at an anticipated $430. Flat format case. 3. OWC TB3 Dock - http://www.imore.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-... has all of the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack and SD card reader as well as USB 3.1 gen 1. It also has superfluous features: S/PDIF and Firewire 800 jacks. It is priced at $279 preorder or $299 normally. Flat format case. 4. CalDigit TB3 Thunderbolt Station 3 - http://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-3-dock/, has all of the critical features and additionally audio in/out, USB 3.1 gen (?), and superfluous feature: 2xeSATA ports. It is priced at $200 preorder or $250 normally. Vertical format case. The CalDigit TS3 is likely the unit I'll go with. It has the best balance of critical and nice to have features with the fewest superfluous (I don't need or use them) features. The price is among the most reasonable. Also, the unique vertical format case takes up less real estate on my already cluttered desktop so that's an extra plus. 0 4 months ago Reply EBFoxbat **CAUTION** Not all of these will work with the 15" Touch Bar. OWC notes in their website that theirs doesn't, but it's far more widespread. There's something with the chipset thats commonly used that just doesn't work. I spent an inordinate amount of time and money finding a USB hub that offered atlas 87watts of power pass thought (USB PD as it's known). I ended up using the Apple display adapter, and a regular USB-A hub. I use a USB-C male to female extensions cable. Only the extension cable is visible above my desk. This allows me to have my "one cable to rule them all" solution. I'm super exited for Thunderbolt 3 docks, but it seams OWC is the only one with an SD slot on the front, so I preordered with them. 0 4 months ago Reply eziduzit I'm not sure how you can include so many poorly rated items in this "Great" list. Starting with the Satechi Type-C USB... do your homework people! And like others, I would like to see options that are actual quality but don't cost $200+. 0 6 months ago Reply Matty Wack We need USB-C Gen 2 Splitter that functions as a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 + Charge adapter for the new Macbooks Pro. Similar to the Lightning + Charge Rockstar adapter by belkin for the iPhone 7. I would use this with the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunder Bolt 2 adapter to charge and connect to my Thunderbolt Display simultaneously. 0 6 months ago Reply jayzero76 waiting for a docking station with charger and everything. maybe apple should make one. sd card reader USB and HDMI... easy to connect and than everyone has nothing to complain anymore. 0 7 months ago Reply Hennes4800 There is one by belkin. But it has DisplayPort and no HDMI. 0 2 months ago Reply Henrywayne118 So… What's your pick? My pick is my Early 2015 MBP with 2 Thunderbolt ports, a dedicated MagSafe 2 port, 2 3.0 USB port, HDMI port, and SD card port. I got mine maxed out and now the "update" is a touch bar and a .3 GHz increase is max CPU. Psssssh, I am not cult of Mac, but even if I was I can't imagine how someone can justify buying this thing. 0 7 months ago Reply DannyJJK You came here just to be incredibly negative about the new MacBook Pro rather than get people's opinions. There's plenty more upgrades than what you're listing, also I like how you listed all the different ports in the old MacBook Pro as if that's a good thing. I'd rather have one type of port which is cable of doing all these tasks, USB-C is the future, adapters are only temporary for now 0 6 months ago Reply Ginseng108 Well, here's how I justified buying a 2016 MBP 13" TB, 16 GB ram, Core i7: My faithful 2008 CoreDuo 13" MacBook has served me well for nearly 9 years and I decided to splurge and treat myself to a laptop of similar format with 3X the processing power and incredible (though currently through dongles and a dock on the way) connectivity. Maybe that makes me "cult of mac" ;) 0 4 months ago Reply directordeek How about a list of upcoming USB C Gen 2 devices/hubs/docks? My Macbook pro probably won't ship till December so I have some time to wait and see what is coming out. 0 7 months ago Reply dreyfus2 I am fine with a device called the HooToo Shuttle. It is not gen. 2, but I do not have any USB peripherals delivering north of 5 Gbps. It does have a short cable, but at least it does not block other ports this way. 0 7 months ago Reply ppennza I ordered the owc hub. I know they are coming out with the thunderbolt hub in the new year but i really just need it for mic, and my mouse and keyboard. I think for the price difference the usb c hub is a much better value. I have been using it with my hp for irk and it performs just fine. 0 7 months ago Reply adsvfv *ugh* This is the 8th article I've seen with the same underperforming USB-C hubs now. All I want is power, 1x DisplayPort, 1x USB3, 1x gigabit ethernet, 1x audio in and 1x audio out. And preferable one that doesn't cost $200. FireWire 800, SD card, thunderbolt port and more USB ports would be nice to have but don't really matter for my setup. 0 7 months ago Reply nutmac Does anyone know whether Satachi or HyperDrive will block nearby USB-C port? 0 7 months ago Reply jimmers There are 2 ports on each side of the MacBook Pro for a total of 4. According to pictures, the Satechi and the HyperDrive will use one and cover the other but you'll still have the 2 ports on the other side of the MacBook Pro. 0 7 months ago Reply returnmyjedi "At around the size of a credit card..." That's the thickest credit card I've ever seen. Posted via the iMore App 0 7 months ago Reply jimmers LOL......I thought the same thing! 0 7 months ago Reply DannyJJK Heh, I guess they meant width/height and not thickness, funny though 0 6 months ago Reply anon(6453003) Ugh! Guys, c'mon! The Satachi and HyperDrive are practically the same device! And while these USB-C hubs are perfectly fine for the MacBook and the newer MacBook Pro, let's not forget that the Pro uses ThunderBolt 3 and that docks like the new one from OWC (https://eshop.macsales.com/preorder/owc-thunderbolt-3-dock/ ) are much more capable for the new MacBook Pro than the OWC USB-C dock you listed. Also, make sure that any USB-C hub is rated for USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) versus USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps). The Pro can handle the higher speed while the MacBook cannot. 2 7 months ago Reply jayzero76 thunderbolt 3 vs usb C whats the difference 1 7 months ago Reply steviet02 it's not USBC vs Thunderbolt 3. It's thunderbolt 2 vs thunderbolt 3. 0 6 months ago Reply ewelch Thunderbolt 3 has vastly more speed than USB-C, and it supports USB 3 gen 2, HDMI, and DisplayPort, all over the same cable. USB-C is far from as capable. Though it and of itself, it's fine. 0 2 days ago Reply Yourtaer Indeed. And why not mention Hyper's 7in1 (it's the better version of the 5in1 and it has no lookalikes, let alone 'specslikes'). What I find strange too: a hub and a dock are two totally different things. Dock sits on my desk with screen, DAS, keyboard, speakers,... attached. Hub sits in my pocket or backpack for attaching external HD, CF card reader,... on location. 0 1 month ago Reply rodaleach I picked this one up from Anker. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XU6PM68/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s... 1 7 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Apple's Pencil stands out from the rest of the iPad stylus crowd for a number of reasons: It works in tandem with Apple's display to create low-latency brush strokes, it's lengthier than your average digital pen, and it charges via Lightning connector. But when it comes to drawing or writing with one, there are only a few basic techniques you need to know before you can start mastering your new tool. Learn how to draw from the masters If you love the idea of an Apple Pencil but your drawing skills are lackluster, my best advice is going to be the advice of many artists before me: Practice! Drawing constantly is the best way to get better. If you're just starting out, I recommend looking at some of your favorite artists, studying their styles, and trying to recreate them on your choice of digital canvas. It's a fun exercise, and should get you thinking about shapes and styles. That might be too complex for you — and that's fine! If you truly want a 101 course, there are a couple of wonderful free drawing sites out there that offer great tutorials and videos. Drawspace boasts the slogan "now everyone can draw," and if its excellent step-by-step drawing lessons are anything to go by, that statement is the absolute truth. Proko offers a bunch of great videos on drawing forms and anatomy shapes, while Draw a Box offers some great active tutorials for drawing everyday objects, people, landscapes, and yes — boxes. Use your hands In conjunction with the iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil features palm-rejection technology, which means your hand, arm, and fingers can rest against the screen while you draw. While previous third-party styli have had variations on palm rejection in certain apps, they never quite worked perfectly; the Apple Pencil, in contrast, is about as perfect at palm rejection as you can be with a digital touchscreen. Because of bad stylus experiences in the past, I've seen dozens of first-time Pencil users awkwardly gripping the pen to hover their hand above the screen. Trust me: I did it too, but you don't need to with the Pencil. Feel free to rest your hand against the screen while you draw. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it'll feel as natural as resting your hand on paper. Test the Pencil's pressure Equipped at the drawing end of the Apple Pencil is a beautifully responsive plastic nib for all manner of sketching and writing. It's pressure-sensitive, too, so you shouldn't be afraid to press harder and softer on the screen to see how your Pencil reacts. One of my first calibration tests with any new drawing tool — digital or not — is drawing a series of vertical and horizontal lines, to test how different pressure results in different line widths. I highly encourage everyone to do something similar — not only will it get you comfortable with the Pencil's variations, but you'll also get a better sense for how you need to hold the tool for optimal control. I also recommend moving your grip up closer to the nib when doing detailed lettering or drawing: It gives you more precision over those fine lines. (And don't be afraid to pinch-to-zoom with your free hand — most great apps support it.) Shade with the sides It's not just the tip of the Pencil nib that works on the iPad Pro's screen: The entire cone of that nib is responsive. As a result, you can use the side of the Pencil to shade with your digital brushes — much as you might use the side of a graphite stick to color in a shadow on paper. Not only is it a cool effect, but it's one I see early Pencil users miss out on when they're first getting to know their new tool. Shading also looks different in different apps and with different brushes — don't be afraid to experiment to find which brushes and apps work best for your purposes. Tap and scroll In addition to being a great drawing implement, the Apple Pencil can be used to navigate your iPad in-between drawing programs. I really enjoy using the Pencil to scroll lists and swipe between views — its precision tip makes tapping and selecting certain items a whiz, and if I have to switch to another app while drawing, it keeps me from having to put the Pencil down to enter a task. Add a clip (and store that cap) While the Pencil's smooth, cylindrical shape may please the eye in the negative space of an Apple Store or design lab, in the real world... well, pencils roll. The Apple Pencil does have a clever weighted magnet that stops slow rolls, but even that won't help you when you want to store the Pencil somewhere. Luckily, it's easy enough to add a free-standing clip or one stolen off your nearest pen. I adorned my Apple Pencil with a clip from one of my Micron pens: Once you slide it off the Micron top, you just have to slip it on, nib first, up the Pencil body. Easy peasy. One other accessory-style tip — or cap, as it were: If you charge the Pencil with your iPad's Lightning port, you can store its magnetic cap on the iPad surface using one of the two bottom Smart Cover magnets next to the home button. I use this trick constantly: It's a great way to avoid losing a tiny white plastic cylinder while charging the slightly larger cylinder it belongs to. Questions?

I am considering an iPad Pro to rediscover sketching I used to do. I am debating on either the 10.5 or 12.9 but afraid of the 12.9 size and heft but believe the 12.9 would be best for my sketching. Do you have a preference in regards to screen size? Currently, I carry my air 2 throughout the house for mainly movie viewing and surfing. Your insight would b appreciated. Again, a big fan! Do you share your drawings and opinions on twitter a lot? If so, I will follow.

What will the specs be? Will it have special features? Here's everything we know! iPhone 8 — iPhone X — whatever Apple ends up calling the next and "tenth anniversary" iPhone, it's expected next fall, and with a new design and new set of features. But what will they be? This article is continuously updated to include the latest news and rumors. Bookmark it, save it, share it, and check back often! May 26, 2017: Score one more rumor for Touch ID beneath the screen Rumors have been going back and forth over where exactly Apple will put Touch ID in iPhone 8. Everyone wants it under the front glass, embedded in the display, but the tech is hard enough other rumors suggest Apple might have to settle for the back or lose it entirely. Now, randomly accurate rumor site Digitimes adds one to the gossip pile for the front: Apple will use an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen, said the report. Additionally, the new iPhone devices will also come with invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of high-pixel camera and to enable AR applications. The information is credited to TSMC, one of Apple's frequent chip fabricators. Weigh it as you will. May 5, 2017: This is what one leaker claims iPhone 8 might look like Rendered images and videos, claimed to be based on CAD designs of an iPhone 8 prototype leaked from the factory, have been posted online by Gear India The site hedges heavily but seems to believe this is close to what Apple will ship. Apple has been testing out several prototype designs for the iPhone 8. For the same reason, at this time, we are not in a position to confirm if the renders showcased above indeed belong to the final design that was selected by Apple. That said, there are chances that the final design of the iPhone 8 will closely match the renders shown above with minor differences. The model you see in the renders measure roughly 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm (8.9mm with back camera bump). There is also some confusion at this point regarding the positioning of the sensors and the camera lenses on the front fascia. Given the seemingly conflicting rumors, along with the lack of parts leaks from the supply chain, some believe Apple hasn't yet come to a final design decision or begun manufacturing ramp up. Whatever the reason, we should learn more as fall approaches. What will the next iPhone be called? If Apple sticks to the same pattern the company has been using since 2010, the 2016 iPhone 7 will be followed by the 2017 iPhone 7s, but given that 2017 is the iPhone's 10th anniversary, we may get something entirely different. iPhone 8? iPhone Edition? iPhone X?! iPhone: 2007 iPhone 3G: 2008 iPhone 3GS: 2009 iPhone 4: 2010 iPhone 4s: 2011 iPhone 5: 2012 iPhone 5s: 2013 iPhone 6: 2014 iPhone 6s: 2015 iPhone 7: 2016 Any pattern can be broken, of course, and Apple can ultimately call any iPhone anything the company wants — iPhone Pro, Apple Phone, etc. Because it's rumored to be an all new design, it's possible Apple will skip iPhone 7s and go straight to iPhone 8. Because it'll be 10 years since the first iPhone was introduced, Apple could also call it iPhone X. According to Macotakara, the phone currently thought of as the iPhone 8 may in fact be given the name of "iPhone Edition". The phone could also be arriving later than the rumored iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, though all three phones would apparently be introduced at the same event. For the sake of simplicity, iPhone 8 will be used in our rumor roundup until we hear otherwise. Will there be an iPhone 8 Plus? Probably not. There was an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 6 Plus: 2014 iPhone 6s Plus: 2015 iPhone 7 Plus: 2016 But iPhone 8 is getting a new design where the display can be iPhone Plus sized while the casing around it remains iPhone regular size. Rumor has it, though, there'll still be iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus alongside iPhone 8 (singular). When will the iPhone 8 be released? Update: Despite previous rumors of severe delays, a new report (via Digitimes) claims that after a September introduction, all three of Apple's rumored new phones for 2017, including the iPhone 8, will launch in October. While that would indeed be later than previous years, it is said that actual production of devices will happen on schedule. Since the iPhone 5, Apple has announced every new iPhone during a special event held the first or second Tuesday or Wednesday of September. iPhone 5: September 12, 2012 iPhone 5s: September 10, 2013 iPhone 6: September 9, 2014 iPhone 6s: September 9, 2015 iPhone 7: September 7, 2016 Likewise, since the iPhone 5, Apple has shipped every new iPhone the second Friday following the event, with the exception of the iPhone 6s in 2015, which shipped the third Friday following the event: iPhone 5: September 21, 2012 iPhone 5S: September 20, 2013 iPhone 6: September 19, 2014 iPhone 6s: September 25, 2015 iPhone 7: September 16, 2016 Past patterns are the best indicator of future events, but they aren't perfect. Apple can and will throw curveballs whenever the company's logistics or strategy demands. So, be aware of the dates but don't be bound to them. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White (via MacRumors) claims that while pre-orders for all three of Apple's rumored 2017 iPhones (iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8) will all begin in September, the iPhone 8 may not ship until "several weeks" later due to issues with its 3D sensor technology. Analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company contradicts White's report with his own investigation (as reported by AppleInsider), believing that it's not 3D sensor issues to blame, but low Touch ID yields: For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display— the current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products. Arcuri theorizes that Apple could avoid delays entirely by ditching Touch ID entirely in lieu of facial recognition (not likely) or move the fingerprint scanner to the rear of the casing, but Apple will most likely just accept the delay and move forward with small quantities (a la the AirPods and Apple Pencil). This isn't entirely unusual for the high-end iPhone model, either: Apple's Jet Black iPhone 7 was under severe shipping constraints when it first launched, as well. KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), believes iPhone 8 will prove difficult enough to manufacture that we won't see it, even in constrained quantities, until October or November 2017: KGI blames several 'significant hardware upgrades' in the iPhone 8 for the delays. This includes a custom OLED display panel, a custom Apple A11 10-nanometer SoC, an all-new designed 3D Touch module and 3D sensing cameras. Kuo (via MacRumors, since doubled down on his belief iPhone 8 will be ramped up later than usual and be severely constrained at launch: According to Kuo, who titled his note "Rising probability of worst-case scenario for iPhone shipments," production ramp-up of the iPhone 8 could be delayed to "as late as October-November," a departure from Apple's traditional August to September ramp-up period. The result will be "severe supply shortages" that persist for "a while" after the new iPhone models are introduced in September. To be clear, Kuo continues to believe Apple will introduce the iPhone in September, but he suggests there's a strong possibility the device will be hard to come by for several months following its release. Rumors of delays typically presage every new iPhone release and while products are sometimes constrained, like iPhone 7 Plus, none have been pushed back past the recent September launch period. (iPhone 4s, in 2011, was the last to launch in October.) Given the incredible amount of cutting edge technology Apple plans to include in iPhone 8, however, no timeline could reasonably be considered certain. What can we expect in the iPhone 8 design? Update: DigiTimes, all three of Apple's rumored 2017 iPhones, the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 will feature reinforced glass bodies with metal frames, with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus featuring aluminum frames, and the iPhone 8 sporting a stainless steel one. The iPhone 8 is also the only one of the three models said to have an AMOLED display. At any given point in time, Apple is working several years ahead on the iPhone line. Upcoming models may already be in the testing or prototype stages while future models may be little more than components attached to boards. Sometimes multiple versions will also exist, some more conservative, others more audacious. What eventually ships depends on what can reliably be produced given the limits of technology and economics. Since 2008 Apple has also followed a "tick-tock" cycle for iPhones. On the "tick" year the company unveils a new design and on the "tock" year the company takes that same design to its limits. In 2016, though, Apple broke from that pattern and released a second tock — iPhone 7. iPhone 3G: 2008 — Plastic shell. iPhone 4: 2010 — Antenna band and glass back. iPhone 5: 2012 — 16:9 aspect ratio, chamfered edges. iPhone 6: 2014 — Bigger screens, rounded edges. iPhone 7: 2015 - New finishes. Rumor has it the next big iPhone redesign will be more dramatic one, with less bezel around the sides and at the top and bottom and virtualized buttons. Other reports also say that the iPhone 8 will feature a glass front and back, with either aluminum or stainless steel around the edges of the phone. Stainless steel is said to be reserved for the more expensive models. ETNews (via MacRumors), in contrast, reports that the iPhone 8 will feature a glass casing and a "water drop design" that will harken back to the original iPhone from 2007. Noted leaker Sonny Dickson has shown off what appears to be a possible schematic for the iPhone 8, which shows a device with a metal back and a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor. This contradicts a previous report from Bloomberg that the iPhone 8 would feature a glass front and back with a stainless steel frame. Benjamin Geskin on Twitter (via 9to5Mac), has posted what he claims is a "dummy" mockup of iPhone 8, matching several of the rumors. Specifically, for iPhone 8 with Touch ID remaining on the front, beneath the glass. iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 Wait, Touch ID on the back of iPhone 8... like... like... Android? If Apple wants to remove the bottom bezel, there Touch ID sensor will have to be changed or removed to accomplish that. It sounds like Apple wants to keep Touch ID on the front but put it under the display. That would be ideal, given Apple already made the Home button virtual with iPhone 7. Samsung had similar plans for the Galaxy S8, however, but was forced to change when it couldn't get the technology to work and put it on the back instead. Apple might well succeed where Samsung failed, or might have to make a similar compromise. That's likely why we keep seeing multiple purported schematics for iPhone 8: the audacious version with Touch ID under the display, and the pragmatic version where it's forced onto the back. What colors will the iPhone 8 be offered in? So far Apple has saved the new iPhone finishes for the years absent big redesigns, save for 2017's iPhone 7 Project RED special edition. iPhone 5s: 2013 — Gold. iPhone 6s: 2015 — Rose gold. iPhone 7: 2016 — Black and jet black. iPhone 7: 2017 - (Product) RED. That said, Apple can do anything the company wants, any time the company wants, including introducing new colors with new designs — including new casing material. Apple Watch Series 2 being released in white ceramics sent the internet atwitter with thoughts of iPhone 8 being made out of the same material. Tougher than stainless steel, it still remains to be seen if it would hold up in a device as big as an iPhone or iPhone Plus. Notably, Greg Koenig of Luma Labs thinks it unlikely, writing on Atomic Delights: More bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing technology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the primary patent the original Quora article pins most of its extrapolations on - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for ceramics. The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming method. In short, not only does the ceramic Watch quash any hopes of a ceramic iPhone, I think it actually indicates that Apple isn't chasing down ceramics for iPhone production any time on the horizon. What specs will the iPhone 8 have? Update: A Goldman Sachs analyst note (via MacRumors) claims that Apple will release the iPhone 8 in 128GB and 256GB variations for $999 and $1,099, respectively. Since Apple introduced the company's first branded system-on-a-chip (SoC) in 2010, every new iPhone has come with a new A-series chipset. If Apple sticks to that pattern, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will ship with Apple A11 processors. New SoC typically take advantage of better processes that let them be faster and more powerful but also more energy efficient. Apple has also been adding coprocessors to handle motion voice activation, and now big.LITTLE fusion. A11 could further build on those capabilities as well, including implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning at the silicon level. The custom CPUs Apple has been producing have gone from Swift to Cyclone to Typhoon to Twister, so... Tropical Storm next? Hurricane? Rumors also persist that Apple is working on custom GPUs and even modems as well, which would allow the company to take full control of everything from graphics to radios. Recent reports indicate that Intel will be supplying at least some of the modems for this year's iPhone lineup. What about an iPad Pro-style Smart Connector? Apple typically introduces a technology in one device and then rolls it out across the lineup. Retina was like that with iPhone 4 and Touch ID with iPhone 5s. The Smart Connector, which debuted with the iPad Pro in the fall of 2015, attaches via a magnet and runs power, data, and ground directly from the device. It currently powers Apple's Smart Keyboard and a similar keyboard from Logitech, with more expected to follow. Apple could certainly engineer a Smart Connector for iPhone 8, but what it would be used for is a more interesting question. Apple made a smaller Smart Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but would the company make an even smaller one for iPhone 8 Plus? For iPhone 8 standard? According to The Verifier, the iPhone 8 will feature a Smart Connector, which it will apparently use both for charging and for augmented and virtual reality features. What about the display? More HD? TrueTone? Apple hasn't updated the resolution on iPhone or iPhone Plus since 2014. As such, it makes them less than desirable for applications like VR, and less than competitive when it comes to spec comparisons. It does make them more energy efficient, though, given they still use LCD rather than OLED panels. There have been rumors that we could see a bump to 1920 x 1080 for the 4.7-inch model and 2560 x 1440 for the 5.5-inch model. There have also been rumors about OLED, but right now the LED component of the LCD system is used to implement the pressure-sensitive 3D Touch system, so would Apple re-engineer that? Or would they simply skip ahead again to something like quantum dot? According to The Korea Herald, any and all OLED versions will be curved and made of plastic, rather than the glass typically used on flat panels. Also, while iPhone 7 got the DCI-P3 wide gamut color system of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it didn't get the True Tone system. True Tone employs two ambient light sensors, with four channels each, to measure the color temperate of the surrounding area and then match the display to that temperature. Investment bank Barclays (via MacRumors) believes that Apple's next iPhone will feature True Tone displays, however. Will the iPhone 8 be waterproof? iPhone 7 is water resistant but not water proof. Rated IP67, it can survive accidental splashes, dunks, and floods, but isn't rated as highly as some competing phones from Samsung and others. Although swimming with an iPhone may not be on everyone's wish-list, those whose jobs or pastimes expose them to the elements, and even those who want to do underwater photography at shallow depths would be thrilled by IP68, and a new report from The Korea Herald claims that the iPhone 8 will feature just that. Will the iPhone 8 have wireless charging? Up until mid-2015, it hadn't been possible to do wireless charging—also known as inductive charging—on a phone with a metal back. Since Apple switched from the glass of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s to the aluminum of the iPhone 5 and later models, that effectively meant the company couldn't offer wireless charging as well. Now methods for induction through metal are being introduced, which means it's possible Apple could keep the aluminum back and offer wireless charging. A report from KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac) claims that all rumored 2017 iPhones will feature wireless charging; the iPhone 8 will also apparently have a thin sheet of graphite to protect its new 3D Touch sensor from the heat generated by wireless charging. Recent rumors have also suggested Apple is working on resonant inductive coupling, which would let devices charge even at a distance. (The greater the distance, the lower the efficiency.) Such technology is likely a year or more away, though. Okay, what do we know for sure? Only that nothing is confirmed until an Apple executive holds an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus up on stage!

Right, until you see the test done on Youtube where the person put the Samsung Flagship and the iPhone 7 in to buckets and lowered them to the bottom of some body of water. Even down to (hope I remember correctly) 45 feet, for about a half hour to 45 minutes, both phones held up. But the Samsung finally was nuked, while the iPhone soldiered on to greater depths. They never did ruin it. Apple's ratings are underestimated, while apparently Samsung's are't as underestimated, but way better than you would expect. 0 1 month ago Reply givmedew Unfortunately there are different tests showing different varying points where the devices fail for both Apple and Samsung. There are tests that show some iPhones failing sooner and some showing Samsungs that last longer. There is a reason for this though. You have 2 versions of iPhone 7 and 2 versions of S7 and S8 and you will always have variances in manufacturing. So you could perceivably have 2 galaxy s7 side by side and they almost certainly won't fail at the same time. Because the drop of water that kills them isn't going to enter at the same exact time and it isn't going to move to the same exact location in the phone and then when whatever fails gets wet it may or may not go instantly. Also the mineral content in the water maters more than anyone understands. The best place to do these tests is in salt water. You could manufacture a test showing an iPhone 4 surviving being dunked in a bowl of water and if the water came from a jug or bottle well it might not be very conductive. It's the minerals and impurities in the water that makes it so conductive. It takes longer for a component to fail in distilled water than tap water and it takes longer to fail in tap that salt water because tap water could be 50-1000x more conductive than distilled water and salt water can be 1000x more conductive than tap water. Then there is possible internal coatings that like conformal coating and other things that could allow a device to survive water ingress. But that's not it... There are so many factors and the thing is that these tests DO NOT SHOW WHEN WATER ENTERS THE DEVICE!!!! They show when the device critically fails! The truth and reality though is that even 1 drop of water inside of a phone means trouble. This drop will not easily get out, it may never escape and it could cause issues with camera optics, touchscreen sensitivity, foggy display etc. To assume that Apple decided to underate the phone is silly. To decide that Samsung overrated their phone is silly. I have used both phones up to their rated spec and had no issue. That's good enough for me... For anyone to try and say look this one specific sample from millions of phones out performed this other example when we took them way way past there rated ability is just silly. 0 1 month ago Reply ChrisS9938 Does it really matter?

I love a tactile home button, and will forever. Lots of benefits, no drawbacks. Instead, shrink the top and side bezels. It doesn't have to be perfectly symmetrical, the bottom bezel can be bigger than the top! Nothing on a Macbook is pefectly symetrical vertically, because it doesn't make sense to do that. So why can't that same logic apply to the iPhone? Do what makes sense. The right tool for the right job. So on and so forth.... What I really want from the new iPhone is that the smaller one also have dual cameras with portrait mode, and make them less slippery. I'd love to go caseless, but this is so scary given how slippery the phone is. Would love to see some sort of new innovation in material usage on a future iPhone that makes it be both premium and pretty, and strong, AND not super slippery. At least the sides, perhaps give some texture to the surface if nothing else. Some flush rubberized inlays? Everything else is just fluff... 0 3 months ago Reply Sicily1918 I believe that's what the haptic engine will do -- it'll still feel like the iPhone 7's Home button, but be baked right into the screen (supposedly, but let's be honest; it's ALL supposedly until Apple shows it off in about 6 months). Personally, I think the renders with the 'missing' home button and the screen that goes all the way down looks great! I think it'll be very slippery, if it's an all-glass design, and you'll more than likely want to protect it with a case, but that's the reality of smartphones in general -- you're talking a $650 - $1000 personal computer that, by its very nature, is vulnerable to being dropped. 0 3 months ago Reply Morjesta Is it true that they want to integrate the TouchID to the screen removing the home button?

The reason the display is plastic is because of the physical curvature (according to Samsung and LG, the technology's not there yet to reliably make curved displays from glass).

Apple's existing technologies include wireless charging, Raise-to-Wake, water-expelling speakers, Apple SIM and a dearth of user-replaceable parts. If curved OLED edges allow Apple to replace the hardware buttons with software ones, I wonder if they would combine this with the rumoured new TouchID and their existing technologies to go so far as removing *all* buttons and ports from the OLED iPhone... It would certainly be one way to achieve an IP68 rating, and would appeal to Jony Ive I think. A phone aesthetic with no disruption to the surface other than a speaker grill is probably his end-game. If they did do this, hopefully the wireless charger would include the capability to somehow force a hardware reboot. I don't think this is very likely, but I can see how it could all line up. And yes - right now people need to plug a Lightning cable in to charge it, so many users have several cables but *most* have just the one that came with their phone. To many users, I don't think it would feel very different to plug in a wireless charging pad to the end of the Lightning cable.

It's not possible, by anyone, until some major new technological advances are made outside of consumer gadgets (like some university discovers X and it trickles into the market). So each year, we get a new phone, with great, but not earth shattering updates. This is true of every smartphone maker! They have to release each year due to competition, so the updates can't be that huge. That doesn't mean everyone has to buy it and complain it didn't blow their minds from last year. I don't see any massive earth shattering revelations in any other industry every year, but gadget people are so spoiled, such $hitty rotten entitled babies, they expect nothing less than mind blowing re-imaginings of every device every single year as if it was possible from people working 50-60 hour weeks to make this happen. For some reason, I don't see this in any other industry. No one is making statements like "new Ford Mustang, same internal combustion 4 wheeled vehicle as the old Mustang". If someone is fiscally smart, they'll wait 2-3 years before upgrading and then the new iPhone WILL surprise them. But like anything else, if you buy a new TV every year or a new car every year, of the same model, you won't be impressed. So I'm complaining about this attitude because I don't understand where it comes from. I do get a new iPhone every year because I'm silly like that, but I'm not a dumb enough to expect it to melt my brain.

That doesn't mean that the cover for the display will be plastic. It will be glass, as always. Of course, OLED is capable of DCI-P3. True Tone was left out because of the lack of room for the extra light sensors. Will they make it into a new phone? If space allows. Pressure sensitivity? Sure, there's nothing about OLED that would prevent the same system from working. The US government doesn't allow the use of the term "waterproof" in most products. There's really no such thing. Even diving watches designed for 5,000 meters are called water resistant to that pressure. A water resistant phone to Apple Watch standards of 50 meters would be hard to do. Is it worth it?

My guess is is something more like a 5" screen in a chassis roughly the same size as the current 4.7", made possible by the smaller bezels. 1 7 months ago Reply kaymc TL;DR: Proooobably glass and poooossibly wireless charging.

The technology is available, just Apple for some also hold back.. e.g If can do Touch ID on a home button there the tech is there... u can do it behind the screen, but I wonder weather just is saying they don't do it, when in reality they are working on it at the moment, just choose not to tell anyone. Sometimes u gotta think whats really happening. 0 7 months ago Reply DannyJJK Edge to edge will result in accidental touch presses. Maybe the bevel can be reduced but that's up to Apple to decide. I've used phones where the screen goes almost to the edge of the phone, and it's very easy to accidentally register touch presses 2 7 months ago Reply highinterest This. I hate the idea of no bezels.

The curved screen is impressive and does not cause touch issues and works perfectly in a case.

It would make it a lot easier to break the screen. 0 5 months ago Reply siryodi It will not increase screen break incidents. Screens braking is carelessness and in the case of a true accident bad luck in terms of how the phone lands and what it lands on. If you have a case it will still just depend on the level of protection and if that protection even comes into play during the incident. I bang my watches on metal, brick, etc. far more than my phone and there is no break. My car takes rocks to the glass at 80MPH and again it is all luck and angles. For those that are worried about touch issues, software can adjust for the edges if need be but in current phones with smaller bezels than the current iPhone this hasn't been needed. 0 5 months ago Reply erikbock Since it is the 10 year anniversary of the iPhone they need to call it iPhone X 1 7 months ago Reply James Falconer Oooooh. :) 2 7 months ago Reply 2tomtom Would the next model be Xs or Y......or XI.........etc. Not sure I like this? 0 5 months ago Reply GreenDize12 uhh, no.

Wireless charging is not a perfect technology, but it can be very convenient. Wireless charging pads in coffee shops, cars and such mean I don't have to find a table with a plug or have wires dangling about. It also allows for battery packs such as the Galaxy S7 one which charge wirelessly rather than plugging a pass through adaptor like on the Apple Smart battery case. The technology will improve and I imagine Apple will adopt it once the range has improved. But for now it's a feature that I have on my Galaxy s7E (and has been on every second phone I've had since a Lumia 920) that I wish was also on my iPhone. 0 5 months ago Reply mavsguy842 I hope the wireless charging rumored to be in testing isn't proprietary, but utilizes either or both of the current standards (Qi/PMA). 3 7 months ago Reply EliCzap86 Unfortunately you know apple.

It would look drop dead gorgeous though. 1 7 months ago Reply danmart I really doubt that Apple would produce a phone with a ceramic back. Ceramic is super tough, which makes it scratch resistant, but the down-side is that it is vulnerable to shattering. You can get way with that for a watch, as most of the time it's strapped to your wrist. But a phone is very vulnerable to dropping and if you dropped a ceramic phone on a hard surface I think the case would be highly likely to shatter. 0 7 months ago Reply PDXMatt It's also fairly heavy. -1 7 months ago Reply Thoughter That's not how modern industrial ceramics work. Zirconia and many other things are added so it is very different than the dinner plates you're thinking of. A ceramic watch has to handle a lot of direct impacts because people swing their arms against objects all the time. It's not a problem. Police and the military use ceramic plates in their ballistic armor. They have solved the shattering problem with new processes and chemical additives. The question is can the cost and difficulty in manufacturing feasibly and cost effectively produce hundreds of millions of phone cases a year. Apple has great material scientists and they have been learning with the watch, so I wouldn't rule a ceramic phone out. With it's great luxury feel, scratch resistance, color choices, etc., I am sure Jony Ive is working hard on it. 2 7 months ago Reply kimmibear40 I think this is just a little too early Sent from the iMore App 1 7 months ago Reply kmontey LOL what a ridiculous article.

I like the bigger screen of my last two plus models over the standard 4.7, but I came in from a 5.2" Moto X last year. I thought that was actually a good size, but didn't want to lose .5" and go down to the 4.7" in the same physical sized body (ok the Moto was like 1-2mm wider). I think 5" would be the perfect spot unless the bezels get seriously reduced somehow. 2 7 months ago Reply jeffro02 I really doubt that there will be a 4.7, 5 and 5.5. The 4.7 and 5 are too close to each other. Apple likes product differentiation and these two seem like there is not enough differentiation. Apple is no Samsung with dozens of devices that directly complete against each other. 0 7 months ago Reply XDAdam Some people view the 4.7" as too small, while the 5.5" as too big... 5" is right in the middle and would satisfy the middle ground. 0 7 months ago Reply flyinion Maybe they'll actually do 4, 5, and a 5.5 or 5.7 basically bumping the 4.7 a bit and bringing a new version of the SE size. 2 7 months ago Reply jeffro02 Yeah, I've been saying that would be a good idea for awhile. Have three sizes, a mini, a normal and a plus. Release them all together and use the same chips. Cameras can be different, but the core specs should be on par. That would appeal to those who like small and large phones. True, there will be people who would prefer a slightly larger/smaller size than those released, but you would still be able to appeal to the vast majority of customers. 1 7 months ago Reply flyinion Yeah I doubt they would do that as well unless they did something like 4.7 is the standard features with 1920x1080, 5.5 is the Plus with extra camera stuff or something and 2560x1440 , and then say a 5. with the extra camera features or whatever is extra of the Plus except still at 1920x1080. It would still be surprising to see two screens that close though. I think if they're going to do 3 phones with one of them being a 5" that the other two will be slightly larger and smaller than the current two sizes to create more of a difference. 0 7 months ago Reply wlonsdale How do their devices "compete against each other" Totally different markets and uses. 0 6 months ago Reply siryodi I have been hoping for a 5" to 5.2" iPhone for a long time. I think that is the sweet spot for a Smart Phone. It would make sense to just do the 5 or 5.1"" and 5.5" then keep selling the iphone 7 for a year in 4.7" before dropping it when the following year's phones come out. 0 5 months ago Reply JosuUrien AppleInsider denies the rumor, and says they will stick to 4,7" and 5.5". Anyway, I don't see any problem in Apple replacing the 4,7 with a 5" model if, as rumored, is all screen and no bezel. Think that a 4,7" screen is a bit wider than an iPhone SE, but shorter in height. So a 4.7" model without any bezel would be smaller than an iPhone SE model right now, and a 5" would be very similar in size to the SE, a little wider but not taller. 0 7 months ago Reply ChrisS9938 I'd love to see an app drawer as an option, but that's a software thing. I'd like to see screens at 5 and 5.5 with a 5.7 or better pro model. The 4.7 7 will be the next "SE" model. I'm all for removing the button altogether and just having a circle on the glass. Apple needs screens that are the equivalent of gorilla glass 5. I LIKE the aluminum body! I really don't want to go back to glass. My upgrade comes dead between the two models, and I am seriously considering android for the first time in years. I have nougat on my work Pixel C and it works wonderfully, so I can use both systems. But the odds are still pretty good I'll get a 7 plus in black. Water resistant is extremely attractive to me and the Pixel phones don't appear to have it. Samsung has glass backs. Don't panic about sales. The iPhone is a really good product, and Apple has a lot of people like me using a 6 that still works great who aren't ready to rush out in September and buy early, but will upgrade over the next year.

Processing and graphics power matters. The more Apple can continue to lead in this area, the more the iPhone can do. Processing power also means we users can get longer life out of our phones. I expect this from Apple, but it is worth saying. Is this an area where Apple can sustain their advantage? 3. I see Siri as a big part of the future for the iPhone. The more Apple can improve Siri -- hardware has to be important here -- the more we can all move beyond legacy input modes. This is one step to the future. 4. Battery life is huge. I don't know how companies like Apple will eventually break away from evolutionary battery improvements and OS efficiencies versus simply adding larger batteries, but this is a tech disruption waiting to happen.

And like last year, this means the company will resort to throttling Qualcomm's modems in order to ensure that they perform at the same level as Intel's. While Qualcomm already has a modem that can theoretically reach gigabit LTE speeds (and this is included in the Snapdragon 835 chipset that powers 2017's Android flagships), Intel isn't there yet. It's reportedly working on a modem with similar capabilities, but that part won't be ready in time for the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus that Apple will launch this fall. Apple doesn't want to depend on just one supplier for such a crucial hardware component, and especially not Qualcomm - with which it's embroiled in a lawsuit where it alleges the chip maker is engaging in monopolistic practices. Apple's solution for this entire conundrum is to do what it did last year: throttle Qualcomm's higher-performing modems to the same level as what Intel's part is able to achieve. Thus there will be no performance difference between iPhones sporting the two parts. This might however create a marketing issue for Apple. The big US carriers have all promised to make gigabit LTE networks a reality by the end of the year, and when those launch the newest iPhones won't support them. On the other hand, Samsung's Galaxy S8, S8+, and Note8 all will, along with other Android handsets powered by the Snapdragon 835. As the carriers are expected to push this advancement a lot in their ads, Apple's image could suffer.

WE are edging closer to Apple’s reveal of the iPhone 8, but is it worth holding out for? Check out our detailed breakdown of the market to find out. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 news.com.au June 10, 201710:42am Key iPhone 8 feature could be disastrous A leaked image of the iPhone 8 has highlighted one key feature and the fury from some customers is spilling over. THE question everyone keeps asking is should they wait for the iPhone 8 or is there a better option to buy now? We decided to give you an in-depth breakdown of the best phones currently on the market to help you make an informed decision. IPHONE 8 Having kept to an almost identical design for its flagship smartphones since 2014, Apple is set to provide a fresh overhaul for the forthcoming iPhone 8. The tech giant is tipped to use its annual September event to announce the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which will offer moderate updates from the predecessors — the main change will be swapping the aluminium case for glass to allow for wireless charging. But Apple will also use the event to launch the radically redesigned iPhone 8, a device expected to set tongues wagging. The bold new design is expected to include a stainless steel frame between two glass panels, which slightly curve to give the appearance of one continuous sheet of glass. Apple’s iPhone 8 is expected to have an advanced edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display that will rival the impressive 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio seen on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. Using finalised schematics leaked from the manufacturer of Apple’s next-generation smartphones, pictures show what the iPhone 8 is going to look like when it’s unveiled later this year. To achieve the 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio, Apple has removed the physical home button from the front of the display. As the leaked design doesn’t include a fingerprint scanner on the rear of the device, it is believed the TouchID sensor will be embedded in the display. The design also shows a new dual-lens camera system that will feature the same optical zoom capability as the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera, LED flash and a microphone. Surprisingly, the camera module on the iPhone 8 is oriented vertically, which is likely to do with the internal hardware engineering needed to fit the dual camera, front camera and new 3D infra-red sensors on the smaller device. However, it could be designed to specifically to enable the new augmented reality features Apple is expected to reveal at the event. While being unveiled this coming September, the release of the iPhone 8 might not come until early 2018 if recent rumours of manufacturing difficulties prove to be correct. Pros: • Full OLED display • Tipped to have 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio • Could have augmented reality features Cons: • Full glass display could make phone fragile • There will likely be no headphone jack • Might not have USB-C charger SAMSUNG S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 review2:25 Can Samsung's latest flagship help it bounce back from the exploding battery saga? May 16th 2017 a month ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Easily the sexiest release of the year, the ‘Infinity Display’ of the S8 Plus maximises the nearly bezel-less screen by using the curved glass to remove the left and right borders, with the top and bottom including only what is needed for things like the front-facing camera and iris scanner. As the tallest flagship phone the company has produced, the S8+ measures a whopping 6.2-inches, while the S8 has a much more humble 5.8-inch display. Despite the S8+ having such a long display, it measures only 73.4mm wide, making it thinner than the iPhone 7 Plus and easier to operate in one hand — this coming from a man genetically cursed with little sausage fingers. When watching 16:9 content on the 6.2-inch display you will have black bars on the side of the content, however if watching cinematic content shot in 2.35:1 or 2.39:1, the entire display will be filled, offering marvellous content. To help with the bezel-less display, Samsung has replaced the physical home button with virtual buttons and the branding has been moved to the rear of the phone because, honestly, there is nothing sexy about SAMSUNG staring at your face every time you look at the device. Also located on the back of the phone is the rear camera, which has been made to sit almost flush with the screen The fingerprint scanner also sits on the back of the phone to the left of the camera and while aesthetically pleasing, it’s a little awkward for unlocking the device at times and can lead to some nasty smudges on your camera. Thankfully there is the option for passcode facial recognition and iris scanning to avoid this issue when unlocking the device. The 12-megapixel rear camera has been kept the same specifications as the S7, which is a little disappointing. The Galaxy S8 features the IP68-rated water and dust resistance you’ve come to expect from Galaxy phones. As for the battery life, the S8 Plus has three display settings, allowing you to run the phone at either a WQHD+ (2960 x 1440), FHD+ (2220 x 1080) or HD+ (1480 x 730) resolution, with the lower tiers obviously offering more battery life. With the default FHD+ setting, the 3,500 mAh battery allows you to expect around eight hours battery life, which is pretty standard and not all bad with wireless adaptive fast charging. Also included on the phone is Bixby — Samsung’s own personal assistant to rival Siri and Google Assistant. Pros: • Slim, sleek and sexy — this design is phenomenal • High screen to body ratio of 84 per cent • No exploding battery saga Cons: • Phone is very fragile without protective case • Fingerprint scanner in strange location • Camera hasn’t seen a huge update from its predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ cost $1199 and $1349, respectively. HUAWEI P10 AND P10 PLUS Huawei P10Source:Supplied Having already crushed Apple and Samsung in China, the world’s third most popular smartphone manufacturer is trying to achieve similar impact locally with the P10 and P10 plus. The smaller phone and its larger counterpart have 5.1-inch and 5.5-inch LCD displays, offering 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 pixels, respectively. The company’s latest flagships also look very similar to Apple’s 2014 iPhone 6S — great news for those who like the iPhone design but not iOS. Unlike other Huawei devices, the fingerprint scanner has been removed from the rear of the device and placed below the display, where it also doubles as a physical home button. It has smooth, curved corners, minimal side bezels and is available in gold and blue and black. Like its predecessor flagship smartphone, the Leica-branded dual camera set up is one of the best aspects of the device. Located flush at the top left of the device is the dual camera set up, which has a 12MP RGB sensor working alongside 20MP monochrome shooter. Both sensors capture images independently and combine them into one photo — this is supposed to enhance detail and contrast. Huawei’s P10 and P10 Plus also offer a front-facing 8MP camera, which includes a Leica-branded portrait mode. Shooting in portrait will use new facial tracking software that detects more than 190 points on the human face to ensure the camera focuses for the best possible shot. Both models offer Huawei Supercharge, which can take the battery from 0 to 25 per cent in 15 minutes or 0 to 88 per cent in an hour. Unlike its competitors, the P10 and P10 Plus are not water and dust resistant, which could be a deal breaker for those who find extra comfort in the setting. Pros: • Very similar to the look and feel of iPhone for people who don’t like Android • Dual camera provides excellent picture quality • Cheaper than other smartphones on the market Cons: • Not water or dust resistant • The P10 has a short battery life The Huawei P10, P10 Plus cost $899 and $1099 respectively. JELLY Jelly is described as a mini-sized 4G smartphone for everyone.Source:Supplied The highly anticipated return of the Nokia 3310 has proven consumers not only have a lust for nostalgia, but that bigger isn’t always better when it comes to smartphones. And while the 3310 is bound to fly off the shelves when it’s released later this year, it’s not without limitations — it won’t work in Australia long-term as it is designed to only operate using 2G networks. Thankfully, there is another smartphone manufacturer looking to fill the market demand for smaller smartphones. The Jelly is a “mini-sized phone with full features” that runs on Android Nougat 7.0 — the latest operating system found on most new Android smartphones. Customers will have the choice between the Jelly or the Jelly Pro, which offer 8GB and 16GB of on-board storage respectively — this can be expanded to 32GB with a MicroSD. Both models will have a 2.45-inch display and a replaceable 950mAH battery capable of up to three days working time or seven days standby. The smartphones will both include a 2MP front facing camera, with an 8MP shooter on the rear. Other key features include a dual SIM card, gyroscope and GPS. Since the concept was born in April 2016, the developers have been able to produce test samples of the product and believe it will start shipping in August this year. Pros: • Smaller than most smartphones, but offers same features • Battery life of up to three days working time or seven days standby • Cheap Cons: • Only has 32GB of space • Poor camera quality compared to bigger smartphones Preorders can be placed now, with the Jelly costing $A106 or $A127 for the Jelly Pro. OPPO R9S It might look like an iPhone 7, but it’s actually an Oppo.Source:Supplied There is no need to spend more than $1000 for a premium smartphone, with Oppo offering high-end specs for just a fraction of the cost. The latest addition to Oppo’s R9 line-up has been designed to meet current demands for greater camera features and improved technologies. Just like its predecessors, the R9s has been designed to be the perfect device for selfie lovers and includes 16MP front facing camera, with a large f/2.0 aperture and Oppo’s Screen Flash technology for quality images in low light conditions. An all new Sony IMX398 sensor has been exclusively designed for the smartphones rear facing 16MP camera, which combines with an extra wide f/1.7 aperture to capture 40 per cent more light than the previous models. The 5.5-inch R9s is eerily similar to the iPhone in design — both with its all-metal body physical appearance and the design of the app icons and fonts. It has a 1080p display, 8-core processor, 4GB of RAM memory and 64GB of on-board storage, which can be expanded to 256GB with a Micro SD card. The R9s further enhances the performance with a “six-string” antenna design — operating on six frequency ranges, which dynamically chooses the best for 4G and Wi-Fi signals. The device’s 3010 mAh battery and VOOC Flash Charge technology will offer heavy users enough charge for the day, while the fingerprint recognition system will become faster over time as it constancy refines its image of the user’s fingerprint. Pros: • Looks and feels similar to iPhone for a fraction of the cost • Selfie lovers dream with 16MP front camera Cons: • Not water/dust resistant • No NFC chip for mobile payment • Comes with Google Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, not the latest Android Nougat OS The R9s is $548 outright or the R9s Plus is $648.

(AAPL) Makes HomeKit Easier for Third Parties, But at a Cost Apple revamped HomeKit to make it easier for manufacturers By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 9, 2017, 7:25 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: WWDC 2017: Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Makes HomeKit Easier for Third Parties, But at a Cost The 10 Biggest E3 New Video Game Announcements Ever Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Gets the Nod From Apple Inc. (AAPL) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind in the race to be the smart home hub. There are a growing number of smart products that support AAPL’s HomeKit standard, but it’s nowhere near the pace being set by rivals Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Source: Apple As WWDC 2017 wraps up, Apple announced it’s making a big change to HomeKit, making it much easier for third party device manufacturers to adopt the standard in the hope of boosting its popularity. However, the move to make HomeKit easier to adopt comes at a cost. Apple’s standard will be giving up some of the rock-solid security that gives it an advantage over competing standards. Making Apple HomeKit Certification Easier to Boost Adoption Amazon’s Alexa has thousands of “skills” that let its Echo smart home speaker interact with online services and control third party connected accessories, such as Google’s Nest smart thermostat. Apple HomeKit has a much more modest adoption rate among device manufacturers and a big part of that is the current certification process. Partners must become MFi licensed and use an Apple authentication chip in their device. Apple HomeKit certification is more costly and takes additional time in comparison to other standards. The requirement for the chip in particular means that companies can’t simply use a firmware update to make their products HomeKit compatible, they have to be specially designed and manufactured. As reported by AppleInsider, the company announced at WWDC 2017 that is loosening its licensing requirements and eliminating the requirement to use its authentication chip. This means product developers can work on HomeKit-compatible prototypes without first having a MFi license. If they decide to go ahead and produce the device, they do still need that license, but Apple is hoping this move will encourage companies that aren’t already partners –and wouldn’t be otherwise– to try out HomeKit, then go ahead and potentially release a commercial product. More importantly, not requiring the Apple authentication chip cuts manufacturing costs and opens up the possibility that smart home products could be made HomeKit compatible through a firmware update. That could even work for previously shipped products already in consumer’s homes. Making it Easier for Smart Home Partners Means Loosening Security Standards The downside to this move is that by employing software authentication instead of a specialized chip, Apple is giving up some of the security that made HomeKit smart devices far more resistant to potential hacking.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iFixit posts teardown of 2017 21.5-inch iMac, finds user-upgradable RAM, modular CPU Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, June 9th, 2017, 05:33 Category: Hardware, iMac, News, Processors The pork has soared and it looks like Apple has finally released an iMac with a user-upgradable CPU as well as RAM. The cool cats at iFixit have just completed a full teardown of Apple’s new 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display. The unit features both removable RAM and a modular CPU, although Apple has yet to say if these components are user-replaceable. Accessing and replacing these components isn’t exactly easy, but it’s still possible. This is the first time Apple has had a 21.5-inch iMac with expandable RAM since 2013, and the first modular CPU since 2012. No one seems to know exactly why Apple has reverted to a socketed CPU, and perhaps there were lengthy discussions with Intel regarding it. iFixit offered the following comments regarding the teardown: Despite the upgradable RAM and CPU, we’re still giving this iMac a 3/10 for repairability. Here’s why: the iMac remains distinctly un-fun to open. Everything is buried under a finicky glass panel. It requires a speciality pizza-cutter-like tool to breach the adhesive before any repair. Plus the glass and Retina Display are fused together, fabulously increasing the cost of replacement. But hey, a 3/10 is triple the score of the iMac’s 2015 predecessor. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Elyse Betters10 June 2017Apps Apple iOS 11 expands Apple Pay to include Apple Pay Cash It's a person-to-person payments service in iMessage With it, you can receive or send money to friends in the US Apple will release iOS 11 with Apple Pay Cash this autumn Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple will introduce a feature, called Apple Pay Cash, in iOS 11 to make it easier for you to send money or receive money from friends. Apple Pay Cash is technically part of Apple Pay, Apple's mobile payment system, but it lives in Apple's iMessage app. And all the money you receive via Apple Pay Cash will live on a virtual card called Apple Pay Cash card, which exists within Wallet, Apple's other app for storing credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, boarding passes, tickets, and more. So, are you confused yet? No worries. Pocket-lint has explained everything you need to know below. Will my iPhone or iPad get iOS 11? iMessage apps: Which should you download first and how to install them? How does Apple Pay Cash work? iMessage app Apple When iOS 11 launches, Apple will allow person-to-person payments, just like apps Venmo, Square Cash, and believe it or not, Snapchat. Apple Pay Cash can be found in Apple's iMessage app. All you have to do is tap the Apple Pay thumbnail within the redesigned app drawer in iMessage. You can then set the payment amount, tap either request or pay, and approve the transaction. TouchID authentication Apple If you're requesting money from someone, a link to make the payment will show up in your iMessage chat window with that person. If you're paying someone, you must hit the send button and use TouchID to approve the transaction. The TouchID sensor offers secure authentication for any type of Apple Pay Cash transaction, and yes, all transactions will be encrypted. Wallet app Apple Payments will be sent from your debit card or credit card stored in Apple's Wallet app. But any money received will go into your "Apple Pay Cash" card, a virtual card that lives in Wallet. Apple is partnering with prepaid payment card company Green Dot on the virtual Apple Pay Cash card. From there, you can use the funds in the virtual card to pay others via iMessage and more. Siri assistance Apple Siri will be able to detect any conversation in iMessage about cash or payments. It'll automatically bring the Apple Pay app to the front of your iMessage app drawer if you or your friends are talking about money in iMessage. Furthermore, if any payment amount is mentioned, that amount will automatically be set when you open up the Apple Pay app, making it a breeze to send cash. Where does Apple Pay Cash work? Apple Pay Cash works wherever Apple Pay is supported. You can learn more about Apple Pay from Pocket-lint's guide here. Not only can you use funds in your Apple Pay Cash card to send and receive money via iMessage, but you can also use it to make Apple Pay purchases at retail locations, on the web, and in apps. You can even transfer the funds to your own bank account. Which devices support Apple Pay Cash? Apple Pay Cash will be available through iOS 11 on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. But it only works on TouchID-supported devices, including Apple Watch, which means older iOS devices won't be able to take advantage of the peer-to-peer payments service. Apple Here is the list of support devices: iPhone SE iPhone 6 and later iPad Pro iPad 5th generation iPad Air 2 iPad Mini 3 and later Apple Watch Are there any fees? To send money using Apple Pay Cash, you will have to add a debit card or credit card to Apple’s Wallet app. Money-transfer services backed by a debit card will be free, while those backed by a credit card will be charged a 3-per cent fee - the same as competitors. You can transfer directly to a bank account without having to pay a service fee, though the transfer may not be immediate. When can you use Apple Pay Cash? Apple Pay Cash person-to-person payments (also called peer-to-peer payments) is coming to iOS 11 this autumn. It will be made available across all your Apple devices, like iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Where is Apple Pay Cash available? Apple Pay Cash will only be available in the US at launch. There's no word yet on UK availability. Are there Apple Pay Cash alternatives? Apple Pay Cash will go up against competing offerings from PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Square Cash, Snapchat's Snapcash feature, and popular bank services like Chase QuickPay. But unlike those competitors, Apple’s service is limited to iMessage users on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and it doesn't offer a ledger option, so you can't keep detailed memos about each transaction.

Key items to “buy” or “wait to buy” during MenuSections http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/New-iPhone-said-lacking-tech-to-match-rivals-11209657.php New iPhone said lacking tech to match rivals Policy of using multiple suppliers hurts ability to maximize data speed Ian King, Scott Moritz and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Published 8:12 pm, Friday, June 9, 2017 Verizon, AT&T and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year's crop of smartphones: thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second — speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won't be the case for Apple Inc.'s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company's most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple's suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won't be ready for the iPhone's introduction, according to people familiar with Apple's decision. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm's chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it's seeking to loosen Qualcomm's grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That's why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won't enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn't public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple's decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that's 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Drag-and-drop on the iPad is going to take some getting used to Chris Smith BGR News June 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share If there’s one thing that amazes me after all these years of being an iOS user, it’s how Apple forces me to relearn iOS every once in a while. If you’re picking up an iPhone or iPad for the first time this year, you won’t have any iOS usage history to affect your experience. Things like 3D Touch on the iPhone or drag and drop on the iPad will be included in what already appears to be a great iOS 11 experience. But if you’re a seasoned iOS user, then there are a few new tricks that’ll force you to rethink the way you’re using the iPad. A couple of short videos demoing the drag and drop feature in action on the iPad reveal the many ways this tiny feature will change interaction with the iPad – it works on iPhone too, but it really shines on the iPad. Don't Miss: Confirmed: OnePlus 5 is an iPhone 7 Plus clone Rather than going through menus to achieve certain tasks like you’d normally do on an iOS device, drag and drop will let you do it a lot quicker than ever. Just press and hold on an item and then drag it on the screen and drop it where it needs to be. The sky is the limit here, and you can do a bunch of things. A demonstration of the various ways you can drag and drop in Safari on iOS 11 /cc @mikecane pic.twitter.com/5Rg9Lqe2GL — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) June 7, 2017 Developer Steven Troughton-Smith shows in the following video various instances where drag and drop can be used, and some of them might not even come to mind if you’re already used to doing things on the iPad a certain way. For example, you can drag and drop a link to enable Split View mode and open a second Split View window. You can drop the link on the “+” icon to open it into a new toolbar. You can add the link to the Bookmarks section where you can add it in a folder or in your Reading List. The video also shows you that you can keep holding onto an item with one finger while bringing up the dock and a different app (Files in this case) with a different finger, thanks to multitouch support in drag and drop. Impressed yet? Well, another developer dragged four distinct objects with four fingers and then dropped them all in Notes. You won’t do all of that at once every time, but it’s definitely impressive. Wow. I was able drag four *different* stacks of objects with four fingers (!) on my left hand. Very, very impressive. #iOS11 cc @viticci pic.twitter.com/vvFiIiACGT — Aurélien C. (@aurelienche) June 8, 2017 Drag and drop seems genuinely impressive on a large canvas such as the iPad, and it’s definitely going to change the way you interact with the iPad.

Wall Street turned in an uneven finish Friday as investors unloaded their technology company shares in favor of energy and financial stocks. AFP file Photo Wall Street turned in an uneven finish Friday as investors unloaded their technology company shares in favor of energy and financial stocks, reports AP. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which has outpaced gains by other U.S. stock indexes this year, fell the most. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. Even with the sell-off in technology stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks closed higher, each setting new highs. "We're seeing investors rotate out of the international stocks and into the US stocks in general," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Equity Research. "And also a rotation out of technology and into energy, materials and financials." All told, the S&P 500 index fell 2.02 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,431.77. The Dow gained 89.44 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,271.97. The Nasdaq declined 113.85 points, or 1.8 percent, to 6,207.92. The Russell 2000 picked up 6.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,421.71. The indexes also closed out the week unevenly after several days of trading in a mostly narrow range. Despite the day's big tech stock slide, more stocks rose than declined on the New York Stock Exchange. US stocks were coming off a two-day winning streak, which included a record high for the Nasdaq on Thursday. They were on track to extend those gains early Friday, each at one point trading above their most recent closing highs. But then investors began to unload technology stocks. The sell-off centered on the biggest companies in the stock market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook. But the biggest decliner was chipmaker Nvidia, which lost $10.34, or 6.5 percent, to $149.60. Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell $34.16, or 3.4 percent, to $970.12, while Apple slid $6.01, or 3.9 percent, to $148.98. "It's had a good run," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "People are taking a little money off the table." The technology sector fell 2.7 percent. It remains up 18.5 per cent for the year. Traders also bid up shares in energy companies as the price of crude oil rose. Helmerich & Payne added $2.87, or 5.7 percent, to $53.27. Rig operator Transocean picked up 39 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $8.81. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 19 cents to close at $45.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 29 cents to settle at $48.15 a barrel in London. Small-company stocks were among the big gainers, receiving a boost from a stronger dollar following the British general election. A stronger dollar tends to benefit small-cap stocks, because they tend to not have as much exposure to international markets as large-cap stocks. The pound lost more than 2 cents versus the dollar after the Conservatives lost their majority in Parliament, which could send Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union, due to start June 19, into disarray. The pound weakened to $1.2724 from $1.2943. The dollar also strengthened to 110.20 yen from 109.94 yen late Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.1195 from $1.1222. Corporate deal news also led to some notable stock moves Friday. DuPont Fabros Technology jumped 9.8 per cent after the data real estate investment trust and owner of wholesale data centers was acquired by another REIT, Digital Realty Trust. The deal is an all-stock transaction valued at about $7.6 billion. DuPont Fabros Technology shares gained $5.44 to $60.80. Digital Realty slipped $3.43, or 2.9 percent, to $113.32. Pandora Media rose on news that SiriusXM will invest $480 million in the online radio company. SiriusXM, which is buying preferred stock and taking a 19 per cent stake in Pandora, will also select three people to be named to Pandora's board. Pandora is breaking off a deal with investment firm KKR from last month. Pandora added 10 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $8.52. SiriusXM slid 20 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $5.20. Several companies fell after issuing weak outlooks. VeriFone Systems shed 3.5 per cent after the maker of terminals for electronic payments cut its forecasts and said it will sell or restructure several businesses. The stock lost 64 cents to $17.68. HNI slumped 12.6 per cent after the maker of office furniture and fireplaces cut its forecasts because of slower sales and falling wholesale revenue. The stock slid $5.64 to $39.27. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield held rose to 2.20 per cent from 2.19 per cent late Thursday. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose a penny to $1.50 per gallon. Heating oil inched up 1 cent to $1.43 per gallon. Natural gas added 1 cent to $3.04 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.10 to $1,271.40 per ounce. Silver lost 19 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $17.22 per ounce. Copper gained 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.65 per pound. Germany's DAX rose 0.8 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.5 percent, while South Korea's Kospi rose 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1 percent.

He prodded Cook to manufacture his iPhones and other gear at home rather than outsource them to China. “One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants,” Trump said he told Cook. That sums up the economic vision of the Trump administration. The president and his advisers are convinced more factories can cure the trade deficits, lackluster growth, and (supposed) joblessness plaguing the U.S. economy. Trump has vowed to lure back plants that departed for cheaper locales such as China or Mexico and sanction companies that dare to leave. The result, he claims, will be investments that revitalize down-on-their-luck communities and American economic vitality. “We will bring back our jobs,” he pledged in his inauguration speech. “We will bring back our dreams.” The president, though, is plain wrong. Factories won’t restore the American dream. That’s because they don’t contribute as much to the economy as they once did, despite all the fuss politicians make over them. Chasing them with pro-factory policies will not only fail to bring the benefits Trump has promised but could also hurt the very middle-class families they’re designed to help. A die-hard conviction remains among many Americans that the more an economy manufactures, the stronger it is. Some workers feel that making steel or cars is more respectable than stacking shelves at a Gap, and the Trump administration readily agrees. Calling steel “critical to both our economy and our military,” the president signed an executive order in late April that in all likelihood will lead to curbs on imports to protect U.S. mills. Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s key economic advisers, argues that bringing factories back from foreign countries will shore up the nation’s growth and security. “One of the goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply-chain and manufacturing capability that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level,” he recently said. This strategy is based on flawed thinking. Manufacturing is certainly not as important to the U.S. economy as it once was, declining to less than 12 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 26 percent 50 years earlier. But the whole idea that “we don’t make anything,” as Trump himself has put it, is a fallacy. The U.S. remains a production powerhouse, accounting for almost 19 percent of global manufacturing, behind China’s 25 percent but bigger than Germany’s and Japan’s shares combined. U.S. manufacturers are still extremely competitive in high-tech and hard-to-duplicate products—think Boeing Co. aircraft. And even as some factory work has moved abroad, the U.S. economy remains remarkably strong. Home to many of the world’s most important and innovative companies, from Facebook Inc. to Tesla Inc., the U.S. boasts an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, less than half the euro-area level. What Trump fails to appreciate is that the true value in making something is no longer in making it. Companies figured out long ago that they can capture most of the value of a product by focusing on its design and research and development, its branding, and the services that support it after it’s been sold. Stan Shih, the founder of Taiwan’s Acer Inc., illuminated this phenomenon in the early 1990s with his “smile curve.” The middle of the smile—the lowest point of value—is where the fabrication takes place; the highest value is found at the corners—the R&D at the beginning and the customer service at the end.© AP Photo/Evan Vucci   Manufacturing is at the lowest point on a curve that plots where companies profit most That simply reflects supply and demand. The talent necessary to conceive, brand, and market a new product is much scarcer than the skills to manufacture it. The integration of giant emerging economies such as China and India into global supply chains increased the number of available hands to screw or sew things together, dropping the cost of making a product even further. There’s “a lot of supply for the actual manufacturing, but not a lot of supply for creating the next Google or Apple,” says Ann Harrison, management professor at the Wharton School and co-editor of the book The Factory-Free Economy. That disparity shows clearly in the apple of Trump’s eye: the iPhone. In a 2010 study, the Asian Development Bank Institute pulled apart an iPhone and figured that the process of assembling it in China accounted for 3.6 percent of its production cost. The remaining 96.4 percent was paid to the parts suppliers, and Apple, as the creator, claimed the big profits. Net income at Apple, which does almost no manufacturing, was an impressive 21 percent of revenue in its last fiscal year, and its shares trade at 18 times earnings. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the companies to which Apple outsources its manufacturing, recorded net profit of 3.5 percent of sales; investors value its shares at 12 times earnings. Apple also creates lots of jobs without big factories: It directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S. and plans to add thousands more. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans Based on Cook’s reaction to Trump’s nagging, he fully understands where the real profits lie. Although Cook in early May made a surprise announcement that Apple was earmarking $1 billion to invest in advanced manufacturing, the savvy CEO never said his company would build and operate factories itself. (Apple’s first investment was $200 million into Corning Inc., a supplier that makes the glass for iPhones.) Of course, more factories mean more jobs, and more jobs are always good. Studies show that workers who lose their job when a plant closes take a long-term hit to their standard of living. Unfortunately, the 21st century factory won’t create the jobs that yesterday’s did. With advancing technology in robotics and automation, a modern plant can churn out a lot more stuff with fewer workers. That’s why U.S. manufacturing output continues to swell while employment in the sector has withered. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans. There are some measures he can take to woo factories home. A corporate tax cut, for instance, might make the U.S. more attractive to some manufacturers. But to entice supply chains back en masse from China and Mexico, where it’s cheaper and more efficient to make certain things, he’d have to intervene in market forces to overturn those cost advantages—for example, by imposing taxes and tariffs on imports lofty enough to render manufacturing outside the U.S. much more expensive, as he’s already threatened to do. But whenever government tries to outmuscle the market, the result is almost always extra costs that have to be borne by the greater economy. A border tax being contemplated in a Republican tax plan could hurt shareholders, by decreasing corporate profitability and share valuations, and consumers, by hiking prices at their local Walmart or Target. That suppresses consumption, which is bad for growth and jobs. A major effort by the administration to force factories home could destroy lots of other jobs. Raising the price of imports would likely decimate the already struggling retail industry, which supports 1 of 4 American jobs, with slower sales and slimmer profits—almost certainly causing store closings and layoffs. By obsessing over factory jobs that no longer exist, Trump may cost Americans the jobs of the future. The logic of the “smile curve” suggests he should focus on developing and supporting the parts of the manufacturing process that hold the real value—in other words, fostering more Apples. That would entail upgrading the skills of the U.S. workforce by devoting more resources to education and reducing the financial burden of a college degree, while encouraging foreign talent to start their next big ventures in Silicon Valley, not Shanghai. Rather than restricting trade, Trump should press for an even freer global exchange of goods and services so U.S. corporations can best organize their operations to maximize profits. Unfortunately, he and his team aren’t headed in that direction. Describing his talk with Cook, Trump called an Apple factory in America a “real achievement for me”—not Apple, the American worker, or the economy. By rallying political support, his obsession with factories may be good for him, but it isn’t necessarily great for the rest of us.

So it is hard to imagine how we got by before the first iPhone launched just ten years ago. Getty Images 9 Having been released on June 29, 2007, the iPhone is now nearly a decade old Apple released its first version of the device on June 29, 2007. Before that phones were for making calls . . . though you could send emails on slightly advanced machines such as the Blackberry. The iPhone was hailed as “revolutionary” and “a game changer” when it was unveiled by Apple boss Steve Jobs. But we could not have known how true that would be – enabling us to take photos at any time, find directions, use the internet and access more than two million apps. 9 Comedian Russell Kane gives his thoughts on the ways the smartphones have changed life iPhones have even made mobiles’ original function — calling people — unpopular. With messaging services such as WhatsApp, a study found a quarter of smartphone users had not made a call in the past week. But they also ruined pub quizzes by enabling people to cheat, created embarrassing autocorrect spelling mistakes and exposed playing-away partners. Here, comedian Russell Kane gives his take on how the iPhone changed the world. 9 Russell Kane says chitchat is dead… but selfies are booming On the 10th anniversary iPhone, here's a compilation of some of their best adverts MOST READ IN OPINION Rod Liddle If the Tories want to win back Canterbury, they should wait until the students are off on holiday BORIS JOHNSON To all of you urging Theresa May to quit and suggesting ANOTHER election, I say get a grip TREVOR KAVANAGH Toxic Tories dump Mrs May at their peril while chirpy Corbyn anticipates the long-awaited revolution THE SUN SAYS Unless the Tories want Corbyn in Number 10 they need to stop plotting and pull together MATTHEW GOODWIN Like Blair and Cameron before her, Theresa May gambled everything and lost all ROD LIDDLE We’ve been far too indulgent of jihadi scum... we need more ‘f*** you, I’m Millwall’ THE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS In the past seven weeks Theresa May has lost many things... including her authority TONY PARSONS While Jeremy Corbyn offered the British electorate dreams he could never fulfil, Theresa May failed to offer us any THINGS CANCER MADE ME SAY I have a confession, a dirty little secret to share with you all...

Eat that, grandad. Yep, ten years of selfies, apps and holstered social media. But has the iPhone enhanced life? Or has it turned us into self-absorbed, mindless zombie bell-ends? Getty Images 9 When it was released, we never could have guessed the ways in which the iPhone would change our lives At the time it just seemed a posh new phone with a few fancy tricks. It was fun but could we have ever guessed how profoundly it would change the way we see ourselves and each other? Or the way we’d stamp on each other’s faces in queues to get the latest model? Let’s go back to 2006, in a pub. If someone said: “What’s the name of that restaurant we went to last week, Dave?” it led to conversation, a debate. Friends remembering together where Dave dangled dough balls in his mouth while Gary downed a Peroni. Getty Images 9 Friends in a pub After 2007 that changed. Why bother using your brain, when you could cowboy swivel your iPhone from your hip and simply google “Pizza, restaurant, Croydon”? Boom. You had it. Sure you were drooling a bit and the frontal lobe of your brain had lost another five per cent mass, but who cares? Things were quicker. Maps gathered in burning heaps as we walked ourselves from train station to meeting using Google Maps instead. Then the cameras started. Getty Images 9 Apple fans queue to get the latest iPhone in Tokyo Let’s not underestimate how a camera attached to a phone was an ego game-changer. Remember the old days — the 1990s and a wind-on camera. A 24 or a 36 film? Why not drop it into Boots Mum while you’re getting your shopping? No. The camera died. Now, with digital lens permanently attached to you, even the smallest moments become photo opportunities. Getty Images 9 Messaging apps like Whatsapp mean the iPhone has now even killed off the phone's original purpose Instagram plus iPhone. Together. People’s dinners became the eye-porn of others. A boring night at the local sticky-floor night club in Southend can be a faked Kanye West after-party as you add a filter and all your friends mug down the barrel pretending to be having fun just so people would “like” you and “share” your stuff. The iPhone changed us from being regular people to online stars, strutting through life. Getty Images 9 Meals have become photoshoots, with diners keen to turn their dinners into Instagram-worthy eye-porn Then the iMessage. As if boiling human banter into texting wasn’t already low enough, the iMessage (and WhatsApp) gave us the hovering bubble — the promise that a reply might come from a girlfriend or beau. The dot dot dot of the response being typed. We hang on our iPhone’s every flicker, buzz and beep. Would I give mine up? No. I’d fight you like a dog on Viagra if you even touch my phone. Getty Images 9 Many will check their phones while half-asleep as soon as they wake up Do I communicate less humanly than I did ten years ago? Certainly. The virtual is replacing the real. Long live the iPhone. But imagine, just imagine, one nostalgic day of a landline in the hallway or even just a dumb phone. Talking. Using words down a phone line. Then again, sod that, I’ve got a picture of my abs that I need to share on Twitter. Russell Kane tours the UK with his show Right Man, Wrong Age until July 2017.

Breonne Rittinger and her boyfriend, Taylor Cowan, own several pet rats, including Nibbler, in New York.  (CELESTE SLOMAN / The New York Times)   By JOHN SURICOThe New York Times Sat., June 10, 2017 NEW YORK—When Breonne Rittinger, 21, and her boyfriend, Taylor Cowan, 27, were looking for a pet last year, they considered their options. As models who travelled often, the couple wanted a pet that required less oversight. They shared an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with two other people, and one of their roommates already had two cats. A dog didn’t seem feasible. So Rittinger had an idea: rats. Now they have three. “I’ve definitely turned into a crazy rat lady,” Rittinger said while her rat Zelda stashed Cheerios in Cowan’s backpack and another rat, Nibbler, raced through an empty LaCroix box in her cage. “But I’m totally OK with that.” Article Continued Below Nibbler and her sister, Leela, arrived in January, adopted from a Staten Island family who had rescued them from a local pet store. And then, a few weeks later, came another duo, Liliu and Daisy, from a reputable “rattery” on Long Island. When Leela died in April, and Liliu soon afterward, Zelda joined the pack. Rittinger was familiar with rodents as pets, having grown up with gerbils in Georgia. But Cowan was hesitant. His previous apartment, on the Lower East Side, had been infested with rats, a problem he later attributed to the landlord. After he did some research, Cowan came around to the idea. “It was really hard to find negative things online about pet rats,” he said. Initially, Cowan said his sister was “grossed out” by the new pets, as were several of their friends. When Rittinger brought the rats to her modelling agency, two employees refused to meet them. The couple were met with a handful of baffled stares when they took their new pets to Central Park. These experiences, rat owners say, are nothing new. Rats, known for scurrying through trash heaps and nabbing pizza slices at subway stops, have long been the scourge of the city. Recent research suggests that the street rat population could be near three million. It is easy to grasp why many New Yorkers will not embrace their domestication. Rat owners say it is all a big misunderstanding. “When you say the word ‘cat,’ people automatically associate that word with a pet at home, not a feral cat on the street,” said Melissa Stewart, 34, who works in TV and film production. “Whereas, when you hear someone say ‘rat,’ they immediately think it’s feral or a street rat.” Although rare, there are stories of street rat domestication, but these rats, she said, have a much harder time finding a home. Street rats, she explained, are brown rats, which are said to be less civil and healthy, and are different from “fancy” rats, the species that most New Yorkers look to adopt. Stewart was first introduced to the idea of pet rats eight years ago at a studio party in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn, where someone told her that a rat named Minky was up for adoption. Stewart, a native New Yorker who had owned a hedgehog in college, was interested. “As soon as I got her, I was so amazed by how incredibly cool, smart and sociable they are,” she said. “They don’t bite. They’re like little dogs, mixed with a cat.” That was five rats ago. Now, Stewart is a full-fledged adoption advocate, who often finds herself explaining rat culture to co-workers. “Their initial reaction is just kind of like, ‘Really?’ ” she said. But she added that after an elevator pitch and a few photos, most become receptive to the idea. The only downside, she argued, is their life span, which on average lasts barely more than two years. This can mean heartbreak, more often. In the rat-adoption community, there is a term for a favourite rat — a “heart rat,” which Stewart considers to be her fallen furry companion, Markey. “That’s the hardest part of having a rat,” she said. “When they pass away, you’ve created these bonds with them.” Very few doctors treat rats. “Most veterinarians either don’t have the interest or treat mostly dogs and cats and, without the right exposure, often provide a disservice to these types of pets,” said Dr. Anthony Pilny, of the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine, in Manhattan, who recently owned five rats. He said this deficit of caregivers drove the community to online forums and Meetup groups, where “proud rat moms and dads” swap tips, tricks and photos. Breeds like Dumbos, known for their floppy ears, are described in detail, while new parents ask for advice: What’s their hygiene? (They clean themselves, but their tails can get dirty.) Do they need company? (Definitely.) What do they eat? (Probably not pizza.) And cohabiting with cats? (It depends.) Having that community can be comforting, owners say, as requests for rat sitters and medical questions are often met with rapid response. Forum participants encourage breeders over pet stores, which typically sell rats as feeders for snakes, while wheels in cages are also hotly debated and rat products are peer reviewed. The home craft website Etsy, it turns out, is a major source for rat hammocks, rat homes, rat sweaters and even rat costumes in the shape of pepperoni pizza slices. Rat adoption is happening in places other than New York. After using the hashtag #ratsofinstagram when she posted her photos online, Stewart connected with owners in Europe, where rat adoption groups reportedly saw an increase after the Disney movie “Ratatouille” opened in 2007. It is a sense of acceptance she hopes her hometown will one day adopt. But practically since its creation, New York has waged an endless war against rats, with some citizens even taking it upon themselves to hunt them down. In 2015, the health department invested an additional $2.9 million (U.S.) in targeting “rat reservoirs,” or areas with high concentrations, and has recently begun small-scale tests with a fertility sterilization compound. The city also offers free workshops in Rat Management Training to landlords and building superintendents. But Abigail Stringer, 13, of the Windsor Terrace neighbourhood in Brooklyn, wanted to make a clear distinction, perhaps to the classmates who teased her at school. “I’ll tell my friends about the rats,” Abigail said, “and they’ll be like: ‘Ew, rats. Where’d you get them, the subway?’ ” “These are a different breed of rats — these are fancy rats,” she continued, as her albino rat, Squeak, slinked around her neck. “They’re not the same.” At least that was the argument Abigail made to her mother, Ruth, when she used a PowerPoint presentation to pitch the idea of adopting a pet rat. She followed up her plea with articles citing their intelligence, and stories of HeroRATs, which are used to detect landmines in Angola, Cambodia and other countries. “I like to think of them as tiny dogs, that cost less and are smarter,” she said, before hiding small carrot chunks in blocks for Squeak to sniff out and eat. “He is smarter than Rascal,” her mother said about the family’s Cavalier King Charles spaniel, who lingered nearby. Abigail retorted, “Definitely.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

After a spate of terror attacks, Western leaders appear to be contemplating the sort of internet controls that Asia has become infamous for By Bhavan Jaipragas 11 Jun 2017 0 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 0Comments Armed police stand over one of three terrorists shot after an incident at London Bridge and Borough Market last weekend. Photo: AFP Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed internet giants have long been the darlings of Western governments, but these days the likes of the “GAFAs” – Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon – just cannot catch a break with officialdom on either side of the Atlantic. Fresh from battling the United States’ new immigration curbs, leading web firms are now facing accusations in Europe of inadvertently abetting terror, and the spectre of Western policymakers enacting the sort of internet regulations that Asian countries from China to Singapore have become infamous for. After the assault on London last week – Britain’s third terror attack in three months – Prime Minister Theresa May slammed internet companies for being partly responsible for providing extremist ideology “the safe space it needs to breed”. May, whose Conservative Party held onto power after a knife-edge general election on Thursday, urged “allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorist planning”. May’s comments are the clearest sign yet that Western leaders are on the verge of banding together to ratchet up control over the internet – against the wishes of the tech industry. Web policing has traditionally been frowned upon in the West and is seen as a regressive practice consigned to Asia’s less democratic societies – think China’s Great Internet Firewall, for example. In Southeast Asia, countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have routinely faced criticism for using internet laws to suppress online government critics. Is Hong Kong ready to combat global terrorism? In comparison, Hong Kong has minimal internet controls beyond laws criminalising the distribution of obscenities like child pornography. The city’s Security Bureau did not directly respond to This Week in Asia queries on whether it has demanded the take down of extremist content, but said the police requests information and cooperation from organisations including internet platforms “in accordance with relevant laws and established procedures”. “Whether in the real world or in the cyber world, anyone who commits an unlawful act shall be criminally responsible and brought to justice,” the bureau said. May and her continental counterparts like France’s Emmanuel Macron say they are not seeking new laws to browbeat online dissidents. Instead, they want specific powers that will make it compulsory for sites to immediately take down terror-related material when it appears. They also want case-by-case “backdoor” access to smartphone communication such as text messages on apps like WhatsApp. And it is not only the officials who are blaming the internet for fuelling the jihadis. Valeria Khadija Collina, the Italian mother of one of three men who went on a knife rampage near London Bridge last weekend in Britain’s most recent terror attack, said in the aftermath that her son was radicalised partly because “he had the internet and that’s where everything comes from”. London Bridge terror: What Britain has to learn from Turkey REGULATION NOT THE CURE Industry insiders acknowledge the web’s influence on the new waves of young, tech-savvy extremists, but say government regulation is not the cure to the problem. “Fighting terrorism should not translate into fighting internet freedom and security,” Andy Yen, the co-founder of the Geneva-based hack-proof email service ProtonMail, told This Week in Asia. The service, seen as one of the world’s most secure email providers, relies on end-to-end encryption technology like many other state-of-the-art web platforms including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. This means messages are scrambled while in transmission rendering them unreadable to eavesdropping government agencies. Even the service providers have no means of accessing the information. British officials have complained that this makes counterterrorism efforts harder. Under laws passed last November, they have wide-ranging surveillance powers to intercept online communications but have so far been unsuccessful in getting access to encrypted services. In the case of the March attack on the British parliament – when a terrorist drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman – investigators have been unable to access the WhatsApp messages sent by the perpetrator Khalid Masood. In a bid to justify the government’s demands, the British interior minister Amber Rudd in May compared the creation of back doors to encryption services as akin to traditional wiretapping with a legal warrant. Experts say such thinking is naive. “Calls to weaken the encryption that is used to secure the internet really represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how the internet works,” Yen said. Islamic State lone wolves: the risk in Hong Kong’s strategy Singapore-based cybersecurity expert John Ellis said “systems that implement encryption back doors would only invite attacks from a variety of cyber adversaries ranging from nation states, criminal operators and potentially cyber terrorists”. Bryce Boland, the Asia-Pacific chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said if governments forced tech firms to establish back doors to the encryption technology, “we’ll all become less secure and criminals will still find workarounds”. THOUSANDS RADICALISED ONLINE Encryption aside, other experts acknowledged the government’s complaint that extremist online content is too easily accessible. Britain’s prime minister “is correct that thousands of individuals in the West and elsewhere are radicalised because of the internet and social media,” said Steve Stalinsky, a Washington-based expert. A Google search from a Hong Kong location by This Week in Asia produced working links to last month’s edition of the Islamic State’s English-language e-magazine Rumiyah. The mobile app for the IS-linked Amar News Agency could also be downloaded, even though it is unavailable on the app stores of leading mobile operating systems. The Rumiyah edition contained a full page detailing ways for jihadis to acquire a heavy-duty truck, pick a location, and execute attacks. Since an extremist ploughed a truck into Bastille Day crowds in Nice last July, killing 84 people, there have been four vehicle-related terror attacks in Europe including the rampage at London Bridge last week that left eight people dead. In Asia, governments say foreign militants from across the region are flocking to the Philippine town of Marawi to help build a regional IS base there partly due to online calls to action by the group’s leaders on these web platforms. In a report released on June 1, the Singapore government pointed to IS “online propaganda” as one of the factors leading to rising radicalisation. Stalinsky, whose Middle East Media Research Institute archives and researches jihadist online content, said efforts by social platforms to remove such material from the web should not be understated. “Facebook has been leading the way over the past two plus years, and Twitter grudgingly joined in these efforts after lots of pressure from governments in the West,” he said. Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook this week told Bloomberg the company had been cooperating with Britain “not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks”. Facebook, which vowed to “aggressively remove terrorist content” following last week’s London assault, last month said it was adding 3,000 new employees to screen for inappropriate material on its platform. The popular encrypted text messaging app Telegram however remains errant, experts say. The Berlin-based app, developed by the exiled Russian internet guru Pavel Durov, was used by IS to claim responsibility for last week’s vehicle attack as well as the May 23 attack at a pop concert in Manchester. It is seen as superior to WhatsApp because apart from encrypted technology, data that is not scrambled is kept in infrastructure across the world, making it harder for authorities to subpoena. Has Chinese pressure forced Pakistan U-turn on anti-India terror groups “It has become the go-to platform for IS, al-Qaeda, its offshoots, and every other main jihadist organisation worldwide – from the Taliban to Hamas and Hezbollah,” Stalinsky said. The company did not respond to queries. A spokesman previously told This Week in Asia it relied on users to report “Islamic State content” before the incriminating chat groups are shut down. As governments train their eyes on the internet, there is a risk they may take their foot off the pedal in offline counterterrorism efforts, some observers say. OFFLINE RADICALISATION Peter Neumann and Shiraz Maher, two leading Britain-based counterterrorism experts, said their research showed “radicalisation rarely happens exclusively online, and the role of the internet is complex”. “The internet plays an important role in terms of disseminating information and building the brand of organisations such as IS, but it is rarely sufficient in replacing the potency and charm of a real-world recruiter,” the two researchers wrote in a BBC commentary this week, drawing on information they had gathered about some 800 Western recruits of IS. At least one of the London Bridge attackers was part of the banned extremist network al-Muhajiroun, founded by Anjem Choudary, a leading British Islamic preacher jailed last year for encouraging support of IS. Some of Choudary’s associates, including fellow British preacher Abu Haleema, the Syrian-born Omar Bakri Muhammad and the US-based imam Ahmad Musa Jebril remain free and a source of inspiration for militants. “It is one thing for the internet companies to pull down radical propaganda,” said Neumann and Maher. “But they face an uphill battle while preachers such as Choudary have spent years spreading their message virtually unchallenged on British streets.” ■ Bhavan Jaipragas recent articles Indian actor’s accent sparks debate on Singaporeans’ attitude to race 3 Jun 2017 6 Comments Amazon Prime Now: Can Singapore deliver? 27 May 2017 9 Comments Mindanao violence: Duterte’s excuse to impose martial law? 25 May 2017 3 Comments Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

ADVERTISEMENT “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.,” he added. Cook made the joke at the start of his commencement speech while praising the students for their accomplishments, and jokingly included hacking the president's Twitter. The CEO’s comments come after BuzzFeed reported that the White House was planning a meeting with Cook, as well as other tech influencers and entrepreneurs. Trump has had a tense relationship with the Silicon Valley community, which was made more complicated after his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. Cook criticized the president’s decision saying he did not think it was in the best interest of the U.S.    View the discussion thread.

In March, Costolo tweeted that Trump was a 'wimp' who 'cowers from any fight, points fingers in a loss but takes credit for any win.' 'A coward, a loser, a two-bit punk,' Costolo tweeted about Trump. Costolo was responding to a Trump tweet plugging a Fox News show hosted by Judge Jeanine Pirro. During that particular episode which Trump promoted, Pirro called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign after House Republicans failed to agree on a repeal-and-replace measure that would undo Obamacare. Costolo was CEO of Twitter from 2010 to 2015. He is currently chief executive of Chorus, a group fitness startup that was launched this past December. In early 2016, Costolo founded the company with $8million of his own money, according to Business Insider. Trump, meanwhile, has perhaps the most famous and consequential Twitter account in history. The president has credited Twitter as well as Facebook for enabling him to mount a successful campaign for the White House, according to The Verge.   Read more: Donald Trump says Facebook and Twitter ¿helped him win¿ - The Verge Tech CEOs Cook, Bezos, Catz Said to Attend Kushner-Led Summit - Bloomberg Trump Will Meet With Tech Leaders To Talk About Emerging Tech Like Drones Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo to launch Chrous fitness startup in December - Business Insider Share or comment on this article e-mail 445 shares Most watched News videos Graphic: Police fatally shoot mentally ill man holding knives Man clings onto bonnet of car driving dangerously in Germany Woman takes hit of pipe that contains 'wild tobacco' and faints Mum has meltdown after baby says 'mama' for the first time Bill Maher apologizes to Ice Cube for using the N-Word on his show Bear with me: Grizzly bear is pulled by strong waterfall stream Finnish woman live streams drinking before fatal car crash Help meow-t!: Cat treats rescue op. as playtime after car crash Man thrusts his genitals behind woman on a train in China Police arrest Todd Kohlhepp after woman is found on his property Police arrive at Todd Kohlhepp's home with a search warrant Tony Wadsworth places his hand on wife's backside during 'workout' Boris Johnson removed steel safety railings protecting...

Apple gives productivity booster shot to iPad Pro Next Story Prev Story Saturday Read more: ITworld Apple this week bolstered its claim that the iPad Pro can perform as a personal computer by announcing significant changes to iOS 11 , the mobile operating system upgrade slated to ship this fall, analysts said today. "They don't need to convince anybody, not when you look at what iOS 11 will be delivering," said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies, when asked why Apple did not restate its "iPad is a computer" message from the stage of the Worldwide Developers Conference Monday.

The Apple CEO began by saying he’d never figured out how students at the university in Cambridge pulled off their spectacular course-end pranks ― such as the placing of a propeller atop the campus’ Great Dome. “Or how you’ve obviously taken over the president’s Twitter account,” Cook added. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.” Tim Cook just dissed Trump's twitter activity SO HARD and I'm living for it— Lindsey Golden (@weare_golden) June 9, 2017 Tim Cook just threw shade at president Trump during the #MIT2017 commencement #amazing— it's xtina y'all (@xtinaashbaugh) June 9, 2017 Cook went on to deliver some serious advice to the class of 2017, and the effect that the online world may have on their lives. “The internet has enabled so much and empowered so many. But it can also be a place where the basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive,” Cook said. He encouraged students not to let “the noise knock you off course” or to “get caught up on the trivial aspects of life.” “Don’t listen to the trolls, and for God’s sake don’t become one,” Cook added. “Measure your impact on humanity not in likes, but in the lives you touch. Not in popularity, but in the people you serve.” Watch Cook’s full speech in the clip below: This article originally appeared on HuffPost.

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News TouchArcade Needs Your Help to Survive: Here's All the Ways You Can Support Us (Some for Free!) Author Eli Hodapp Posted On2017-06-10 13:15:42 News Two years ago now we launched our Patreon and since then while support from our community has been encouraging, we're still only half way to our goal to get back to firing on all cylinders. As you've likely noticed, there haven't been any new names on the site since Brad Nicholson left quite some time ago, as we're largely treading water trying to stay alive on the incredibly limited resources we have. I personally think third party editorial outlets like TouchArcade are very important to the health of online ecosystems like the App Store, and I believe we provide a significant value to our readers and iOS developers every day. All we're asking for is a value for value exchange, and if you feel you derive any value from reading TouchArcade (or anything from the TouchArcade community), please support our efforts to continue doing what we're doing. Here's all the ways you can do that: Advertising If you're an iOS developer looking to raise awareness of your game, advertising on sites like TouchArcade is a great way to reach a hyper-targeted audience of iOS gamers and industry influencers who view the site multiple times a day. We offer options ranging from sponsoring our podcast, advertising on our forums, or even completely re-skinning the site. Apple's editorial featuring games team constantly visits TouchArcade, along with (obviously) our whole staff, so having well-placed ads on a site like TouchArcade can be exponentially more effective at getting word out about your game than paying a PR person (likely way more money) to send us emails. For more information, contact our ad sales manager at ads@toucharcade.com. Supporting Us on Patreon Patreon is our primary funding source these days. If you're unfamiliar, you're able to more or less "subscribe" to creators (like us) whose content you value. We offer several different tiers of support, which grant things like cosmetic rewards on our forums, as well as access to a Patreon-only chat channel on our Discord server. All Patreon backers also get a video version of our podcast. Developers who support us on Patreon on the "Indie Developer" tier and above get access to a developer chat on on Discord for direct access to TouchArcade staff (and other developers), along with other developer-exclusive content like a business insights email newsletter, event reports, and more. We're also in the process of working with a few different highly relevant companies for exclusive discounts for Patreon backers, although nothing has been finalized just yet. Overall, a good way to look at our Patreon is to think of TouchArcade as a magazine you'd subscribe to. If you used to pick up a copy of GamePro every month for five bucks (back when magazines only cost five bucks), kick us $5 instead. We provide way more content than print magazines ever could, in an infinitely more timely manner. If you'd like to support the site for more than that because we've saved you money over the years by helping you avoid bad games or by highlighting games you wanted when they were on sale... Even better! The way we look at it is that there's nothing more valuable than time, and we work well over a full time schedule to try and save YOU time by not having to sort through the crap on the App Store. If we've provided value to you in any of these ways, please consider giving back to us with your support. Amazon Prime Members Can Subscribe to Us on Twitch for Free If you're an Amazon Prime member, you get way more benefits than fast shipping that you might not even be aware of. One of those perks is Twitch Prime. Once you link up your Amazon account with Twitch, aside from a bunch of random gaming-related freebies, you'll also be able to subscribe to one Twitch channel per month for free. We hope you use that free subscription on our Twitch channel. Something to keep in mind with these free Twitch subscriptions is they do not auto-renew. You'll need to manually re-subscribe every month, so if you'd like to go one tiny step further for us, set a recurring reminder on your iPhone's calendar to remember to do this. Subscribe on Twitch and/or Cheer with Bits If you're not an Amazon Prime member, you can still subscribe to our Twitch channel, it just costs $4.99. Something to keep in mind with this is the Twitch revenue share is 50/50, so if you just want to support the site and don't really specifically care about Twitch, your dollars go way farther over on Patreon as they take significantly smaller payment processing fees. But, hey, if you just love Twitch and want the perks that come with a subscriber, rock on. Twitch Bits Donation Another thing you can do on Twitch to help us out is cheer us with Bits. It's a new thing Twitch recently added that let you more or less "tip" the active streamer with a Twitch-exclusive currency that gets added to our account which Twitch eventually pays out on. Much like subscriptions, the revenue share on Twitch Bits isn't great, but you can get them for free if you're willing to view some ads on Twitch. Cheering is pretty fun while streaming as there's a whole lot of fanfare when Bits come in, they get added to a tip cup, and Twitch chat gets all excited. Shop on Amazon Through Our Affiliate Link If you do a lot of shopping on Amazon, visiting the easy to remember URL toucharcade.com/amazon and clicking through our link gives us credit as the referral for everything you buy. Amazon then gives us a very tiny percentage of the sale, which they'd otherwise just keep for themselves. They have widely varying commission rates, but everything (short of just buying cash gift cards) awards us something. Amazon Pantry items are among the highest commissions Amazon pays, so if buy a lot of non-perishables and other home goods on Amazon, clicking our link first would be amazing- It also helps keep the joke alive that TouchArcade is in part supported by toilet paper sales since mobile gamers spend a lot of time playing on the toilet. One-Time Contributions via PayPal One thing a lot of people have asked us for is the ability to do one-time payments via PayPal. As part of setting up everything to make our Twitch channel work, we also have a more user-friendly way to do one-time payments. Click here, fill out the form, and it'll toss you over to PayPal to complete your payment. All of your PayPal information remains confidential, so we'll really only know what you fill out on the one-time contribution page. If you want to cover PayPal fees, there's a checkbox for that too. One thing to keep in mind with this is that since this whole thing is built with Twitch in mind, it's outside of all the automated stuff we've built for Patreon. If you don't care about those rewards, rock on. Additionally, if we're streaming when you donate, it'll automatically read your note on stream. Whitelist TouchArcade on Your Ad Blockers I know this is a ultra-touchy subject for some people, but if you use an ad blocker, please whitelist the TouchArcade domain. We (to the detriment of our own success) run the site with minimal ads which are manually screened to avoid anything that spawns pop-ups, auto-plays sound, or anything else annoying. We respect our readers, and while we'd be doing tons better if we had full-screen and totally irritating interstitials, I think all that does is encourage more people to block your ads. If you just block everything because you assume all sites these days have in-your-face ads, just try whitelisting us. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. And, hell, if you really want to block our ads, just kick us a few bucks in one of these other ways and we'll be square. Tell Your Friends and/or Share Our Stories on Social Media If you love TouchArcade, but really just aren't interested in supporting the site financially, you can still do us a solid via word of mouth. If a friend of yours just got a new iPhone, recommend they check out TouchArcade to find some great games to download. Additionally, we go out of our way to produce great long-form content which typically doesn't generate that much search traffic. For instance, Shaun's amazing RPG Reload series, which I think is some of the best content we publish, are among the worst performing articles on the site. If you read something here that you find insightful, or otherwise interesting, please take a moment to encourage your friends to check it out on Twitter or Facebook. You might think one share doesn't mean much, but we can clearly tell the difference in site analytics. Thanks for Reading As always, thanks so much to everyone who has supported us over the years. You're the main reason we're still around, and we hope to keep doing what we've been doing for years to come. Hitting our original Patreon goals would allow us to hire more writers, attend more events, refresh the site, and potentially even explore options with our iOS app. We've managed to successfully fight against the tide of needing to run SEO-bait listicles, get involved in sponsored content, and all the other gnarly things web sites are doing to stay alive all because of you. Thanks everybody!

In a commencement address, Cook — who as Apple’s chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch — said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion. “Whatever you do in your life and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with,” said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. “That responsibility is immense, but so is the opportunity,” he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. “When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can impact,” he said. Cook said he is not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences,” he said. “That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead.” Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical.

Pokemon Go is an incredibly successful mobile game, complete with exciting new events and updates to keep players invested. However, its core experience largely revolves around observing Pokemon in the real world – making it easier to catch them all. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to Niantic’s latest blog post, which details how it will adopt the latest AR tech for iOS 11. “Utilizing this exciting advance in AR, we are working to create new, fun and innovative ways to place Pokémon in the world around you, to view Pokémon, and to use your phone camera to capture the moment,” Niantic wrote on its blog. “The digital world will overlay the real world in more detailed and accurate ways and you will be able to interact with Pokémon in a more immersive and life-like fashion.” The changes to Pokemon Go were teased at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California, which Niantic attended to discuss the new ARKit features for developers. It’s not entirely clear how effective Pokemon Go’s AR will behave outside of these screenshots and a tech demo, but Niantic has promised to reveal more in the coming months. Apple’s ARKit will launch with iOS 11 this fall. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores. If you click on one and make a purchase we may receive a small commission.

Home Featured Promote your Business through Apple Business Chat Promote your Business through Apple Business Chat Promote your Business through Apple Business Chat Featured NEWS Technology SHARE Carrie Ann , June 10, 2017 / 137 0 Just when you thought that Apple Inc. has covered almost all the aspects at its annual conference WWDC 2017, it comes up with a new venture. We have already witnessed the launches of various gadgets, software, and app updates. Towards the end of the much-awaited event, there was a keynote to wrap up the lavish affair. At this keynote, the tech giant announced one more feature in the iPhone. Though this feature is for the iPhone, it can be synchronized with other gadgets of Apple according to the requirement of the user. Dubbed as Apple Business Chat, this app is a fresh outlook towards textual communication for professional purposes. The latest software update by Apple was out last week, iOS 11. Along with this update came another feature available on the iPhone. All iPhone users are well-acquainted with iMessage which is a messaging portal by Apple. Through this portal, two iPhone users can exchange messages through the medium of internet. Now, one can propagate his business through an added feature on iMessage. Apple Business Chat is a gateway for customers to get in touch with the business holder and clear their queries accordingly. It is an ideal medium for customer support and to build a rapport with them as well. Dubbed as Apple Business Chat, this app is a fresh outlook towards textual communication for professional purposes. Apple Business Chat beneficial for your company The main agenda of Apple Business Chat is to help customers connect with the company they are interested in with the help of iMessage. This might turn out to be a boon for one’s company as customers can freely and conveniently contact the company and clarify whatever doubts they have. This will save money spent on hiring call representatives and helpline connections. Instead, all they need is a small team to look after the Apple accounts of the company. Through this, the company can also promote its products or services to the client. The best feature of Apple Business Chat is that it offers customer support directly from Safari. This means that if someone is viewing your company’s website through Safari, he can click on the tab for help and will be redirected to this messaging app. As this service is specifically for professional purposes, it comes at a price. One can purchase it with Apple Pay. The company can also use this app to schedule appointments and deliveries with the help of its inbuilt scheduling app. Apple assures that the conversations in this app will be human to human and will not involve chatbots.

FORGET FANG: Goldman adopts a new acronym for the most powerful tech stocks driving the market Akin Oyedele Business Insider June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos lion fangs growl teethMore (Pixabay) Forget the FANGs: Goldman Sachs has adopted a new acronym for the most powerful drivers of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. "While FANG has dominated investor focus, the nature of the acronym has expanded more broadly to encompass mega-cap tech," Robert Boroujerdi and his colleagues wrote in a note on Friday. "Indeed, the bigger story in our view is FAAMG — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — a group of five stocks which have been the key drivers of both the SPX & NDX returns year-to date." Combined, the FAAMG stocks have added $660 billion in market value this year. Screen Shot 2017 06 09 at 10.41.33 AMMore (Goldman Sachs) As with FANG, the G in FAAMG represents Google, the best-known company under the Alphabet umbrella. FAAMG also adds Apple to the list. But Goldman excluded Netflix, the N in FANG, and Nvidia, the red-hot tech stock that is up 249% in the past year, saying they are not yet large enough and are more volatile. The FAAMG stocks on the other hand are displaying lower volatility, much as the rest of the market is. As its own sector, FAAMG would have the lowest volatility in the market, Goldman says, though that could end up being a problem. "We believe low realized volatility can potentially lead people to underestimate the risks inherent in these businesses including cyclical exposure, potential regulations regarding online activity or antitrust concerns or disruption risk as they encroach into each other’s businesses," Boroujerdi wrote. Goldman expects that passive investors who are chasing a low-volatility strategy would move into the FAAMGs. "The fear is that if fundamental events cause volatility to rise, these same passive vehicles will sell and exacerbate downside volatility," the note said. Back in April, Randy Phinney at Right Side of the Chart wrote about how the FAAMG stocks were leading the Nasdaq and the rest of the market to all-time highs. He noted that FANGs got all the attention probably because the acronym was easier to say.

Digital Realty, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust and one of the world’s largest data center landlords, announced the blockbuster all-stock deal Friday, saying it had agreed to acquire DuPont Fabros for about $7.6 billion, including $1.6 billion in assumed debt. “A real game-changer,” is how Andrew Power, Digital Realty’s CFO, characterized the deal in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. “We are getting very high-quality assets in the top US markets,” he said. “It also deepens our relationship with some of these blue-chip customers: Microsoft, Apple, Salesforce, and others.” The deal significantly increases Digital’s footprint in the top-tier Northern Virginia, Chicago, and Silicon Valley data center markets. DFT has 12 data centers, with a total of 300MW of power. It also gives Digital substantial footprint in secondary markets where it has not been a major player: Toronto and Hillsboro, Oregon (about 20 miles west of Portland). Once the acquisition is closed, Digital Realty will become the largest multi-tenant data center provider in North America with 18 percent market share, knocking Equinix down from number-one to number-two with 16 percent market share, according to the market-research firm IHS Markit (click chart to enlarge): More Firepower More than anything, the acquisition gives Digital additional firepower to go after the booming market for leasing data center space to hyper-scale cloud companies, who have been spending billions upon billions of dollars to expand capacity to serve their growing customer bases and compete among themselves for market share. Total capital expenditures by Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Alibaba went from $7.2 billion in 2010 to $25.3 billion in 2016, according to an estimate by DuPont Fabros cited in a slide deck Digital Realty presented to analysts Friday. The company clearly doesn’t expect this rate of growth to decrease significantly any time soon, and DuPont Fabros has been successful in winning deals with those types of customers, signing for example a single deal for nearly 30MW total in Chicago suburbs and in Ashburn, Virginia, in the first quarter. Having inventory available or close to being available in top markets is key to winning hyper-scale deals, and the acquisition gives Digital six projects currently under construction in Ashburn, Chicago, Santa Clara, and Toronto, all due to be delivered within the next 12 months. Nearly half the space in these future facilities has been pre-leased. Besides just having product available, having more buildings per metro gives Digital the advantage of being able to provide multiple locations in a single metro to a cloud provider, Power said. To improve reliability of their services, cloud providers typically have two, three, or more physically separate cloud availability zones per metro, supplied whenever possible by different power grids, different electrical substations, and connected to different fiber networks. The latter set of factors (diverse sources of electricity and connectivity) is more important to cloud providers than being able to lease from a single provider in a metro, Jabez Tan, research director at Structure Research, said. Having a single provider in a metro is a factor they consider, but it isn’t something that will make or break a deal, he said. Microsoft, Facebook Become Digital’s Top Clients The acquisition makes Microsoft, DuPont Fabros’s largest client by annualized rent, the second-largest client in Digital Realty’s portfolio, using the data center provider’s services in 15 locations. Microsoft, the world’s second-largest cloud provider, has not had substantial presence in Digital Realty data centers, although its new subsidiary LinkedIn has been Digital’s fifth-largest client, using its services in six locations. The deal also makes Facebook Digital Realty’s third-largest customer, adding four locations to the nine Facebook has already been using Digital in. Another major brand whose presence within Digital’s footprint will expand with the acquisition is Apple, which has signed for 14MW of capacity DuPont Fabros currently has under construction in the Chicago market, Jim Kerrigan, principal at the real estate firm North American Data Centers, said. IBM will remain Digital Realty’s top client, hosting its infrastructure with Digital in 24 locations. Here’s how Digital’s top 20 clients will rank if and when the acquisition closes (click to enlarge): Source: Digital Realty Trust A Preemptive Strike? While expanded capacity and household-name customer relationships give Digital a big market advantage, the defensive aspect of the acquisition is hard to ignore. Several new heavyweight players recently entered the market, while previously existing competitors have been going after the hyper-scale deals more aggressively than before. That’s the reason Kerrigan disagrees with an assessment by some analysts that the merger between Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros would reduce competition and help balance price control in the data center market. Had the deal taken place three or four years ago, Kerrigan said, he would agree with that assessment, “but I don’t agree with it now. There’s too many new players right now.” One example is Digital Bridge, a company formed last year that has been making one acquisition after another, including most recently a deal to acquire Vantage Data Centers, one of the top hyper-scale players in the extremely tight Silicon Valley market. Digital Bridge is led by Michael Foust, founder and former CEO of Digital Realty. Another example is Iconiq Capital, a wealth-management firm that serves some of Silicon Valley’s richest tech entrepreneurs, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffman, and Napster co-founder Sean Parker. Iconiq registered a data center investment arm, Iconiq DC Management, last year and has already invested in T5 Data Centers, a wholesale data center provider. There’s also CloudHQ, a wholesale data center provider founded last year by Hossein Fateh, co-founder and former CEO of DuPont Fabros. Like DuPont, CloudHQ builds massive-scale data centers and goes after massive-scale cloud deals. Also going after hyper-scale deals is Infomart Data Centers, a company formed in 2014 as a result of a merger between Dallas Infomart and Fortune Data Centers. Infomart’s most well-known customer is LinkedIn. Existing players CyrusOne and RagingWire have been very successful in winning hyper-scale deals. Both have substantial presence in Northern Virginia; CyrusOne recently entered Chicago with acquisition of the massive CME Group data center there and started construction of a Silicon Valley campus last year; RagingWire is close to announcing entry into both Chicago and Silicon Valley markets, according to industry sources. The hyper-scale data center market is hotter than ever, and Digital Realty’s acquisition of DuPont Fabros, while making an already massive player even more massive, is not likely to cool things down. This is Digital’s third major acquisition in about two years’ time. In the fourth quarter of 2015 it closed the $1.9 billion Telx deal, entering in a big way the retail colocation and interconnection market in the US, and last year it acquired eight data centers in Europe from Equinix for $874 million, adding substantial retail and interconnection capacity across the Atlantic. The DuPont Fabros deal, expected to close in the second half of the year, solidifies Digital Realty’s position as one of the world’s top landlords for cloud giants, but that doesn’t mean cut-throat competition for hyper-scale deals will ease going forward.

Reply ↓ nowhere June 10, 2017 at 3:55 pm Eh… it’s kind of like the AppleTV not supporting 4K video support yet, there is not enough content to drive its inclusion (and with broadband caps and nationwide speeds being so variable, streaming 4K is a minuscule fraction of consumption). It’s also because they are trying to avoid vendor lock-in with only using Qualcomm chips (I’d imagine it helps to keep the price per chip down). This is the whole reason Qualcomm is suing Apple, because Apple is detuning the modems from working at their maximum speeds. I’m pretty sure if this was a major factor in the next release of the iPhone, it would be integrated. iPhone users generally refresh every 2-3 years, so when this speed actually has real-world applications, the iPhone will have the modem to take advantage.

Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 7:33 am Re: tweet storm on NI, DUP and, ok, NI in general: I am not old enough to remember the height of tension with the IRA and such, though I did study it at university. Speaking to some friends who are older/do remember and friends who have heard from their parents on the issue, many still remember — very vividly — just how bad things were. It seems things are truly in danger of slipping backwards, with the inherent problems of brexit/a fluid Irish border. This hasn’t been sufficiently publicised, as far as I can, with the focus being primarily on how homophobic the DUP is. The BBC live blog has reported Sinn Fein is concerned about the effect this deal will have on the suspended power-sharing deal. I thought the whole point of May was that she’s cautious (and yes, strong and stable — or something), but this does seem quite poorly thought through. (And of course, in all fairness, what is the alternative? I don’t think Labour could scrounge together the numbers to form a majority either.) Also, re: Ruth Davidson, it’s unsurprising. Her star has been rising in awhile (and it’s quite a treat watching her and Nicola Sturgeon spar). And at this juncture it makes sense. Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 7:44 am On NI, from Buzzfeed: Northern Ireland Politicians Say Theresa May’s Dependence On The DUP Could Damage The Peace Process https://www.buzzfeed.com/siobhanfenton/northern-ireland-politicians-say-theresa-mays-dependence-on?utm_term=.mnaMdNJBG#.nmjmWMBj6 Reply ↓ JTMcPhee June 10, 2017 at 8:36 am “The peace process”? pp, I’m not teeing off on you, it’s just that the phrase you used stuck a wrong note for me. Why does the phrase “the peace process” still get thought of and used as a “thing”? I’ve heard it for what, 60 years now? Korea “resolution of conflict,” Kissinger and Vietnam, of course “the Troubles” and The Irish Question and then the supposed standing-down of the Gun-Men on both sides of “the Line,” those charming Likudniks lying and stealing their way across the landscape, all those events and activities conducted before and behind that kick-the-can-down-the-road, hope-springs-eternal catch phrase. And one need not look very far to find “conflicts” of all genera that supposedly have been palliated if not resolved by past “peace processes,” like Europe East and West, and much of Africa, and the Indian sub-continent. Occasional lacunae with reduced violence, but always with enough collective memory and grievance, and of course weapons on tap, and “outside agitators” like our very own exceptional Empire, to so easily stir the always-simmering pot and trigger another boil-over. Out of the pot, onto the fire — why is there never quite enough spit out of the pot to actually smother and extinguish the flames, to allow the only “peace process” I have ever noted as functioning as pretended, an exhaustion of the energies of violence-as-fun-and-profit by passage of time and dying off of the raggedy old combatants and the family and tribes that drive them. Beirut: during the worst of the horrors there, the time of Sabra and Chatila, ordinary people still lived there, braved often fatal sniper fire to go out and buy bread and other necessities, and eventually things quieted down, but not permanently of course, Great Game play and Byzantine politics are always-on. And the people who live on the Emerald Isle? When, if ever, will the drivers of conflict be extinguished, how will the few who tend the fires and stoke them when the opportunity arises be turned to other more positive endeavours or disappear into the graveyards of the ancient churches? “Peace process” may be a comfortable and comforting shibboleth, but it sure looks to me like that is all it is. Reply ↓ XXYY June 10, 2017 at 11:28 am The original (and still the best!) Peace Process(tm) is of course the ongoing invasion and takeover of Palestine by Israel. The US has been facilitating this violent, ongoing effort to displace the inhabitants of Palestine and steal their land and water for many decades; this is invariably described in the US press as the “peace process in the Middle East.” There is obviously no “peace” going on here, though there is a process! Noam Chomsky occasionally quips that the “peace process” is just whatever the US is doing at the moment. Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 12:31 pm True. What term would you prefer?

Reply ↓ David June 10, 2017 at 10:05 am Well, I’m old enough to remember what it felt like in the 70s and 80s, when the government I was working for was actually much more worried about a potential Protestant backlash than about the IRA campaign, which it always reckoned (correctly) it could outlast. But if the Protestant majority ever felt they were being sold out, they had the numbers, the weapons and the sympathizers within the security establishment to create havoc on a scale that would have made the IRA campaign look like a football match by comparison. There was a real possibility of a civil war at some points, and it’s not certain that the Army and the Police could have been relied upon. Given the current political situation in the province, I just hope we are not in for a re-run. The fact that the DUP is uncomfortably close to the men with guns matters a great deal more, frankly, than their social attitudes being fifty years behind those of the Grauniad. Reply ↓ Darn June 10, 2017 at 10:56 am I’m from NI. The ability of Protestants to mount a sustained terrorist campaign is currently pitiful. The loyalist terrorist groups have not been serious since the 90s and although they occasionally still kill, they have always been unprofessionally organised compared to the IRA. This is especially true now that they are older, more rusty and more focused than ever on drugs and other gangsterism. Killing random Catholics from the phone book was never the same as taking on the armed forces of a great power. The IRA have millions to re-arm when they like, and said only its “current campaign” was over and not the war, as the government is well aware, which is to prevent NI politics ever being taken in a more unionist direction. And then men IRA members killed in 2015 were killed with automatic weapons that IRA members had kept, or bought. As for sympathisers in the security establishment, if you mean MI5 etc yes they seem to have concealed collusion and so on. Helping a new loyalist campaign is not the same. The home battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment were disbanded so that’s a potential crossover gone, the percentage of Protestants in the police has fallen and their skills too have been lost. Gerry Adams said the peace process was in danger over benefit cuts. When the Tories got their majority SF implemented them anyway; the IRA isn’t gonna come back over such stuff, or Brexit, or a DUP-supported UK govt. As for “closeness”, the DUP broke with Ulster Resistance 30 yrs ago, which no longer exists and killed no one even if their guns shipment did in the hands of other loyalists. Even SF has not suggested the DUP are close to terrorism. As for Arlene Foster meeting a UDA man, stupid, not evil, same as Jezza meeting Adams and McGuinness after the 2015 killings. (So did the Tory-appointed British ambassador to Dublin, which called those deaths “bumps in the road”) May’s hypocrisy over Corbyn vs the DUP consoles Labour losers but the fact remains JC could have got a majority if he got the DUP’s help and may need them in 2022. Reply ↓ makedoanmend June 10, 2017 at 11:36 am The idea that the DUP under its current leadership would support Labour (and indeed that Labour would want DUP support) goes beyond the realms of conjecture and into the realms of pure fantasy. You might as well say that the Tories are going to support Labour as the next UK government. And I like how you justify one group of terrorists over another: ‘Our terrorists aren’t as bad as yours.’ And again show us one verifiable piece of evidence that any organisation in Ireland has massive amounts of money stashed away beyond that asserted by a journalist who sources their statement from an unnamed and unsourced Garda. Real evidence – not conjecture – not fantasy. And Arlene recently meeting with a representative of terrorist organisation isn’t, as you say, affiliation. It’s much closer. It’s actual communication. Oh, and being from somewhere does not make one an authority. Reply ↓ Darn June 10, 2017 at 2:36 pm Being from somewhere? You said “I live in Scotland” on another thread! It doesn’t go beyond the realm of conjecture — they kept the possibility of deals with any party open in 2015 and emphasised it during the campaign and in their literature. “More Votes. More Seats. More Influence. More for Northern Ireland”. Similar to the SNP saying more seats = more power for Scotland. The difference was the DUP didn’t say they would lock the Tories out of Downing Street. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32479185 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31045870 I have not justified any group of terrorists in any way and you should withdraw that remark. I said I believed loyalists have poor CAPABILITY to carry out attacks compared to the PIRA, today. David said in the 70s and 80s Prods would have been able to “create havoc on a scale that would have made the IRA campaign look like a football match”. That is no longer true. “ANY organisation”? Hohoho! You do realise the IRA and others raised money for 40 years? So there isn’t fuel laundering and cigarette smuggling on a large scale? There is no Criminal Assets Bureau and Asset Recovery Agency to deal with it? Money isn’t raised by “any” of the terrorist groups in this list because they would only kill and not steal? (About 34 killed by loyalists since 2002, and 27 by republicans) http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/deathsfrom2002draft.htm Communication is not “closer” than affiliation. Ask Jezza, meeting SF after 2 murders by IRA men. It does not show he supports the IRA, it just makes for an embarrassing photo op. (The DUP has communicated around a Cabinet table with SF Ministers who are IRA members for ten years now.) Likewise meeting a UDA man is not evidence of support for the UDA. This is not hard to understand. Neither Corbyn nor Foster should have done these things if they didn’t want to be criticised. Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 12:27 pm To Darn as well: it’s very good to hear from those with actual experience of those times — for me, everything is second-hand. I hope this isn’t a re-run either. A re-run + Brexit + general Parliamentary chaos = recipe for disaster. As though one isn’t enough! And even if it isn’t a re-run in the sense of violence, increasing polarisation in what seems to be a fragile situation is quite unappetising. Also, the DUP said they were supporting the Tories in part to keep Labour out. And unfortunately, short of Tories defecting, Jezza just can’t make the numbers. Reply ↓ Darn June 10, 2017 at 2:40 pm Yes purplepencils the polarisation in NI is bad but was already happening in the Assembly elections. And indeed has been ongoing since 2005 when the DUP and SF became the biggest two parties. Each community wants to drive the hardest bargain. T Yes the DUP wants to keep Jezza out, I’m very sad he could not win them over by coming out more clearly and early against the IRA. The massive Tory use of the issue makes it even harder for them to be seen to go along with him because of their constituents. And he needed to prevent losing votes over it in GB in any case. Reply ↓ makedoanmend June 10, 2017 at 3:49 pm to purplepencils: Time can only tell how things will play out in the six counties. I’m hoping for the best, but Tory/DUP (as natural allies) marriage doesn’t bode well for the short and medium term. Of course polarisation is the foundation of the original six county state and time nor the peace process has not fundamentally altered that status unfortunately. I read somewhere before Martin McGuinness (Sinn Fein) died that he stated that the current UK government really didn’t understand or didn’t care to understand about the current dynamics in the six counties. (I’ll try and ferret out the article.) This is a fairly serious statement given that McGuinness, as Deputy First Minister, has worked with Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and, indeed, Arlene Foster; although the latter relationship was fraught to say the least and the assembly brought down over their differences. As for the contention that somehow Corbyn’s stance on the troubles cost him the election, well, I let everyone make up their own minds. Former deputy chairman of the Tory Party, Michael Ashcroft: “… surveyed over 14,000 people on election day who had already cast their vote to help understand how this unexpected result came about…” The five biggest issues for the Aggregate UK electorate were: 1. Brexit – 28% 2. NHS – 17% 3. Economy – 8% 4. Right leadership – 8% 5. Immigration 6% The five biggest issues for the Tory UK electorate were: 1. Brexit – 48% 2. Right Leadership – 13% 3. Economy – 11% 4. Immigration 9% 5. Terrorism/security – 7% The five biggest issues for the Labour UK electorate were: 1. NHS – 33% 2. Spending cuts – 11% 3. Brexit – 8% 4. Poverty – 7% 5. Economy/jobs 6% Only the Tory electorate mention security in their top five and nowhere in the 161 page report is Corbyn’s past considered a prime issue. Maybe the researchers didn’t think it warranted a mention? (Strangely enough on p. 41 where the security question is broken down by demographics only 3% aged 65+ registered it as a concern – strange because the Tory voter tends to be older.) http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2017/06/result-happen-post-vote-survey/ (Note he has an entire PDF of his data findings that can be downloaded) As for the supposition of the DUP supporting the Labour Party in government? Well, it would be somewhat like US Tea party candidates demanding that Hillary Clinton become President. On the other hand, I just can’t imagine any instance when Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour party would remotely consider any dalliance with the DUP. best regards Reply ↓ Darn June 10, 2017 at 4:10 pm Wise up. What the Tories say about Jezza’s past costs him points on both “right leadership” and “terrorism/security”. The video would not have been shared 1 million times if ppl weren’t interested. The campaign wouldn’t have complained if it wasn’t a worry. I have another post to you, on Labour+DUP possibilities which is stuck in moderation presumably due to a lot of links. For now, let me say the party’s 2015 stance of not extending gay marriage to NI (unlike civil partnerships which Labour passed for the whole UK and started in NI a day early) seemed to be in case Miliband needed DUP support in a hung parliament. Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 5:17 pm Not sure about Jezza, but it seems the DUP already thought this through, in anticipation of having to deal with either Miliband or Cameron in the event of a hung election. Reply ↓ Darn June 11, 2017 at 12:47 pm Yes I think that’s exactly right, because if Jezza realised DUP MPs can affect the result he would have dealt with the IRA accusation clearly and early. DUP seem to have expected Tory victory this time though because unlike the 2015 campaign they didn’t talk about a hung parliament all the time.

It was the end to a fairly long ceasefire, a ceasefire that ended due in no small part to complete intransigence and an unwillingness to participate in the political process (I’m simplifying things a bit, but when I read about the constitutional crisis in NI, shades of the Troubles immediately come to mind). London has experienced three terrorist attacks in short succession, do we really want to add IRA/Unionist shenanigans back into the mix? The Good Friday accords only came about because people were willing to set aside their grudges and embrace a vision of the future, uneasy as it was. Playing with people’s hopes like this, in the current geopolitical environment, is likely to lead not just to despair, but to carnage.

Reply ↓ Another Anon June 11, 2017 at 5:54 am Yves, This was exactly the strategy of the ANC. Mandela wrote in his autobiography that they tried to avoid just killing people because they would have to live with the white population in the future. On the other hand, blowing up infrastructure was good in getting attention and blowing up the electrical grid on a hot day was one way of making wealthy people uncomfortable.

This was done, of course, out of the public earshot. And — mirabile dictu! — it seems to be the only detail the intelligence community and plugged-in Democrats have resisted leaking to the media. ============================================ So much for me not commenting – I saw “mirablile dictu” and I couldn’t help noting it. The posting yesterday about Cardinal Richelieu from Fabius Maximus seems pertinent: “That was how Cardinal Richelieu was said to have put it nearly 400 years ago. “Let me have six lines from the hand of the most honorable of men, and I will find therein wherewith to hang him.” Well, I don’t think Comey is all that DIShonorable or that Trump is all that honorable, but it certainly is a good example of finding (publishing) what you want and not finding (publishing) what you don’t want. On an entirely unrelated matter, for those who think government can never do anything right***, I am probably alive right now because even in a relatively small city like Paso Robles we have expensive trucks, filled with high tech equipment, and staffed by highly trained and professional paramedics and firefighters who reached me in a medical emergency within …at most, a minute (well, staying at a downtown motel helped).

It reminds me a bit of our unlamented ex-mayor Boris Johnson’s decision a few years back to close something like a third of London’s fire stations. The rationale was: “1. We have a “target” for the “acceptable” number of fire-related deaths per year. 2. The Fire Brigade has consistently “beaten” that target (i.e. allowed fewer people die). 3. Ergo, the firefighters have overshot the mark! It’s too easy for them; too few fire deaths means firefighters are underworked, understressed and overequipped. So fire them! (so to speak) and let them go and work in private security contracting where they’re really needed.

(“Arrrgghh 2.0”) Reply ↓ JTMcPhee June 10, 2017 at 8:56 am The seas are plied already by a whole bunch of functionally self-navigating behemoths. I helped deliver a 38-foot sailboat from Hawaii to San Fran in the mid-’80s. We encountered over 100 ships during the 19-day voyage. We radioed every one of them to let them know our little boat was in their water. We got a response from less than a quarter of them, and those responses included people who barely spoke English, who were by their voices half-asleep, and a couple were willing to discuss their technological resources, to say that radar was set to a “watch” function and that even when they powered it up, they could not see us for the “sea clutter.” And also offered that Otto the Autopilot was actually performing the steering function, to drive the vessel along the Great Circle cheapest shortest route from port to port. The most encounters were as we were crossing ‘shipping lanes” like the route between Long Beach and Yokohama, I recall it was 8 ships going up and down the course with loads of slick Japanese automobiles and trucks for the “US Market.” This along a stretch of our route of maybe 20 miles, over 6 or 8 hours as we sailed slowly along. Those vessels were already largely autonomous as to course-keeping and power settings and such. These vessels already had minimal crew, under the “regulations” set by flag-of-convenience, race-to-the-bottom nations. And quite a few mopes who dare to set sail on small boats to go see the world via the “free oceans” have been run down, to die or survive with their horror stories of deprivation and thirst. While the Great Beasts of Trade lumber along, unheeding and careless, as they plow those huge long furrows across the seas. And of course the reduction in crew to zero is just a small step for mankind, and the automation in all aspects of shipping proceeds apace. To what end? Wait, wait, don;t tell me!… And of course losses to pirates are just priced into the “goods” (sic) we mopes just have to have, made in other race-to-the-bottom places where our political economy has been migrated to… Reply ↓ purplepencils June 10, 2017 at 8:21 am And Theresa May loses at least one aide: Nick Timothy resigns.

There is a great deal of outrage and vitriol against the two chiefs of staff. To some extent, this may be viewed as scape-goating, but there has actually been a lot of unhappiness about how the two have managed Downing St, conversations about policy and access to May herself. Presumably they were behind the replacement of 5 perm secs when May came to power. The Torygraph (see article on Ruth Davidson) also reports that Fiona Hill (of the [censored] off berating) tried to manhandle the Scottish Tories. Fiona Hill was also the aide involved in the spat with Michael Gove a few years back. So this isn’t new; the unhappiness has been there. But it seems wrong to place so much of the blame on them as well. May has a brain. She should use it. She’s the leader. She should lead.

And that doctors experienced with systems such as tri-care/ VA would be best. Recruiting nurses would probably be best of all if for no other reason the Drs are accustomed to much higher income than public office pays.

Reply ↓ JTMcPhee June 10, 2017 at 9:13 am Remember that nurses were viciously excluded from the Obama-gamed “health care legislation drafting.” Gee, I wonder why? Maybe cuz they collectively know all the warts and lesions and deformities on the corpus of “The World’s Greatest Medical System?” And were interested primarily in providing actual needed health care and health promotion to the mopes? I second the notion re having nurses drive the health-care bus, with the caveat that nurses are human, all too human, too. And subject to subornation and distraction and deflection and self-interest. Less so than maybe the run of physicians, which cadre also still includes some very decent and caring people, but then there’s the others… But having worked as a male in the “estrogen-enriched environment” of many nursing settings, I can aver that there’s a reason that my Continuing Education includes segments on “failures of cooperative nursing” and “bullying in the workplace” as admonitions seeking to palliate some pretty obnoxious aspects of punching out and kicking down that are part of the panoply of “nursing behaviors.” That said, the National Nurses Association, I believe, is one of the primary drivers of “single payer,” and the players in that group are well versed in the ins and outs of the political game. I would also note that the NNA is only for RNs, which excludes about half of all nurses, us lowly folks who only have the “licensed practical nurse” credential and maybe a bunch of specialty certifications that add up to the same skill level and scope of practice as the RNs, just those with the vaunted RN plus all those extra degrees and certifications that many nurses insist on appending to their signature blocks… Reply ↓ Anon June 10, 2017 at 9:37 am Democrats: Where appearing to fight for a thing is better than actually achieving it.

It might be similar to the Scottish Labour Party, which is part of, but semi-independent of the main Labour Party. In reality, it would mean giving themselves the power to tell London to stuff it if they don’t like what they are being told to do. The interesting wrinkle in all this is that Davidson is a lesbian in a relationship with a catholic from the Republic of Ireland. The Conservatives new bride in London, the DUP, are unreformed old school homophobes. Davidson, in addition to other more liberal sections of the Conservatives may well seek to completely disassociate themselves from the government if the DUP seek to stifle equality legislation – although I suspect the DUP will be too politically canny to push that issue.

But there’s more: There are two other reasons why a southern move is not on the cards. Firstly, Davidson has settled in Edinburgh with her partner, Jen. As she said in a newspaper article last week, she left Glasgow to go to Edinburgh for love. That is not to say Davidson is not eyeing up a move. She is. But here’s the problem for the Tories in England who want her in their team. The move she’s eyeing up is not to Downing Street. It is to Bute House, the residence of the First Minister of Scotland.

The purpose of provoking the Japanese attack was to convince the US populace to agree to enter WW2. IIRC the reason that was so desirable to TPTB was economic. A close family member knew about the coming attack weeks in advance–a tenant who was a journalist received a telegram posting them to leave immediately for Hawaii to cover the upcoming attack. The tenant showed the telegram to my family member, who never forget it. The Pearl Harbor attack–both US provocation and US foreknowledge of the specifics–has been documented by numerous historians. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 10, 2017 at 9:43 am Nuclear Regulators’ Flawed Analysis Leaves Millions at Risk From Radioactive Fires The headline is typically alarmist, but the article does a fairly balanced job of pointing out the kind of risks that come from standard operating practice in regulation of the US nuclear industry. As many will know, one of the biggest public threats after the Fukushima reactor meltdowns and explosions was a spent fuel pool that was in danger of drying up or collapsing. This would have lead to a hugely radioactive fire that could have displaced 25% of Japan’s population and forced evacuation of Tokyo. The practice of putting as many spent fuel rods as possible into the same pool, and leaving them there for many years, is common in the US. It also greatly increases the risk and intensity of any radiation release from such a fire. Now it seems the regulators take a very economic view of this situation. From the piece: The NRC adopted a number of safety upgrades after the Fukushima disaster but rejected a measure to end dense packing of the 90 spent fuel pools located at nuclear plants across the US – a technique utilities use to reduce storage costs. […] Under the NRC’s current rules (which the authors point out are self-imposed), the potential backfit for the storage problem — moving the spent fuel from the pools to air-cooled dry storage casks after a few years — could be adopted only if 1) the monetary value of the resulting public risk reduction were to exceed the cost of implementation and 2) the increase in safety were “substantial.” The estimated cost of transferring the spent fuel to dry cask storage is $5 billion, about $50 million for each of the nation’s 100 reactors. Point 2) is reasonable, but 1) raises the question “What is the monetary value of the resulting public risk reduction?” How does one quantify the cost of deaths, displacement and suffering? Perhaps some of the economists here can comment on standard approaches to this. To continue: The NRC’s analysis assumed the chance of a fire resulting in a large release of radioactive pollution would be small, though with considerable uncertainty. Its risk analysis also failed to account for a possible terrorist attack and made other assumptions that minimized the estimated health and economic consequences of a high-density fuel pool fire. For example, it ignored accident consequences beyond 50 miles and assumed radiation dose standards for population relocation that were less restrictive than those recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the NRC overlooked the societal risks of accidents such as the psychological trauma of mass relocation. Forget psychological trauma, in Japan there were more than 1500 deaths directly attributed to the forced relocations – mostly old people who died in temporary shelters after being uprooted, as well as heart attacks, accidents, and suicide victims. Yet in determining whether the benefit from risk reduction is justified, the NRC essentially ignores these aspects. Under the current administration, protection of public health and the environment is a non-priority. The $5B costs of moving to dry cask storage is another hidden cost of nuclear energy that nuclear advocates want to keep hidden. Perhaps some tech billionaire will get concerned about this, as fallout doesn’t discriminate, otherwise nothing is likely to change. Indeed, it will probably be “fixed” by raising the EPA acceptable radiation dose standards to validate the NRC’s approach. Reply ↓ Grumpy Engineer June 10, 2017 at 11:36 am The EPA estimates the “statistical value of a human life” at $7.4 million dollars in 2006 dollars (per https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation), which effectively serves as their cut-off number on whether or not environmental regulations are worth the cost. If regulatory costs exceed this number per life saved, then the increase in poverty caused by the compliance costs is presumed to do more harm that the cleaned-up environment would help. If you buy into this thinking, a cost of $5 billion could only be justified if it would save 676 lives. Given that Fukushima killed 1500 people and Chernobyl even more, it seems pretty easy to justify the effort even with this rather cold-hearted math. Don’t blame the nuclear power people, though. Between 1983 and 2014, nuclear power operators paid nearly $31 billion to the federal government through the “Nuclear Waste Fund Fee” (https://www.eenews.net/stories/1059999730), which was supposed to be used for a permanent repository to hold their nuclear waste. The government never lived up to its obligation (the Obama administration killed funding for Yucca Mountain in 2009) and kept the waste fund fees anyway. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 10, 2017 at 12:12 pm Was that based on junk science for the EPA to arrive at the $7.4 million per human life? How much for a cat then?

What’s really overwhelming everything is not corporate buybacks and rich individuals buying stocks, but Central Banks buying assets: Today BofA’s Michael Hartnett provides an update on this number: he writes that central bank balance sheets have now grown to a record $15.1 trillion, up from $14.6 trillion in late April, and says that “central banks have bought a record $1.5 trillion in assets YTD.” That’s at the end of April, which works out to a run rate of almost $400 billion per month or $4.8 trillion projected for 2017. It is important to note that this kind of market buying activity has never happened before, except during the financial crisis, yet we told there is no crisis today and everything is fine. Today’s “policy” completely insulates the markets from price discovery since these central banks will never sell their assets. It is also the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind as central banks buy these assets from already wealthy individuals and corporations while driving prices higher. No wonder El-Erain doesn’t want to mention it. The financial community, of which El-Erian is a big part of, also continues to avoid any mention of this phenomena. Besides making their job of reading and predicting the market obsolete, this policy is destroying the pubic wealth of nations around the globe in a last gasp orgy of profiteering. No wonder it’s not discussed. This policy is now hard-wired into the system. Talk of tapering is a joke occasionally whispered to maintain a shred of credibility.

Do those wealth entities get wealth by selling, with the central banks buying, their best assets? Or do they only sell junk? “Driving prices higher” – those wealth entities would have to pay higher, after selling, due to ‘prices being driven higher,’ if they have to buy again (like a working class worker would after selling his/her only home…but these wealthy entities are not working class workers owing only one asset). Unless, it’s the stuff they don’t want, or stuff they borrow on short term loans they have to pay off…while still keeping their valuable assets. In the meanwhile, due to the ‘greatest transfer of wealth,’ those with homes keep up or even race ahead, while those without, typically the young (unless they will inherit their parents’ homes, up to the allowed limit) fall further behind.

Click through to read the whole thing. Important. There is huge scope here for the new government to be attacked over this by Labour. Over the years I’ve noted how the entire UK media do its best not to report anything about Northern Ireland, unless it involves the IRA. Theresa May of course made a big deal of Corbyn’s supposed IRA connections. But now she is sharing government with a party full of creationists and climate deniers and homophobes, the leader of which in just the last month had meetings with the UDA, an organisation listed as a terrorist in British law. But I’m pretty sure that if you asked the average person on the street in England or Wales (possibly not in Scotland), who Arlene Foster is, and what the DUP is, and you’d either get a blank look or a casual description of them being Irish politicians. But I strongly suspect that the general omertà in the UK media about reporting NI accurately will apply. And of course they will continue the unspoken rule that only nationalists and catholics can be terrorists, unionists/loyalists may be ‘thugs’, but they are never terrorists, no matter how many they kill (and unlike the IRA, they are still regularly killing people in their internal feuds). So they can conveniently overlook the association of the DUP with sectarian killers. The Brexit aspect is also quite interesting – the DUP have a very different perspective on Brexit, primarily because many of their supporters know they will be hit very hard by a closed Irish border. This will add yet another layer of complexity. The Conservatives (and their media) have probably not gotten their heads fully around this, but they have found themselves in bed with some very unpleasant partners. No doubt they will patronise them at first, but they may well find that the DUP have some nasty surprises. Reply ↓ Darn June 10, 2017 at 12:12 pm I’m from NI and you are completely wrong about the media, esp broadcast media, calling loyalists thugs but republicans terrorists. I include the national UK broadcasters as well as BBC NI, UTV etc. The DUP’s association with loyalists is exactly this: they set up Ulster Resistance, then quit it. Perhaps after they had acquired their guns, which other loyalists then used. Foster meeting a UDA man isn’t support for loyalist violence any more than JC meeting Adams and McGuinness in the wake of 2 killings in 2015 is support for those. May is a hypocrite over terorrism; the DUP do not support terrorism. Both these things are true at the same time. For “regularly kill” let us consult an academic source. Republican terrorists have killed about 27 people since 2002, and loyalist terrorists have killed about 34 since then. Davison and McGuigan are believed to have been killed by IRA men acting without authority of the leadership. http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/deathsfrom2002draft.htm Reply ↓ LT June 10, 2017 at 11:17 am Re: Theresa May Dear “Dis.

India’s caste system, I suspect, isn’t unique to India, and goes all the way back into our deepest past. It, and the evidence from primatology, is the reason I seriously doubt the “and then farming came along and with it specialization and inequality” hypothesis, as well as the “Capitalism did it” explanation of class. In Attenbourough’s recent Planet Earth doc, there’s a scene in which an adolecent upper class female monkey (Hanuman’s langur maybe, don’t think it was a macaque) literally takes food right from out of the mouth of an adult lower class female. The old gal clenches her teeth and tightens her cheeks, but makes no other effort to resist. Just horrifying to think of the analogies. Class violence is as old as we are.

Corbyn did, and his message resonated with voters. ▪ UK general elections differ from the US in that money to politicians for election is legally limited in the UK, particularly during the final weeks before the election.

Supposedly, one reason was rejection of May’s hard Brexit stance. OTOH, Corbyn was successful campaigning on progressive issues. But as I understand it, one of the biggest issues boiling up among the common populace is the influx of immigrants who are depressing wages. So how does Corbyn propose to navigate (or even cancel) Brexit but still either a) limit the influx of immigrants or b) improve the economic status of the great masses? Or am I misunderstanding something about Corbyn’s plans? Reply ↓ LT June 10, 2017 at 1:35 pm You’ll see even more campaigning in Europe, because there will be even more elections.

Its traditionally called scapegoating and tends to work when a better alternative is not offered. “Make America Great” versus “I’m with her.” At some point, voters will pick a candidate they think will offer solutions or not vote for a lesser of two evils candidate at a sufficient rate for the “lesser evil” candidate to win.

Reply ↓ Jess June 10, 2017 at 4:20 pm Looks like I phrased my question wrong. How does Corbyn engineer a “soft” Brexit, retaining the economic treaty benefits but getting loose of the immigration/free flow of labor aspects of the EU? Or, if he abandons Brexit, and gets the majority of the country to agree, how does he solve the free flow of labor issue? Because it seems to me like trying to turn around from the neoliberal order and restoring domestically beneficial economic policies is going to be hard enough without having a constant influx of immigrants adding to the labor/welfare/social services pool. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 11, 2017 at 2:46 am Why would it be Corbyn/Labour that “engineers” a soft Brexit, rather than pressures, including Tories, opposed to May’s hard Brexit? Brexit is now May’s mess to deal with, and she has chosen that fate by not resigning. She has lost her mandate for a hard Brexit, and is now outnumbered by the forces that want to remain in the single market, which include the DUP on whom she relies. She can’t simply ram a hard Brexit deal through parliament, though she may try to sabotage a deal with the EU. But if she doesn’t compromise on Brexit, she will destroy the Tories. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 11, 2017 at 3:36 am thanks, NTG, believe it or not that’s actually a much more concise way of saying a lot of what I meant below. Where we may — or may not? — disagree is that I think all selective immigration control is racist in practice, and that practical racism is much more important than personal sentiments. A faultline cynically manipulated by the “conservatives in center left drag” who implement an onslaught of practically racist policy while vilifying a lot of people who are “looking for solutions” for an imputed racism that’s actually their (i.e. the center left conservatives'”) own. The shorthand for this phenomenon is “David Goodhart”, the “Center left” think tanker who denies the importance of “looking for solutions” — because working class people are only capable of “tribal” sentiment, he imagines — and is now effectively puppeteer-in-chief of White Identity Politics. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 11, 2017 at 2:28 am I don’t think he sees a problem, because apparently he’s aware that: 1. we “immigrants” are part of “the great masses”. 2. among the people actually responsible for depressing wages, there are indeed a few immigrants (Boris Johnson, Mark Carney, Lakshmi Mittal, Xavier Rolet…), but most are either “homegrown” makers of state and corporate policy (legislators, “non-political” administrators, CEOs, consultants, academics middle managers, gangmasters…) or are “settled” far away and exercise their influence from other continents (“foreign” legislators, “non-political” administrators, CEOs, consultants, academics…). 3. fear of “cultural” contamination (i.e., more succinctly, racism) is a big deal among the the proprietors of those parts of England (specifically) that immigrants never even visit (because: why would we? And: do you think we would be made welcome?), but those creatures are not exactly Corbyn’s target demographic. Separately, a lot of working and outright impoverished people also in low-immigration areas do indeed suspect that immigration, rather than the global division of labour and its vicious application in UK policy since c.1978, is the direct cause of the ruin of their lives. And unlike the Milibands, Blunketts and Straws of the world who encourage this misconception while insulting those who hold it, Corbyn and the low-powered, pillow-soft left milieu he comes from have enough common respect for “ordinary” people to disagree with them face-to-face about the causes while agreeing about the effects. 4. Meanwhile, in high-immigration areas (note: NOT those plantations or building sites to which a gangmaster may briefly ship a load of semi-indentured workers) — eg. London apart from a few rich semi-urban outposts of the “Home Counties” and/or UAE, plus much of Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, Leicester, Manchester, Glasgow — millions of cosmopolitan, metropolitan workers are way too pragmatic to mistake their/our neighbours for the source of our problems: there’s too much obvious evidence of where the problems really come from (landlords, government, councils, employers, private utilities, police…), along with the evidence that the problems are exactly the same for neighbours of different “national” origin. None of which implies some paradise of non-racism in those cities, far from it; but the shared everyday life of the “mixed” (if you presuppose that “nationality” is real) urban proletariat has done infinitely more to undermine racist presumption and tradition than several decades of virtuous posturing and scolding by the same upper-middle-class anglo-English elites who straight-facedly try to instruct their inferiors in”anti-racism” and “British Values” at the same time. 5. Metro-proletarian workers (by which I do mean all degrees of desperation, not just odd hybrids of desperation, haphazard under/over-employment and over-self-education like me and my immediate friends) also tend pragmatically to see that if our wages/conditions/forlorn hopes of housing are “depressed” by “competition”, the problem is likely to be competition as such rather than the legal nationality of the unwilling competitors. Being surrounded by people from all over the world, we even often remember that “they” might just as easily “take our jobs away” without ever leaving their “home” countries! Nor does an abstract head count of population usually seem a greater threat than the HR manager, the dole office inquisitor or the bailiff at the door. That’s why we don’t, under normal circumstances, protest outside maternity hospitals or celebrate at funerals.

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 10, 2017 at 4:19 pm Our world is defined by the people, things and events we know in our lives. When some pass on, a little bit of the world diminishes. And you get to be really old, and very few people you know still live, and your way of life when you grew up no longer exists, perhaps to get in touch with another person is completely different (if it is better, that one thing; but if it’s crappified, that’s another), you are less incentivized to hang on. Reply ↓ jawbone June 10, 2017 at 4:17 pm WNYC reporters’ discussion of Christopher Wray’s involvement as Christie’s personal attorney concerning Bridgegate. Wray was Christie’s “secret” attorney who had his own secret during the investigation, as in hiding Christie’s phone. Wray held on to Christie’s phone, which had records of text messages during some the crucial hours of Bridgegate, until after a judge ruled that the phone did not need to be turned over to prosecutors or defense attorneys for those actually charged with crimes of Bridgegate. And this is who will run the FBI? Now, I don’t know whether it’s legal for an atty to withhold evidence, but it sure seems unethical to me. But I’m not part of the Jersey Gangs. However, it seems to be something done by the “best” of the higher officials at DOJ and the FBI. So that may mean Wray does have “impeccable credentials.” Other interesting sides to Christie’s ethics and appointments discussed. http://www.wnyc.org/story/week-politics-christies-bridgegate-lawyer-trumps-pick Audio, so far — not sure transcript will be available.

A few decades ago, when sanitation was not well understood with regard to tofu making, part of a Chinese village was lost before they figured out what the problem was with their equipment. Before then, Japan went thru a learning experience post war, when apparently, traditional word of mouth knowledge was lost. Today, there can be the same problem with active probiotic cultured milk products. That makes me a tad nervous. Then you can have salmonella or E Coli on your bean sprouts.

Hot Topics: Ironman Boulder Dead & Company Chautauqua concert noise Stashlogix under fire Yellow Deli faces eviction News tips Print   Email   Font Resize What's With All These Voice Speakers? By Dave Taylor For the Camera Posted:   06/10/2017 09:21:46 AM MDT Dave Taylor For the Camera Q: I saw that Apple just released a new voice-activated music speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo product. What's the deal with these speakers and should I get one? A: If you're like me, you've spent years fiddling with a tuning dial, selecting a favorite CD or two from your collection or, more recently, tapping on a device to figure out what playlist or streaming channel you want to hear. Speaker selection has always been about sound quality, convenience and price, but they've always been at the "end of a wire,"sitting there without any functionality beyond playing the music pushed to them. Imagine instead that as you walk into a room you could say "Hello room! Please play some Mozart!" or "shuffle Beats Antique" or even "play mellow jazz." That's exactly what all these voice-activated audio devices can do, and there are more of them than you think. The segment leader is the Amazon Echo with its three options of the tiny Dot, the wireless Tap and the flagship Echo itself, just a bit bigger than an Arizona Tea can. Google has a product of its own called Google Home and its great benefit is that it understands Chromecast so it can interact with my TV and stereo system wirelessly. In fact "Hey Google, play music videos on Vizio tv" works just fine, even turning on my Chromecast-enabled television in the process. Advertisement Apple introduced a new unit last week that competes in the same space, though the company is quick to highlight that they see it more as competition with higher end audio systems like the Sonos multi-room music system. Built around Siri, the HomePod is a fat, squat speaker (unlike its slimmer competitors) and is reputed to have considerably better sound. Which is important, because it comes with a premium price tag too: About $400 compared to $50-$150 for the Amazon product line and $100 for the Google Home device. At the end of the day, however, it's all about the music and the additional features. Each connects to various smart home devices, though, predictably, your smart thermostat, garage door opener and lights are generally compatible with one, not all. None of the devices support a separate subwoofer but they all have quite acceptable sound reproduction, and if you're a fan of Pandora, Spotify or similar streaming services, they're ready to go and fantastically easy to work with. With your own music it's a bit more tricky, and that might be where Apple will have the edge with many people already converting their CDs into iTunes tracks. It's a brave new world and these devices are really great if you're used to tuning and tapping to get your favorite music. It's a revolutionary way to enjoy much more music, whatever your genre preferences, and that's a win in my book. ------ Dave Taylor has been involved with the online world since before the creation of the Internet and runs the popularAsk Dave Taylor — http://www.askdavetaylor.com/ — tech review and how-to site.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) lost $6.47 (4.2%) over the course of the week, but not for lack of trying. Also most of this loss came in Friday’s session. Despite this loss, the iPhone giant remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 28.6% year to date, beating second-place McDonald’s at 24.5%. The company’s market cap at Friday’s close was $776.75 billion, a loss of nearly $36 billion for the week. The loss that we saw Friday was devastating but it was not specific to Apple. Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft each saw similar losses. Some may point to political causes coming to a head and creating uncertainty, such as the Comey interview on Thursday or the British elections from earlier in the week. But like we said, this isn’t for lack of trying. This week Apple had its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, which showcases its new software and tech for software developers. CEO Tim Cook took this opportunity to announce new features for Apple’s existing products, including a set of tools for augmented reality and a new home digital assistant. In advance of the WWDC, the company announced that it has paid out over $70 billion to apps developers since the App Store opened in 2008. Based on last year’s report that Apple had paid out $50 billion, app developers earned $20 billion from the company last year. Apple doesn’t do to badly from app sales either. The company takes a 30% cut on most sales but offers some subscription programs a lower rate of 15%. In fact, recent earnings reports have demonstrated that Apple is building up its services (App Store, iTunes) revenues and that this segment could be a viable and sustainable source of revenue going forward. Practically all the analyst calls issued this week were positive on the stock as well. Although Deutsche Bank did take a stance against the consensus with a Hold rating and a $130 price target. Apple shares closed Friday at $148.98, with a consensus analyst price target of $157.36 and a 52-week trading range of $91.50 to $156.65.

October 6, 2013 How-to: Set time limits on your Wi-Fi network using AirPort Utility Sarah Guarino - Oct. 6th 2013 2:00 am PT @sarahg1113 How To AirPort AirPort Time Capsule Apple AirPort Extreme Airport Express Comments (26) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit AirPort Utility is a built-in Mac app that is used to configure and control Wi-Fi networks using Apple’s AirPort Extreme, AirPort Express, and Time Capsule. The AirPort Extreme is a base station router like you would use when setting up your Wi-Fi network. An AirPort Express is used to extend a Wi-Fi network to a larger area, or can be used to stream audio using AirPlay. A Time Capsule is a combination of an AirPort Extreme and an external hard drive, and comes in 2 TB or 3 TB. It automatically backs up all Macs on your network. AirPort Utility has the ability to set limits on what time of day the network (and therefore the internet) can be accessed from specific wireless devices. This can be helpful in situations where parents want to keep kids off of the internet after a certain time. Time limits can be set for different times on different days of the week. Apple TV There is an iOS version of the app, but it cannot implement time limits. Therefore, you have to set this up using AirPort Utility on your Mac. You can find AirPort Utility by going to your Applications folder (or the stack on your Dock) and looking for the Utilities folder. AirPort Utility is inside this folder. You can also search for it with Spotlight. AirPort Utility will then display theAirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, or Time Capsule connected to your network. Click on it, then click the Edit button at the bottom right. Click on the Network tab at the top, and check the Enable Access Control check-box. Then click Timed Access Control. Timed Access Control is where you will indicate which devices are allowed to access the internet at what times. A separate description and time frames will be needed for each device. Start by clicking the plus sign under the Wireless Clients section, and type a name like “My teenager’s iPad” in the Description field. In the MAC Address field, type the MAC Address of the device (more on that in a bit). In the Wireless Access Times section, set the days and times that the device will be allowed to access the internet and click Save. Repeat this process as necessary, beginning with a new description, for each device you want to put time limits on. To determine the MAC address of an iOS device, go to Settings -> General -> About -> Wi-Fi Address. To determine the MAC address of a Mac, choose About This Mac from the Apple logo on the main menu. Then click the System Report button and choose Locations on the left under Network.   You have now successfully setup time limits for the devices connected to your network. Each device will stop connecting to the internet at the determined time each day.

Vid Logar - 4 years ago Reply You are wrong you can manage timed access from iOS app. So update the article. Sarah Guarino - 4 years ago Reply Thank you for making me aware. I see the functionality is there and will update the article. This makes a big difference as children often ask for “15 more minutes”. Being able to do that from an iOS device is significant. Mickey Hancharenko - 4 years ago I believe this is a feature that Apple added at a later date. From what I remember, the ability to change Timed Access was not initially available in the iOS application. Soluble Apps - 5 months ago The article was never updated- it still says you can’t do it from the iOS app. (You can.) Marco Brandão - 4 years ago Reply I use time limits with my Airport Extreme and it work very well. It is super easy to setup. In my opinion there is one problem with it. It has no way to stop, within your network, from someone messing with time limits or your Airport base stations using the Airport Utility. There is even a Show Password command under Base Station in the menu bar, that shows all passwords you use with that. If there is a way to protect it in anyway, let me know. Mickey Hancharenko - 4 years ago Reply If you password your base station, you can’t access the “Show Password” or any other settings until the password is entered. It is probably pulling your password from your Mac OS X Keychain if you didn’t uncheck the box to “Remember this password in my keychain” the first time you logged in. Just remove the base station keychain item from Keychain Access and open AirPort Utility again. Marco Brandão - 4 years ago Nice. I will check if it is like that. Thank you! Shawn Jacobson - 4 years ago Reply I have used time limits on my AirPort Extreme and my son MacBook Pro somehow kept changing MAC address and forces him to stay on longer than the time limits. How is that possible?? Has my 16 year old son found a way around it? I had to keep re-creating it every time he is on it but does not hep me stop him from using the internet after certain hours. Can anyone explain this and how to fix it? Arjan de Boer - 4 years ago Reply I think your -clever- son is spoofing Mac Addresses (telling the AirPort Extreme he has another MAC-Addres), so your son is actively changing the address because he’s under scrutiny. The only work around I can think off now is: (1) a good father to son talk or: (2) change your DHCP/NAT settings to do the following: only KNOWN computers with their respective MAC address get access (assingned an ip-address). In doing so changing the MAC address will kick him off the internet. While keeping his MAC-address will keep him on (as long as he is allowed, by timed-access). (3) regain control over his MBP by degrading his admin status to user and not giving him an admin account. He won’t be able to install stuff or change settings (unthinkable for a 16y/o I guess). And really a last resort… Mickey Hancharenko - 4 years ago Reply You can spoof any MAC address on just about any device. There are many ways to do this and probably the easiest would be an app like MacDaddyX. KisMac/Kismet/AirCrack-ng can also sniff MAC addresses passively, so physically gaining access to an approved device to write down the MAC address isn’t even needed. If I remember correctly, AirPort Utility may also display the connected MAC addresses from the status window. What you need to do is set “All Other Units (default)” in the AirPort settings to “No Access”. It won’t keep him from using the MAC addresses from your other units, but he’ll have a limited number of addresses to use. I don’t believe the AirPort base station will allow another unit with the same MAC to kick off an already existing connected device. The only way to actually get around this would be by setting up something like a RADIUS server and telling the AirPort base station to use RADIUS for authentication. His connectivity to the base station would be restricted by a username and password and not by the device. Schedules can be set per username that prevents this sort of spoofing. Ron Jape - 4 years ago Reply Make sure the Everybody Else choice is set to “No Access”. That way only MAC addresses you enter can use the network. It’s a bit of a pain because every device that uses wifi has to be added, but I found once I had the majority of devices added, it wasn’t that bad to update new people on occasion. Aldo Esplay - 4 years ago Reply Works fine with iOS Airport Utility. Select base station–>Edit–>Advanced–>Timed Acces. Sarah Guarino - 4 years ago Reply This is true. Updating the settings from an iOS device makes this more practical also. Jerry Salinas (@kitesurfjerry) - 4 years ago Reply If you have a second router (Airport Express) to extend the range do you have to do this on both routers or just in the main router (Airport Extreme) John Matthew - 4 years ago Reply Thanks for the quick tip. I have never used this option, but in the past I was seriously looking to control the use of my bandwidth and connectivity of teenagers in my house. Everyone is just up to connect with internet and get answers. Eduardo Garcia™ (@egugalde) - 4 years ago Reply Is there a way to restrict adult content? Marco Brandão - 4 years ago Reply You can ban full addresses like http://www.example.com, but there is no way to ban a list of xxx words. Eoin McCarthy - 4 years ago Reply Its a great feature, but takes time to get to – and there’s the inevitable TC reboot. Anyone know of an app that *just* manages the timed-access part of TimeCapsule? (very practical way to manage teenage access times) Carla Schmidt Pace - 3 years ago Reply I need to limit my son’s access on his windows based devices. Do I need to look on each individual device to find this, or is there a way to see this on my Mac desktop where I control my AirPort extreme? He is tied into my airport extreme with three windows/microsoft devices and one iPod and might be tied in on some handheld gaming devices like a nintendo. Sprarty (@spartacuswines) - 3 years ago Reply I am having a challenge. The weekend field includes Friday and Sunday, as it should. So as a result, I can’t use the weekend option if I want to place a cut off time for Friday night at 11:59pm and Sunday night at 11:00pm. Then I used the weekday field to cover Monday through Thursday with a cut off time of 11:00pm. This should work, but one of the two devices stops at 11:00pm on Friday and the other at 11:59pm. To fix this I set separate times for each day of the week (7settings one for each day). This idea doesn’t work because you can only have 4 settings. (example; Week days, Friday, Saturday & Sunday). Does anyone have a fix for that? I love Apple, but sometimes…. Herman Verner III - 3 years ago Reply Does this method work if someone connects to the router via an ethernet cord? John - 2 years ago Reply Great for setting a time for homework for the teenagers!! Richard Zimmerman (@rickz_twit) - 2 years ago Reply I made the primary network accessible to just my devices and task the Guest network as the “kids network”. Now I just shut the Guest network off when I want them off it. epkescreative - 1 year ago Reply This is not good enough parental control. “Time Limits” mean they are limited to 1 hour of usage time. This talks about “Schedule Limits”. Tracy Nelson Brown - 1 year ago Reply Yes, I agree! This is the part people are mis-understanding.. allowing access during specific time of the day, seems to be the easy part now-a-days. The harder part is limiting access for a specific number of hours WITHIN that ‘limited access’ time frame!!

One machine learning practitioner sees Core ML as analogous to the TensorFlow software Google released before introducing its TPU chip. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 5:14 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, June 5, 2017. Apple on Monday introduced Core ML, a set of tools that developers can use to incorporate machine learning techniques into their apps. The news was little noticed amid all the new hardware and iOS updates. But it's important. The capabilities of Core ML are a "dead giveaway" that Apple is preparing to introduce a new kind of processor, presumably just for iPhones at first, that could make trendy machine learning workloads run more efficiently. That's according to one person inhabiting the world of machine learning, Reza Zadeh, CEO of image recognition startup Matroid. A company would only release something like Core ML "if there's a really intense piece of hardware that it was going do compile down into," said Zadeh, who built the machine learning algorithms for Twitter's Who to Follow feature before starting Matroid last year. "All those converters and everything, it's a dead giveaway there's going to be some intense [processor] available down the line." Alphabet's Google introduced its TensorFlow open-source framework for machine learning in November 2015, and then unveiled a custom tensor processing unit, or TPU, six months later. Zadeh thinks Apple is doing something similar with the launch of Core ML. Meanwhile startups like Deep Vision and Mythic have been working on processors that could be plunked into smaller devices, as opposed to data centers, where Google's TPUs are located. Another startup, Movidius, which touts its vision processing unit for drones and other gadgets, was acquired by Intel in 2016. Bloomberg reported last month on Apple's plans to build a artificial intelligence (AI) chip. This would build on the inclusion of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for certain computations in the iPhone 7 last year. Core ML provides machine learning models that developers can drop right into iOS, macOS and tvOS apps, while also providing ways to use their own models. Apps drawing on Core ML will be able to recognize objects in images, follow the movement of things in video frames or just make smart calculations given a certain amount of previous data. These processes can run on current iPhones and iPads. But it's reasonable to think Apple wants to improve performance on future hardware, while also lengthening battery life. It could do that sending machine learning workloads to a dedicated AI chip, instead of devices' central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), which are not always optimized for those computing duties, Zadeh said. But that's not all. Emerging specialized processors like the rumored Apple AI chip could become the computational workhorse in the next few decades, Zadeh said.
