Eyeball scanning, of course, is a big new feature for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (although it's been around for longer than that on phones like the Lumia 950), and may well be coming to the Samsung Galaxy S8 as well, so if the iPhone 8 has an iris scanner too the tech will officially have gone mainstream. The theory that the iPhone 8 (or iPhone 7S if Apple's nomenclature holds up) will scan your eyes is based on a Chinese-language report, picked up by Digitimes, stating that according to "market watchers" a company called Xintec is to start mass producing iris-recognition chips, some of which will apparently be used in the 2017 iPhone. We might not see it Digitimes is hit and miss for rumors, so we'd take this with a big helping of salt for now. In some ways it would make sense for Apple to put an iris scanner in the iPhone 8, as it would allow the company to compete more directly with Samsung. But there's a question over how useful an iris scanner actually is for the average smartphone owner, and Apple doesn't tend to roll out features that aren't ready for mass adoption, and it would need to be much faster at recognising your eyeballs - current versions are just far too slow to be useful. If the iPhone 8 does have an iris scanner that might not be the only way in which it mimics Samsung's phones, as earlier this year we heard talk of a curved AMOLED display, which sounds a lot like what we've seen on the Galaxy S7 Edge and Note 7.

 EU's Vestager warns others, says Apple could cut bill Reuters Sep. 1, 2016, 5:05 PM 531 facebook linkedin twitter email print European Commissioner for Violation of EU Treaties Vestager reacts during a news conference on the approval of the Hutchison-Vimpelcom deal at the EC in Brussels Thomson Reuters By Alastair Macdonald and Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Other multinationals which do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday. She handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish registered subsidiaries tax resident in paces like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds. "Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code," she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: "not much". Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish 'branch'. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The U.S. could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents. "If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States," Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies' affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon and McDonald's in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple's methods and other cases by a U.S. Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Apple CEO Tim Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.

The Taoiseach has said the European Commission’s decision that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to €13bn to Apple has created an “unprecedented situation” — not quite Charles Haughey’s ‘Gubu’ pronouncement, but close. As the Cabinet met yesterday to discuss the ruling, it was clear Finance Minister Michael Noonan’s view that the EC decision was wrong and should be appealed was not shared by many of his colleagues. His view of the Apple ruling contrasts with the stance he took in July in relation to Ireland’s extra €280 million EU budget liability based on extraordinary GDP figures boosted by the presence of Apple, Google, and other multinationals in Ireland. Minister Noonan said he accepted that Ireland rightly had the extra liability, would pay it and could afford to do so. On this occasion, he is prepared to spend millions of Irish taxpayers’ money to ensure that Ireland does not get up to €20bn (including fines and penalties) from Apple. Indeed, if the commission’s ruling is not appealed and is enforced, there is every reason to believe that it could be applied to other multinationals, leading to a windfall of tens of billions of euro for Ireland. Who in their right mind would consider opposing such a windfall, especially considering the billions we had to pay to bondholders, funded by years of cuts and austerity? When it comes to dealing with multinationals, successive Irish governments and ministers have adopted the politics of fear. Fear that once we insist these multi-billion euro organisations pay their fair share (which still amounts to only 12.5%) that they will leave the country and set up elsewhere. Fear that the much-trumpeted reason for their setting up shop here is not our tax policy but the presence of a highly educated workforce will be exposed as a pious platitude at best or fraud at worst. Fear that our indigenous industries will never be able to replace lost jobs if they do leave. In other words, fear of failure. We should never give in to those politics of fear. We began our fight for independence at the height of the Great War. Against the odds, we achieved it. We survived a spiteful economic war begun by the British because of Irish neutrality throughout the Second World War. From the 1960s on, we finally managed to build an economy to be proud of, creating our own pan-national corporations. In more recent times, culminating in the same-sex marriage referendum, we achieved a society to be proud of. Whatever the merits of the EC ruling, allowing multinationals to pay virtually no tax is unconscionable. Instead of fear, we should show courage by taking the €13bn and let them run if they dare.

Apple has revealed that bugs in iOS that were exploited by spyware utilised by repressive regimes to target dissidents and journalists are also present in its OS X desktop operating system. The company today issued a security patch for OS X 10.11.6 "El Capitan" and 10.10.5 "Yosemite" that fixes two zero-day vulnerabilities. CVE-2016-4655 and CVE-2016-4656 were patched last week by Apple in the 9.3.5 update for its iOS mobile operating system. They allow attackers to read OS X kernel memory and execute arbitrary code with full system privileges, Apple said. Security vendor Lookout together with researchers from University of Toronto's Citizen Lab are credited with finding the bugs in iOS and OS X. The zero-days were included in the Pegasus spyware made by American-owned Israeli company NSO Group, which specialises in kernel-level exploitation. Citizen Lab came across the spyware after a United Arab Emirates human rights activist was targeted through a text message that tried to trick him into clicking on a link that would deliver Pegasus to his device. An infection with Pegasus fully compromises devices. Attackers are able to access voice and text messages from a range of apps, along with log files, emails and other data stored on systems. Apple also patched a memory corruption bug in the Webkit rendering engine used by the Safari browser, also found by Citizen Lab and Lookout. The patch applies to the older OS X 10.9.5 "Mavericks" version of the operating system as well as Yosemite and El Capitan. It plugs a vulnerability that could allow websites to run arbitrary code in drive-by attacks on visitors' computers. Tthe bug was fixed in the earlier iOS 9.3.4 update.  Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

However as it turns out, Apple might have more than just an iPhone announcement up their sleeves. According to the folks at French website iGen.fr (via iClarified), we could be looking at new Beats by Dre products. This is according to an email mistakenly sent by the Beats PR team which reads, “The Apple Keynote, awaited by all lovers of technology! Do not miss this event, a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be revealed September 7th, 2016.” The original post included a screenshot of the email but they have since been asked to take it down, but it’s pretty much the same thing. Now Apple typically never announces what they plan to announce, even though we guess based on their schedule it’s not that hard to figure out, so this would really be a first in which they are being very specific about it. It is unclear if we are looking at new headphones or new speakers, but if it is the former, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some Lightning-only variants designed specifically for the new iPhones which is said to have its headphone port removed. In any case if you are after some new Beats products, do check back with us next week for the official details. Filed in Apple >Audio. Read more about beats, Headphones, iPhone and Speakers.

It ordered Apple to pay €13 billion (£11bn) in arrears to the Irish exchequer, although Dublin said it didn’t want the money. “I think the right thing here is to stand up and fight against this overreach,” Mr Cook told RTE TV from his base in Cupertino, California. Taking a Eurosceptic tone, he added: “Clearly the sovereignty of the country is at stake and the rule of law and sovereignty of law are at stake.” Apple said it had hired top London law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to appeal against the ruling. But Rosa Pavanelli, general secretary of union federation Public Service International, said the EU Commission’s decision acknowledged that austerity was a political choice, not an economic one. “This ruling shows that governments do have access to the funds to provide public services such as health, education and water if they have the political will,” she said. “This is the worst form of corruption and should be considered an international crime. “My first thought is for the Irish workers and families who have suffered for the austerity measures imposed by the Irish government to recover from the financial crisis.” international@peoples-press.com Related Tags: Ireland It looks like you've got Adblock Plus installed.

X Noel Whelan: Turning our back on €13bn would be politically explosive A frank and honest communication of the case for an appeal is needed but unlikely Fri, Sep 2, 2016, 00:14 Updated: Fri, Sep 2, 2016, 08:24 Noel Whelan Video Images European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager rejects Apple's criticism that an EU order to the company to pay back taxes to Ireland is political, noting the calculations are based on facts and Apple's own data. Video: REUTERS Tim Cook’s claim that the European Commission’s findings are ‘total political crap’, and Michael O’Leary’s suggestion that Ireland should tell the commission to ‘F*** off’ are not helping the political situation in Ireland. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters         The implications of the European Commission’s decision this week are truly massive. Size does matter and the size of the bill for back tax which the commission says Apple owes Ireland really matters. The events of this week have damaged our reputation internationally. Some, but only some, of that damage could be repaired if ultimately Ireland and Apple win an appeal to the European courts. If we lose that appeal, the damage will be compounded. The events of this week have also badly damaged our relationship with the European Union. Ireland is now engaged in public conflict with the European Commission on a central and important policy issue. It is not in our interest to be in that unhappy position in the lead-in to Brexit negotiations when we are trying to persuade European institutions to have particular regard to Ireland’s future. The events of this week will have their most dramatic impact, however, on our fragile domestic politics. This is the biggest challenge for Irish politics in many years. It is a more potent one than water charges, and the political ramifications could be even more dramatic. The political response could further erode confidence and trust not only in the current Government but also in politics generally. Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Popular impact It is difficult to understate the popular impact of that big €13 billion figure. The suggestion that Ireland should abandon a claim, even to some of this sum, comes at a time when things are already precarious for our politics. It comes after the banks were bailed out, with the electorate still in a post-traumatic state after years of recession. It follows on from stories about vulture funds feeding off our property collapse but then paying little or no tax on massive profits. The claim that the Irish people are owed €13 billion plus interest from Apple is not some ideologically motivated charge from the left-wing fringes of the Dáil or the European Parliament. It has come from the mouth of the European Commission itself. On this issue the European establishment is making the anti-establishment argument in Irish politics. ADVERTISEMENT There may well be good reasons why Ireland should appeal against this decision. Ministers argue that failing to do so would be an admission that Irish tax authorities and the Irish State did something wrong. They say we can’t afford to alienate multinational corporations who provided hundreds of thousands of jobs in Ireland. They must also realise, however, that there are profound political implications of abandoning a claim to such a substantial tax payment from a multinational. The only way in which the explosive political impact of abandoning a claim to these billions could possibly be ameliorated is through honest and frank communication of the case for an appeal. Ministers need to set out in detail why it is in Ireland’s interest to forgo this €13 billion in the longer-term interest of sustaining foreign direct investment. They need to tell us whether other multinationals benefited or continue to benefit from similar tax arrangements. They need to tell us what changes have already been introduced in how Apple and other such companies are treated. They need to set out honestly what the prospects for success in such an appeal are. They are unlikely to do so. Anti-European rhetoric Bombast from business executives does not advance the political case. Tim Cook’s claim that the European Commission’s findings are “total political crap” and Michael O’Leary’s suggestion that Ireland should tell the commission to “f*** off” are not helping. Stooping to the level of anti-European rhetoric more usually associated with the Daily Mail (or one time with Boris Johnson) does little to improve public understanding of the issue. Government politicians, industry representatives and Revenue spokespeople now responsible for persuading the Irish people on this issue are closeted in groupthink. They are advised by those whose previous policy decisions have been challenged by the commission. They don’t appreciate the bubbling public anger at the notion of abandoning this tax claim. Irish sovereignty They are also seeking to crudely stoke up the suggestion that the European Union is infringing on Irish sovereignty. They fail to appreciate that most Irish people have a problem with the notion that Ireland used its sovereign tax-collecting powers to make or tolerate an arrangement which enabled one of the wealthiest companies in the world to evade paying tax on so much of its earnings. In the next 24 hours the focus will be on the immediate implications for the survival of the Government. This Government always looked vulnerable to an unforeseen shock. We will know later today whether the Cabinet can collectively make a decision to appeal against this tax ruling. My guess is that it will not. The next election, whether it happens sooner or later, will be all the more volatile because of this week’s events.       Topics: Boris Johnson Michael O Leary Tim Cook European Commission European Union Apple Ireland Read More Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims Leading US politicians criticise EU ruling on Apple Apple’s €13bn Irish tax bill does not contain seeds of change Apple claims it paid $800m tax on European profits in 2014 Business Podcast: Making sense of the Apple ruling Independent Ministers demand early recall of Dáil to debate Apple appeal Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Opinion Dennis Kennedy: British politicians can still prevent Brexit Opinion Rite & Reason: Our world is dominated by an aimless secularist view of life Opinion Una Mullally: Ban ‘busy’ in 2017 and get more out of life Opinion 1:32 Promissory note ruling may haunt future ministers Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief, stridently defended the company's tax practices in Ireland, countering European officials' ruling this week that the Irish government provided illegal incentives, which allowed the technology giant to pay essentially nothing some years. In an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE, Cook said the company paid its fair share in Ireland, the United States and elsewhere. Cook noted that Apple planned to send some of its enormous amount of cash overseas back to the United States next year, although he did not specify how much. Those international reserves have been particularly divisive as they remain out of the reach of U.S. tax authorities. "The finding is wrongheaded," Cook told RTE. "It's not true — there wasn't a special deal between Ireland and Apple." He continued, "When you're accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you." The Apple case has stirred up tensions, pitting the United States against Europe. In announcing the tax decision Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, said Apple's sweetheart deals with the Irish government allowed the company to sidestep taxes by moving profits to a "head office" with "no employees, no premises, no real activities." The company paid just 50 euros ($56 at current exchange rates) in taxes for every million euros in profit in 2014, she said. Following Cook's criticism, she denied any political motivation, saying the decision was based on longstanding laws that prohibit member states from lavishing selected companies with favorable treatment. The case, she said, would stand up in court. "I don't think the courts will hear any kind of political opinions or feeling or what's in your stomach or whatever," she said at a briefing in Brussels. "They want the facts of the case, and that, of course, is what we have to produce."

CNN Money by Ivana Kottasova   @ivanakottasova  Apple’s $14.6B tax bill explained  Ireland must recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in unpaid taxes from Apple, European officials said on Tuesday. The tax ruling is the biggest the European Union has ever made regarding a single company, and it could spark a huge transatlantic row over how Europe treats U.S. companies. Apple shares initially fell almost 3%, but then recovered most of their losses. The company will appeal the decision. It said the ruling upended the international tax system and would damage jobs and investment in Europe. The European Commission, which administers EU law, said the Irish government had granted illegal state aid to Apple (AAPL, Tech30) by helping the tech giant to artificially lower its tax bill for more than 20 years. Apple reacts to the EU’s demand that it pay $14.6 billion in tax to Ireland. “[EU] member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies — this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” said Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official. The United States fired back immediately, saying retroactive tax assessments by the EU were unfair. “The Commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU,” a Treasury spokesperson said. The decision amounted to “a transfer of revenue from U.S. taxpayers to the EU,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. The Obama administration would fight for “American taxpayers and American businesses overseas when they’re being treated unfairly,” he added. Related: How Apple paid just 0.005% tax on its global profits Apple paid tax at 1%, or less, on profits attributed to its subsidiaries in Ireland, well below the 35% top rate of corporate tax in the United States and Ireland’s 12.5% rate. That prompted complaints by both European and U.S. lawmakers, who argued that Apple had been given an unfair advantage in exchange for creating jobs in Ireland. CEO Tim Cook was even called to testify on Apple’s tax arrangements with Ireland before a Senate committee in 2013. The bill for tax benefits, plus interest, covers 2003 to 2014. Apple has more than $231 billion in cash on its balance sheet to cushion the blow. Cook said on Tuesday the ruling had “no basis in fact or in law,” calling it “obvious targeting of Apple.” Apple had helped create and sustain more than 1.5 million jobs across Europe, follows the law and pays all the taxes it owes, he added. “The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” he wrote. Ireland said it will appeal the decision, saying Apple paid what it owed. The country has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe, which makes it an attractive place for global companies. The Irish government is afraid companies would be less likely to invest in Ireland if its tax regime changes, which could cost the country thousands of jobs.

The European Commission ordered Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler to repay millions in taxes last October. Starbucks (SBUX) has to pay back up to 30 million euros it saved thanks to a sweetheart tax deal with the Netherlands. Fiat Chrysler (FCAM) was ordered to repay a similar amount after a similar deal with Luxembourg. Both companies have appealed the decisions.

The ruling against Apple’s tax deal comes despite a stern warning from the U.S. Treasury Department last week that it would consider “potential responses” if the Commission doesn’t change course. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the EU’s ruling “feeds the perception that the Commission is unfairly targeting U.S. businesses.” “When coupled with ongoing competition investigations against several U.S. manufacturers, technology companies, and services providers, this ruling raises significant new questions about Europe’s attractiveness as an investment destination for U.S. business,” the Chamber said in a statement. http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/technology/apple-tax-eu-us-ireland/index.html?utm_source=Daily%20Email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=160830 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 September 2016 | MYT 4:30 AM Apple getting ready to give its Macs a powerful overhaul Functional upgrades: The Macbook Pro is expected to get an innovative OLED strip rather than traditional function keys. — Apple As Apple confirms its next-generation iPhones are coming on Sept 7, reports and rumours are flying as to what to expect from the company beyond its annual smartphone refresh.  Regardless of the competition, Apple is still streets ahead when it comes to smartphones. The iPhone is the world's most desirable and desired handset – so much so that as long as the company issues a new one every year, consumers are going to buy it, or wish they could buy it.  However, as beautifully designed and engineered as they are, the company's desktop and notebook lineup is beginning to lag behind the Wintel completion. But Apple is about to close that gap.  The biggest changes are coming to the MacBook Pro. According to a host of different sources it's ditching the traditional row of physical function keys in favour of a touch-sensitive OLED strip.  The idea is simple: the strip can be set up to show the buttons that a specific user desires at a specific time, whether browsing the web, watching a movie or doing something much more involved such as video or still image manipulation. The new notebook will be even thinner than the existing model and will be getting a processor speed hike.  Although demand for PCs is still sluggish – the latest IDC data, published Aug 29, suggests that sales will continue to decline both this year (-7.3%) and next (a further 1.6% drop) – power users, i.e., those that need a serious device with a fast chip and a long-lasting battery are bucking this trend. There are also signs of life in the tablet-cum-notebook market (they now represent 14% of notebook PC sales).  Clearly aware of this, the iPad Pro's also tipped to get some productivity adjustments with more functions for its stylus (or pencil as Apple calls it) and, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, improved response times so that it can handle more intensive applications.  Apple has been toying with a standalone 5K monitor with its own graphics processing capabilities for some time but until now it has remained tightly under wraps. However, Gurman also suggests that the monitor (a collaboration with LG) will finally be making its debut this year.  But, with so many tweaks and updates allegedly on the way, Apple may well host a dedicated event in late September or early October and keep next week's show focused on phones, smartwatches and software updates. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Secure your accounts Samsung targets gamers with new curved, quantum dot monitor Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read U.S. House Republicans weaken ethics body as they return to Congress Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick advertisement Latest News Seattle’s cloud-computing boom is new force driving regional economy What is cloud computing?

Related News/Archive In election's wake, navigating political conversations at work 2 Weeks Ago Phone companies could stop robocalls, they're just not doing it 5 Months Ago Airbnb nears tax deal with Hillsborough County as college football championship nears 2 Weeks Ago In two interviews with Irish media, Cook said Apple has done nothing wrong and is confident European courts would overturn the ruling on appeal. "It's maddening. It's disappointing. It's clear that this comes from a political place," Cook said in a radio interview with Ireland's RTE News. "When you're accused of doing something so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you," he said. Cook was more blunt in an interview with the Irish Independent newspaper. He blasted the assertion by a top EU regulator that Apple paid a 0.005 percent tax rate in Ireland in 2014 — far below the nation's low 12.5 percent corporate rate. "It's total political crap," Cook said of the figure. "They just picked a number from I don't know where." Apple paid taxes at the 12.5 percent rate — a total of $400 million — in 2014, he said. After a two-year investigation triggered by a U.S. Senate inquiry, EU officials on Tuesday said Apple had struck an illegal deal with Ireland that allowed the technology giant to pay almost no taxes from 2003 to 2014 on profits for sales throughout the 28-nation region. Margrethe Vestager, the top competition official for the European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the deal amounted to illegal state aid to Apple from Ireland. The investigation found that Apple routed almost all the taxable profits from European sales to two Irish-based subsidiaries, which shifted the money to a "head office" that had no employees or facilities and was not taxed in any country. Ireland was ordered to collect up to $14.5 billion in back taxes, plus interest. The ruling drew bipartisan criticism in the United States, with Obama administration officials saying the EU was trying to improperly wring more money out of American multinational companies. Apple is just the latest U.S. company to be targeted. Last year, EU regulators ordered the Netherlands to collect $34 million in back taxes from Starbucks. Tax breaks from Luxembourg for Amazon.com and McDonald's are also under investigation. Cook said he is confident that Ireland would appeal the tax ruling along with Apple, although the nation's government has not yet made a decision. He was particularly upset at the EU's demand for retroactive tax payments. "It's sort of like playing a sports game, winning a championship and later finding out that the goals count differently than you thought they did," Cook told RTE News. "It lacks any level of fairness." In both interviews, Cook said Apple remained committed to Ireland. The company opened its first factory there in 1980 and is breaking ground on an $800 million data center. "There wasn't a special deal between Ireland and Apple," Cook said. "We haven't done anything wrong and the Irish government hasn't done anything wrong." Apple's Tim Cook says EU tax ruling is just a political move 09/01/16 [Last modified: Thursday, September 1, 2016 9:01pm] Photo reprints | Article reprints Copyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Tribune News Service.      Abuse Policy Commenting Guidelines Join the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours Loading...

Per the leaked image that was anonymously sent to the tech site, the iPhone 7 Plus will come with AirPods wireless earphones, a Lightning-to-USB cable and a USB power adapter.  Photo of the latest leak that was anonymously sent to Apple Insider. Photo: Apple Insider It can be noted that previous leaks claimed that the upcoming iPhones would come with the usual EarPods with Lighting connector. There were also leaked photos that suggested that the new Apple smartphones would arrive with a Lightning-to-headphone jack adapter.  On Wednesday, 9To5Mac even ran a story featuring a purported iPhone 7 Plus packaging that indicated the inclusion of a Lightning-to-headphone jack adapter and suggested that the rumored 256GB storage variant of the iPhones is real.  Related Stories How To Get The Best Apple Smartphone Deal However, this new leak that comes exactly a week prior the launch event of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus does not mention anything that would back the EarPods with Lightning connector and the Lighting-to-headphone jack adapter rumors. What it does have as part of the description of the box is an entry that corroborates recent rumors mentioning Apple’s planned solution for the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, the AirPods  wireless earphones.  AppleInsider admitted that photos featuring texts on white paper could be easily faked; however, the tech site stated that if this latest leak turns out to be true, then it’s clear that the Cupertino tech giant is eyeing an expansion for its iPhone lineup by releasing various configurations, some with wireless earphones and others without the AirPods. But at this point, it’s hard to tell how the prices would vary for these configurations.  This new appearance of the AirPods coincides with Pocket-lint’s previous report that Apple is preparing to launch standalone hardware that according to a Eurasian Economic Commission filing is a pair of wireless earphones called AirPods.  Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus next Wednesday, and only then can we all confirm if these rumors and this new leak are true.  Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

By Corazon Victorino On 09/01/16 AT 7:27 PM Close It has long been rumored that Cupertino tech giant Apple is working on an upgraded Apple Watch that would sport a thinner display and a larger battery. And just this Thursday, this rumor may have materialized according to a newly leaked video that features the different components of the upcoming Apple Watch 2.  The new leak comes from a British shop named Byte that reportedly sells Apple accessories and repair parts, and MacRumors reports that Byte’s video showcases the different components of Apple’s next wearable device.  In the leaked video (shown below) that was uploaded on YouTube, the LCD display of the Apple Watch 2 is slightly thinner than the one found on its predecessor, and it also has wider bezels along with a different layout for its screen assembly. Apple Insider also picked up the video and found out that the Force Touch gasket of the Apple Watch 2 is different from the one its predecessor sports. The new gasket is said to come with a modified layout with the addition of a new chipset. Related Stories Apple AirPods, iPhone 7, 7 Plus And 10 Apple Watch 2 Models Confirmed For Sept. 7 Event? In terms of batteries, the Apple Watch 2 could be sporting a thicker battery pack that has a 1.28 watt-hours capacity, and this is a significant upgrade compared to the Apple Watch’s thinner battery pack with 0.94 watt-hours capacity.  This leaked video comes days after a snap of the rumored battery of the Apple Watch 2 landed on Chinese website Weibo. Despite having previous leaks to back up the rumored larger battery of the new wearable, nothing has been set in stone yet.  Apple fans would only be able to confirm the upgraded specifications of the Apple Watch 2 when the Cupertino giant finally pulls the wraps off of the device next week during the Sept. 7 event that’s primarily intended for the debut of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones.   Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

That’s a good practice in case anything goes wrong, and also to give the company negotiating power when it wants to cut costs. Apple is putting that backup plan into action now, as suppliers say that the company is out to lower its cost on parts as smartphone sales have slowed down. Suppliers told the Wall Street Journal that Apple has told them to expect two things as the next-generation iPhone comes out: that Apple expects to sell fewer phones and order fewer components from its suppliers, and that it also expects to pay its suppliers less for the components that it does buy. There are some parts that only come from one supplier, though. The Journal’s sources noted that the chips and camera lenses that will be used in the next-generation iPhones only have one supplier, leaving the company in a weaker position to bargain with those companies. Globally, where the market for smartphones is growing, people aren’t interested in pricey iPhones. Consumers in China are opting for less expensive and more patriotic Android phones from local electronics companies. The “less expensive” part is key, though: the current price of an entry-level unlocked iPhone is actually lower in China than in the U.S. right now.

Michael Sohn, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email From virtual reality to a new Samsung smartwatch, a wide range of new tech was unveiled at IFA 2016 in Berlin, Europe’s largest tech trade show.  Companies like Samsung, Lenovo, and Sony are on hand during the expo to show their latest tech wares. Samsung’s new smartwatch Samsung’s next smartwatch will come with GPS capabilities and the ability to call or text for help by triple-tapping a side button. The new Gear S3 retains the circular design of the current S2 model, but is slightly larger. Samsung will still sell last year’s S2 to those who consider the S3 too big on their wrist. As with the S2, the outer ring of the watch face rotates to let you scroll through notifications and apps. Interface improvements include the ability to accept or reject calls with the ring rather than a swipe of the screen. The S3 will come in three flavors. One has LTE cellular capabilities, allowing people to make calls, receive notifications and check weather without a companion phone nearby. A data plan costs extra. The other two models lack LTE and differ primarily in style. Samsung said prices will be announced closer to the devices’ availability later in the year. Samsung announced the new watch lineup Wednesday at the IFA tech show in Berlin. The Gear smartwatches have had impressive designs and battery life, but have been hampered largely by a dearth of apps, as many developers write for Apple Watch and Android Wear devices instead. A G3 smartwatch and a mobile phone of the electronic company Samsung are displayed after a press conference at the company’s stand at the IFA 2016 tech fair in Berlin, Germany, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. Michael Sohn, AP All three S3 models will have GPS, making them more accurate for workouts. In the S2, GPS was limited to a pricier model with cellular capabilities (on the slower 3G network). GPS, so far, isn’t common in smartwatches, allowing Samsung to stand out with the S3. Although GPS tends to drain battery quickly, Samsung expects at least three days of battery life in the S3. Meanwhile, the emergency-calling feature echoes the “SOS” feature coming to the Apple Watch this fall. Where the Apple Watch will call 911 or the relevant emergency service elsewhere directly, though, the S3 will call or text emergency contacts, such as friends or relatives. These will be pre-recorded or pre-written messages. For an extra recurring fee, which has yet to be announced, S3 users will also be able to make a live call to ADT’s security dispatchers, who would then be able to call 911 or offer other help. The S3 also comes with expanded ability to make payments at stores through Samsung Pay. And the watch’s always-on feature improves with a display of millions of colors, rather than just 16 before. Something missing in a laptop  Also at the IFA tech show, Lenovo unveiled a twist on the laptop: Its new Yoga Book won’t have a physical keyboard. It’s an odd choice, given that Apple, Samsung and other tablet makers are pushing professional tablet models with keyboard accessories. Those companies are hoping to appeal to businesses and individuals looking to replace their laptops. In Lenovo’s case, the 10-inch Yoga Book retains the clamshell design of the laptop, but puts a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. People can type on a touch-screen keyboard there, or just write or draw on that second screen with an included stylus. You can even use a regular pen or pencil, though you’d want to put a sheet of paper over the screen to avoid damage. The Yoga book. Lenovo Although Lenovo calls Yoga Book a tablet, the keyboard part isn’t detachable, making the device a laptop. The keyboard, though, can fold all the way to the back to make the device feel more like a tablet. Jeff Meredith, a Lenovo vice president, said the Yoga Book might not be appropriate for extensive typing, but should be suitable for people - especially younger people - who now use the phone’s touch screen to respond to email at night or even take notes in classrooms. He added that when BlackBerrys were still popular, people couldn’t imagine getting rid of physical keyboards on their phones, either. The Yoga Book will start shipping in the coming weeks. An Android version will cost $500, and Windows will be $600. The unveiling came hours after rival computer maker Acer unveiled what it calls the world’s first laptop to measure less than a centimeter. The Swift 7 is 9.98 millimeters (0.39 inch) to be exact. But Lenovo​ says the Yoga Book is thinner, at 9.6 millimeters, or slightly more than the thickest iPad at 7.5 millimeters. Acer, meanwhile, unveiled a laptop with a curved screen, something traditionally limited to computer monitors for desktops. The Predator 21 X is designed for video games and comes with eye-tracking technology that promises to let players aim, identify enemies and take cover by gazing at the screen. LG welcomes Alexa SmartThinQHub LG LG’s upcoming smart home helper – the LG SmartThinQ Hub, which seen as a competitor of the Amazon Echo – will surprisingly accommodate Alexa, Amazon’s digital assistant, CNET reports​.  How will the two work together? If you press a button on the SmartThinQHub, you’ll be able to activate Alexa and tell it to play music or check something on your calendar. If you are in a different room, you can also send requests to Alexa through a remote. This isn’t that different from using a bluetooth remote to link Alexa with your Echo.  What are you missing out on by not using Amazon’s hub? Well, this is a limited version of Alexa. You won’t be able to have the assistant control compatible smart home devices, for instance. If you want to use the personal assistant to its full advantage, you’ll have to purchase Amazon’s competing product. Bringing back the Walkman Andrew Hoyle/CNET Sony is going a little retro by debuting a high-end version of the Walkman​. The new NW-WM1Z Walkman is pricey – it retails at $3,200, CNET reports​.  The device is expensive but could appeal to music die-hards, and is easy on the eyes. It is made of oxygen-free copper, which is said to improve the device’s sound quality.   Looking for a less-expensive version? The cheaper model, the NW-WM1A is still a major investment, given that it costs $1,200. A VR headset you won’t be able to own Qualcomm was on hand with a fancy new VR headset that CNET’s Roger Cheng describes​ as the “Goldilocks version of a virtual-reality headset.” The headset aims to provide an immersive experience that isn’t very different from that of the HTC Vive. The headset doesn’t require wires, has a battery that lasts about two hours, and lets you “walk around” and “duck underneath” virtual reality​ objects.  Roger Cheng/CNET But unfortunately, this isn’t something you’ll be able to purchase at any store. While it might appeal to VR​ fans, the headset at the trade show was just a “reference design” from Qualcomm. It is a working prototype that provides a design and technology that other companies could ultimately build upon for a more desirable virtual reality experience.  “We couldn’t just build a board,” Hugo Swart, head of the company’s home entertainment business, said of simple Snapdragon VR820 chip used by the headset. “We needed to show a real device.” The reference design will be shipped to companies in the fourth quarter of this year, CNET reports. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Then you read every political party, bar one hardline grouping, have put up their collective hands and said: “No, we're fine, our indebted country and creaking health system doesn’t want the money. You keep it.” This is what has happened in Ireland, a country where GPs can charge you 50 euros for turning up at the surgery and people long ago stopped believing in pots of gold at the end of the rainbow. The European Commission have ruled that Apple, the makers of mobile phones and laptops, paid less than one per cent tax on European profits for years through their Irish base.

Sour when you consider that is 50 euros tax on every million euros in profit generated. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the arrangement with the Irish government is illegal under state aid rules and Apple must pay Dublin 13billion euros and the interest on top. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says Apple received illegal state aid from Ireland (Photo: Reuters) Apple’s billions in back taxes could build 100,000 homes for the poor or pay off a chunk of the nation’s debt. The trouble for Ireland is that Ireland doesn’t want the money. For 40 years and more, the cornerstone of Irish economic policy has been a low corporate tax rate that attracts inward investment. The iPhone-makers are one of more than 700 US companies who have a European foothold in Ireland. They employ a combined 140,000 people across the island. So, do you want the 13billion euros or not? Read More EU orders Ireland to recover €13 billion from Apple over illegal tax deal Go look up the answer at Google or ask a friend on Facebook, or any other multinational using an Irish stepping stone. The sound of hand-wringing in the Dail, Ireland’s parliament, can be heard this side of the Irish Sea. Most commentators, as far as can be fathomed, back the Irish government’s stance to appeal the decision. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, vowing to fight Europe on behalf of the world’s richest company, went straight for Ireland’s famine heart. “To do anything else, it would be like eating the seed potatoes,” he said. These Irish jobs are at stake and Apple, backed by the US government, won’t brook the European Commission meddling. Apple CEO Tim Cook is challenging the EU Commission ruling (Photo: Getty Images) For Apple, this is a drop in the ocean. The company generated about $4.45billion a month last year and the back tax – equivalent to about $3000 for every man, woman and child in Ireland – works out at three months of profit. But no way are the Irish getting a share of Apple’s pie. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: “Ireland always does the right thing. You can always count on that.” If there’s an iPhone app for generating smugness, that guy was the first to download it. Why should we worry about Ireland’s tax dilemma? Well, I get the feeling whichever direction we turn, Ireland’s breakfast is our dinner. Just as Alex Salmond sought to emulate the Celtic Tiger across the northern “arc of prosperity” (what a cracker that was) his plan for an independent Scotland depended on facilitating any passing multinational with a lower than UK corporate tax rate.

Eurosceptic Tories have been eager to press Theresa May to offer Apple an even better deal than Ireland does, if that is possible. I fear that’s what Brexit means on Tory terms, rendering craven homage to global companies and turning your workforce into the cyber-serfs of the 21st century.

Even if the devices are going to be “boring” to some people. Even if they fail to set a new sales record. The iPhone 7 will still be a huge cash cow for the company, and Apple is doing everything it can to protect its profits while also dealing with slowing iPhone sales. Apple suppliers will be the first to suffer alongside the company, and a new report reveals that Apple is squeezing component makers to protect its margins. What’s interesting is that suppliers may complain about Apple’s desire to cut prices and orders at the same time, but there's really nothing they can do about it. DON’T MISS: This is the new color coming to Apple’s iPhone 7 The Wall Street Journal says that negotiations over cuts in component prices started in January, and their effects have been felt across the board. Apple is currently experiencing iPhone sales declines for the first time ever, so orders to its suppliers are obviously lighter. But even so, Apple is looking to help offset lower than expected iPhone demand by paying less for components, being fully aware that none of Apple's suppliers can afford to lose its business. “The reason why everybody is extremely unhappy about it recently is because they played a ‘double cut,’ cutting both the price and the volume of orders,” said a person from one of Apple’s suppliers said. Companies including TSMC and Largan have strong bargaining positions, the Journal says, as they make critical iPhone components including processors and camera lens modules. But for everyone else, Apple has alternatives. Some component makers have already said that Apple has threatened to take its business elsewhere if they didn't agree to price cuts. On the other hand, Apple also told suppliers that despite the volume cuts, orders would still rise significantly after its new iPhones are released. The Journal doesn't mention the price of the iPhone 7, but it's likely Apple won't change its pricing structure compared to last year. The report does mention the iPhone 6s is currently cheaper in China than the US, since local telecom operators are running special deals to clear out stock before the new iPhone arrives.

 The flaw that allowed hackers to take over your iPhone affects your Mac, too Paul Szoldra Sep. 1, 2016, 7:05 PM 4,757 facebook linkedin twitter email print A customer enters the new Apple store, which is the world's largest, on its opening day at Covent Garden in London Thomson Reuters If you have a Mac desktop or laptop, you need to update it right now. It turns out the major security hole that could let attackers take over iPhones affects Macs as well. Apple fixed the iPhone issue with a software update to iOS 9.3.5. On Thursday, it quietly released an update for OSX that does much the same thing, with critical patches coming for the Safari browser and the kernel, or core of the operating system. The updates for OSX patch three "zero-day" vulnerabilities, or unfixed bugs, that could allow an attacker to take over a victim's computer. In order to pull that off, a user would just need to visit a "maliciously crafted website" — a poison link that would execute code without the user's knowledge. This is the same method researchers at Citizen Lab and Lookout Security found being used to spy on iPhone users with a hacking tool called Pegasus. In order for an iPhone to be hacked, a victim would only need to click a link from a text message. As one of the researchers told Business Insider of Pegasus last week: "Once you get this software on your phone, it’s not your phone anymore." The malicious software tracked an incredible amount of data on an affected user. Every single text message, calendar entry, email sent through Gmail, or WhatsApp message was vacuumed up and sent back to whoever was behind the spying. It constantly updated and sent the user's location from the phone's GPS. And it even fully downloaded the user's various passwords and stole the stored list of WiFi networks and passwords the phone connected to. In order to update to the latest version of OSX, users need to open the "App Store" app and hit the Updates tab. It's Security Update 2016-001 10.11.6.

No Thanks Yes Please Home «Back EU's Vestager warns others, says Apple could cut bill Reuters | Brussels Sep 02, 2016 02:43 AM IST Other multinationals which do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday. She handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro (10.97 billion pounds) bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish registered subsidiaries tax resident in paces like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds. "Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code," she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: "not much". Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish 'branch'. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The US could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to licence Apple patents. "If the US tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States," Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies' affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon and McDonald's in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple's methods and other cases by a US Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Apple CEO Tim Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While US companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.

Last week the European Union did something about it. The European Union's executive commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. But rather than congratulate Europe for standing up to Apple, official Washington is outraged. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan calls it an "awful" decision. Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who's likely to become Senate Majority Leader next year, says it's "a cheap money grab by the European Commission." Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accuses Europe of "targeting" American businesses. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden says it "undermines our tax treaties and paints a target on American firms in the eyes of foreign governments." P-l-e-a-s-e. - Advertisement - These are taxes America should have required Apple to pay to the U.S. Treasury. But we didn't -- because Ryan, Schumer, Hatch, Wyden, and other inhabitants of Capitol Hill haven't been able to agree on how to close the loophole that has allowed Apple, and many other global American corporations, to avoid paying the corporate income taxes they owe. Let's be clear. The products Apple sells abroad are designed and developed in the United States. So the foreign royalties Apple collects on them logically should be treated as corporate income to Apple here in America. But Apple and other Big Tech corporations like Google and Amazon -- along with much of Big Pharma, and even Starbucks -- have avoided paying hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on their worldwide earnings because they don't really sell things like cars or refrigerators or television sets that they make here and ship abroad. Their major assets are designs, software, and patented ideas. Although most of this intellectual capital originates here, it can be transferred instantly around the world -- finding its way into a vast array of products and services abroad. - Advertisement - Intellectual capital is hard to see, measure, value, and track. So it's a perfect vehicle for tax avoidance. Apple transfers its intellectual capital to an Apple subsidiary in Ireland, which then "sells" Apple products all over Europe. And it keeps most of the money there. Ireland has been more than happy to oblige by imposing on Apple a tax rate that's laughably low -- 0.005 percent in 2014, for example. Apple is America's most profitable high-tech company and also one of America's biggest tax cheats. It maintains a worldwide network of tax havens to park its global profits, some of which don't even have any employees. Sitting atop this network is "Apple Operations International," incorporated in Ireland. Never mind that Apple Operations International keeps its bank accounts and records in the United States and holds board meetings in California. It's still considered Irish. And its main job is allocating Apple's earnings among its international subsidiaries in order to keep taxes as low as possible.

Éilis Ryan (Workers Party, North Inner City) said that the it was critical to ensure the public are fully compensated for the corporate tax revenue lost because of the Apple deal. Cllr. Ryan said: The money in question is not abstract. It is very real revenue lost over decades. Apples gain has, quite literally, been paid for by the cutbacks, homelessness and evictions forced on the Irish public. In July, the Workers Party successfully passed a Dublin City Council motion for 100% mixed income public housing on ODevaney Gardens, but the proposal was deemed unworkable by the councils management. Cllr. Ryan said: The Apple windfall would remove any excuses for not implementing our proposals for ODevaney Gardens. The 13 billion lost by the state to Apple in unpaid tax revenues would be sufficient to halve housing waiting lists if used to build 72,000 houses. The Workers Party also called on Irelands MEPs to publicly endorse European efforts to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance through greater international oversight  something which they have so far failed to do. Cllr. Ryan said: It is of concern to us that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin all voted against the EUs most recent package of anti corporate tax avoidance measures in June. Tax sovereignty is a myth to justify tax minimisation. If our MEPs are serious about tackling cases like Apple, they must begin by accepting the need for global solutions. Related Link: http://workersparty.ie/apple-government-must-not-appeal...sion/ Add Your Comments >> printable version with comments RSS and atom feeds allow you to keep track of new comments on particular stories.

General Motors’ sales dropped 5 per cent from last August while Ford’s sales were down 8 per cent. Toyota’s sales were down 5 per cent, Honda’s fell 4 per cent and Nissan’s dropped 6.5 per cent. Volkswagen’s sales dropped 9 per cent. Hyundai’s sales were flat. Fiat Chrysler bucked the trend with a 3 per cent increase in sales, while Subaru’s were up 15 per cent. Both companies benefited from consumers’ increasing preference for SUVs. Sales of Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep brand rose 12 per cent. Overall industry sales dropped 4 per cent to 1.5 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. Total sales through August are up less than 1 per cent over last year. ___ Apple says several billion dollars set aside for US taxes LONDON (AP) — Apple’s chief executive says the company has put aside “several billion dollars” to pay tax liabilities in the United States as it repatriates some of its huge overseas earnings. Tim Cook told Irish state network RTE in an interview broadcast Thursday that the money, part of profits from 2014, should be brought back to the U.S. next year. He did not specify how much would be repatriated. Apple holds nearly $215 billion in cash and securities outside the U.S., much of that generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Cook has complained in the past that high U.S. taxes have discouraged the company from bringing those earnings home. This week, the European Union ordered the company based in Cupertino, California, to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland plus billions more in interest. ___ Wal-Mart cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs over the next few months as it centralizes its invoice and accounting departments, expanding a test it announced in June. The nation’s largest private employer said Thursday that the cuts will take place in all its namesake stores, confirming the move reported by The Wall Street Journal. The goal is to get workers out of the backrooms and onto the selling floors as Wal-Mart faces increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com. Wal-Mart said it believes most of the displaced workers will find new jobs that involve direct contact with shoppers and that the change was not a downsizing move. The customer-facing jobs would include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. ___ Stocks, starting September on a quiet note, notch tiny gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks staged a late recovery Thursday and finished mostly higher, led by technology and metals companies. However energy companies continued to fall with the price of oil. In early trading the Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 105 points. But those losses faded around noon and stocks finished more or less back where they started. Banks and utility companies slipped, and energy companies took losses as oil prices fell for the fourth day in a row. It has now been almost two months since the stock market has made a big move. The market recorded a tiny loss in August after an extraordinarily quiet month. ___ US productivity down in spring, while labour costs rise WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity fell in the April-June quarter by a larger amount than first estimated, while labour costs accelerated sharply. Productivity declined at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent, even worse than the 0.5 per cent drop initially reported, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It marked the third straight quarter that productivity has fallen. Labour costs rose at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent, the biggest rise since a 5.7 per cent increase in the fourth quarter. Labor costs had fallen at a 0.3 per cent rate in the first quarter. ___ Explosion at SpaceX launch pad destroys rocket, satellite CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A massive fireball and explosion erupted Thursday at SpaceX’s main launch pad, destroying a rocket as well as a satellite that Facebook was counting on to spread internet service in Africa. There were no injuries. The pad had been cleared of workers before what was supposed to be a routine pre-launch rocket engine test. SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the accident occurred while the rocket was being fueled and originated around the upper-stage oxygen tank. The explosion — heard and felt for miles around — dealt a severe blow to SpaceX, still scrambling to catch up with satellite deliveries following a launch accident last year. It’s also a setback for NASA, which has been relying on the private space company to keep the International Space Station stocked with supplies and, ultimately, astronauts. ___ US construction spending unchanged in July WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. construction spending was unchanged in July as weakness in spending on government projects offset gains in home building and the strongest month for non-residential construction on record. Construction spending was flat in July but declines in May and June were revised to show slight gains, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Spending in June is now reported up 0.9 per cent while May showed an increase of 0.1 per cent. The advance in July was led by a 1.7 per cent increase in spending on non-residential projects which rose to an all-time high of $429.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Office building and shopping centres both showed solid gains. ___ US factory activity shrinks for first time in 6 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. manufacturing contracted last month for the first time since February, as new orders and output plummeted and factories cut jobs. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its manufacturing index dropped to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. The report suggests that manufacturers continue to struggle as businesses spend less on machinery, computers and other large equipment. Auto sales have also levelled off this year after reaching a record level in 2015. ___ Weekly requests for US jobless aid rise but still near lows WASHINGTON (AP) — Slightly more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the overall levels still remain near historic lows in a positive sign for the job market. Applications for jobless aid rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000, matching its four-week moving average, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number of people collecting unemployment checks has fallen 4.4 per cent from a year ago to 2.16 million. Weekly requests for jobless benefits have stayed below the threshold of 300,000 for 78 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1970. This indicates that employers are holding onto their workers in the belief that the broader U.S. economy will continue to grow. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate rises to 3.46 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week amid expectations in financial markets that an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be on the horizon. Mortgage rates remain at historically low levels, however. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.46 per cent, up from 3.43 per cent last week. The average rate is down from 3.89 per cent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 2.77 per cent from 2.74 per cent. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.42 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 18,419.30. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.09 points to 2,170.86. The Nasdaq composite gained 13.99 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,227.21. U.S. crude oil gave up $1.54, or 3.4 per cent, to $43.16 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell $1.44, or 3.1 per cent, to $45.45 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline dropped 6 cents to $1.27 a gallon. Heating oil fell 4 cents to $1.38 a gallon. Natural gas fell 10 cents to $2.79 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Facebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

The new fixes come a week after malware hunters caught government hackers trying to exploit unknown flaws in the iPhone’s operating system to hack into the phones of a Dubai-based human rights activist and a Mexican journalist. Last week, Apple patched those vulnerabilities in an iOS update. But as it turns out, those unknown flaws, or zero-days, also affected Safari and Apple’s computer operating system OS X, given that the mobile and regular version of Safari share the same codebase. Apple quietly released the patch for Safari and for OS X on Thursday. According to Apple’s advisory, the vulnerability in Safari allowed hackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s computer by tricking him or her into visiting “a maliciously crafted website.” In simpler words, by tricking someone to clicking on a wrong link, hackers could then take over the victim’s Mac computer. This is the same technique that hackers using malware created by a shadowy Israeli surveillance vendor known as NSO Group, used in the attacks against the UAE dissident and the Mexican journalist. Read more: Hacker ‘Phineas Fisher’ Speaks on Camera for the First Time—Through a Puppet ”Not only could NSO infect iPhones at the touch of a link, but it seems that the vulnerabilities they were exploiting could be weaponized to target many different platforms,” Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told Motherboard. The company credited Citizen Lab, a digital rights watchdog at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and mobile security firm Lookout for discovering the flaw. Researchers at Citizen Lab, with the help of Lookout, analyzed the NSO malware behind the attack on the UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor two weeks ago, and alerted Apple right away. They discovered that the malware leveraged three unknown zero-days to allow attackers to take full control of the iPhone, allowing what is essentially a remote jailbreak of the device. ”Not only could NSO infect iPhones at the touch of a link, but it seems that the vulnerabilities they were exploiting could be weaponized to target many different platforms.” Those same vulnerabilities could have been used against Mac users, and thanks to Apple's new patches, hackers won't be able to weaponize those bugs anymore. ”Kudos to apple for being proactive here. They are patching vulnerabilities that could have been weaponized against OS X users,” John Scott-Railton, another senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told Motherboard. ”In the end it goes back to Mansoor's vigilance. Here is someone whose willingness to share a single suspicous SMS with researchers is leading to improvements in the security for hundreds of millions.” Want more Motherboard in your life?

Tim Cook told Irish state network RTE in an interview broadcast Thursday that the money, part of profits from 2014, should be brought back to the U.S. next year. He did not specify how much would be repatriated. Apple holds nearly $215 billion in cash and securities outside the U.S., much of that generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Cook has complained in the past that high U.S. taxes have discouraged the company from bringing those earnings home. This week, the European Union ordered the company based in Cupertino, California, to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland plus billions more in interest. ___ Wal-Mart cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs over the next few months as it centralizes its invoice and accounting departments, expanding a test it announced in June. The nation's largest private employer said Thursday that the cuts will take place in all its namesake stores, confirming the move reported by The Wall Street Journal. The goal is to get workers out of the backrooms and onto the selling floors as Wal-Mart faces increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com. Wal-Mart said it believes most of the displaced workers will find new jobs that involve direct contact with shoppers and that the change was not a downsizing move. The customer-facing jobs would include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. ___ Stocks, starting September on a quiet note, notch tiny gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks staged a late recovery Thursday and finished mostly higher, led by technology and metals companies. However energy companies continued to fall with the price of oil. In early trading the Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 105 points. But those losses faded around noon and stocks finished more or less back where they started. Banks and utility companies slipped, and energy companies took losses as oil prices fell for the fourth day in a row. It has now been almost two months since the stock market has made a big move. The market recorded a tiny loss in August after an extraordinarily quiet month. ___ US productivity down in spring, while labor costs rise WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity fell in the April-June quarter by a larger amount than first estimated, while labor costs accelerated sharply. Productivity declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent, even worse than the 0.5 percent drop initially reported, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It marked the third straight quarter that productivity has fallen. Labor costs rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the biggest rise since a 5.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Labor costs had fallen at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter. ___ Explosion at SpaceX launch pad destroys rocket, satellite CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A massive fireball and explosion erupted Thursday at SpaceX's main launch pad, destroying a rocket as well as a satellite that Facebook was counting on to spread internet service in Africa. There were no injuries. The pad had been cleared of workers before what was supposed to be a routine pre-launch rocket engine test. SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the accident occurred while the rocket was being fueled and originated around the upper-stage oxygen tank. The explosion — heard and felt for miles around — dealt a severe blow to SpaceX, still scrambling to catch up with satellite deliveries following a launch accident last year. It's also a setback for NASA, which has been relying on the private space company to keep the International Space Station stocked with supplies and, ultimately, astronauts. ___ US construction spending unchanged in July WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. construction spending was unchanged in July as weakness in spending on government projects offset gains in home building and the strongest month for non-residential construction on record. Construction spending was flat in July but declines in May and June were revised to show slight gains, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Spending in June is now reported up 0.9 percent while May showed an increase of 0.1 percent. The advance in July was led by a 1.7 percent increase in spending on non-residential projects which rose to an all-time high of $429.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Office building and shopping centers both showed solid gains. ___ US factory activity shrinks for first time in 6 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. manufacturing contracted last month for the first time since February, as new orders and output plummeted and factories cut jobs. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its manufacturing index dropped to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. The report suggests that manufacturers continue to struggle as businesses spend less on machinery, computers and other large equipment. Auto sales have also leveled off this year after reaching a record level in 2015. ___ Weekly requests for US jobless aid rise but still near lows WASHINGTON (AP) — Slightly more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the overall levels still remain near historic lows in a positive sign for the job market. Applications for jobless aid rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000, matching its four-week moving average, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number of people collecting unemployment checks has fallen 4.4 percent from a year ago to 2.16 million. Weekly requests for jobless benefits have stayed below the threshold of 300,000 for 78 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1970. This indicates that employers are holding onto their workers in the belief that the broader U.S. economy will continue to grow. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate rises to 3.46 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week amid expectations in financial markets that an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be on the horizon. Mortgage rates remain at historically low levels, however. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.46 percent, up from 3.43 percent last week. The average rate is down from 3.89 percent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 2.77 percent from 2.74 percent. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.42 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,419.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.09 points to 2,170.86. The Nasdaq composite gained 13.99 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,227.21. U.S. crude oil gave up $1.54, or 3.4 percent, to $43.16 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell $1.44, or 3.1 percent, to $45.45 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline dropped 6 cents to $1.27 a gallon. Heating oil fell 4 cents to $1.38 a gallon. Natural gas fell 10 cents to $2.79 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, September 2, 2016 Updated: 9:20 AM, September 2, 2016 BRUSSELS - Other multinationals that do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple Inc but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday. She handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish-registered subsidiaries tax resident in places like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds. "Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code," she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: "not much." Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish "branch." Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, told reporters on Tuesday that the assertion that Apple doesn't pay taxes anywhere on much of its profits is "simply wrong." "These are profits that are taxed in the United States, and for anybody that understands the U.S. worldwide tax system, this is very easy to understand," Maestri said. "We actually accrue those tax liabilities on our balance sheet on an ongoing basis and we've done it consistently over the years." Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The United States could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents. "If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States," Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies' affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon <AMZN.O> and McDonald's <MCD.N> in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple's methods and other cases by a U.S. Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Apple's Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.

That’s big news. What makes it weird is the Irish government is appealing the decision, saying they don’t want Apple’s money. That’s a story, in part, about the exciting world of European Union corporate taxation policy. It’s also very relevant to the growing American practice of highly profitable companies stashing profits overseas to avoid taxation. And at the center of the drama is Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s commissioner for competition, who also happens to be the real-life basis for Birgitte Nyborg, the main character on the Danish TV series Borgen that’s developed something of a cult following. What happened here exactly? Ireland is a member of the European Union, which operates something known as the single market, allowing companies based anywhere in the EU to seamlessly sell goods and services to other countries in the EU. This single market means that many regulatory issues and other important government functions are handled at the EU-level, through the Union’s permanent bureaucracy in Brussels. Taxation, however, is handled by the individual member states, and they vary considerably in their policies toward corporate income taxes. Many global companies take advantage of this combination of single market and diverse corporate taxation by choosing to legally locate their European operations in Ireland, which has a low corporate income tax rate. With the Irish headquarters in place, the name of the game is then to use some clever lawyering and accounting to ensure that even if the bulk of your European sales occur in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, the bulk of your European profits occur in Ireland, where they are taxed at the low Irish rate. EU authorities, however, allege that something even bigger was going on with Ireland — a special tax deal similar to deals the EU has already challenged between Amazon and Luxembourg and Starbucks and the Netherlands. The theory here is that Apple and Ireland (or Amazon and Luxembourg, or Starbucks and the Netherlands) basically negotiated an arrangement in which the company just agreed to hand over a certain amount of money and then the government agreed to say the company has fully exercised its European tax obligations. This means Ireland gets to artificially inflate its tax revenue while Apple artificially reduces its revenue, by ensuring that no taxes at all are paid to other European states. Why is this handled by the competition commissioner? The European Union does not have a unified taxing authority. But it does have a unified anti-trust agency, run by the competition commissioner. This is a very important agency because, by tradition, busting up national monopolies and ensuring continent-wide competition was one of the primary missions of the European Union. As part of that, the EU attempts to restrict member states from subsidizing particular companies. The specific fear was that the government of, say, France would direct subsidies to France-based automobile companies like Peugeot, thus unfairly disadvantaging Fiat unless Italy also stepped up with subsidies. Consequently, this kind of state assistance to firms is considered anti-competitive under EU law. But in recent years, Vestager and her competition commission have interpreted favorable corporate income tax deals as a form of illegal subsidy. She says that due to its arrangement with the Irish government, “Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International.” This, she says, is “illegal under EU state aid rules, because it gives Apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules.” Why are the Irish saying they don’t want Apple’s money? The Irish government would, of course, be glad to enjoy a $14.5 billion tax revenue windfall. Their concern, however, is that taking the money could end up killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Ireland is a small country, with about 4.5 million inhabitants*; it’s a little bit remote; and historically it’s traditionally been a bit of an economic backwater. That changed in recent decades thanks to Dublin’s booming business as a host for corporate headquarters. It’s a nice town located in a very pleasant country whose population speaks English and is well-educated. It’s a perfectly viable place to do business, in other words, and its 12.5 percent corporate income tax makes it an unusually lucrative place to book profits. Given the country’s small population, even if these foreign HQs don’t really employ very many people or generate that much economic activity relative to the overall scale of the enterprises, it amounts to a lot of extra money relative to the scale of Ireland. But while this arrangement is very convenient for foreign companies — especially high tech and pharmaceutical companies that own a lot of patents and can engage in a lot of fancy accounting footwork to locate profits wherever they like — it’s deeply annoying to some of Ireland’s fellow EU member states, who see the country as making a living as a parasitical tax haven. Technically speaking, the EU ruling on the Apple matter doesn’t prevent Ireland from continuing to make tax competition the basis of its economic strategy. But the broad implication is that the EU is looking at using competition law as a basis for forcing member states to begin applying corporate tax law in a more uniform way. That’s a clear and present danger to Ireland’s overall economic approach, so the Irish are pushing back. What does this have to do with Apple avoiding American taxes? The bad news for an American company that’s reached a convenient arrangement with a low-tax foreign company is that the American government collects corporate income tax on a global basis. If you are an American company, you owe taxes on all your profits, wherever the profits are earned. You can take a credit for whatever taxes you pay to foreign governments, so there’s no double taxation. But saving a bundle by locating in low-tax Ireland doesn’t actually save you any money, it just increases what you owe to Uncle Sam. Except there’s a loophole. You are allowed to “defer” paying taxes on your foreign profits as long as that money is still owned by your foreign subsidiary. The theory is that you might end up using the money to finance a foreign investment next year or something, so it shouldn’t really be taxed. The reality is that big, highly profitable American firms are deferring taxation on over $1.4 trillion of dollars of profits that they clearly have no intention of ever using to finance investment. What they’re doing is hoping that Congress will change the law and allow that money to be repatriated at a lower rate. When that happens, the money will be paid out as dividends and share buybacks. But until then, Apple and other global companies taking advantage of the loopholes are tapping the bond market and going into debt to finance their buybacks even while accumulating cash in foreign accounts. * Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the population of the Republic of Ireland as 6.4 million. That is the approximate population of the island of Ireland, but some of those people live in Northern Ireland which is a region of the United Kingdom and not part of the country that this article is about.

Apple Announces App Store Cleanup By John Voorhees Apple has announced a plan to clean up the App Store. Apple’s developer site states it plainly: To make it easier for customers to find great apps that fit their needs, we want to ensure that apps available on the App Store are functional and up-to-date. We are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps, removing apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines, or are outdated. Beginning September 7, 2016, the same day as the event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium where Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 7, App Review will begin evaluating all existing apps on the App Store to determine if they are functional and meet App Store guidelines. Some of the highlights: If App Review determines that changes need to be made to an app, the developer will be contacted and given 30 days to update it, after which it will be removed from the App Store; If an app crashes on launch, it will be removed from sale immediately; and Existing customers will still have access to apps removed from the App Store. In addition, Apple announced in an email to developers that going forward, app names will be limited to 50 characters. Apple explained that long app names, which developers use to try to influence search results, provide no value for customers, particularly because they are too long to display in full on the App Store. Eight years and over two million apps later, the App Store is long overdue for a cleanup. Abandoned and broken apps create a real discovery problem for customers. We are well past the time when the number of apps served as meaningful bragging rights for Apple keynotes. The directness in tone and relatively short time frame given to developers to make changes to apps sends a clear message – Apple is serious about cleaning up the App Store. Developers with neglected apps had better pay attention if they want to remain on the App Store.

It followed an investigation that found tax deals between Ireland and Apple breached EU state aid rules. Mr Cook used two interviews to attack the Commission’s explosive claim that the Irish deals meant its tax rate in the country was just 0.005% in 2014. He claimed Apple’s worldwide tax rate that year was 26.1%.

They just picked a number from I don’t know where.” “It’s maddening. It’s maddening and disappointing. “It’s clear that this comes from a political place. It has no basis in fact or in law.” He went further, claiming the firm was being targetted as part of wider plans by Brussels. He said: “I think it’s clear that there is a desire to harmonise tax rates the EU.” The Commission found Apple had diverted a big chunk of the profits generated on sales throughout Europe, Africa and India through a “so called head office” that was not liable for tax. Tim Cook is not happy with the ruling (Photo: Getty) The row centres on two tax agreements with the Irish Government, the first dating back to 1991. Mr Cook said yesterday: “This is a huge overreach that represents retrospective activity and is completely unfair.” He went on: “This is like playing a basketball game where you score a couple of three pointers and later someone tells you they were actually two pointers.” Mr Cook said Apple paid $400million (£300m) corporation tax in Ireland in 2014. He spoke as members of Ireland’s fragile minority Government decided whether to back Finance Minister Michael Noonan’s call for an immediate legal challenge. The cabinet met on Wednesday but failed to reach agreement and will meet again on today (FRI).

Nearly a decade later, Android powers about four of every five smartphones in the world. At least 1.4 billion people around the world use Android, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company announced last year. Google, however, makes very few of those devices itself, instead licensing the Android software to hardware manufacturers like Samsung, LG and HTC. That has given Android one major advantage over Apple’s iPhone lineup: Consumer choice. Android phones are available in a wide range of sizes and formats, ranging from cheap basic models to expensive high-end handsets that can be dunked underwater or dropped without fear of damaging them. Apple, meanwhile, only sells five different iPhones, not counting color and storage space variations, and they all tend to be relatively expensive. Google recently based a major ad campaign around this very idea, featuring the slogan “be together, not the same.” But this approach also hinders Android in some ways. Whereas Apple controls iPhones’ software and hardware, companies that make and sell Android smartphones typically supplement the operating system with their own features and apps. This has the effect of creating a fragmented experience for Android users, since the software and user interface varies between different devices. Using an Android device made by Samsung likely won’t feel the same as using one created by LG or HTC, unlike different iPhone models, which don’t vary much in terms of software. It also makes the process of updating Android a slow and onerous one; pushing out a new software version requires both carriers and device makers to approve it and possibly modify it before it reaches the consumer. This is not only a disadvantage for Android device users, who must wait longer to get Google’s newest features and security patches, but it also poses a challenge to developers creating new apps and features for Android. “Fragmentation is [Android’s] number one problem,” says J.P. Gownder, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. “It holds Android back.” An exception to this rule is Google’s own Nexus lineup of smartphones, which usually run a barebones version of Android without modifications and are the first to get crucial software updates. Now, Google may be showing signs of changing its approach to Android and smartphones more broadly. The move, experts say, appears motivated by a desire to make the Android experience more uniform. Technology news site The Information reported earlier this year that Google is looking to take more control of its Nexus devices, which the company typically creates in collaboration with hardware partners. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said this summer that Google would “be more opinionated about the design of [Nexus] phones” moving forward. And just this week, tech blog Android Central reported that Google may even go so far as to add features on top of so-called “vanilla Android” for its Nexus phones. A rebranding effort, possibly along with a new name besides “Nexus,” might follow. Google declined to comment for this story. Why the shift? Nexus devices are Google’s way of showing smartphone makers what Android is capable of being. Establishing a firmer grip on them could be a way to nudge manufacturers in a certain direction. “They’re trying to show the partners and the ecosystem what a good Android experience looks like,” says Gownder. That doesn’t mean Google wants every Android smartphone maker to quit tinkering with the software. Rather, Google may be trying to streamline the various versions of Android out there, says Tuong Nguyen, a principal research analyst at Gartner. Clarifying Android’s purpose and vision is even more important as the platform moves from phones and tablets to other devices, like smartwatches, televisions, and even cars. Nguyen compared the situation to children on a field trip. They may branch off and venture to different areas when exploring a museum. But the teacher will eventually wrangle them towards the next display or exhibit. “I understand you have your own goals,” Nguyen said. “But let’s all head in the same direction.” These steps would mark a significant departure from Google’s approach towards smartphones. It’s also a risky move. Nexus phones are popular with a subset of Android users exactly because they offer a stripped-down, “clean” experience. Any tweaking on Google’s part might ruin that. That said, Google could do plenty of interesting things by being more bold with Android. The company’s recent focus on fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning, for instance, could result in much smarter smartphones. But fully unlocking that potential might require controlling both the hardware and software sides of smartphone design (count that as another advantage for Apple, which is reportedly making strides in smartphone-based AI). Just look at the latest Google software, like Google Assistant, a promising Siri-like tool that can understand and answer specific questions, to get a glimpse of what might be possible. That’s potential that Android fans should cheer. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager gestures during a news conference on Ireland's tax dealings with Apple Inc at the European Commission in Brussels. The European Commission began probing some 1,000 companies in up to 23 EU states in 2013. Nonetheless, officials reckon the Commission may choose a company closer to home for any major new inquiry Multinational companies can expect the European Commission to press on with a crack down on sweetheart tax deals after handing Apple a breathtaking demand for 13 billion euros, officials and experts said yesterday. But Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager may be tempted to train her fire on European companies after a string of investigations of U.S. global giants that, especially after Tuesday's Apple verdict, has enraged the United States. The order to the iPhone maker to pay back taxes to Ireland on the grounds that Dublin illegally favoured Apple with a tax regime that amounted to a competition-distorting subsidy was the biggest of 38 decisions by Vestager since the Commission began probing some 1,000 companies in up to 23 EU states in 2013. Another U.S. firm, coffee chain Starbucks was ordered to repay up to 30 million euros to the Netherlands and a unit of Italy's Fiat must hand a similar sum to Luxembourg. In a separate case involving 35 firms in Belgium, many were not identified but some were also from the United States. The Commission will not say when a decision is likely on two outstanding cases involving two more U.S. firms, Amazon and McDonald's, both in Luxembourg. Set alongside a series of high-profile antitrust probes into Google and Vestager has a case to answer on charges of anti-American activity - albeit one that she strenuously denies. Nonetheless, people involved in competition law in Europe, many of whom declined to speak on the record for this story, reckon the Commission may choose a company closer to home for any major new inquiry. "It is quite obvious that the Commission will not be able to investigate 1,000 tax rulings. It will only go after manifest violations," said Georg Berrisch, partner at law firm Baker Botts, who noted the fertile ground the Commission may have in evidence turned up in 2014 by leaked data from Luxembourg. "It will have to pick and choose a few cases, maybe look into European companies. Luxleaks mentioned several European companies having tax deals with Luxembourg," Berrisch said. Vestager, arguably the most powerful official in the EU due to her individual power to rule on competition cases across the 28-nation bloc, makes no secret of her reliance on others at times to provide the evidence that can justify her inquiries. For all the fury in Washington over Apple, that and the other current cases were all launched on the back of revelations provided by a U.S. Senate subcommittee inquiry into taxation. It is unclear how many companies may face back tax demands in the end. Given limited resources, officials and observers said, the Commission's competition directorate is likely to focus on a fairly small number in the expectation that success - still to be tested in court - can deter others from going to extremes in reducing their global tax burdens. Jonas Koponen at law firm Linklaters called the massive tax demand for Apple a wake-up call for others to be wary of how political institutions, not just in Europe, were responding to popular pressure to gather more taxes from rich corporations and the danger that posed of legal turmoil and reputational damage. "The amounts at stake may intensify the political pressures both within the EU and from outside the EU," he said. "Companies must now more than ever carefully assess whether any agreements or rulings they receive from national tax authorities are compliant with state aid principles." It was a point inferred by Vestager herself. Asked at a news conference on Tuesday whether it was fair to penalise a company which "felt that they were abiding by the rules" in agreeing a tax regime for its profits with Irish government, the straight-talking Dane said some should listen to their feelings more. "If my effective tax rate would be 0.05 percent falling to 0.005 percent," she said, "I would have felt that maybe I should have a second look at my tax bill." Manwhile, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook says the company has put aside "several billion dollars" to pay tax liabilities in the United States as overseas earnings are repatriated. Cook told Irish state network RTE in an interview broadcast yesterday that repatriation should occur next year as profits from 2014 are repatriated. Top 10 companies with the largest untaxed earnings held offshore The European Commission push to force Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes has put a spotlight on the fact that U.S. companies hold some $2.43 trillion in untaxed earnings offshore, according to Audit Analytics. Here are the 10 companies with the largest offshore earnings hoards: Microsoft $108.3 billion General Electric $104.0 billion Apple $91.5 billion Pfizer $80.0 billion IBM $68.1 billion Merck & Co $59.2 billion Alphabet (Google) $58.3 billion Johnson & Johnson $58.0 billion Cisco Systems $58.0 billion Exxon Mobil $51.0 billion Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Business The Transport, Maritime and Communication Ministry will assume the...

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong & Keith Collins September 01, 2016 Apple’s cleaning house in the App Store in preparation for its big iPhone event next week. The company today (Sept. 1) updated its App Store guidelines to limit the length of an app’s name to 50 characters. Apps that break the rule will be booted from the store if developers don’t make changes within 30 days of being contacted by Apple. The review process will go into effect Sept. 7, the same day it’s expected to unveil the iPhone 7. Quite a few of the top 100 iOS apps currently don’t make the cut. Thirteen of the top 100 paid apps would have to shrink the verbiage in their names. The ratio of offending titles is the same, coincidentally, for the top 100 free apps. Apple recommends an ideal name length of 23 characters. Here they are: Popular apps that must shrink their names to comply with Apple’s new rule From the top 100 paid apps Characters Cartoon Network Superstar Soccer: Goal!!! – Multiplayer Sports Game Starring Your Favorite Characters 101 Word Swag – Cool fonts, typography generator, creative quotes, and text over pic editor! 88 Tabs & Chords by Ultimate Guitar – Learn and play acoustic guitar, bass and ukulele 83 TurboScan™ Pro – document & receipt scanner: scan multiple pages and photos to PDF 82 Fontmania – Add Artworks, Text Captions, and Typography Designs to Your Photos! 79 NOAA Hi-Def Radar Pro – Storm Warnings, Hurricane Tracker & Weather Forecast 77 NOAA Radar Pro – Severe Weather Alerts, Forecast & Hurricane Tracker 68 Tiny Memories – Photo Editor for Baby and Pregnancy Milestones 62 Stick Texting – The Emoji Emoticons Killer (Emoticon Emojis) 60 Tiny Scanner+ – PDF scanner to scan document, receipt & fax 59 Couch to 5K® – Running App, Training Coach and GPS Tracker 58 Scanner Pro 7 – Document and receipt PDF scanner with OCR 57 Dark Sky – Hyperlocal Weather, Radar, and Storm Alerts 54 From the top 100 free apps Characters Prisma – Art Photo Editor with Free Picture Effects & Cool Image Filters for Instagram Pics and Selfies 103 Groupon – Deals, Coupons & Shopping: Discounts on Local Restaurants, Events, Hotels, Yoga & Spas 96 Checkout 51 – Grocery coupons, shopping deals, cash back offers, store discounts and savings app 96 ESPN Fantasy Sports – Play Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey and More Games 80 The Weather Channel – Temperature, Local Weather Alerts, Warnings & Radar 73 After School – Funny Anonymous School News for Confessions & Compliments 72 Google Maps – Real-time navigation, traffic, transit, and nearby places 71 Free VPN Proxy by Betternet | Unlimited VPN to Access Any Site 62 Kindle – Read Books, eBooks, Magazines, Newspapers & Textbooks 62 Free Music – Unlimited Music Streamer and Cloud Songs Play.er 61 Amazon App: shop, browse, scan, compare, and read reviews 57 Mercari: The best shopping marketplace to buy & sell 52 Yahoo Fantasy Football, Basketball, Hockey, Baseball 52 An analysis of a larger range of apps by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm, showed an even higher ratio of rule-breaking names. The firm looked at the top 1,500 paid and free apps, and found that 27% of the free apps have names that are too long, while 22% of the top paid apps break the character limit. Of the 1,500 top-grossing apps, 24% have names that contravene the new rule. Apple says publishers have been “gaming” the App Store search engine by cramming in keywords to improve their visibility in search results. Apple’s new app guidelines are explicit about banning this search-engine optimization technique: “App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.” The guidelines carry the additional warning to publishers to not meddle with their apps’ metadata, including descriptions and screenshots. “Don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system.” As part of the App Store clean up, the company will check that apps are functioning correctly. Apps that crash on launch will be removed immediately. Developers will otherwise be contacted by Apple and given 30 days to make changes. Apple has been tinkering with the App Store as it grows more crowded, including offering publishers new revenue models, like subscriptions, and revealing plans for ads on the platform.

Europe has cracked down on special breaks for Apple Corp.  (Mark Lennihan / AP)   Thu., Sept. 1, 2016 The world’s biggest, richest corporations spend a lot of time and money to make sure they pay the absolute minimum amount of tax they can get away with. Many are very good at that, and the result is they get to keep a lot more of what they make and governments have a lot less to spend on services for their people. Now the European Commission has blown the whistle on one of the biggest tax avoidance schemes going – special breaks granted by the Irish government to Apple Inc., the biggest, richest corporation of them all. This week the commission ruled that Apple received illegal tax benefits from Ireland to the tune of 13 billion euros, or more than $19 billion, and must pay the money back. It’s far from clear what will happen in the end. Apple is outraged, and after all the appeals and deals down the road who knows how much – if any – it will end up paying? Washington is angry, too. It argues that Apple’s unpaid taxes should eventually go to Uncle Sam, and doesn’t want the European taxman getting his hands on it. Setting aside those squabbles, however, the European ruling is a blow for a basic principle that has been too often brushed aside in recent years. Simply put, it’s that successful, profitable companies should pay their fair share of taxes and help the societies that support them remain prosperous and healthy. Fundamentally, it’s not a complicated idea, but it’s something that many big multinational corporations simply haven’t honoured. Instead, they have found complicated ways to stash hundreds of billions – in fact, trillions – of dollars away from their domestic tax collectors. The London-based Tax Justice Network says a staggering $31 trillion may be tucked away, with a tax loss to various governments amounting to $280 billion.

Ireland taxes corporations at a rate of 12.5 per cent, and Apple booked profits from all its sales in Europe in Ireland. But rather than paying even Ireland’s relatively low rate, the company was allowed to shift almost all those profits to a paper “head office” that was effectively stateless and therefore not taxable anywhere. The result of the Irish maneuver, according to the European Commission, was that Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of just 1 per cent on its European profits over the past decade. In 2014, its tax rate was a vanishingly small 0.005 per cent. Nothing illegal about all that, says the company, since Dublin happily went along with it in order to reap the benefits of having Apple in its backyard. The commission disagrees, saying it amounted to a special, illegal deal. The courts will eventually sort it all out. None of this was a secret. In fact, it was a report by the U.S. Senate in 2013 that shone a bright light on Apple’s European arrangements and concluded that the company had used them to avoid paying $44 billion in American taxes at the time. That piqued the interest of European officials, who started poking into the company’s Irish deal. Legal or not, Apple’s arrangement is a scandal. By playing governments off against each other and employing battalions of lawyers and lobbyists to squeeze its tax bill down to almost zero, the company chips away at society’s ability to pay for everything from education to infrastructure. And it offloads the tax burden onto others less able to afford it. Apple is hardly alone in this. Other big multinationals play the same game, while corporations and wealthy individuals hide trillions from the taxman in ways both legal and illegal. By one estimate, affluent Canadians and corporations have stashed some $200 billion in offshore tax havens, resulting in a loss of tax revenue of about $8 billion a year. And an investigation by the Star and the CBC earlier this year found that the federal government has opened up dozens of tax loopholes that allowed Canadian corporations to avoid paying tax on $55 billion in international profits over the past five years. Closing such loopholes and ending sweetheart tax deals would go a long way to ensuring that everyone – even the Apples of the world – pays their fair share. It’s not tax gouging, just basic justice.

Over the last few years, the music industry's long-untouched approach to releasing albums has been steadily chopped to pieces by alternate distribution methods, and artists finding ingenious ways to subvert the traditional album rollout. Whether it's the surprise album, the exclusive release, the brand partnership, the windowed rollout, or any combination of the three -- or even surprises via snail mail -- here are 20 innovative album releases from the past three years.  From Beyonce to Frank Ocean, Breaking Down the Mechanics, and Politics, Behind Streaming Exclusives The Justin Timberlake Album: The 20/20 Experience Pts. I and II Release Date: March 15, 2013; Sept. 27, 2013 Strategy: It had been more than six years since Timberlake put out an album when he released lead single "Suit & Tie" featuring Jay Z in January of 2013, and after an extended and successful foray into acting, fans were ready for his return. Accordingly, the first of the two albums debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 968,000 copies in its first week, the highest sales week of 2013. Shortly afterward he announced the companion second side, released almost exactly six weeks later, with the double-packaged The 20/20 Experience – The Complete Experience arriving on the same day. Timberlake wasn't the first to split albums in half, but his was a remarkably successful effort. The Jay Z Album: Magna Carta...Holy Grail Release Date: July 4, 2013 Strategy: No stranger to changing the game, Jay Z partnered with Samsung in a deal worth a reported $20 million to release his 12th solo studio album on the 4th of July, delivering digital downloads to the first one million Samsung Galaxy phone owners who downloaded a custom app upon release. Jay claimed that made MCHG a platinum album overnight, saying that Samsung purchased each copy for $5, and the RIAA agreed -- but Billboard's charts department did not, arguing that sales count when people buy the albums, not corporations. Regardless, when it became available for sale on July 7, fans still bought it in droves, and MCHG became Hov's 13th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 (including collaborative projects with R. Kelly, Linkin Park and Kanye West), selling 528,000 copies in its first week. The Beyonce, Part I Album: Beyonce Release Date: Dec. 13, 2013 Strategy: When people talk about the "surprise album" release strategy these days, Beyonce's self-titled fifth solo album is generally held up as the prototype. Conceived, recorded and filmed (individual videos for all 14 songs, as well as three additional videos, were made available upon release) in secret, Beyonce caught fans and the industry by surprise when she released the album -- right in the middle of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, no less -- exclusively via the iTunes Store without even any indication she had been working on one at all. Beyonce debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 617,000 copies sold, despite the fact it had only been available for three days of the tracking week, and set in motion a trend that permeated release strategies ever since. The U2 Album: Songs of Innocence Release Date: Sept. 9, 2014 Strategy: Long associated with Apple's iconic iPod ads in the mid-2000s, U2 partnered with the company to release Songs of Innocence directly to iPhone users' iTunes libraries, with their single "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)" the soundtrack to a media campaign reportedly valued at $100 million. The unorthodox release made the album available to 500 million people worldwide for free, with Apple announcing that 81 million people "experienced" the album in its first month of availability. The release was certainly effective in terms of scale and revenue, but retailers -- left in the dark as Apple flexed a five-week exclusive window -- and fans were less than pleased. A month later, Bono apologized, saying, "I had this beautiful idea and we got carried away with ourselves." The Global Listening Event Album: What a Time to Be Alive Release Date: Sept. 20, 2015 Strategy: Drake and Future's What a Time to Be Alive album/mixtape had so much buzz that fans were creating unaffiliated web sites with countdowns that led to nothing, all designed to capitalize on the feverish hype of the two hottest rappers in the game at the moment putting out a full-length joint project. But what Drake did was use his OVO Sound radio to debut the record in its entirety -- the first time he would utilize that particular platform to create what he called a "global listening event" (DJ Khaled and others would use the same formula). The album became available immediately after the show ended as an Apple exclusive, and shot straight to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 -- the second No. 1 album of 2015 for each artist. Frank Ocean's Album Is the Straw that Broke Universal Music's Back (and It May Get Him Sued) The Eric Church Album: Mr. Misunderstood Release Date: Nov. 3, 2015 Strategy: Technology, digital, streaming, downloads, exclusives -- there have been a lot of buzz words flying around the music industry in recent years as everybody races to embrace the next new trend. But then came Nov. 3, when members of Eric Church's fan club opened their collective mailboxes to find a brand new album -- a physical CD, no less! -- delivered directly to them with no prior warning. A bit of retail subterfuge that occurred ahead of time left some stores in the dark and others confused, while the album was marketed as an iTunes digital download exclusive for its first seven days before making its way to streaming services. The Adele Album: 25 Release Date: Nov. 20, 2015 Strategy: With streaming consumption growing more dominant by the week, most artists would find it risky to cut out the platform when releasing an album. But Adele is not most artists. Withholding a new album from streaming services is not exactly a novel tactic -- Adele did it for her last album, 21, as did Taylor Swift, Coldplay and others -- but it certainly helped the British singer shatter the 15-year-old record for most sales in a single week with 3.38 million copies in the first seven days after its release. This June, seven months after 25 his shelves, Adele finally released the album to streaming services, which promptly propelled it back into the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The David Bowie Album: Blackstar Release Date: Jan. 8, 2016 Strategy: In life, there's only one really final hurrah, and it can be difficult to get right. But not for David Bowie. Having hidden his cancer from all but a few close acquaintances, he revealed the creepy, prophetic video for lead single "Lazarus" on Jan. 7, in which he sings of being in heaven while strapped to a hospital bed. Three days later, the legendary artist was dead, leaving behind a final goodbye for fans that loved him worldwide. It may not have been an innovative release strategy, per se, but you won't find many imitators -- that's for sure. The Rihanna Album: Anti Release Date: Jan. 29, 2016 Strategy: Taking a leaf from Jay Z's book, Rihanna partnered with Samsung for the release of her long-awaited Anti album in a deal that, all assets included, was rumored to be worth $25 million. That included a sponsorship for her world tour as well as an eight-part interactive "diary," essentially an app that allowed fans to explore different virtual rooms that were unlocked over November and December of 2015. Album delays left fans hanging after the last room opened, however, until the end of January when her single "Work" featuring Drake finally emerged on radio. Anti was released the night of Jan. 27 as a Tidal streaming and download exclusive -- the most high-profile exclusive for the service to that point -- and as a free download for one million Samsung users bundled with a free 60-day trial of Tidal, although an early leak marred the rollout. It was released widely to digital distributors on Jan. 29, but the awkward timing of the release meant Anti initially debuted at No. 27 on the Billboard 200 based on just its first day of availability, before it soared to the summit the following week. The Kanye West Album: The Life of Pablo Release Date: Feb. 14, 2016 Strategy: "Unprecedented" might be a bit of an understatement for the strangest album rollout in recent history. But Kanye is known for pushing the envelope, and this time he kept pushing it even after Pablo had been released. West initially premiered the album at his Yeezy 3 fashion show on Feb. 11, live-streamed both on Tidal and at movie theaters across the world (fans received a voucher for a digital download of the album when purchasing tickets), even though the album still wasn't done. Then, following his Feb. 14th appearance on Saturday Night Live, he finally released the album, initially as an exclusive stream on Tidal and as a $20 download on his own site, only to remove the download option a short time later because he was unhappy with the masters. But Pablo remained streaming on Tidal for six weeks, even as West continued to tinker with the final mixes -- tweaking production, adding lyrics and verses -- and declared the album would never be for sale. But on April 1, Pablo was released to all streaming services and digital retailers, and Pablo eventually became the first-ever album to debut atop the Billboard 200 albums chart with the majority of its equivalent album units coming from streams. (Tidal declined to report its streams to Nielsen Music in the six weeks prior.) Chance the Rapper Switches Up His Release Strategy With 'Coloring Book' The 1975 Album: I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It Release Date: Feb. 26, 2016 Strategy: Playing favorites without committing fully to one service, The 1975 debuted their latest album -- their first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 -- on paid subscription streaming services, rolling the dice by excluding Spotify for the first two weeks of its release. That's a strategy that Coldplay and others have employed in the past, but The 1975 added a wrinkle by padding their pockets with Apple money; in the week leading up to the album's release, they performed the first-ever live event put on by Apple's Beats 1 Radio, an exclusive stream that debuted the night before the album's release. The Beyonce, Part II Album: Lemonade Release Date: April 23, 2016 Strategy: "Formation" appeared on YouTube with no advance warning on Feb. 6, the day before Beyonce performed the song during her explosive Super Bowl Halftime Show set. The album itself got a cryptic seven-day teaser trailer, promising a "world premiere event" on HBO the night of April 23. What arrived that night was a 60-minute "visual album" with each of the project's 12 tracks soundtracking a film about betrayal, hurt, acceptance and forgiveness that HBO allowed viewers to watch for free, regardless of whether they owned a subscription. The album arrived that evening after the premiere event ended as a download and streaming exclusive on Tidal, before being released for sale to digital retailers 24 hours later, debuting atop the Billboard 200. Lemonade remains a Tidal exclusive for streaming, with the service saying the window will last "in perpetuity." The Drake Album: Views Release Date: April 29, 2016 Strategy: For an album with such a long, drawn out build up, Views arrived in the shadow of Beyonce's Lemonade, released just six days earlier. But led as it was by the monster smash "One Dance," its arrival as an Apple exclusive shattered records immediately -- eventually, he would own four of the top five one-week streaming records ever, despite being sectioned off into Apple Music for its first two weeks (though its singles were available on Spotify and others.) Drake is believed to have the closest relationship with Apple among all the artists it has done deals with, and the marketing push behind the album's release -- a tour sponsorship, iTunes takeovers, sponsored videos, OVO Sound Radio etc. -- helped it become the highest-selling album released in 2016, and helped Drake rule all summer '16. The Radiohead Album: A Moon Shaped Pool Release Date: May 8, 2016 Strategy: It began, in typical Radiohead fashion, with a mystery: on April 30, some fans received a leaflet in the mail with the phrase, "Burn the Witch," and the following day the band's website and social networks all went dark. Slowly, teaser videos and clues leaked out until May 3, when the stop motion animation video for the song "Burn the Witch" officially declared a new album to be imminent, followed by a mid-day, 2 p.m. release on Mother's Day, no less. Pool was released right away to digital retailers and paid subscription streaming services -- aka, not Spotify -- for the first six weeks, until the band eventually released it to Spotify June 17. The latest in a decade's worth of creative release strategies for the group. The Chance the Rapper Album: Coloring Book Release Date: May 12, 2016 Strategy: Not tied to a label and determined to keep his music free, Chance the Rapper cut a deal with Apple Music to release his third solo project, Coloring Book, as an exclusive stream for two weeks with no download option -- a reprise of sorts to the deal Apple gave his 2015 Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment project Surf, which remains the only album "sold" for free via the iTunes Store. As a result, Coloring Book became the first-ever album to appear on the Billboard 200 chart based on streams alone, debuting at No. 8 with 38,000 equivalent album units based on 57.3 million first-week streams. Inside Rihanna's Long, Rocky Road to Releasing 'Anti' The Ariana Grande Album: Dangerous Woman Release Date: May 20, 2016 Strategy: Grande was active in the promotion strategy in the buildup to this album, utilizing Instagram, Snapchat, TV performances and multiple web sites to help generate buzz. And while the album was released widely on May 20 to all retailers and distributors, she used Apple Music to exclusively debut a new song from the LP every day in the seven days leading up to Dangerous Woman's release. In that way, she was able to leverage Apple's exclusive offerings, while not really committing to an exclusive. The Epic AF Album: Epic AF Release Date: July 17, 2016 Strategy: Label compilations are nothing new, while playlists will probably never go away. But in a streaming world, Epic Records figured they could be one and the same, and packaged a collection of singles unattached to other projects together into a playlist, slapped a label on it, called it an album and landed a top 10 debut based on streaming equivalent and track equivalent albums only. Expect to see more labels go this route to fill otherwise-barren release schedule periods. The Frank Ocean Album: Blond Release Date: Aug. 20, 2016 Strategy: Disenchanted with his label, Def Jam, and seeking freedom from his recording contract, Ocean pulled a coup by delivering the visual album Endless to his label in order to fulfill his deal, paying back as much as $5 million, according to one source, to Universal Music for a fresh slate. But the bigger, more surprising maneuver came the following day, when Ocean delivered the "real" album -- a 17-track release titled Blond -- to Apple as a download and streaming exclusive via his own label, Boys Don't Cry, without Def Jam or Universal's involvement. It was a rare, bold move -- and it could conceivably lead to a lawsuit. But more than that, it proved that for a certain type of top-tier artist with a devoted fan base, just about anything is on the table. The De La Soul Album: And The Anonymous Nobody Release Date: Aug. 26, 2016 Strategy: Hamstrung by digital copyright laws and unable to make money off their wildly influential back catalog due to sample clearance issues, De La found themselves in a bit of what The New York Times called a "digital limbo," and turned to their fans -- via a successful Kickstarter campaign -- for help. The result is the group's first album in over a decade, and a welcome return for one of the innovators of the genre. The Jason Aldean Album: They Don't Know Release Date: Sept. 9, 2016 Strategy: Long a proponent of fair compensation for the team of writers and producers that help him craft his albums, Aldean has waffled in the past on his view of streaming services, removing his last album from Spotify in November 2014 only to return it to the service a year later due to fan demand. But for his next one, out in September, he's trying to compromise by withholding it from all streaming services for one month, encouraging his fans to buy his album before he makes it available as a stream. "If you want something that’s brand new, you’re willing to pay the price for it," he told Billboard about the decision. "And then, after it’s been out for a while, you may get it at a discount. That’s just business 101."

She handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish registered subsidiaries tax resident in paces like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds. "Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code," she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: "not much". Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish 'branch'. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The U.S. could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to licence Apple patents. "If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States," Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies' affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon and McDonald's in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple's methods and other cases by a U.S. Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Apple CEO Tim Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Companies like Apple will bring back billions if there's a 'tax holiday' – but last time it was a 'disaster' Thursday Sep 1, 2016 at 3:33 PM Dan Bobkoff AP Apple's CEO Tim Cook Thursday continued to rail against the European Competition Commission's ruling that the company got a special deal from Ireland to avoid taxes, which is against European Union rules. The commission is ordering Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes. Both Apple and Ireland strongly disagree with the ruling, and plan to appeal. In an interview with Ireland's public broadcaster, RTE, Cook called it an "invalid, politically-based ruling."  And he said something else that raised some eyebrows:  "We provisioned several billion dollars for the US for payment as soon as we repatriate it, and right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year," Cook told RTE's Paschal Sheehy.  That means Apple may bring some of the billions it earned selling Macs and iPhones in countries like Germany and Ireland back to the US, where it would be subject to US taxes.  Apple currently has a whopping cash pile of roughly $230 billion, but most is kept overseas to avoid paying US corporate taxes. Only about $16 billion of Apple's money is currently held in the US.  Cook didn't say exactly how much it might return to Apple's home country, but he's been a vocal critic of US tax policy.  The company was among those that joined a lobbying effort to push for a one-time tax "holiday" to bring some of that money home at a lower tax rate.  But the last time the US tried this, it didn't work out so well.    It was 2004, Apple was riding high on iPods – not iPhones – and Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act.  It had many provisions but one of them was a one-time tax break for companies that keep a lot of their foreign profits overseas.  Instead of paying the normal US corporate tax rate, that year they could pay just 5.25%.  And they did. In droves. According to a paper by Chuck Marr and Chye-Ching Huang at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:  Pfizer brought back about $37 billion.  Merck repatriated nearly $16 million And Apple repatriated $755 million.  In sum, about $300 billion made it back to the US in 2005, up from an average of roughly $60 billion in the years before.  Congress hoped the tax holiday would bring in lots of revenue that could be used to create jobs, repair roads, and generally improve the US economy. Instead, despite Congress's efforts to prohibit it, the companies spent a lot of their savings on dividends and stock buybacks. And many of the companies that benefited the most actually cut thousands of jobs shortly after. Pfizer, for instance, cut 10,000 jobs that same year, according to the paper. Ford repatriated $850 million and then laid off 10,000 workers in the US. "Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D—even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained," wrote the authors of another major study on the effects of the tax holiday.  That paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, and called "Watch What I Do, Not What I Say," says for every dollar companies brought back to the US, there was a $1 increase in shareholder payouts.  "For several years, it was considered to be a disaster," Marr told Business Insider. His own analysis suggests tax holidays have little economic benefit. And some right-leaning think tanks, like The Heritage Foundation, agree. Most still have plenty of cash in the US, despite keeping foreign earnings on other continents. That means they're not cash constrained and don't necessarily need to bring money back to the States to invest in research or workers. In fact, many companies repatriate money anyway at the higher rate, such as when they shut down an international division.  "If you give a holiday, you're giving it to companies that would done it anyway," Marr said.  And there's another hazard. By making these occasional tax holidays, rather than a permanent change to corporate tax policy, companies can lobby Congress to give them a temporary break, bring some money back to the US, and then go back to their old ways of keeping money overseas until the next holiday comes around. And companies like Apple are hoping they'll get some kind of corporate tax cut soon.  NOW WATCH: Paul Krugman weighs in on the Apple tax debate See Also:Paul Krugman weighs in on the Apple tax debateWhat just happened to Apple, explainedThe maker of EpiPens says it gives thousands to schools free  and it may get huge tax breaks in the process SEE ALSO: What happened to Apple in Ireland, explained About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     “Hey Siri, call Sébastien on Skype” By Christian Zibreg, Sep 1, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments Apple’s made a rare move of publishing multiple blog posts to whet our appetite for Siri’s upcoming third-party integration on iOS 10. We already detailed how Siri will work with popular messaging/payments apps and allow you to search photos inside third-party apps like Pinterest, just by using your voice. Now, we take a closer look at how Apple’s personal digital assistant can interact with VoIP apps like Skype, Vonage and others. Here’s Apple’s sneak peek at some of the new ways you can use Siri to place Voice over IP (VoIP) calls on Skype or Vonage, and call co-workers via Cisco Spark. “Hey Siri, using Essentials call Michael” In one example, a user invokes Siri and says, “Call Michael using Essentials”, ”Using Essentials, call Michael” or some such. Thanks to SiriKit and iOS 10’s much-improved Phone app (that now integrates Recents, Favorites and Contacts from VoIP apps), the personal assistant knows who Michael is on Vonage Essentials and uses this contact information to call him on Vonage. Or, if you use Skype, you could say something like “Hey Siri, call my boss on Skype,” “Using Skype, call my Mom” and so forth, and Siri will do the right thing. Again, the stock Phone app is extensible on iOS 10 to let apps like Skype provide the same Lock screen and in-call experience as cellular phone calls. It’s interesting how Siri’s ability to place VoIP calls on your behalf automatically kicks into action when you just speak a person’s name aloud. For instance, if Lisa Smith has an entry in the Contacts app and you invoke Siri and say “Lisa Smith,” the assistant will ask if you’d like to call Lisa using any default service that happens to be found on her contact card. Like regular contacts, Siri can resolve your VoIP contacts if you only mention a person’s first name and there are multiple VoIP entries for that name in Contacts. In such a scenario, asking Siri to “Call Lisa on Skype” shall yield a prompt asking to select the correct Skype contact. And lastly, there’s Spark, Cisco’s app for communicating securely with co-workers. Cisco Spark now uses SiriKit, so searching your contacts and placing calls is simpler than ever. And thanks to the Apple-Cisco partnership, you’ll be able to receive calls made to your work number right on your iPhone when an update for the Cisco Spark app lands this fall.

I hope that Apple applies the same formula to everything. Make their apps, services and devices only to work with their own it’s pretty stupid to me and is creating the struggle to expand market. Samsung has announced that their next watch will work on iOS. Will Apple wait till it’s too late to see that’s the right thing to do? QP it was too late… Rafael Nunes I agree. Apple bought Siri and it was the first personal assistent on a mobile phone if I’m not wrong. All the others, Google, Cortana came late and now is much more advanced then Siri. Microsoft added Cortana to Windows, now Apple is running for it on OS X. History proves that Apple likes to create new things and gets outdated on its own inovation.

The updated information pertains directly to App Store subscriptions, SiriKit, and iMessage apps including Sticker Packs. Previously, clarification about what developers could and could not do with regard to the new subscription enhancements announced just prior to WWDC 2016 was a bit ambiguous, but with today’s document update, guidelines become a lot more black and white. Now that App Store subscriptions are available to every app category, including games, updated information pertaining to guidelines is well warranted. Subscriptions will likely prove to be popular, as it is a way for developers to establish better customer relationships via free trials and auto-renewability, and it will allow for developers to make more money via an 85/15 automatic adjustment of the revenue sharing ratio after a year (per subscriber). The biggest priority related to App Store auto-renewable subscriptions, according to Apple, is that developers provided ongoing value to customers. Section 3.1.2 of the App Store guidelines states the following: If you offer an auto-renewing subscription, you must provide ongoing value to the customer. While the following list is not exhaustive, examples of appropriate subscriptions include: new game levels; episodic content; multi-player support; apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support. Apple additionally lays out six bullet points highlighting the dos and dont’s for developers planning on implementing App Store subscriptions into their apps: Subscriptions may be offered alongside a la carte offerings (e.g. you may offer a subscription to an entire library of films as well the purchase or rental of a single movie). You may offer a single subscription that is shared across your own apps, but these subscriptions may not extend to third party apps or services. Subscriptions must work on all of the user’s devices where the app is available. Learn more about sharing a subscription across your apps. Apps must not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the app. As with all apps, those offering subscriptions should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Subscriptions may not include consumable credits, gems, in-game currencies, etc., even when combined with other offerings, but you may offer subscriptions that include access to discounted consumable goods (e.g. a platinum membership that exposes gem-packs for a reduced price). If you are changing your existing app to a subscription-based business model, you should not take away the primary functionality existing users have already paid for. For example, let customers who have already purchased a “full game unlock” continue to access the full game after you introduce a subscription model for new customers. These guidelines seek to protect the customer and the overall perception of the App Store and the new subscription model. For example, it should protect customers from shady apps that continuously charge for in-game currency. Such a practice would get an app rejected from the App Store, because not only is its value highly questionable, but the motives behind such a subscription would be suspect as well. Apple is also looking to prevent developers from restricting content that was previously available through the app’s initial purchase or in-app purchase. Again, the theme here is customer protection. These are all good ideas and guidelines, but you can be sure that gray areas remain. As such, App Store subscription guidelines will need to be tinkered with and adjusted as reviewers, developers and customers adjust to the updated subscription model. Apple has also provided guidelines on SiriKit: 2.5.11 SiriKit (i) Apps integrating SiriKit should only sign up for intents they can handle without the support of an additional app and that users would expect from the stated functionality. For example, if your app is a meal planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration with a fitness app. (ii) Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for. (iii) Resolve the Siri request in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only present interstitial UI when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout). iMessage apps including Sticker Packs are touched on as well, albeit briefly. Head over to Apple’s App Store review guidelines document for more information. You don’t need to be a paid developer to access this information. Since Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller took over App Store management duties, we’ve seen numerous changes aimed at bettering the experience for both customers and developers. For example, just today it was reported that Apple would be removing problematic and abandoned apps starting next week, and would be limiting app names to 50 characters to avoid keyword spamming.

Developers get 30 days to clean up their acts. By Jason Cipriani | September 1, 2016 -- 20:22 GMT (13:22 PDT) | Topic: Apple Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Apple on Thursday sent an email to developers, revealing the company's plans to rid the App Store of rotten apps. Starting Sept. 7 -- the same day Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 7 and a new Apple Watch -- the company will begin evaluating apps currently listed in the App Store, looking for apps that no longer function or meet the current review guidelines. Developers of apps that aren't up to snuff will receive a notice from the App Store team, and they will be given 30 days to submit an update that fixes the issue(s). If an update isn't submitted, Apple will pull the app from the App Store. More details on Apple's developer site reveal that if during the review process an app crashes when it's opened, it will be immediately removed from the App Store until the developer submits a fix. App Store customers will still have access to any removed app(s) already installed on their devices. Apple will also begin enforcing a 50-character limit for app names. Doing so will prevent developers from overloading an app's name with search friendly terms in an effort to rise to the top of App Store searches. With two million apps in the App Store, developers often look for any advantage possible resulting in high search rankings. In its email to developers, Apple points out longer names aren't even viewable in the App Store and "provide no user value". Amen. Thursday's announcement comes nine months after Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing, was put in charge of the App Store. Bringing in Schiller was a move many developers viewed as a sign Apple was getting serious about fixing the App Store, with the loudest complaints surrounding discoverability. In June, Apple revealed developers could purchase App Store search ads as a first step in boosting discoverability. It seems step two is to cut the fat, so to speak, from the App Store and remove apps abandoned long ago (there's a lot). Apple also announced a new subscription model, where nearly any app can now charge a regular reoccurring fee to its users, with Apple's revenue share dropping from 30 percent to 15 percent after the first year. more iphone news iPhone 7 Plus hands-on: A weekend full of adjustments iPhone 7: Best LCD display ever tested CR: iPhone 7 camera does not outperform iPhone 6s Scratch test raises serious durability concerns Apple's supply pinch: Smart marketing or forecasting? iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recal l Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Apple Does an iPhone production cut suggest a sales slump?

The company is seeking to outshine Apple with the new products. Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 2, 2016 BERLIN — Samsung Electronics has unveiled two new smartwatches, which boast a range of digital features while also promising up to four days of battery life, seeking to outshine Apple in a still nascent market of wearable products. At the IFA technology tradeshow, the world’s biggest smartphone maker introduced the Gear S3 Classic and Gear S3 Frontier — two variations of the same base product, which support Samsung Pay, and on the Frontier version also allow users to make phone calls or even book an Uber ride from the device without the need for a smartphone to be connected. “We want people to be able to leave their phone at home and use only the Gear,” said Mr Tony Kim, from Samsung’s global product planning team, ahead of the product’s announcement. Samsung, which introduced its first wristwatch-like device in 2013 ahead of Apple and other rivals to carve a share of the just-forming wearable market, failed to draw people’s attention to the new watch category. But it has steadily been increasing the feature sets of such products, making them less dependent on being permanently in range of a connected phone. Apple is slightly ahead of Samsung in rolling out its Apple Pay contactless payment business — currently present in nine regions compared with Samsung’s eight. Both systems let consumers register a credit or bank card to their phones in order to make small contactless payments in stores, taxis, or on public transport. And both companies now have wearables that support the technology. But it is the cellular features of the Gear line that may be a sore spot for Apple, which had been trying to incorporate similar technology into the next version of the Apple Watch but ran into delays. The feature in Samsung’s model allows the watch to have its own phone number for making phone calls, sending SMS messages or using apps from Spotify or Uber. Only American and Korean versions of the Gear will support this feature, with other regions needing Wi-Fi or to be connected via Bluetooth to a compatible phone. Samsung’s incorporation of cellular connectivity into the previous Gear models was a key contributor to the product line’s success, according to market analysis published by research group IDC in July. “Focusing on the telco channel to drive future success in telco-driven markets is likely to remain the core strategy for Samsung moving forward,” concluded the group. Other features of the Gear S3 include a 1.3-inch colour display, a GPS location sensor, 4GB of internal memory, wireless charging, and a battery the company says will last between three and four days on a single charge. It is also resistant to water and dust. Just as Apple’s smartwatch does not connect to Samsung’s phones, Samsung’s Gear S3 does not connect to its rival’s iPhone range, although it is compatible with many competing Android devices, such as those manufactured by Sony and LG Electronics. But Samsung is gearing up to enable its watches to work with Apple’s mobile devices in a bid to reach a wider audience for its wearable accessories beyond its own phone users, said Mr Richard Knight, Samsung’s head of global product management. “We have a beta trial now in Korea,” the Samsung executive told Reuters following the introduction of the smartwatches in Berlin. “It’s completely open. It involves about 2,000 people. So, we are making some real progress there.” Mr Knight offered no timeframe for when compatible products might be announced but said it was very much in the works. “It is absolutely our goal to make it compatible with iOS as well,” he said, referring to Apple’s operating system software for phones and tablets. “We don’t want people who have an iOS device having a bad experience with our own devices.” Agencies mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Tech READ COMMENTED ‘Smart’ solar palm trees power Wi-Fi, phones in Dubai ‘Sextortion’, a new cyber crime, is common: Study ‘PCs will not go away in the next five or 10 years’ ‘PCs not dead yet’ ‘MyShake’ app, a personal tsunami warning system Super Mario Run losing steam New app lets users book workspaces in cafes Intelligent-tech arms race looming at CES Flight booking systems lack basic privacy safeguards, say researchers Facebook safety alerts like Bangkok to be triggered more often Chinese electric car battery maker charges for the world Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps A compact powerhouse Inside Today World Brazil drug gangs spark prison riot, 56 dead Peru demands cash from Odebrecht ahead of plea deal talks South Korea pushes for extradition of daughter of President Park's friend At least 100 homes burned as fire erupts in Valparaiso, Chile China navy confirms carrier conducted drills in South China Sea Business Oil prices rise as markets eye OPEC, non-OPEC production cuts Asia stocks see subdued start to 2017, dollar resumes climb Twitter China head Kathy Chen leaves company Intelligent-tech arms race looming at CES China should set flexible 2017 growth target: Adviser Sports Scorpion King Giroud gets 2017 off to a flying start Shanghai Sipg supporters welcome oscar, their S$96m man Singapore silat aiming high for 2017 SEA Games Guru-Guru masters his rivals for New Year win New Hougang head coach Philippe Aw to focus on youth Entertainment Syrian star turned pizza boy dreaming of Hollywood ending Korean ban sees Japanese works make it big in China Proud mom Pink shares first sibling photo with new baby ‘Absurd’: Dick Clark Productions rejects Mariah Carey’s sabotage claim Benedict Cumberbatch and Sherlock Holmes: A match made in history About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

Apple issues update after cyber weapon captured By Glenn CHAPMAN San Francisco (AFP) Aug 26, 2016 Apple iPhone owners on Friday were urged to install a quickly released security update after a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident exposed vulnerabilities targeted by cyber arms dealers. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. - Phishing scheme - After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they've been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. - Cyber arms dealers - Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders. gc/grf APPLE INC.

The news is the first confirmation of new headphones arriving from Apple with iPhone 7, its first device expected to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack and require wireless headphones or those using its proprietary Lightning connector. The email reportedly sent out early by the Beats PR team included Apple’s invitation for its event on September 7th with a mention of new Beats by Dre products to be unveiled the same day. The email has since been removed from the site at the request of Beats, but it still exists on the internets: As noted in the report, a recent trademark filing included references to three separate Beats wireless headphones. That same document included a reference to “AirPods”, which many have speculated could be related to Apple’s under development cord-free wireless earbuds.  It’s still unclear what Apple will include bundled with the iPhone 7, but some of the options suggested so far include everything from its current EarPods with a Lightning adapter to new Lightning EarPods or its under development cord-free earbuds mentioned above. Beats currently has a selection of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but none that use Apple’s Lightning connector or truly wireless, cord-free earbuds like those Apple is said to be developing. Earlier today we noted that a number of Accessory makers were racing to launch new wireless & Lightning headphones ahead of iPhone 7. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The following app categories are permitted to take advantage of the new SiriKit in iOS 10: ride hailing, messaging, photo search, mobile payments, VoIP and workout apps. The company already detailed Siri integration in popular messaging and payments apps and now a new blog post shows you how Siri can find photos inside apps like Pinterest, Vogue and more. “Here’s a sneak peek at new photo-searching capabilities coming this fall as top apps unlock the power of Siri,” writes Apple. “Hey Siri, show me my best selfies” Pinterest, an image-focused social app, is one of the apps that will support Siri integration at launch. People who run iOS 10 and have Pinterest installed on their device will be able to summon Siri and ask something along the lines of “Find men’s fashion Pins on Pinterest”. Siri will then launch you into the search results section of the Pinterest app. Vogue Runway, an app aimed at fashion industry insiders “who know exactly what they want to see when opening the app,” will also support Siri photo search at launch, as will Looklive, a cool app that lets you discover (and buy) men’s fashion. Instead of browsing thousands of shoppable images within the Looklive app, you ’ll be able to quickly see the latest fashion “looks” by running Siri queries like “Show me pictures of what Drake was wearing at the MTV Music Awards in Looklive”. Yet another example: Pikazo Pikazo is an app that makes it easy to produce surprisingly great looking artistic photos simply by choosing the subject you want to see and the style in which you want it painted. And thank to Siri, you won’t even need to fiddle with switches in the Pikazo app—simply asking Siri to “show me a photo of my daughter in the Style of Monet on Pikazo”. Note there’s a lot going on in the Pikazo example. Siri first must determine who your daughter is based on information from Contacts, then it must find a photo of your daughter, feed it to Pikazo and ask the app to apply the specific style to it. If you haven’t already, check out Apple-provided examples of Siri’s integration with popular messaging and payment apps, including WhatsApp, Square Cash, Monzo and LinkedIn. To reiterate, some of the more popular apps that have been confirmed to support Siri integration at launch include WhatsApp, LinkedIn, WeChat, Pinterest, Vogue Runway, Pikazo, Square Cash, Monzo, Slack, Looklive, Lyft, Fandango and The Roll. Siri-focused updates for apps that support Siri integration will be delivered to the App Store when iOS 10 releases for public consumption this fall.

I just don’t think to use it other times Jerry They’ve been times where I was like wow siri is amazing. Sending a text while your hands are tied is great and also the alarm, timer, what song is that? whats the weather. these are some of my favorite ones. Jayy Times when I need to find a song hands free it’s always to loud for Siri to hear what I’m saying. So I just open up “Shazam”. If I’m not playing around bored on Siri it’s mostly to set alarms or look up movie times / sports scores. Now with iOS 10 I may start to use it more with things like calling a uber/ lift, or maybe sending money.

It doesn't find that Apple broke any tax law. Rather it concludes that Apple's low tax burden in Ireland, where the company houses its international headquarters and employs some 6,000 people, amounts to illegal "state aid," which is a violation of European Union antitrust regulations. Apple officials responded that the low tax rate that the commission said the company paid was "completely made up" and that it was trying to "rewrite Apple's history in Europe." It pointed to the fact it paid $400 million in taxes to Ireland in 2014, making it the country's biggest taxpayer. (Apple is also the biggest taxpayer in the U.S. and the world.) According to Apple CEO Tim Cook: The commission "is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the commission thinks the law should have been… Using the commission's theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed." Apple played by the rules. But now EU bureaucrats are trying to change them after the game in order to achieve a naked tax grab for political purposes. The result will be a chilling of economic activity, investment, and job creation in the European Union. No wonder Britain wanted to leave. And this is only the beginning. Next in the commission's tax crosshairs are U.S. multinationals including Google, McDonald's, and Amazon. The U.S. should act to protect its companies by reforming its outdated and uncompetitive corporate tax code. Moving to a territorial tax system that only taxes U.S.-based earnings would cause U.S. multinational companies to bring home their estimated $2.4 trillion of stranded foreign earnings — eliminating the treasure chest that EU regulators are targeting with their tax decisions. "Apple played by the rules. But now EU bureaucrats are trying to change them after the game in order to achieve a naked tax grab for political purposes. The result will be a chilling of economic activity, investment, and job creation in the European Union. No wonder Britain wanted to leave." "Since the U.S. has been very slow to enact reform and get revenue, the status quo has allowed the Europeans the opportunity to move in and get tax money for their governments," says Kimberly Clausing, an international tax expert at Reed College. These funds should go to creating jobs and economic activity in the U.S., not bureaucracy and government in Europe. Reforming the corporate tax code would also protect U.S. companies from foreign takeovers. Because the value of a company is a multiple of its future earnings, and because these earnings are artificially deflated due to the U.S. tax code, U.S. companies are takeover targets for foreign ones looking to unlock their true value. At the moment, longstanding American companies are facing an onslaught of foreign takeover attempts. This summer France-based Danone bought American WhiteWave Foods for $12.5 billion, and Luxembourg-based Samsonite bought American competitor Tumi for $1.8 billion. And earlier this year, German-based Bayer launched a $62 billion takeover bid for St. Louis-based Monsanto. Also this year, Winston-Salem-based Krispy Kreme was taken over by Keurig owner JAB Beech, which is also based in Luxembourg, and Chicago-based Baxalta was taken over by Ireland-based Shire for $32 billion. Last year saw the most U.S.-targeted foreign acquisitions in history, with a total value of more than $400 billion. Moving to a territorial tax system, which is used by every other developed country in the world, would protect U.S. companies from takeovers and bring their foreign profits home. These companies create jobs, opportunities, and capital that should that should benefit the U.S., not European bureaucrats. It might take the status of Apple to drive this point home.

Apps that no longer work or are simply outdated will be removed. Many believe that it’s about time that Apple launched a cleaning operation in the App Store as it will help bring up more quality apps. “We are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps, removing apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines, or are outdated,” the company says, adding that this is being done in the interest of making it easier for its customers to find great apps that fit their needs. All apps in the App Store are going to be evaluated to ensure that they are not only functional but that they meet the company’s App Store guidelines as well. If the review process determines that changes need to be made to an app, the developer will be asked to do so in 30 days. If they don’t, the app will be removed. If an app crashes on launch it will automatically be removed. Apple has also informed developers that from now on, all app names will be limited to 50 characters only. It explained that by using long app names developers try to influence search results but that provides absolutely no value for customers as the names are too long to be displayed in the App Store. The cleaning operation is going to start on September 7th. If that date sounds familiar to you, it’s because Apple has scheduled a press event on that very day where it’s going to unveil the iPhone 7 and perhaps even the Apple Watch 2. Filed in Apple.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Annual car show in Apple Valley continues to help make wishes come true Thursday Sep 1, 2016 at 1:07 PM Sep 1, 2016 at 1:07 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Several groups will join forces to help make wishes come true during this weekend’s “8th Annual Make-A-Wish Classic Car Show and Tell.” The Orange County and Inland Empire Chapter of Make-A-Wish have partnered with the Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce to host the car show that has raised thousands of dollars over the years. Show organizer Ed Henry told the Daily Press big crowds continue to attend the show in Apple Valley, which raised nearly $10,000 over the last two years. “All of the funds are earmarked for kids in the High Desert through the Make-A-Wish Foundation,” Henry said. “There’s nothing like fulfilling the wishes of children who need our support.” Henry said over 100 vintage and classic cars will be at the show, with competitors and their vehicles vying for prizes in several categories, including “Mayor’s Choice,” “Sponsor’s Choice,” “People's Choice” and the new “Kid’s Choice.” Sponsored by NAPA Auto Parts, the event will also feature vehicles from several law enforcement agencies “We really wanted our kids to play a bigger part in the car show, that’s why we created the 'Kid's Choice' category,” Henry said. “It will be exciting to see how the kids see the classic cars through their eyes.” Henry said he's had the opportunity on a few occasions to play a part in making a wish come true. One year, the Orange County office had a request for a child that wanted to ride in a 1967 Orange Dodge Daytona, a car that Henry just happening to own. “Last year, a child in a wheelchair had the chance to sit on a motorcycle,” Henry said. “When the CHP officer put them on that bike, the smile on that child was priceless. That’s why we do this.” The car show will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Desert Mountain Plaza just northwest of the corner of Highway 18 and Apple Valley Road near the parking lot by Maxwell's Burgers Fresh Salads.

The letter will be delivered by a member of the Uplift campaigning organisation dressed as Snow White. Snow White famously ended up in a coma after being tricked into eating a poisoned apple. Uplift Executive Director Siobhán O’Donoghue says: “We agree with former Clinton advisor and Nobel prize winner economist Joseph Stiglitz who said the government should use the money to tackle the enormous hardships still being faced by the people of Ireland.” “Everyone has to pay their tax and that includes Apple, one of the world’s most wealthy corporations. When corporations are allowed avoid paying their tax bill, we all suffer. "The government regularly claims not to have enough money in the budget for basic services such as healthcare, housing and education - yet Apple’s tax bill would go a long way towards solving these problems. As we continue to commemorate 1916, we call on the government to stand up for the Irish people, not just corporations.” You can read the text of the open letter here or below. “Dear Minister Noonan, Everyone has to pay their tax and that includes Apple, one of the world’s most wealthy corporations. When they’re allowed to avoid paying their tax bill, we all suffer. "As the Minister for Finance you have a duty to protect and safeguard the interests of every man, woman and child in Ireland. You claim you do not have enough money in the public exchequer to ensure quality healthcare for everyone; to properly resource our schools and universities; to ensure every worker has a living wage, to end homelessness. Apple’s tax bill would go a long way to solving these problems. "We, the undersigned, remind you that you have a choice and an opportunity to stand up for the people of Ireland over the interests of Apple. We call on you to not appeal the decision that Apple owes Ireland €13 billion. Don't stand in the way of Apple paying what they owe.” KEYWORDS: apple, tax, ireland, business, politics   send us stuff PreviousNext By Claire Anderson Follow @csandersoncork Got a story to share?

 Companies like Apple will bring back billions if there's a 'tax holiday,' but last time it was a 'disaster' Dan Bobkoff Sep. 1, 2016, 3:53 PM 12,610 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. AP Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday continued to rail against the European Commission for Competition's ruling that the company got a special deal from Ireland to avoid taxes, which is against EU rules. The commission is ordering Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes. Apple and Ireland strongly disagree with the ruling and plan to appeal. In an interview with RTE, Ireland's public broadcaster, Cook called it an "invalid, politically-based ruling." And he said something else that raised some eyebrows. "We provisioned several billion dollars for the US for payment as soon as we repatriate it, and right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year," Cook told RTE's Paschal Sheehy. That means Apple may bring some of the billions it earned selling Macs and iPhones in countries like Germany and Ireland back to the US, where it would be subject to US taxes. Apple has a whopping cash pile of roughly $230 billion, but most is kept overseas to avoid paying US corporate taxes. Only about $16 billion of Apple's money is held in the US. Cook didn't say how much it might return to Apple's home country, but he's been a vocal critic of US tax policy. The company was among those that joined a lobbying effort to push for a one-time tax "holiday" to bring some of that money home at a lower tax rate. But the last time the US tried this, it didn't work out so well It was 2004. Apple was riding high on iPods — not iPhones — and Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act. It had many provisions, but one of them was a one-time tax break for companies that keep a lot of their foreign profits overseas. Instead of paying the normal US corporate tax rate, that year they could pay just 5.25%. And they did. In droves. According to a paper by Chuck Marr and Chye-Ching Huang at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Pfizer brought back about $37 billion. Merck repatriated nearly $16 million. Apple repatriated $755 million. In sum, about $300 billion made it back to the US in 2005, up from an average of roughly $60 billion in the years before. Congress hoped that the tax holiday would bring in lots of revenue that could be used to create jobs, repair roads, and generally improve the US economy. Instead, despite Congress' efforts to prohibit it, the companies spent a lot of their savings on dividends and stock buybacks. And many of the companies that benefited the most actually cut thousands of jobs shortly after. Pfizer, for instance, cut 10,000 jobs that same year, according to the paper. Ford repatriated $850 million and then laid off 10,000 workers in the US. "Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D—even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained," wrote the authors of another major study on the effects of the tax holiday. That paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, "Watch What I Do, Not What I Say," says that for every dollar companies brought back to the US, there was a $1 increase in shareholder payouts. "For several years, it was considered to be a disaster," Marr told Business Insider. His own analysis suggests that tax holidays have little economic benefit. And some right-leaning think tanks, like The Heritage Foundation, agree. US Customs and Border Protection Marr said that most of the companies that benefit from tax holidays are big multinationals with lots of "intangible profits" — think patent-heavy tech and pharmaceutical companies. Most still have plenty of cash in the US, despite keeping foreign earnings on other continents. That means they're not cash constrained and don't necessarily need to bring money back to the States to invest in research or workers. In fact, many companies repatriate money anyway at the higher rate, such as when they shut down an international division. "If you give a holiday, you're giving it to companies that would [have] done it anyway," Marr said. And there's another hazard. By making these occasional tax holidays, rather than a permanent change to corporate tax policy, companies can lobby Congress to give them a temporary break, bring some money back to the US, and then go back to their old ways of keeping money overseas until the next holiday comes around. And companies like Apple are hoping that they'll get some kind of corporate tax cut soon.

In a note to developers on Thursday, Apple informed the community it will remove abandoned and problematic applications. The idea is to make it easier for iOS and macOS users to find what they’re looking for. The review process, which will be ongoing, will see apps that crash upon launch removed from the store immediately. Related: Best iPhone apps 2016: 16 of the best Apple is giving developers whose apps require a little love and attention 30 days to bring them up the required standard. In a post on the developer website Apple wrote: “To make it easier for customers to find great apps that fit their needs, we want to ensure that apps available on the App Store are functional and up-to-date. “We are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps, removing apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines, or are outdated.” The apps that suffer deletion will still be available to existing users. As part of the change, Apple is also encouraging devs to choose shorter names for their apps. They’ll now be limited to 50 characters. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

(NASDAQ: AVGO) is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter financial results after the markets close on Thursday. This company exceeded earnings expectations for its first quarter operating as a combined company. Its increased scale and diversity already was proving very resilient, with strong product cycles in its now largest segment, wired. Can Broadcom keep it up this quarter? It’s worth noting that Broadcom is the successor to Avago Technologies, after a successful acquisition back in February. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters are $2.77 in earnings per share (EPS) on $3.76 billion in revenue. The same period from last year reportedly had $2.24 in EPS on $1.75 billion in revenue. The company produces radio frequency (RF) front-end for LTE-enabled Apple products. Wall Street estimates that the company does 15% of its total business with Apple. Additional estimates are that the company has between a 13% and 17% revenue exposure to Apple in the wireless communications segment, which was guided up 10% or more quarter over quarter for the third quarter. Customer diversity and content for Samsung could be more than enough to offset slower Apple business. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the RF arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. Some analysts think the company is growing earnings at 13% organically, and that could lift to 17% with mergers and acquisitions. Ahead of the earnings report a fair number of analysts weighed in on Broadcom: Cowen reiterated an Outperform rating with a $200 price target. D.A. Davidson reiterated a Buy rating with a $190 price target. Brean Capital reiterated a Buy rating with a $200 price target. Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating and raised its target to $200 from $180. Citigroup has a Buy rating with a $205 price target. Barclays reiterated a Buy rating with a $185 price target. B. Riley reiterated a Buy rating with a $200 price target. Mizuho reiterated a Buy rating with a $190 price target. Pacific Crest reiterated an Overweight. In 2016 thus far, Broadcom has outperformed the broad markets, with the stock up 22%. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock is up as much as 50%. Shares of Broadcom were trading at $176.66 on Thursday, with a consensus analyst price target of $195.22 and a 52-week trading range of $111.53 to $179.42.

The news comes courtesy of an email that was mistakenly sent to the site from the Beats PR team, which iGeneration originally provided a screenshot for but was asked to remove. The email announced the Apple event and specifically said "a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled." It isn't known what new Beats products Apple has in the works, but it seems likely the company will debut both new wireless headphones and Beats headphones that adopt Lightning connectors, as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not have a headphone jack. Apple was recently granted a number of product certifications from the Eurasian Economic Union, and three new Beats headphone models were among them. Apple is also working on a set of wireless "AirPods" earbuds, which are not likely to be sold under the Beats brand. It is not clear if the AirPods are going to be announced at the September 7 event, but rumors suggest they are fully wireless with no connective cord between the earpieces, much like the Bragi Dash. It appears Apple plans to offer a range of different jack-free headphone solutions for iPhone customers alongside the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Along with new Beats and the rumored AirPods, Apple is also said to be planning to ship its two new smartphones with Lightning-equipped EarPods.

And it’s good timing with IFA taking place this week— one of the year’s biggest tech events where many accessory companies are showing off new products ahead of the holidays. Below we take a look at all the announcements with a roundup of new Lightning headphones and wireless Bluetooth headphones.  While we still don’t know what Apple will bundle with the iPhone 7, it has a few options. Include EarPods with a Lightning adapter, new Lightning EarPods, or new cord-free wireless EarPods that we reported earlier this year it’s working on. It seems unlikely that it could include no headphones in the box at all, but even if that was the case there are about to be more than enough third-party options on the market for Apple to promote and sell in its stores alongside iPhone 7. Here are a few products announced just this week: Libratone Q Adapt In-Ear Lightning Earbuds ($179) Just announced today, Libratone’s Q Adapt In-Ear earbuds will offer active noise cancellation without a battery by drawing power from your iOS device through the built-in Lightning connector. There’s a remote with mic for controlling media and taking calls, and a companion app will let you adjust EQ and ambient noise levels. Jabra Elite Sport ($249) Jabra’s new Elite Spot earbuds announced today are truly wireless, or cord-free, and include two integrated mics that uses voice commands to let you answer calls and intelligently remove background noise. They are IP67 rated for waterproofing and Jabra says you should get around 3 hours listening time and additional 6 hours while on-the-go from charging with the included portable charging case. There is also an in-ear heart rate monitor that the company says offers “90%+ accuracy and an integrated app that offers automatic fitness testing via a companion app for iOS. They’ll be available through BestBuy in October. Sony MDR-1000X Hi-Res wireless headphones ($399) Sony’s new MDR-1000X noise cancelling wireless headphones are on show this week at IFA and come in at a $399 price point and specs that put it in line to be a competitor of the wireless $349 Bose Quiet Comfort 35s we reviewed and loved earlier this year. Sony is also showing off two new wireless Extra Bass models (MDR-XB80BS and MDR-XB50BS) at IFA this week. You can order them now for shipping October.  Griffin iTrip Clip Adapter ($20) Not everyone is happy about having to buy new headphones for the new iPhone 7 if they don’t already have a pair wireless or lightning option. That’s why the launch of Griffin’s new iTrip adapter is perfect timing, allowing users to give any set of headphones Bluetooth functionality. Griffin says you should get around 6 hours of playback before having to charge with the including micro-USB cable, and the adapter has a built remote and belt clip.  Audeze ($399 – $2495) Audeze was one of the first of the headphones companies going all in with Lightning headphones when Apple started pushing them more last year, and its new line announced today is no different with all models including a Lightning connector in addition to a 3.5mm stereo plug. The new models include the iSine 10 ($399), iSine 20 ($599), & LCD i3 ($2495), all of which use Audeze’s Lightning cable that it notes “takes digital audio directly from the iOS device and uses its own built-in DAC and amplifier” to improve sound quality. The middle-range $599 iSine 20’s have a longer voice coil (24 ohms) and some other upgrades over the iSine 10’s. Bowers & Wilkins P7 ($400) Bowers & Wilkins took the wraps off its new wireless P7 headphones this week and Ben noted earlier that many of its well-reviewed previous generation models received price cuts in the process. YEVO 1 ($299) Headphone maker YEVO Labs announced its new YEVO 1 truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds today available to preorder now from its website for $299 USD with included charging case. The company says it will ship by the holidays. It promises around 3-4 hours battery for listening and includes touch controls for taking calls and navigating music. Bragi Bragi made some decent but expensive cord-free wireless headphones with its Dash product that we reviewed earlier this year. It’s still one of the better truly wireless options available, but hard to recommend at $299. However, the company is teasing a “big announcement” for next week that will coincide with Apple’s event, so it’s possible it could have product updates in the future to line up with the launch of iPhone 7. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

In an email to developers, Apple have stated that applications that 'no longer function as intended', have not been supported with compatibility updates, or ones that do not 'follow current review guidelines', are at risk of being removed from the App Store completely. Furthermore, Apple are also imposing a restriction in the length of an app's title, to prevent overly long names in an attempt to influence search results. They have stated that names must now be no longer than 50 characters, or they will not be approved to be put on sale. Apple explain these new restrictions will be put in place from September 7th (the same day as their incoming media event), and justify such changes by emphasising their commitment to 'quality' applications, and their desire for it to be easier for 'customers to find great apps that fit their needs'. Whoa. This is huge. Apple reviewing old apps for quality + encouraging shorter app names. pic.twitter.com/S7C10yCOBC — Jake Marsh (@jakemarsh) September 1, 2016 While the naming restrictions will certainly have their own repercussions, the attempt at cleaning up 'abandoned' applications is far more concerning for the iOS gaming community as a whole. On one hand, Apple's reasoning is understandable - purchasing an application that has not been supported for newer versions of iOS is not desirable by any means. However, the removal of games that 'no longer function as intended' or that don't 'follow current review guidelines' is more troublesome - this could lead to the sudden disappearance of classic older games that still run perfectly fine even on newer devices, but haven't been updated in a few years. Furthermore, while Apple have outlined an 'ongoing process' in evaluating apps, notifying the owners and removing them afterwards, it's still not clear whether developers will have any way to respond to these inquisitions, or if apps will disappear from the App Store overnight. These changes to Apple's evaluation process do conveniently coincide with the impending iOS 10 public release, as well as Apple's introduction of 'Search Ads' that allow developers to pay to have their applications prominent in search results, so it's easy to be cynical about what their intentions are in making these alterations. The relative ambiguity to the criteria that is stated for removal of an application raises the question as to where the line is drawn in terms of when an app is declared 'abandoned'. Either way, it will be interesting to see how these new terms affect the App Store, and whether they can have a long-term positive impact in making it a more accessible ecosystem for users. [via The Verge] 'The Spire' Is Live - Go Visit the Last Wing of 'One Night in Karazhan' 'Hearthstone' Adventure 'Fired Up' is the Next Game from Noodlecake and 'Mmm Fingers' Developer No Monkeys Shiro Very disturbing. Wavydoesit Nice Maybe They Can Add Skulls Of The Shogun Back I Never Got to Finish It and It Vanished from the Store lol nkx Does this mean games saved on cloud will disappear as well??? dndk no Tallgeese Well I checked and am deeply saddened to report that one of my favorite ios games, Skulls of the Shogun (Bone-A-Fide: Edition) *is* indeed available in my purchase history and will even install, however it will crash upon start-up (probably can't access and load its assets or something), I've tried rebooting and clicking on it many times. Very sad. It looks to still be available on GOG, steam, XBox, Winpho, and Droid. Sorry for the news. Onikage725 PS4 as well. OrangutanKungfu Skulls of the Shogun is gone? That sucks. It's still in my purchase history, though, so it's not been completely pulled. bhayes444 I wonder if this might result in the removal of the TA app as it hasn't been updated in a while since the update breaks some silly Apple rules. I hope it doesn't, but it is possible I suppose. Jakeopp Apple clearly needs to rethink these rules of theirs dancj Hopefully this just means games not being available for sale, but still in our purchased lists. Could this put the TouchArcade app itself in danger? It's never been optimised for iPhone 6 and possibly infringes the same rule that killed the AppShopper app. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Hard to say! It works on iOS 10 and still has a back-end that is maintained so I think we might be OK? GUILTIE I think I recall you guys saying it could not be updated, but what exactly is the problem? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp We break the "store within a store" rule by mirroring a lot of the App Store stuff for display purposes. HelperMonkey And it still makes more money for Apple... scottsoapbox I hope so! dndk they will stay in your purchased list dancj Cool. In that case this is probably a good move. There are too many broken old apps that turn up in searches. curtneedsaride Wait... "However, the removal of games that 'no longer function as intended' or that don't 'follow current review guidelines' is more troublesome - this could lead to the sudden disappearance of classic older games that still run perfectly fine even on newer devices, but haven't been updated in a few years." Wouldn't those old apps that still run perfectly fine on newer devices NOT be considered 'no longer function(ing) as intended'?? Meaning, those apps would remain on the App Store? If it runs fine, it should still sell. Don't see why they'd remove it. http://www.twitter.com/robfunnell3 Rob Funnell Entirely depends on their interpretation of 'abandoned'. Not being confirmed functionality from a certain version of iOS, not being updated since a certain date (both of which will probably be automatically detected) or whether it'll be more a case by case basis (ie games that still run on later versions but haven't been updated in a while). You'd hope it wouldn't be an issue, but the relative ambiguity in their methodology around this means we won't know until the process starts. swarmster Fantastic news, and long overdue. Hopefully this is just the beginning and we see all those games that don't support larger screen sizes, longer aspect ratios, or even retina assets put out to pasture. For that matter, start requiring Game Center and iCloud save support. iOS gaming could really use a more consistent and user friendly atmosphere than the current plague of different third party user accounts and Facebook popups. OrangutanKungfu Unfortunately, Game Center is being axed from iOS 10 onwards, so that element of your wishlist is off the menu, I'm afraid. Shame - I was just starting to enjoy it, after years of ignoring it entirely. vectorarchitekt Maybe Fireflame will be more inclined to update Dungeon Raid after all shaneorourke Maybe it'd force the developers to finally fix Dungeon Siege. What a bloody con that was gleeclub BIOSHOCK??? garbui Capcom: 0 Apple: 1 GameTaco At least we got Monster Hunter back Until the next time an iOS update breaks something 😡 Tallgeese Full score: Apple: -4735 Capcom: 3 M0rdresh Before buying an app I always first check when the last update was done. At the mark of six months is a doubtful case, anything beyond is a no-go for me. Hence I welcome this wholeheartedly. houseofg That's a really handy rule of thumb (for missing out on awesome games). M0rdresh Awesome games are updated frequently and not left to their own devices. That's both from technical and content perspective. There are a lot gems that are meanwhile not experienced as intended because they have not been updated in a very long time. My rule may be to progressive as such, it's a shame devs abandon their game like that. This is 2016, we want updates, improvements, social buzz and upcoming content, that is modern gaming. We had our share of static games on print plate with plastic encasement (read = cartridge). Milotorou As long as its done properly im all for it, lets see how it unfolds HelperMonkey Capitalism benefits everyone if it's "done properly." Socialism benefits everyone if it's "done properly." But "done properly" can be a hell of a challenge. Still, I agree. In the long term I think this will benefit the AppStore ecosystem. Tallgeese Capitalism and socialism are only done properly when the two are blended together, meaning in brief that capitalism has rules preventing cheating and to win and promoting fairness and socialism has boundaries that allow for more freedom. Milotorou Definitely going to be hell of a challenge. Im still willing to put some faith into apple, they sometimes do mistakes but for the most part they usually do things the best they can sherlockeb Haha, no wait, so even if I get an old used iPod touch 3 I'm not gonna be able to buy these games and play them what's worse I might not be able to redownload old games I bought to play on my older devices. dndk you will be able to redownload old games Tallgeese Whether or not older games even work and if you can indeed still download them remains to be seen. Bioshock was removed from even purchase histories previously before they put it back. Some games I've tried to download won't even install. bluechipps Sounds to me like the idea is to prevent people from buying apps that for example were designed for iOS3+, never updated, and now most of their functions don't work... things like that. sobriquet I really see this as a positive. Sure there's a possibility of losing some older games, but my interpretation of that statement is they're finally trying to clean out some of the old, dead apps. I don't think the focus is at all the game store, but outside of games, christ, there are 1000's of calendars, clocks, web browsers and the efing flashlights that probably haven't been downloaded in ages. It's a freaken nightmare. I'd be curious to hear Jared's thoughts on this. He has occasionally been vocal about the overcrowding of the App Store. http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive "the removal of games that 'no longer function as intended'" ... "could lead to the sudden disappearance of classic older games that still run perfectly fine" I don't think there's cause to worry from this announcement. Worth watching though! Stormourner of the Nature every developers must take notice before it's too late O~O Alexythimia23 Maybe it will also have a positive effect in that devs will make sure their games dont break...looking at you 2k! Maybe games will not break on every update with the threat that they could lose their spot on store?? Who knows, knowing our luck their will be major negatives like losing older games... http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp How many downloads per day do you honestly think some half broken game from 2012 is getting? I'm not sure the pressure is as real as you think. Tallgeese That's only 4 years, nostalgia takes time to strike... Anonomation Darn! I won't be able to play Asphalt Racing on a Need for Speed Forza driving simulator track Turismo! Dankrio If quality was so important they wouldn't push many unnecessary updates that keep on breaking older aps. Mike T4 This could be problematic. Not only games, some abandoned apps are one-of-a-kind and still work. I suddenly remember Warpgate, and ngmoco, where are these games of AppStore past heydays? Puts me in a nostalgic mood Rashanii [said with smirk on his face] Starscream: Oh, how it pains me to do this! Megatron: Wait! I still function! Starscream: Wanna bet? [Starscream lets Megatron's body drift from the open shuttle door into space] Megatron: Starscream!... argh!... [Megatron's crumbled body disappears into space] Tallgeese haha scottsoapbox So does a premium game that changes to free to play "no longer function as intended"? -raised eyebrow- HelperMonkey Snap. TripMX Ahahahahaha!!! XD cmmc38 So this means I can finally stop checking the App Store three times a day to see if Crimson Gem Saga has been fixed? Tallgeese no Tallgeese in fact tid isn't enough... what it is fixed and then taken down seconds later... Tallgeese Oh, snap, that game looks dope, maybe you should see if available for a PiSP. boydstr So all the people that bought BioShock loose their money and what the attempt by the devs to fix this??if this is true Apple need to pay all the people back that bought the game and I don't understand the way games are released look at Eisenhorn:Xenos within 1 week I need to updated the game more then 3 times why not testing the game first and when it's without any faults release it and not bring a product what is not ready for a release🤔this is so frustrating and it has nothing to do with the money that I spend but it's the principle that matters. KizuxTheo I hope this doesn't mean they'll remove Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, I just bought it and I know several people still actively play it. theforkfactor Good. Septim I think they'd be better off in the quality control department if they just don't approve every casino/slot machine app and clone app of popular games that is submitted. Those two account for most of the rubbish on the App Store. There are a couple other categories that could be limited too. Who cares if a completely original game like Rolando or Wild Frontier (both removed) hasn't been updated but still plays fine. Stormourner of the Nature yup I see casino/slot machine games every day in AppShopper and I wish they don't get approved unless they're mixed with other genres bpcookson Is "inquisition" really the right word for this? Made me laugh but I'm not sure that was the intent. Anyway, this will probably be a good thing in general. I agree though that the gaming community may get the short end of the stick here. There are always some mistakes made in whatever one does; there will be casualties of war. http://www.twitter.com/robfunnell3 Rob Funnell Almost probably not, but I'm glad someone appreciated it haha, I agree that it will likely be a good thing, but even if it's a relatively restrained clean up of older games, it still feels like a bit of a whitewashing of some of the App Store's history. Hopefully it works out for the better, but my main concern is I strongly doubt Apple have the intentions of the gaming community at mind whatsoever. http://javatune.co drunk_vader Am I the only one who sees this as a good thing? It's a mere quality check. We don't want iOS to be anything like Android. Booch138 Maybe this will scare SQENIX into finally making Tactics playable. Bleh. fabell Good: all those crapapps that get released everyday with zero content may finally get removed, clearing up the store with stuff that follows guidelines. Bad: if a developer isn't careful they may get auto-removed because of some unknown incompatibility with the rules, even though it's an awesome product. Ugly: unless Apple is improving the search feature, restricting the app title is going to make it very tedious to find apps that are normally impossible to find.

While cell phone companies and online marketplaces alike have a lot of options for trading in old devices or selling them online, last fall Apple launched its own brand of upgrade program that, for loyal Apple users, is well worth considering. In this article we’ll explain the ins and outs of the Apple Upgrade Program, including the cost, where it is available (sorry U.K., Canada and Australia) and how to use it once you’ve signed up. RELATED: How To Sell iPhone 6S, 6, 5S: Where To Get Best Price For Your Old Apple Phone Apple Upgrade Program: What It Is And How It Works Apple announced its new upgrade program last fall, and in light of the changes to cell phone plan policies, it was a smart move. Most cell phone companies have completely done away with two-year plans locking users into payments with the company (and potential fees for canceling service early). This gives consumers the freedom to walk away from a service provider at any time. For some, however, the lack of a two-year plan makes it more difficult to decide when to upgrade a device or how to trade it in. Currently, the iPhone 6S and 6S plus models are the phones eligible for the Apple Upgrade Plan. When the iPhone 7 becomes available, it will be added to the upgrade plan as well. Apple   If you know you love Apple and iPhones, then the Apple Upgrade program can offer some great benefits. Here’s how it works. You sign up to purchase either an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus (iPhone 7 will soon be available) You agree to make 24 monthly payments of $32 to $45 a month depending on the model and storage chosen. After 12 months of payments you can upgrade to the newest available device free of charge, you just continue to make the same payments as before. If you choose to keep the original device for the full 24 months of payments, at the end of them the phone is yours. So, in a nutshell, you can upgrade to a new Apple phone every year as long as you are comfortable with a continued monthly payment. To find out more specifics about the plan you can read Apple's Official Upgrade Terms and Conditions, here.   Is Apple Upgrade Program Worth It? How It Compares To Other Upgrade Programs If you happen to be looking at upgrade programs at cell phone companies like T-Mobile for instance, where you can get the entry-level iPhone 6S for $27 a month over 18 months, then you may be wondering why Apple’s upgrade program is costing so much more. Basically, with the Apple upgrade program, you are paying for two things:  1) The ability to upgrade every 12 months  2) AppleCare coverage ($129) – AppleCare coverage extends your warranty by two years and will basically allow you to get replace your phone with a brand new one for just $99 if it gets broken or becomes otherwise unusable. While it might not sound like an epically good deal, the Apple Upgrade plan is still solid and it allows you to switch between carriers much easier if needed. As the iPhone 7 release nears, weighing upgrade options is important to ensure the best deal for your situation. Who Is Eligible For The Apple Upgrade Program? How To Sign Up And Upgrade Apple's iPhone Upgrade program is only available in the US for purchasers with a US based credit card. Apple To sign up for Apple Upgrade program, you will need the following: A valid U.S. credit card (Yes, this means it’s not available in the U.K., Canada or other areas outside the U.S.), however, Apple does have a Trade-In program non-US residents can take advantage of. Purchaser must be over the age of 18. Have service with a carrier – you’ll have to activate a carrier plan with T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon or A&T when you sign up. To upgrade a device after signing up for the Apple Upgrade Program: You must have owned the phone at least six months and have made 12 months worth of payments (paying ahead is allowed!) The phone must be functional – power on Screen/Display must be intact and functional – no breaks or cracks. Activation lock must be disabled. If you fulfill all these requirements, simply walk into an Apple Store with the phone you want to upgrade.   How To Check If My iPhone Is Eligible For Upgrade With Apple Program If you've already signed up with Apple's Upgrade Program, you can check upgrade eligibility at Apple's website. Apple If you signed up for the Apple Upgrade program with your last iPhone purchase but you aren’t sure if you are eligible to upgrade yet, use Apple’s online tool to check your upgrade status     Cammy Harbison Tech Writer/Reporter Follow Cammy on Facebook, Twitter, o read more More from Cammy Harbison 'Word Cookies' Answers For All Commis Chef Pack Levels Coffee Through Espresso ‘Geometry Dash World’ Guide: On Vault Codes, Demon Keys, Treasure Room And More 'Word Cookies' Talented Chef Answers: Cheats For Strawberry, Peach, Red Velvet & Cherry 'Clash Royale' Electro Wizard Challenge Decks, Tips, Tricks And Strategy Mon, 01/02/2017 - 19:45 ‘Arrow’ Season 5 Spoilers: What If This Crazy Episode 10 Reddit Theory Is True?

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Karen Turner September 1, 2016 Follow kthalassa A labor rights group has accused Pegatron, a supplier of Apple products in China, of misconduct. (Eugene Hoshiko/AP) As Apple watches its profits decline for the first time in 13 years, tightening production costs are pushing iPhone factory workers to working longer hours for less pay, a new study reports. The report, released last week by China Labor Watch, revealed worsening labor conditions at Pegatron, one of Apple's major iPhone factories based outside of Shanghai. The factory implemented excessive overtime hours that spanned up to 90 additional hours per month, according to the report, and overall wage cuts from $1.85 to $1.60 per hour on Pegatron workers over the past year. Apple has been criticized in the past for labor conditions in the Chinese factories that produce their popular products. They have responded by launching yearly audits to ensure factories are meeting specific standards, such as a weekly cap of 60 hours per worker. But China Labor Watch's latest report claims that these standards have not been met at Pegatron, which employs up to 100,000 workers at peak season to create iPhones and iPads. The report comes on the heels of Apple's announcement of the iPhone 7 release next week. As the study reports, excessive overtime tends to kick into high gear right before a new Apple product release. The study dug deep into worker conditions, reporting that during high volume months, 40 to 70 percent of factory workers worked more than Apple's standard 60-hour workweek. Workers were often forced to stay overtime and were rarely granted leave. Student interns, though forbidden by law from working overtime, put in an average additional 80 hours per month. The report also examined Pegatron's wages closely. Hourly wages technically were increased in 2016 to meet the new minimum wage of $2 per hour as set by the Shanghai government. But as wages were increased, worker subsidies such as workday meals, medical insurance and retirement were abolished. When accounting for these additional costs, the report found that wages actually decreased by 25 cents per hour from 2015 to 2016. "Workers are very unhappy, but they feel that there's nothing that they can do about it," said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch, adding that many workers depend on overtime pay because base wages are so low. China Labor Watch is an independent watchdog group that focuses on labor practices in China. They have published reports on work conditions in factories producing products for Samsung, Adidas and Walmart. The group has also devoted multiple reports to Pegatron's factories that create popular iPhones and iPads. The group collected and analyzed 2,015 pay stubs from Pegatron workers between May 2015 to May 2016. Pay stubs were spread throughout the months covering both low and high season. Pay stubs were not evenly collected, with a high number of stubs coming from one high production month out of the year, but China Labor Watch adjusted its analysis to account for months that are peak season or have more holidays than others. They also sent five investigators undercover to work at the Pegatron factory. In response to the report, Pegatron insisted that they have taken measures to ensure that workers do not exceed the 60-hour limit per week, including switching to electronic record monitoring. They claimed that their 60-hour workweek compliance was very high, around 95 percent, contrary to the excessive overtime claimed in the report. "We work hard to make sure every Pegatron facility provides a healthy work environment and allegations suggesting otherwise are simply not true," a Pegatron spokesman said in a statement. Apple responded with claims that 97 percent of factories stick to no more than 60-hour workweeks and that factory wages have raised an average of 13 percent per year. "Our commitment to these issues will never waver and we have teams of Apple employees on the ground working with our suppliers to ensure we continuously raise standards and offer safe and healthy working conditions," Apple said in a statement. But Li insists that the pay-stub analysis and on-the-ground reports tell a different story. "Pegatron or Apple can make any justification regarding their overtime hours and regular hours, as they have set the standard themselves," he said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

 Apple is about to do a massive purge of the App Store Kif Leswing Sep. 1, 2016, 2:43 PM 4,928 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple is cleaning up the App Store. On September 7, while CEO Tim Cook is revealing the iPhone 7, Apple will begin to review apps and purge those that don't work from the App Store, the company announced on Thursday. Apple's looking to zap apps that "no longer function as intended, don't follow current review guidelines, or are outdated." Many of the apps that Apple will be removing are likely old and abandoned — perhaps a program developed years ago that doesn't work with up-to-date hardware. Developers will have a chance to save some poorly functioning apps before Apple purges them. Apple will notify developers and give them 30 days to make a change. And if an app is removed, that doesn't mean a new app can take the removed app's vacated name. However, apps that crash on launch will be immediately removed. Apple has been making a lot of changes to the App Store to keep developers happy since Phil Schiller, a senior vice president, took over the division in December. Recently, Apple added a new way to bill users for subscriptions in which it takes a smaller percentage of sales. In June, Apple said the App Store had over 2 million apps.

"We provisioned several billion dollars for the US for payment as soon as we repatriate it, and right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year," Cook said. The interview came two days after the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect €13 billion (£11.1 billion/$14.5 billion) in back taxes from Apple after the company benefitted from years of a sweetheart deal and dubious, but legal, tax shenanigans. However, what Cook didn’t explicitly say is that Apple likely would only do this if Congress passes a new so-called "tax holiday," which the Obama administration has proposed as part of the government’s Fiscal Year 2017 federal budget. In February 2016, the Department of Treasury announced that the White House would like to "impose a one-time transition toll charge of 14 percent on untaxed foreign earnings that US companies have accumulated overseas. The earnings subject to the one-time tax could then be repatriated without any further US tax." As The Wall Street Journal reported, American companies are believed to be holding approximately $2 trillion in cash overseas that is shielded from US taxes. Under American law, companies must pay a 35-percent corporate tax rate on global profits when that money is brought home—so there is an incentive to keep as much of that money overseas as possible. In October 2015, Ars reported that Apple pays an effective 2.3-percent tax rate on overseas profits. Google, Microsoft, and many other large multinational corporations engage in similar behavior. Fat chance Unfortunately for Cook and Apple, at least one tax law expert told Ars that this tax holiday proposal is unlikely to take effect. "I don’t think it is likely in an election year," Omri Marian, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, told Ars by e-mail. "However, if the [European Commission] decision holds, it is certainly more likely to gain favor with lawmakers after the election. The US would very much like to tax foreign earnings of US multinational before the EU does." Absent making nice with government institutions, there’s not a big incentive for Apple or other companies to bring money home at this time. "For the most part, companies like Apple don't need to repatriate money," Samuel Brunson, a tax law professor at Loyola University Chicago, e-mailed Ars. "They're sitting on plenty of cash here, and if they don't have enough, they can usually borrow it from their offshore subs (or a bank or whomever). In fact, to the extent they can deduct interest payments, borrowing from a related entity may be advantageous for tax purposes." Brunson explained that such debt "may not look as good for financial accounting purposes," but it makes sense for a company like Apple. "Aside from those kinds of considerations, they can sit on their money offshore pretty much as long as they want," he concluded. In the RTÉ interview, Cook said that in 2014, Apple paid an effective global rate of 26.1 percent, which he described as "reasonable." "When you’re accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values it brings out an outrage in you and that’s how we feel," he said. "Apple has always been about doing the right thing, never the easy thing. We haven’t done anything wrong and the Irish government hasn’t done anything wrong."

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple to begin removing old, unmaintained apps from the App Store Move is meant to improve compatibility and cut down on abandonware. by Andrew Cunningham - Sep 1, 2016 7:03 pm UTC Login to bookmark 72 Apple is cleaning its (app) house ahead of this fall's big releases. Apple is making a few small tweaks to its App Store Review Guidelines for developers ahead of the release of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra this fall. The changes, which Apple is currently telling registered developers about via e-mail, are meant to cut dead wood out of the App Store and to make it easier for users to find better apps. These are the latest in a series of App Store changes implemented since Apple worldwide marketing SVP Phil Schiller was given the reins back in December of 2015. The biggest change is that Apple will begin to remove older, outdated apps from the App Store that no longer follow current review guidelines or that haven't been updated to support new APIs or features. Removing old apps will also cut down on the number of apps that haven't been updated for compatibility with newer iOS versions or iDevices. Apple isn't saying exactly what criteria it will use to remove apps, just that it is "implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps for these issues, notifying their developers, and removing problematic and abandoned apps." People who have already downloaded these apps will still be able to download them, developers will be given 30 days to issue an update before their app is removed, and if their apps are removed they will still be associated with that developer's account and other developers won't be able to use the names for other apps. The other update is related to app names—apps submitted to the App Store will now have their names capped at 50 characters. This is meant to cut down on the number of apps that give themselves long names with multiple keywords intended to improve search ranking. Sierra and iOS 10 are both likely to be released later this month. We'll find out the specific dates at Apple's product event on September 7, the same day that these App Store guidelines take effect. Below, see some of Apple's official messaging regarding the changes. Apple's biggest changes to the App Review guidelines.

What if you've only ever been an iPhone user, and you're thinking about switching to an Android phone? Here's a little background on what makes each gadget tick, along with what you can expect from the user experience and a few leading phone options should you decide to take the leap. Operating systems Let's start at the beginning. When we say iPhone and Android, we're talking about phones (hardware) that use different types of operating systems (software). Apple uses closed, proprietary operating systems: Mac computers run on OS X (soon to be called MacOS) and mobile devices run on iOS (iPod, iPad, iPhone...sound familiar?). Only Apple devices have native iOS or OS X operating systems, so they can be referred to as iOS/OS devices or just "Apple devices" more or less interchangeably. But non-iOS devices work a little differently. Android phones can be made by any manufacturer – "Android" is actually the operating system. It's an open source software first developed by Google. Some companies, like Samsung, do extra work on the operating system for an experience that's unique to their devices. Other (typically smaller) companies use operating systems pretty close to "stock" Android. What closed vs. open means for the end user Take note of the words "closed" and "open" – these differing approaches to software offer a lot of insight on company politics and ultimately manifest in the user experience as well. Apple's software is (mostly) closed. The company doesn't share access to the tool that keeps its devices running, with the exception of limited information for app developers. Android software is open. Google owns Android, but works to develop the software and share it for free (there are guidelines for hardware-makers to use Google's core apps, but the core software itself is distributed without strings attached). (Almost) anyone and everyone can take Android software and make it do whatever they want. Before shaking your fist at the ghost of Steve Jobs, keep in mind there are plenty of reasons to keep systems closed. Ivory towers don't build themselves. Closed systems mean greater security, since hackers have fewer access points to distribute malware. It also prevents the user from inadvertently messing up their own system. Apple has very successfully used their closed system to provide an intuitive, robust and stable user experience. On the Android side, there's more room for customization by both the manufacturer and the user. So while an Apple user can pick up anyone's iPhone and know more or less what they're in for, the difference between one Android phone and the next can be jarring. Updates By now, you know the drill - when your iPhone needs an update, you get a big notification. Once you opt in, there's a download, then the phone restarts. From there, all of the apps need to be updated accordingly. If you don't upgrade your apps, one by one they'll start to cease function. And if your phone gets too old to support the current OS, you're out of luck. Android updates are rolled out more slowly. Nexus devices (which Google developers in collaboration with a manufacturer partner) get the updates first, and then other manufacturers follow suit. Users don't always know when, if ever, their phone will receive Android software updates, and there's always the option to opt out. Know that you might get hungry comparing specs for the first time. Android names each version of their software after a different sweet: Right now, most new phones are running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but Android 7.0 Nougat was just released. App store Apple's App Store contains only carefully vetted Apple-approved products. You can only get content through the App Store, and the App Store contains only Apple content. It's next to impossible to put non-Apple approved content on your phone, with jailbreaking being rarer (and harder) now than it was in the first five years of iOS devices. Android has one centralized app store: Google Play. The Google Play store sells Android apps, but lots of other stuff too - it's kind of like iTunes and the App Store rolled into one. More importantly, you can also put apps – and even other app stores – on your phone from outside Google Play. So if you want to experiment with different types of (non-vetted) content, you can go right ahead. Historically, Apple's App Store has been the superior of the two, beating Android in terms of quality and quantity of apps. But that gap, along with many others, is closing. Cloud storage & backups "Not enough storage. The iPhone can not be backed up because there is not enough iCloud storage available." If you're like me, you've been ignoring messages like these for weeks. If you're more organized, you've had to jump through hoops to either upgrade your iCloud space or deal with your files like an adult. Automated backups to the iCloud are great in theory. Your phone backs up to the cloud over Wi-Fi, keeping your files safe without you lifting a finger – until it starts becoming a headache. The small storage capacity of the free tier of iCloud (5 GB) and the iPhone's automatic reliance on it is enough to send users up a wall. Does Android offer a better solution? Sort of. Whereas iCloud can give a full system restore in minutes (get a new phone, restore your iCloud backup and voila), Android backups are piecemeal. For example, all of your contacts are saved in Gmail, and you can keep your apps and music on the Google Play cloud. Google Photos works similarly. So, while there's no built-in system-wide tool that brings apps and their content back just the way you like them, all of your data exists somewhere. Gaming & other hardware characteristics We've gone over major differences between the operating systems, which is the most important difference between iPhones and Android devices. But there are some general hardware trends that persist in the different environments as well. Making the switch from iPhone to Android means countless more device options. That's a pleasure for some, but a chore to those with decision fatigue. In general, it's easier and more affordable to find an Android phone with more internal and external storage (SD cards). Apple users pay a premium to get the amount of storage that would be entry-level for another manufacturer. Beyond cloud connectivity, iPhones also lack support for external storage. If you've been filling up your iPhone, switching to Android could make your life much easier. Switching from an iPhone likely means you'll be looking into a different type of display as well. Apple devices have been using IPS display technology. Android phones can have either IPS or AMOLED, but AMOLED is quickly becoming the favorite across leading manufacturers. You'll notice darker blacks, brighter whites and more color saturation. Samsung Super AMOLED display (L), iPhone IPS display (R)(Credit: Will Shanklin / New Atlas) Compatibility with high-tech accessories also varies among manufacturers. Android devices win out. In this department, the major feather in iOS's cap is the Apple Watch. Not only are there dozens of Android-compatible smartwatches out there, several Android phones are virtual reality-ready as well. Apple hasn't announced any plans for a VR headset. There are a plenty of other hardware options currently available on Android phones that haven't yet come to iPhone: fast charging, wireless charging, water resistance and modularity, to name a few. If there's a feature you really like, that alone would make the switch worth it. Recommendations So if you're thinking of walking out on iOS, where should you look first? Here are a few of our picks. Thanks to the number of options, you can choose a phone that caters to your lifestyle more specifically than any iPhone. From L to R: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, Moto Z, HTC 10, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 The Samsung Galaxy series is probably the Android option most analogous to iPhone in terms of availability, price, and popularity. It also encompasses some of the best Android hardware perks. The "7" series is the company's 2016 collection, but recent years' models have many of the same features. Phones in the Galaxy S7 series are Gear VR-compatible, flaunt sophisticated glass bodies with rounded edges and are IP68 water resistant. Full retail price starts at about $670 for a Galaxy S7 versus $649 for an iPhone 6S. Here's a spec-by-spec comparison of the two phones, but keep in mind that's just the base model S7. There are specialty models too, like the rugged S7 Active, or the Galaxy Note 7, a larger option with a stylus and a few new features. The Moto Z Play is a soon-to-be-released modular smartphone that has clever camera, slideshow, speaker and battery life accessories that make it both fun and utilitarian. Plus, it's more affordable than its big brother, Moto Z. The HTC 10 is an all-around stellar pick that clearly puts quality over gimmicks. It lacks some of the more headlining features like water resistance, but it's solidly equipped and provides a high-end, focused and premium experience. Of course, now that you've done background reading on the two types of systems, you might be ready to cast a wider net with your research. In that case, our 2016 smartphone comparison guide is a great place to start.

The Apple Watch 2 (or Apple Watch Series 2 to give it its official title) is the second version of the most successful smartwatch around. The Watch was Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a phone on your wrist. At TrustedReviews we liked the look of it, but struggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but they were limited, and it didn't offer water-resistance. In addition, the watchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much. Interesting third-party apps were lacking too. There are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very first iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a superb product. While the iPhone 7 didn’t meet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 has. All our concerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS 3 is now intuitive and useful; there are plenty of compatible apps; and the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant.vOwning an Apple Watch finally makes sense – especially if you’re the outdoorsy, fitness type. In the end, we loved the Apple Watch 2 so much, we awarded it our coveted TrustedReviews Wearable of the Year Award for 2016. Keep reading to find out just why it deserved such a fantastic accolade. Related: Best Smartwatch Apple Watch 2 – Design The Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t mind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks, particularly since it isn't as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer square watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind. The Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that you’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with rounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the edge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still works well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation. The button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a useless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow). You can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium chassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no expensive gold-plated model. Instead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic cast is treated at length at high temperature before it's polished smooth. Not only does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless steel model. Standing out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions – the 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249. Suffice to say, it isn't necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch that’s "tough". I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and regularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on the screen or body. The headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will it survive a brief dunk in the bath, it's now fit for the sea. Apple claims it can withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn't advise that you go scuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms swinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths. An Apple representative explained to TrustedReviews that the Apple Watch 2 is fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with seawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it provides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without any bother. The screen locks when under water and so won't be usable, but it will continue to track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a little party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound at various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam. There's a plethora of straps available for the Series 2 – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and they're the best way of making an Apple Watch "yours". As well as the relationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike to launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, whose compression-moulded perforations make it more breathable – ideal for athletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed. For those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I'd recommend a Sports strap, rather than the metal or nylon straps. The Sports strap doesn’t retain any water, so you won't be left with a damp wrist all day after a brief plunge.

Full Site Menu CEO: EU ruling on Apple’s Irish tax is ‘total political crap’ 4 months ago / Reuters DUBLIN/BRUSSELS - Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook described a European Union (EU) ruling that it must pay a huge tax bill to Ireland as "total political crap", but France joined Germany on Thursday in backing Brussels as transatlantic tensions grow. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Cook's broadside, saying the demand for a €13 billion back tax payment was based on the facts. Washington has lined up with the tech giant, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the US government. But in Ireland itself, the government and public opinion are divided over whether to take the windfall, which would fund the country's health system for a year, or reject it in the hope of maintaining a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals, creating jobs. A group of independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the minority coalition's survival, called for a review of how tax is collected from multinationals. Their reluctance to back a call for an appeal by the country's finance minister has cast doubt on whether Ireland will challenge Vestager's decision. Apple has said it will appeal the ruling which Cook attacked in an interview with the Irish Independent. "No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable," the newspaper quoted him saying. "It's total political crap." Vestager has questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed the iPhone maker to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. She said on Thursday that the calculations were based on data provided by Apple itself and evidence presented during hearings on Apple tax issues in the United States. "This is a decision based on the facts of the case," she told a news conference. The battle lines are forming on both sides of the Atlantic. In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager's view that Apple's Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. "The European Commission is doing its job," he told a news conference. "It's normal to make Apple pay normal taxes." German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the Commission on Tuesday. Austria also welcomed the ruling but Britain - which voted in June to leave the EU, has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the Commission. "DOING THE WRONG THING" Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014. However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation due to misgivings among the five-strong Independent Alliance group of lawmakers. "I don't think Apple have paid sufficient tax. I don't think they've been illegal in what they've done, it's the tax system as it's set up," said Alliance member John Halligan, a junior minister who does not sit at cabinet. "The Independent Alliance have asked that we review our intake of tax, how we take tax in from multinationals and (assess) are we collecting fair tax," he told RTE radio. After five hours of discussion, the cabinet adjourned discussion of an appeal until Friday when the government said a decision would be made. Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. On the streets of Dublin, some argued Ireland had to keep drawing foreign investors with low tax rates to provide jobs. But others said the government should drop the idea of appealing the decision and take the money. "They are doing the wrong thing. They don't care about the normal people," said Louise O'Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. "The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive." O'Reilly's mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of €1,050, a higher rate than the EU said Apple's main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. By contrast, Cook estimated Apple's average annual tax on its global profits at 26 percent. "They just picked a number from I don't know where," he said. But in another interview he promised to boost tax payments by repatriating billions of dollars in global profits to the United States next year. Apple would fight with Ireland to overturn the ruling, by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU, which he said had "no basis in law or in fact". "DOING THE RIGHT THING" Cook played down the possibility of the government failing to appeal the decision. "The future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty," he told RTE radio. "I'm pretty confident that the government will do the right thing." In Washington, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticized the ruling. "I have been concerned that it reflected an attempt to reach into the US tax base to tax income that ought to be taxed in the United States," he said on Wednesday. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any US company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning non-profit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying US taxes. But Cook said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States.

Crowley, 41, of Schnectady is facing second degree assault and felony criminal mischief charges after repeatly striking and kicking an officer in the ribs, said Sheriff Craig Apple. Inmates stop attack on Albany County jail guard 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Colonie Inmates rescued a jail guard when another prisoner attacked the guard Tuesday, Sheriff Craig Apple said. "Not one, not two, but every inmate in the tier responded to help my officer," Apple said Thursday. Inmate Drew J. Crowley, 41, of Schenectady is facing second-degree assault and felony criminal mischief charges after repeatedly punching and kicking an officer in the ribs, Apple said. Crowley was allegedly upset by a phone call before the assault. The incident occurred on the "Soldier On" tier of the jail, which houses inmates who are military veterans. "They get treated a little bit better because they act better," Apple said. The men participate in counseling and programming sessions. Crowley, who is not housed in that wing, was allowed onto the tier to make a phone call. When he pinned Officer Matthew Richmond to the ground, "Soldier On" inmates pulled him off and held Crowley until other officers arrived. "It's a huge deal," Apple said. "We work very hard on programming and this is part of what is changing their behavior. The goal is to get out, and live a clean and healthy life." Richmond suffered bruising and will take a one-month medical leave, Apple said. Crowley was being held on burglary charges, awaiting sentencing.

Announced at WWDC, Siri will be able to integrate with third-party apps in iOS 10. For the first time, users will be able to take advantage of third-party services through Siri voice search. Apple has uploaded some screenshots (embedded below) showing how third party apps will work with Siri, using popular apps like LinkedIn and WhatsApp as examples … First, it’s worth noting that Siri on iOS 10 is not a universal solution enabling all apps on the App Store to suddenly integrate into Siri voice queries. The SDK is focused on select categories of application to enable rich voice interactions with those apps. The developer implementation is explored in more detail here, but the consequence for iOS 10 users is that Siri will work with six categories of third-party app: ride booking, messaging, Photo Search, payments, VoIP Calling and Workouts. One of the examples Apple is touting today is person-to-payments. Using the Monzo bank as an example, Apple shows how customers will be able to ask Siri to “send Andy $10 using Monzo”. This will bring up a custom sheet inline to the Siri experience with details of the transaction. To confirm users press the Send button. However, payments require authentication so Siri will ask for the user’s fingerprint to allow the transaction to take place: “Unlock to Send Money”. A similar process takes place if the user refers instead to Square Cash but with custom, unique, UI to differentiate the experiences. Using third-party apps for messaging in iOS 10 is also straightforward, just like sending an iMessage with Siri. In the example, a user can say “Send a WhatsApp message to Alice saying I’ll be there in 15 minutes” and Siri will transcribe the request into a message sheet. This sheet looks just like a normal WhatsApp conversation with the same interface for message bubbles and such. Apple also shows another example for sending a message using the LinkedIn social network. In this case, the LinkedIn app provides the UI instead … with the same blue branding you would expect from LinkedIn. This is a good gallery of examples for the messaging and payment categories of Siri integration. Expect similar experiences for the other categories like Photo Search and ride booking. As discussed before, Apple has done a good job with the Siri third-party app SDK for the categories it supports. However, some developers have expressed disappointment that the initial set of supported apps is too limited. Apps like Spotify or Pandora are notably excluded from the initial Siri SDK as there is no category for media playback apps. This also impacts podcast apps like Overcast or Castro, they are also left out in the cold. Apple executives have said they are open to expanding the Siri SDK in future iOS releases but nothing has been officially announced regarding further expansion. iOS 10 will be released to the public later this month, and will ship pre-installed on the iPhone 7. Catch all the announcements next week, on September 7, at Apple’s fall media event. We are expecting the unveiling of the iPhone 7, new Apple Watch, final details about iOS 10 and more.

The changes seek to remove broken and forgotten apps from the App Store, apps that are currently breaking App Store review guidelines, and that are just no longer functional. The notice to developers today indicates that Apple will begin reviewing and removing non-functional apps on September 7th within all categories from the App Store. Apps that automatically crash on launch will be immediately removed from the App Store, but other apps will have 30 days to submit an update to keep the app within the store. Apple makes it clear that apps that are removed won’t lose functionality for users who currently have it installed, but future customers will no longer be able to search for it. In preparation for the coming culling, Apple suggests developers read the latest App Store Review Guidelines and confirm that all current apps follow them. Apple recommends that developers continue to address overall functionality issues within the app and to update it regularly. Most interestingly, they explicitly state that if an app is no longer being updated, developers should consider removing it from the App Store. App Store developers today also received emails re-iterating the upcoming changes, alongside an additional indication that shorter app names will also be a focus. Generously used with apps that look to spam search keywords and overtake similar apps, Apple is now discouraging the use of lengthy names. Apps submitted to iTunes Connect will now be limited to 50 characters. As of now these spammy names usually include descriptions and terms not relevant to the applications or user.  Developers looking for some help in this area can read the App Store Product Page for more information. These changes should help curb some of the spam and abandoned applications that currently resides in the App Store. It isn’t uncommon now to download an app and see that it still hasn’t been updated to support the new iPhone 6 (or even iPhone SE) resolution, or that it just crashes within its main functionality. The new naming limitations will also hopefully hamper development farms that create keyword-related app titles looking to copy the success other top-grossing applications. Unfortunately, Apple’s update today doesn’t indicate that it will retroactively adjust apps with absurdly long titles. While today’s update looks to deter spammy app names, that may just push those developers to look more intently into Apple’s new Search Ads. Apple’s Phil Schiller noted that developers should look into “conquesting” with Search Ads (“…you can do conquesting. You can use someone else’s brand in your ad words that you want to use”). Hopefully a combination of these changes will help create a better App Store ecosystem for users coming this Fall. Apple’s iPhone 7 event is next Wednesday, September 7th. We’re expecting to see Apple’s latest flagship iPhone to launch, alongside the possibility of a new Apple Watch.

New Fitbit devices announced ahead of Apple Watch event Andrew Fraser , afraser@stcloudtimes.com 1:40 p.m. CDT September 1, 2016 Fitbit Charge 2 is the follow-up to the Charge HR fitness tracker. (Photo: Fitbit Press Kit, investor.fitbit.com/press/press-kit/) 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Apple Watch’s health and fitness features were always a part of the product’s value proposition, but lately they’ve seen a larger focus. Apple’s June WWDC presentation press release highlighted what it calls “breakthrough” health features in Apple Watch’s upcoming watchOS 3. An included quote from Apple COO Jeff Williams describes Apple Watch as the “ultimate companion for a healthy life.” Apple Watch’s stronger shift towards health is bad news for competitor Fitbit, maker of popular fitness trackers and smartwatches. With Apple expected to announce an updated Apple Watch at a press event next week, Fitbit struck first and detailed two new products. Charge 2 Fitbit didn’t stray much from a winning formula when designing its newest core fitness tracker. Called Charge 2, the new device is the follow up to 2014’s Charge HR, Fitbit’s top-selling device. The Charge line is known for striking a good balance between the simplicity of Fitbit’s basic trackers and the larger digital displays afforded by smartwatches. ST. CLOUD TIMES Apple Watch: the first year The display returns with Charge 2, but is four times larger than the one in Charge HR. Since the new device’s width didn’t increase with the change, the extra screen real estate is a welcome upgrade. Charge 2 has the heart rate sensor, making it, like the previous Charge HR, the starting point in the line for users that require that functionality. Like Fitbit Alta, Charge 2 allows for interchangeable bands and accessories, so you can swap out the look if you’re trying to cop a certain style. Fitbit’s online store lists prices of $29.95 for extra basic (sport) bands and $69.95 for leather bands. On the software end, Fitbit has added features that will help its platform compete with fitness updates expected to play heavily into the next Apple Watch. The new tracker can connect to your phone’s GPS to map runs and distance, as well as deliver information on cardio and offer relaxation breathing exercises. Charge 2 is available for preorder on Fitbit.com for $149.95, with an estimated ship date of 1-2 weeks given (at the time of this writing). The older Charge HR can be found online now for $129 or less, but unless you find a discount deeper than that, Charge 2's upgrades are worth the higher price. Charge 2’s features also make it a better value than the $129 Alta, which only appears to be worth the savings if the $20 price difference breaks the bank or you’re dead set on Alta’s slimmer width. Fitbit Flex 2 can be used with a variety of sports bands or fashion accessories.  (Photo: Fitbit Press Kit, investor.fitbit.com/press/press-kit/) Flex 2 In addition to Charge 2, Fitbit is also releasing an updated version of their Flex tracker. Unsurprisingly called Flex 2, the device aims to provide an affordable, versatile entry point to Fitbit’s ecosystem. Flex 2’s main unit is a small, rectangular device that can be placed in a variety of wearable accessories, like necklaces, bangles or the included sport wrist band. The device doesn’t have a screen, but presents feedback and information to the user through a series of LEDs. Users can go back to the synced Fitbit app on smartphones or computers to view information the device gathered. Flex 2 is also swim-proof, so this is the Fitbit to get if you’re interested in tracking swimming activity. This device is also available via Fitbit’s web store and carries a $99 price, with an estimated shipping timeframe of late September. Flex 2 feels a bit too expensive for the features delivered. If Fitbit could’ve gotten the price around $80, this would be a better sell. As is, another $30 gets you a screen in the Alta, while another $50 delivers heart rate tracking and the latest core Fitbit features with Charge 2. Like its Charge HR predecessor, Charge 2 will likely end up being Fitbit’s best value device for users that want an element of health tracking but aren’t interested in a full smartwatch. It’s affordable, packed with core features and does what most users in this space want it to competently. Flex 2 will do basic tracking well, but the extra money gets you a lot more, and is worth it for a device you’ll have on your person often. This is the opinion of Times Digital Project Specialist Andrew Fraser. He’s on Twitter at @andrewfraser. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/life/2016/09/01/new-fitbit-devices-announced-ahead-apple-watch-event/89685158/

The releases patch multiple vulnerabilities that allow an application to disclose kernel memory, and executive arbitrary code with kennel privileges. If this sounds familiar, it’s because these are the same exploits patched in the latest iOS 9.3.5 update. Apple again credits Citizen Lab and Lookout research firms with the find, and recommends that all users install the updates. Here are your full release notes: Kernel Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 and OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 Impact: An application may be able to disclose kernel memory Description: A validation issue was addressed through improved input sanitization. CVE-2016-4655: Citizen Lab and Lookout Kernel Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 and OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 Impact: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling. CVE-2016-4656: Citizen Lab and Lookout For those that missed it, last week it was exposed that notorious digital arms dealer NSO Group has been selling software built using these exploits. The program can read texts and emails, track location, and record sounds and passwords. Today’s Security Updates can be installed via the Updates tab in the Mac App Store.

Cin Now, I am afraid of updates…. Last time I updated, on reboot, I got the black screen of death…. techfreak23 That’s why you should always have a backup of your data before you do any kind of update. Most of the time, those problems can be resolved with a restore unless you had a hardware issue. Obviously that’s more involved. Cin I have a backup after everyday.. I didnt lose a single file.. It was the magic board.. so yes, hardware in my case but I blame the update to death lol. Apple even advised me to not do updates through the app store because I was on beta program.. Do manual fresh install. Rolf Bause Back in the day, this literally NEVER happened… Granted, software got more and more complex over the years, but their quality control also really sucks these days… techfreak23 That’s very true. Software also used to years to develop where each lines of code was more scrutinized. I will agree that their quality control has gone down significantly in recent years because of this whole need to put out new hardware refreshes or software upgrades every year. Truly saddening. Same this with video games shipping out essentially unfinished and having first day patches or DLC.

SiriKit Here’s the new section covering SiriKit, a new iOS 10 framework to allow certain types of apps to integrate with Siri by registering actions (“intents” in Apple talk) with the system. (i) Apps integrating SiriKit should only sign up for intents they can handle without the support of an additional app and that users would expect from the stated functionality. For example, if your app is a meal planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration with a fitness app. (ii) Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for. (iii) Resolve the Siri request in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only present interstitial UI when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout). Downloadable iMessage content As you know, iOS 10’s much-enhanced Messages app now has a built-in App Store where users can find downloadable stickers and iMessage extensions, also known as “iMessage Apps”. Apple notes that Messages stickers and iMessage extensions “may show the user experience in the Messages app” much like video previews on the App Store let you see an app or game in action before you hit the Download button. “You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone,” writes the company. In another section that covers Data Collection and Storage, Apple explains that downloadable stickers and iMessage extensions must have a privacy policy. There’s an entire section dedicated to stickers, too. Stickers dos and don’ts “Stickers are a great way to make Messages more dynamic and fun, letting people express themselves in clever, funny, meaningful ways,” reads the document. “Whether your app contains a sticker extension or you’re creating free-standing sticker packs, its content shouldn’t offend users, create a negative experience, or violate the law.” Apple provides some examples of acceptable sticker content: (i) In general, if it wouldn’t be suitable for the App Store, it doesn’t belong in a sticker. (ii) Consider regional sensitivities, and do not make your sticker pack available in a country where it could be poorly received or violate local law. (iii) If we don’t understand what your stickers mean, include a clear explanation in your review notes to avoid any delays in the review process. (iv) Ensure your stickers have relevance beyond your friends and family; they should not be specific to personal events, groups, or relationships. (v) You must have all the necessary copyright, trademark, publicity rights, and permissions for the content in your stickers, and shouldn’t submit anything unless you’re authorized to do so. Keep in mind that you must be able to provide verifiable documentation upon request. Apps with sticker content you don’t have rights to use will be removed from the App Store and repeat offenders will be removed from the Developer Program. If you believe your content has been infringed by another provider, submit a claim here. Subscriptions Lastly, Apple defines permissible uses for recurring app subscriptions it announced back in June. Auto-renewable In-App Subscriptions are now available across all app categories, with some of the provided examples covering such cases as: New game levels Episodic content Multi-player support Apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support Some of the permissible uses for auto-renewing app subscriptions include: Subscriptions may be offered alongside a la carte offerings (e.g. you may offer a subscription to an entire library of films as well the purchase or rental of a single movie). You may offer a single subscription that is shared across your own apps, but these subscriptions may not extend to third party apps or services. Subscriptions must work on all of the user’s devices where the app is available. Learn more about sharing a subscription across your apps. Apps must not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the app. As with all apps, those offering subscriptions should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Subscriptions may not include consumable credits, gems, in-game currencies, etc., even when combined with other offerings, but you may offer subscriptions that include access to discounted consumable goods (e.g. a platinum membership that exposes gem-packs for a reduced price). If you are changing your existing app to a subscription-based business model, you should not take away the primary functionality existing users have already paid for. For example, let customers who have already purchased a “full game unlock” continue to access the full game after you introduce a subscription model for new customers. The refreshed document states that users should not be able to inadvertently subscribe to “multiple variations of the same thing” and that apps should clearly describe what the user will get for their subscription (How many issues per month? How much cloud storage? What kind of access to your service?) and so forth. You can read the updated App Store Review Guidelines on Apple’s website.

Today Apple sent out an email to developers notifying them of a new evaluation process meant to find and remove "problematic" apps that haven't been updated for compatibility with recent versions of iOS and macOS. Apple says it's seeking out apps "that no longer function as intended" and those that fail to meet current review guidelines. The Apple developer website has also been updated with an explainer on the new process. If problems are found, the company will notify developers who've left these "abandoned" apps to collect dust in the App Store that changes must be made within 30 days. Failing that, those apps will be removed completely. However, apps that instantly crash when opened will be removed immediately once they go through Apple's evaluation process. "Quality is extremely important to us," the email reads. "We know that many of you work hard to build innovative apps and update your apps on the App Store with new content and features." If you've already downloaded an app that gets booted from the App Store, you'll still be able to keep using it. Whoa. This is huge. Apple reviewing old apps for quality + encouraging shorter app names. pic.twitter.com/S7C10yCOBC — Jake Marsh (@jakemarsh) September 1, 2016 Apple also announced another change in today’s notice: the names of new apps submitted to the store can no longer exceed 50 characters in length. According to Apple, this step is designed to prevent developers from gaming App Store search, which is "one of the most frequently used methods for customers to discover and download apps from the App Store." Some app makers have "used extremely long app names which include descriptions and terms not directly related to their app" to rank higher in search queries. The email warns that such lengthy names "are not fully displayed on the App Store and provide no user value." This change is particularly interesting ahead of the launch of iOS 10, which introduces Search Ads that let developers pay to be placed at the top of search results for terms relevant to their app. Both of these changes take effect beginning September 7th — the same day Apple is expected to announce a new iPhone, second-generation Apple Watch, and the public release date of iOS 10. Keep in mind that we're talking about software that hasn't been updated in years, so it's unlikely that this process will impact any of the everyday apps on your iPhone's home screen. Apple says that at present, the App Store contains over 2 million apps. So it's about time to start getting rid of the junk (hi, fart apps) and long forgotten selections from the App Store's early days to make room for the next era of mobile apps.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Cook's broadside, saying the demand for a 13 billion euro ($14.5 billion) back tax payment was based on the facts. Washington has lined up with the tech giant, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. But in Ireland itself, the government and public opinion are divided over whether to take the windfall - which would fund the country's health system for a year - or reject it in the hope of maintaining a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals, creating jobs. A group of independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the minority coalition's survival, called for a review of how tax is collected from multinationals. Their reluctance to back a call for an appeal by the country's finance minister has cast doubt on whether Ireland will challenge Vestager's decision. Apple has said it will appeal the ruling which Cook attacked in an interview with the Irish Independent. "No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable," the newspaper quoted him saying. "It's total political crap." Vestager has questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed the iPhone maker to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. She said on Thursday that the calculations were based on data provided by Apple itself and evidence presented during hearings on Apple tax issues in the United States. "This is a decision based on the facts of the case," she told a news conference. The battle lines are forming on both sides of the Atlantic. In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager's view that Apple's Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. "The European Commission is doing its job," he told a news conference. "It's normal to make Apple pay normal taxes." German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the Commission on Tuesday. Austria also welcomed the ruling but Britain - which voted in June to leave the EU - has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the Commission. "DOING THE WRONG THING" Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014. However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation due to misgivings among the five-strong Independent Alliance group of lawmakers. "I don't think Apple have paid sufficient tax. I don't think they've been illegal in what they've done, it's the tax system as it's set up," said Alliance member John Halligan, a junior minister who does not sit at cabinet. "The Independent Alliance have asked that we review our intake of tax, how we take tax in from multinationals and (assess) are we collecting fair tax," he told RTE radio. After five hours of discussion, the cabinet adjourned discussion of an appeal until Friday when the government said a decision would be made. Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. On the streets of Dublin, some argued Ireland had to keep drawing foreign investors with low tax rates to provide jobs. But others said the government should drop the idea of appealing the decision and take the money. "They are doing the wrong thing. They don't care about the normal people," said Louise O'Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. "The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive." O'Reilly's mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of 1,050 euros ($1,170), a higher rate than the EU said Apple's main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. By contrast, Cook estimated Apple's average annual tax on its global profits at 26 percent. "They just picked a number from I don't know where," he said. But in another interview he promised to boost tax payments by repatriating billions of dollars in global profits to the United States next year. Apple would fight with Ireland to overturn the ruling - by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU - which he said had "no basis in law or in fact". "DOING THE RIGHT THING" Cook played down the possibility of the government failing to appeal the decision. "The future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty," he told RTE radio. "I'm pretty confident that the government will do the right thing." In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticized the ruling. "I have been concerned that it reflected an attempt to reach into the U.S. tax base to tax income that ought to be taxed in the United States," he said on Wednesday. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Cook said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States.

According to the latest leaked images, Apple's next plus-size smartphone could feature more internal storage than any of its predecessors - meaning more room to download apps and store photos than ever before. There have been rumours that Apple is planning to launch a 256GB model for some time, but now a sheet outlining some of the key features of the iPhone 7 Plus has emerged on Chinese microblogging site Weibo , appearing to confirm the rumour. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, rumours, leaked images, price and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone Read More iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE: Dual-lens camera and NO headphone jack expected at Apple event 2016 The sheet clearly shows plans for a 256GB version of the device - doubling the capacity of the largest iPhone 6s Plus. This is a huge amount of storage for an iPhone. For context, it's the same amount of storage offered on Apple's top-of-the-range iPad Pro , which costs £739. Apple's decision to include this option may relate to rumours that the iPhone 7 Plus will have a dual lens camera , capable of capturing SLR-quality photos. If this is the case, it is likely that the images captured will take up a lot more storage space than standard iPhone photos. Leaked iPhone 7 v the iPhone 6 (Photo: YouTube/9to5Mac) Apple has also launched a new iCloud tier this week, offering a massive two terabytes of storage for just £19.99 a month. This is the largest amount of space offered by the company to date. The leaked spec sheet, whose authenticity has not been verified, also suggests that Apple's will bundle the new iPhone with its own EarPods, featuring a Lightning connector, and a "Lightning to Headphone Jack Adapter". This differs from earlier rumours, which suggested the iPhone 7 would come bundled with wireless "AirPod" earphones .

I wanted to show and highlight what an actual crime-fighting K9 could endure. The game was never made with the intention to glamorize harming dogs as "cool" or "fun". The only intention of this game is to provide the world with something new, fun, and creative. I'm happy and proud to release this game to the world, and I hope you all will enjoy it!

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! Can Apple Beat Snapchat and Instagram at Their Video Game? By John P. Mello Jr. Sep 1, 2016 10:02 AM PT Snapchat and Instagram, look out. Apple has you in its sights. The company is working on a video-sharing app with features similar to those found in Snapchat and Instagram, Bloomberg reported last week. The app, possibly slated for release in 2017, will allow users of Apple devices to record a video, apply filters and draw on it, then share it with others on a variety of social networks. Ease of use and quickness are paramount in the software's design. Users can perform most of its functions with one hand -- shooting, editing and uploading videos in less than a minute, noted Bloomberg. One version of the app allows users to shoot square video footage, as Instagram does. Although current plans reportedly call for a standalone app, Apple may decide to bundle the functions with a future version of its camera app. Apple has hired Joe Weil, who codeveloped the KnowMe video-blogging app, to lead the team on the project, which is being forged in the same department that created Apple's iMovie and Final Cut Pro video-editing apps, according to the Bloomberg report. Revenue Hunting If Apple is developing a Snapchat-like app, it could be a sign the company is concerned about future growth in iPhone sales. "In a time when iPhone revenues are growing at a more earthly rate, Apple is looking for incremental revenue elsewhere," said Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners. Because social media is hot right now, it may seem sensible to embed those capabilities in new or existing applications and services, but such thinking ignores the current market reality, he suggested. "Between SnapChat and Instagram, the young generation has made up its mind where to chat, exchange personal pictures or videos, and tell life stories as they occur," Scherer told TechNewsWorld. "For the same reason that Google+ had a tough time breaking into Facebook's turf, it will be very difficult for Apple to compete with the two incumbents," he maintained. Overblown Reports It's questionable whether Apple actually is gunning for Snapchat and Instagram. "I think the stories are mostly a little overblown in calling this a Snapchat competitor," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. Apple only wants to give people more ways to edit videos and share them over other social networks -- the Bloomberg report suggests no more than that, he maintained. "Apple doesn't seem to be trying to compete with Facebook or Snapchat directly here," Dawson told TechNewsWorld. Apple just wants "to capture more of the time users spend on Apple devices in its own apps rather than third-party apps, and this is one way to do this," he explained. "It's the same strategy that's seen Apple launch News and Music in recent years too. Past Stumbles If Apple were to take on Snapchat and Instagram head to head, CEO Tim Cook might find himself on the losing side. "Tim Cook doesn't have a history of doing social media right, and it is incredibly difficult to do right, so I think the odds are against Apple with this effort," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "Like Microsoft found with search, once people are happy with another platform it is really hard to get them to switch, even if you are the OS owner," he told TechNewsWorld. Apple painfully discovered the pitfalls of social media when it tried to launch a music-focused social network called "Ping" in 2010 -- the company pulled the plug on it in 2012. Apple's cautious approach with this app likely can be attributed to "the difficulty they've had in the past with these kinds of platforms," said John Carroll, a mass communications professor at Boston University. "They're taking extra care in developing this," he told TechNewsWorld, "to try and ensure that they have the most effective application possible."

Tsunamis Can Get Much, Much Bigger Than You Think 10 Cars We Can't Wait to Drive in 2017 What to Do When the Dealer Says Nothing's Wrong The iPhone Is Losing Its Headphone Jack But You'll Be Fine It's an annoying change—an outright bad one, even—but you'll survive. Most Popular YouTube MobileFunTV By Eric Limer Sep 1, 2016 For those of you living under a rock, it is virtually certain that the iPhone 7, due to be announced next week, will only have a single Lightning port at its bottom and will come with a pair of earbuds that end in a Lighting connector instead of a traditional 3.5mm plug. It's an annoying change, a bad one even, but you'll make it through. After all, there's nothing you can do about it. What's wrong with the headphone jack? It's impossible to know exactly what the designers at Apple are thinking with their decision to kill the headphone jack, but you can get an idea of what they're going for: thinness and simplicity, though perhaps both to a fault. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A headphone jack might not seem like much on the outside, but inside an actual phone it takes up a fair amount of space. Not only does the port have to be thick enough to accommodate the plug with no room for thinning down, but it also has to be as deep as the plug is long, with a block electronics around the plug dedicated to dealing with it. As this X-ray shot from iFixit's iPhone 6s teardown shows, the headphone jack takes up as much space as the Lightning port and Home button combined! iFixit Most Popular If that's your only option, then it's a necessary evil, but it turns out that Apple's Lightning Port (as well as its Android equivalent, USB Type-C) can do all all the same work. Plus it's already got other jobs like functioning as a charging port and data connection, so it needs to be there. The headphone jack, not so much. Getting rid of it will not only let future iPhones get thinner (not like they really need to be) but also open up that precious space for other guts that do a unique job instead of a redundant one. The iPhone will also be simpler. With the headphone jack gone, there will only be one place to plug everything in. Nobody was really getting confused or overwhelmed what with two whole jacks(!) but removing one will eliminate one of the few parts of the phone susceptible to physical wear and tear. The other big one, the Home Button, is rumored to be on the chopping block too. Related Article Get Excited for an iPhone Without a Home Button Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Last (and maybe least), one less port should make the phone much easier to waterproof because there are fewer holes for water to get in. Apple's already been quietly dabbling in water resistance. Other waterproof phones like Samsung's latest Galaxies claim to be waterproof even with a headphone jack, but they can wind up having a little trouble. But none of that can counteract the brutal reality iPhone owners are about to face: Not having a headphone jack is going to be a pain in the ass. The inconveniences include, but are not limited to: Not being able to charge and have headphones plugged in at the same time. Not being able to use normal headphones without a dongle. Being out of luck if your dongle breaks or gets lost. Having to buy Lightning headphones if you don't want to use a dongle. Not being able to use your Lightning headphones anywhere other than your iPhone. You could make the case that this litany of downsides outweighs any of the benefits. Too bad! Apple is forging ahead regardless. Yes, this is going to be annoying, but here's what you can do to make it a little less irritating. Better go Bluetooth If you've already got a pair of Bluetooth headphones, they're about to become way more useful. If you don't, there's never been a better time to grab a pair; even without the coming headphone jack-pocolypse Bluetooth headphones can be incredibly handy. there's never been a better time to grab a pair of Bluetooth headphones. If you exercise, you haven't known true freedom until you have listened to music without a wire running to your pocket or arm. Have you ever caught the cable of your headphones on a doorknob and had them yanked out of your earholes? Bluetooth headphones will save you from that horror. Perhaps best of all, Bluetooth headphones let you listen to music or podcasts on headphones without being particularly close to your phone. I don't know how I lived before I could do dishes, listen to a podcast, and charge my phone on the other side of the room all at once. Bluetooth headphones used to be bulky and expensive, but they're not (necessarily) anymore. You can get a good pair of over-the-ear Bluetooth headphones like the Jabra Move for around $70. If you're a stickler for quality and willing to pay for it, there are plenty of more expensive but better-sounding options like the $350 Bose QuietComfort 35. If you prefer in-ear buds—which are a little subtler and better for working out—there are a wealth of options there too. I have a pair of Jabra Coach earbuds that I couldn't live without, and there are much cheaper options as well, like these $20 SoundPEATS. Though when it comes to Bluetooth headphones, you can justify a little bit of a splurge. Without a plug that's constantly bending and eventually shorts out, Bluetooth headphones are practically immortal. Just don't splurge on those totally wireless ones that look like two earplugs and come in a little case. You will lose one eventually, especially because there's no good way to hang them around your neck when they're not in your ears. Be nice to your back-up 'buds The obvious problem with Bluetooth headphones is that they will run out of battery, inevitably at the worst time. Fortunately, the new iPhone is pretty much guaranteed to come with Apple's traditional "EarPods" but in Lightning connector form. You're going to want to keep these in your backpack or purse because otherwise you might actually be stuck alone with your thoughts for a bit when your Bluetooth headphones run out of charge. Be sure to treat these with extra love and care; if they break, you'll be stuck either paying for another pair of special headphones that only work with your iPhone, or buying an annoying dongle that turns old 3.5mm plugs into Lightning plugs. If you're in love with a set of wired headphones you already have, it might be worth it to pick up an adapter, but brace yourself: Apple's adapters aren't known for being cheap. And dongles are just annoying in general. If you can get away without buying one, you should. Apple is very excited about the wireless future, which is why its new Macbook hardly has any ports either. It's a little bit irritating in the meantime, where we are all used to our wired earbuds that never have to charge and other cabled devices that will never randomly drop a connection.

According to The Wall Street Journal: The European Union’s antitrust regulator has demanded that Ireland recoup roughly €13 billion ($14.5 billion) in taxes from Apple Inc., after ruling that a deal with Dublin allowed the company to avoid almost all corporate tax across the entire bloc for more than a decade—a move that could intensify a feud between the EU and the U.S. over the bloc’s tax probes into American companies. With all of the finger pointing and spin, it’s important to take stock of the facts. Let’s be clear—Apple’s pretense that it is a good corporate citizen that pays its taxes is now over. ⦁ The European Commission has disclosed how, with assistance from the Irish government, Apple attributed over 99% of the profits it earned in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India to a phantom “head office” with no employees, premises, or economic activity, and ensured those profits were never taxed by anyone. ⦁ Moreover, less than 1% of Apple’s profits were made subject to Irish taxes.  According to the European Commission, the end result was that in 2011, for every 1 million Euros in profits, Apple paid 500 Euros in tax, a tax rate of 0.05%.  In 2014, Apple’s tax rate dropped even lower—for every 1 million Euros in profits, Apple paid just 50 Euros in tax, a tax rate of 0.005%. Offshore tax dodging is a very serious and growing problem. It negatively effects each and every nation in the world. However, American taxpayers lose more than any other country to tax dodging by multinational companies—up to $135 billion this year. Today, the European Union (E.U.) signaled that it is engaged in a serious conversation and is willing to take steps to address aggressive tax avoidance and tax haven countries that facilitate the problem. Unfortunately, the U.S. Administration and Congress have been less willing to do the same.  While saying they are defending U.S. tax dollars, current proposals from both the Administration and Congress to address the problem are more a giveaway to companies than a serious attempt to collect what companies owe. The current proposal from the Administration would reward U.S. multinationals that offshore profits—now estimated at a combined total of $2.4 trillion—with a discounted tax rate of 14% (approx. $336 billion).  At that rate, Apple, with more than $50 billion in profits in 2015, would be in the same tax bracket as an individual who makes $30,000.  Congressional plans have been even worse—proposing an 8.75% rate (approx. $210 billion). Those amounts are far less than if they paid the current corporate tax rate. At the current rate, they owe approximately $700 billion. Apple alone has approximately $215 billion booked offshore. The U.S. Treasury and individual members of Congress have spoken out against the European action.  Some have said that this decision robs the U.S. of tax revenue and they are fighting for our share.  If the dispute with the European Commission is in fact about U.S. tax dollars, where is the push from the Administration or Congress to claim the larger sums that Apple still owes taxpayers?  They should be less concerned with the $14.5 billion in taxes that Apple owes Ireland, and more focused on the remaining $51.5 billion that Apple owes U.S. taxpayers. Even more important, the Administration and Congress should act to end the policy that allows companies to move profits offshore untaxed. They should eliminate the practice of ‘deferral.’  Tax deferral allows multinational companies to book their profits offshore and avoid paying tax on those profits indefinitely—until such time as they re-book those profits back in the U.S. That’s the serious debate. The time has come to end deferral.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Apple Watch 2 is expected to debut at an event next week alongside the iPhone 7. Plenty of details surrounding the second-generation smartwatch have already been spilled, but a new video may confirm a couple of major hardware changes. Electronics retailer Byte got its hands on some alleged Apple Watch 2 components, including the new battery and display panel. A quick round of testing revealed some major battery upgrades. The new power pack scored a 1.28 WH rating (up from 0.98 for the original Apple Watch battery. A bigger battery could potentially mean better battery life, which would be a great improvement for the Apple Watch 2. However, it’s also possible the new battery could simply compensate for a faster processor and the addition of built-in GPS. In that case, battery life may not change at all despite the internal upgrade. As for the display, Byte says it’s “noticeably thinner” that the last model, though the screen size hasn’t changed. That could mean a slimmer Apple Watch 2 overall. It’s also possible the bigger battery inside could balance out the difference, keeping the device’s thickness consistent as a result. Finally, you can see the new Force Touch gasket for the Apple Watch 2. It’s been updated as well with a fresh layout, but it’s unclear exactly how that will change the overall experience. Check out the full video below, and stay tuned for the rumored unveiling next week on September 7.

Lew to discuss the upcoming G20 leaders’ summit. Secretary Lew discussed the top agenda items of the summit, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Apple’s tax battle with Ireland and the European Union, U.S. economic growth over the last eight years, policies that include emerging economies in global economic growth, combating cybercrime, fossil fuel subsidies, and carbon pricing. Secretary Lew was introduced by Kemal Derviş, vice president and director of the Global Economy and Development Program. Following his opening remarks, the Treasury secretary was joined by David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, in a discussion on what to expect from the G20 Summit later this week. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email The secretary said that, at the G20 Summit, President Obama will encourage inclusive and shared growth, investment in jobs, pro-growth policies, and new fiscal measures while discouraging structural reforms that are not paired with macro-economic policies and combating excessive production. Obama will also continue to emphasize American leadership on financial reform and fiscal policy. The president is also expected to focus heavily on environmental issues at the summit, including discussions on implementing the final stages of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and adopting the recommendations of the Green Finance Study Group. During his opening statement, Secretary Lew remarked on how the G20 contributed to impressive growth and economic improvement in the wake of the 2008 recession. Lew explained that comparing the state of the U.S. economy eight years ago to the current economic situation is similar to comparing “night and day.” He expressed that, while there is still room for improvement, the U.S. remains a “pillar of strength in the world economy” as a result of coordination among G20 countries. Watch: The secretary also discussed inclusive growth, one of President Obama’s top priorities for the G20 Summit. He explained how including emerging economies in growth can improve quality of life globally and commented on how increased globalization benefits the U.S. and global economies. Additionally, he highlighted the need for policymakers to discuss inclusive growth regularly, instead of solely in the context of trade agreements.

Bradford and Johannes F. Linn Thursday, October 18, 2007 On whether he felt optimistic about passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before the end of Obama’s presidency, Secretary Lew said that he thinks there will be a vote on the trade deal by the end of President Obama’s term. He emphasized that the president remains committed to TPP and will use “every ounce of energy” that he and his administration have to see the deal through before he leaves office. Watch: Secretary Lew expressed his concerns on the accusations that Apple evaded taxes in Ireland. He explained his desire to work with Congress to close tax loopholes and combat tax evasion. Secretary Lew also explained that companies should think about their reputations when making decisions on their tax policies. He stated that “a company doesn’t have to take an action just because it’s permitted” and that CEOs should think about the long-term effects of their tax policies before implementing them. When asked if he believed that the European Union was unfairly targeting U.S. firms, Secretary Lew answered that the EU seemed to be highly focused on U.S. firms. Additionally, he mentioned that this could be an attempt by the EU to draw profits from the U.S. tax base. Watch: Related Books Upcoming Russia’s Addiction By Clifford G. Gaddy and Barry W.

Apple has also also introduced Security Update 2016-005 for OS X Yosemite users. The Security Updates are available to all OS X Yosemite and El Capitan users and can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Apple recommends all users install the update, and a full list of what's fixed can be found in the accompanying support document. Most security updates are generally built into OS X updates as they are released, with separate security-only updates only being introduced when standard updates to the operating system are not expected. The release of a Security Update for OS X El Capitan suggests we may not see any new versions of the operating system ahead of the launch of macOS Sierra. Update: Today’s security update fixes a series of critical kernel vulnerabilities that were recently patched in iOS with the release of iOS 9.3.5. On iOS devices, the vulnerabilities were part of a sophisticated jailbreak and malware attack that gave access to all of the functionality of an iPhone or iPad. Citizen Lab and Lookout, who discovered the vulnerabilities on OS X and iOS, are credited with the fix. Update 2: There's also a Safari 9.1.3 update to fix vulnerabilities in the Safari browser. 76 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) tywebb13 18 weeks ago 400 MB. Serious ****. There are three parts to it.

I have a macbook air 2015 13 inch. Does anyone know a fix for this cause I didn't back my mac up? Have you tried a PRAM reset? I know it sounds silly to many "experts" here, but most startup issues should be troubleshot with this step first and foremost (and it works wonders many times).

Apple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook has disputed the tax figures presented by the European Competition Commissioner and insisted that it pays a global tax rate of 26.1 percent. He told Irish state radio RTE: “It’s maddening, it’s disappointing. It’s clear that this comes from a political place. It has no basis in fact or in law. When you are accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values it brings out an outrage in you. That is how we feel. Apple has always been about doing the right thing. Never the easy thing.” He added: “It is very easy to see what our tax rate is and our tax payments. We disclose them publicly worldwide. Anybody can look at those.” Listen: 'No special deal between Ireland and Apple' – Tim Cook https://t.co/NCZLYImHj8— Morning Ireland (@morningireland) September 1, 2016 Based on facts European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager rejected Cook’s argument saying the demand is based on facts including evidence given to US congressional hearings into Apple’s tax affairs: “The figures that we use in our decision are the figures that we get from Apple themselves. And some of the figures back from 2011 come from the US hearings. There are very, very little, if any, figures in the public domain. And our investigation is not into the Apple corporation as such, it is Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. And that it is where the figures of – in some years – 0.005% of tax rate are accurate.” Vestager said those two Apple subsidiaries received favourable tax treatment and put the profits on sales from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India into Ireland. It was the US Congressional investigation into Apple’s tax practices that got the Competition Commissioner looking at how that worked and led to the Irish ruling. Irish tax rulings to Apple are illegal state aid. Effective taxation as low as 0,005 pct. #Apple has to repay up to €13 billion unpaid tax.— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) August 30, 2016 Battle lines forming In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager’s view that Apple’s Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. “The European Commission is doing its job,” he told a news conference. “It’s normal to make Apple pay normal taxes.” German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the Commission on Tuesday. However, Britain – which voted in June to leave the EU – has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the Commission. Washington has lined up with Apple, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the US government. Video of my conversaton with Jack Lew today on Apple, G20, etc. https://t.co/fGVOoUxcPO via YouTube</a></p>&mdash; David Wessel (davidmwessel) August 31, 2016 Vestager has said she will meet US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in Washington in September to further discuss the Apple case. She also indicated said more cases could follow: “It is only when tax rulings are used as a tool to give illegal state aid that we take an issue and we get the concern and we start asking more detailed questions and we eventually may open cases, which is also to say that, you know, we have two open cases right now, McDonald’s and Amazon, but I will not preclude that there cannot be more cases. That depends on what we find when we ask more questions.” Call for review of multinationals’ tax In Ireland itself, the government and public opinion are divided over whether to take the 13 billion euro windfall – which would fund the country’s health system for a year – or reject it in the hope of maintaining a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals and created jobs. A group of independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the minority coalition’s survival, called for a review of how tax is collected from multinationals. Their reluctance to back an appeal against the ruling has cast doubt on whether Ireland will challenge Vestager’s decision. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014. However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation due to misgivings among the five-strong Independent Alliance group of lawmakers. “I don’t think Apple have paid sufficient tax. I don’t think they’ve been illegal in what they’ve done, it’s the tax system as it’s set up,” said Alliance member John Halligan, a junior minister who is not a cabinet member. “The Independent Alliance have asked that we review our intake of tax, how we take tax in from multinationals and (assess) are we collecting fair tax,” he told RTE radio.

Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the Irish government’s survival prospects.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Lurssen Mastering Console for Mac/PC and iOS Adds “Digital Delivery Mastering” Feature in Latest Update Lurssen Mastering Console for Mac/PC and iOS Adds “Digital Delivery Mastering” Feature in Latest Update Posted on September 1, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Lurssen Mastering Console for Mac/PC and iOS now lets musicians create "Mastered for iTunes®" specification compliant audio masters for digital distribution services like iTunes®, Spotify®, Pandora® and more Sunrise, FL (PRWEB) September 01, 2016 IK Multimedia, the leader in mobile music creation, is pleased to announce an update to Lurssen Mastering Console for Mac/PC and iOS that adds "Digital Delivery Mastering" – a feature that lets musicians and audio engineers prepare their mastered audio files for popular digital distribution services to comply with Apple's "Mastered for iTunes" specifications. The update is complimentary for current owners of Lurssen Mastering Console for Mac/PC, and is an included feature in the HD engine in-app purchase in the iOS release. Five new style presets for Hard Rock/Heavy Metal music are also included in this update. Digital Delivery Mastering – "Mastered for iTunes" For musicians and engineers mastering music for digital distribution and streaming services like iTunes, Pandora and Spotify, Lurssen Mastering Console now ensures their music is compliant with Apple's Mastered for iTunes specification – an industry first. Lurssen Mastering Console's new Digital Delivery Mastering (DDM) feature provides mastered audio files that comply with specifications for sample rate, bit depth and peak levels, ensuring that audio translates perfectly for compressed formats like AAC. Apple's Mastered for iTunes specifications states that files have to comply with high-resolution sample rate and bit depth requirements and that no clipping at or over 0.0dBFS should be present in the digital masters being submitted. As the tendency in contemporary digital music production is to go for super loud masters, distortion can be created as a by-product of extreme use of digital peak limiters pushing up the level. Even though the file's maximum peak level is not exceeding 0.0 dBFS, digital overshoots can still occur when the file is de-compressed back to PCM format for playback. This is where the new Digital Delivery Mastering option for Lurssen Mastering Console comes in. It offers an additional layer of protection against peak overshoots that could be generated when decoding the compressed format for playback. This can cause clips that may go unnoticed while mixing and mastering with regular sample peak meters. The additional layer of protection is achieved by the peak limiter at the end of the mastering chain working in a specific way. This guarantees that the compressed file is safe from distortion when played back from digital distribution services such as Apple's iTunes, Spotify and Pandora. The Digital Delivery Mastering option is part of the HD Engine in-app purchase, and can be enabled independently from the HD Engine in the settings menu. It is also included in the free update for Mac/PC users. Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Style presets Lurssen Mastering Console provides mind-blowing results in record time through an intuitive set of controls and settings. "Styles" presets created by Gavin Lurssen, Reuben Cohen and the team at Lurssen Mastering, Inc., define the gear chain and provide the settings for virtually every genre including Rock, Country, Americana, Pop, EDM and more. In this new release, five new styles have been added for creating Hard Rock/Heavy Metal mastered files. With these additional presets, users can now find a mastering starting point for virtually every style and genre of music. About Lurssen Mastering Console Lurssen Mastering Console is a totally unique and easy-to-use approach to audio mastering. It features a processor chain that's built to reproduce the sequence, gear, hookups and settings used by the team at Lurssen Mastering, Inc. to master virtually every style of music today.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 07:14, Fri, Sep 2, 2016 | UPDATED: 07:14, Fri, Sep 2, 2016 EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSThe JBL Playlist is the firm’s latest speaker – and now comes in an interesting new colour choice Apple has scheduled its next media event on September 7th, where the US firm is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The next Apple smartphone is widely-rumoured to shun the industry standard 3.5mm headphone port. It’s also expected to ship with more internal storage, as well as improved water resistance.  Apple is also expected to debut a new colour alongside the launch, but sources and industry experts have disagreed over the new shade. MARTIN HAJEK • FLICKRDesigner Martin Hajek has created a number of renders, based on the leaked information MARTIN HAJEK • FLICKRApple is expected to introduce a new colour – believed to be a dark Blue – with the iPhone 7 However premier audio brand JBL might just have given us our biggest clue yet. JBL launched a new Google Cast enabled speaker – the JBL Playlist – during its annual media event at the IFA technology show. And a company spokesperson gave a fascinating reason for its choice of colour scheme. The firm chose to introduce the deep navy colour into the range in an effort to align with “a few more devices” that will launch “in the near future”. “We believe this will be an important colour this holiday season,” a JBL spokesperson told Express.co.uk. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSJBL's new smart Hi-Fi home speaker bakes in Google Cast technology EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSThe firm is believed to have chosen the new shade of blue to match the upcoming iPhone 7 A number of leaked parts have hinted at a deep blue colour for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Last year, Apple introduced Rose Gold into the iPhone lineup.  With this year’s iPhone only expected to boast minor design tweaks, it would make sense for the company to freshen the line-up with a blue anodised aluminium finish. The JBL Playlist is the latest speaker to join the company's line up, which was also updated to enable Google Now and Siri support. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSJBL Playlist launches in the UK in October – just in time to match your new Deep Blue iPhone 7 The smart Hi-Fi home speaker bakes in Google Cast technology, enabling you to stream high-quality audio across a home wifi network, straight from your favourite music streaming apps. JBL Playlist allows anyone to instantly stream music, radio, or podcasts directly from their Android phone or tablet, iPhone, iPad, Mac or Windows laptop. Google Cast offers a key competitive advantage for the JBL Playlist, since it lets users to easily share audio from their existing apps, like Spotify and TuneIn Radio without pairing via Bluetooth. Users can enjoy higher quality audio than achieved with a standard Bluetooth connection. This new speaker launches in October – just in time to match your new Deep Blue iPhone 7.

Compared to the previous model, the camera has moved from the centre of the device to the left, which also gives it more of an iPhone look.

The device shares a similar curved metal body to Apple's iPhone 6S, and even the camera has been moved from the centre to the left corner in the new model However, inside the case the differences between the cameras are stark.

However, HTC has introduced its Boost+ feature from its flagship model the HTC 10, which monitors app power consumption. The A9s also features a 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5MP front camera.

Share this article Share The HTC One A9s shares the iPhone's distinctive bands that break up the metal body (pictured) RUMOURS AND RELEASES FOR IFA 2016 Acer: Taiwanese firm Acer today released an ultraslim laptop, the Swift 7. Thinner than 1cm, it has an HD display and 7th generation Intel Core i5 processor.  At the other end of the scale, it released the chunky 21-inch Predator 21x gaming laptop, which it claims is the first curved display with eye tracking technology. Other releases included the Pawbo+ gadget, enabling users to monitor their pets while they are away from home. Asus: Hardware firm Asus came out of the traps today with its ZenWatch3 smartwatch, powered by Android and with a round case.  The Taiwanese firm also added a high end laptop - the ZenBook 3 - monitor and 9.7 inch Android tablet to its product line up. Fitbit: New wearable devices - the Flex 2 and Charge 2 - along with more fashionable bracelets are expected from the fitness tracking tech giant. Google: News could emerge around Google's Daydream VR, but a launch is unlikely.   Huawei: Huawei is holding a pre-IFA launch event on Thursday 1st September. The Chinese manufacturer is expected to drop two new smartphone handsets at IFA, and potentially a new samartwatch as well. HTC: HTC has said its new One A9s will be cheaper than its predecessor the HTC One A9, which it launched in November last year. Lenovo/Motorola: Lenovo will hold a press event at 7PM BST this evening and is rumoured to be readying a number of Motorola handsets for release, including the Moto Z and Moto M.  LG: South Korean electronics firm LG is expected to bring its new V20 smartphone to the event. The handset won't officially launch until 6th September, but is rumoured to be one of the first to be shipped with Android's latest Nougat OS.  Sony: The Japanese consumer tech behemoth will hold a press event on Thursday 1st September at 12pm BST. New additions are expected to the Xperia smartphone range and laptops ZTE: The Chinese smartphone manufacturer could potentially release new handsets, but little is known at this stage. But all could be revealed at ZTE's press conference on Thursday 1st September at 1.30pm BST. The new phone is expected to launch on October 14 but HTC, which unveiled the phone at the IFA2016 in Berlin, has still to announce its pricing. The A9 cost $399 in the US when it was launched and £429 in the UK, but the new model is expected to cost less. Available in a black, gold or silver finish, it is the appearance of the A9s that has raised most eyebrows. While the HTC One A9s shares some of the iPhone 6s's (pictured) physical appearance, the hardware and performance of the devices are quite different International Business Times said the comparisons with the Apple iPhone were ‘not helped on the A9s due to the shift in camera placement from the middle to the corner’. Wired described the device as a ‘mid-range metal-clad iPhone-lookalike Android handset. Meanwhile, Huawei launched two new handsets at IFA2016 – the nova and nova plus. It claims the devices have a battery lifespan of up to two days and feature a 3D fingerprint sensor on its back that can be personalised to control many of the phones functions including taking pictures. Huawei also unveiled two new devices the nova (pictured) and the nova plus which features a fingerprint sensor on its rear side The Huawei nova is expected to sell for €399 while the Huawei nova plus will go on sale for €429. Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei Consumer Business Group, said: "Our designers have created beautiful devices that meet the needs of our increasingly demanding lifestyles. ‘These handsets will allow users to burn more brightly, to get the most out of each day and to enhance their lives with the best specifications and functionalities in the segment."   Read more: IFA 2016: HTC One A9s specs revealed for mid-range smartphone IFA 2016: HTC One A9s looks even more like a mid-range iPhone | WIRED UK Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Cook’s broadside, saying the demand for a 13 billion euro (US$14.5 billion) back tax payment was based on facts. Washington has lined up with the tech giant, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the US government. But in Ireland itself, public opinion and the government are divided over whether to take the windfall — which would fund the country’s health system for a year — or reject it in the hope of keeping a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals and the jobs they create. Apple has said it will appeal the ruling which Cook attacked in an interview with the Irish Independent. “No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable,” the newspaper quoted him saying. “It’s total political crap.” Vestager has questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed the iPhone maker to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. She said yesterday the calculations were based on data provided by Apple itself and evidence presented during hearings on Apple tax issues in the US. Asked if she accepted Cook’s comments on the ruling, she told a news conference: “No, I will not. This is a decision based on the facts of the case.” The battle lines are forming on both sides of the Atlantic. In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager’s view that Apple’s Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. “The European Commission is doing its job,” he told a news conference. “It’s normal to make Apple pay normal taxes.” German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the commission on Tuesday. However, Britain — which voted in June to leave the EU — has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the commission. Opinion is divided on the streets of Dublin. Some argued Ireland had to keep drawing foreign investors with low tax rates to provide jobs. But others said the government should drop the idea of appealing the decision and take the money. “They are doing the wrong thing. They don’t care about the normal people,” said Louise O’Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. “The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive.” O’Reilly’s mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of 1,050 euros (US$1,170), a higher rate than the EU said Apple’s main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. By contrast, Cook estimated Apple’s average annual tax on its global profits at 26 percent. “They just picked a number from I don’t know where,” he said. “I think that Apple was targeted here,” he said. “And I think that (anti-US sentiment) is one reason why we could have been targeted ... I think it’s a desire to reallocate taxes that should be paid in the US to the EU.” Apple would fight closely with Ireland to overturn the ruling — by far the largest anti-competition fine imposed on a firm by the EU — which he said had “no basis in law or in fact”. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014. However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation of an appeal. A group of independent lawmakers represented in the minority coalition say they need to consult further with Noonan, tax officials and independent experts. After five hours of discussion, the cabinet adjourned until today when the government said a decision would be made. Any failure of the Independent Alliance group to come on board would cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Cook played down the possibility of the government failing to appeal the decision. “The future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty,” he told RTE radio. “I’m pretty confident the government will do the right thing.” IT <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=31&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=55&x=js'></script> Most Read Today Weekly Monthly China launches first freight train to London Heavy smog suspends schools, causes travel problems Violators of smog rules punished China's investment in US in new year expected to grow fast Britain to launch new pound coin to deter counterfeiters Customs finds 3 tons of pangolin scales 64-Year-Old Woman Gives Birth Drunk Driver Dies after Driving off Overpass Century-old Dashijie is back in business after 13-year revamp It’s full speed ahead as railway links Shanghai with Kunming China issues first white paper on traditional Chinese medicine Warning of poorer relations in Trump era Probe into US airline’s runway slip at Pudong Firms fined for cashing in on BMW logo Customs finds 3 tons of pangolin scales <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=125&h=125&posid=21&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=160&h=600&posid=20&x=js'></script> Latest News ANZ sells stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank for 1.3 bln USD Sudan gov't holds rebel movement responsible for bloody incidents in Darfur Hunt goes on for gunman behind nightclub attack Syrian arrested in Germany for ‘planning terror’ Suicide bomber kills at least 36 in Baghdad market blast View more » Latest Business News China's investment in US in new year expected to grow fast Mainland-HK trade drops 7.1% in first 11 months HK stocks close the year flat Confidence sparkles City’s FTZ leading the way Battered Toshiba may run out of choices View more » °C | °F Shanghai Weather Loading...

This rendering of the iPhone 7 in "space black" also shows the handset with a pressure-sensitive home button and no headphone jack Credit: Martin Hajek Telegraph Reporters 1 September 2016 • 6:00pm Whenever Apple releases a phone that looks fairly similar to its predecessor the company normally adds a new colour to the roster of options that device is available in.  For example, in 2015 the Silicon Valley giant introduced a "rose gold" version of the iPhone 6s, which proved extremely popular. Two years before it brought in the white and gold iPhone 5s, as well as a raft of bright colours on the iPhone 5c.  Given that the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is expected to look almost identical to the last two generations of the phone, Apple may release a new colour or set of colours to entice its customers to upgrade.  Leakers and Apple experts alike have been speculating what colours Apple could add. Here are some of the suggestions:  Glossy black A leaked imaged of the full colour range for the iPhone 7 Credit: Macotakara This leaked image from Macotakara of iPhone SIM card trays indicates that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus could come in five colours, including two new glossy and matte black shades. The glossy black sheen is reminiscent of the Mac Pro, and marks a step away from the company's recent tendency to release its products in lighter, more subtle colours.  Space black An alleged leaked image of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in black and silver  Credit: Macotakara Moving away from the silver, gold, rose gold and space grey of the iPhone 6s, Apple could replace the grey colour with a darker shade closer to "space black".  Copper Yasser Farahi's designs suggest the iPhone 7 could come with two new colour options "wine" and "copper" Credit: Yasser Farahi This concept design from Yasser Farahi shows the iPhone 7 could come with more colour options than the iPhone 6s, but in subtler shades than those available for the iPhone 5c. Farahi drops rose gold and instead replaces it with copper and wine shades.  Purple This leaked image shows the iPhone 7 could come in a purple colour Credit: YouTube Another suggestion that the upcoming handsets could come in purple, this picture instead goes for more of a violet colour than the plum shade of Farahi's design.  Blue #Apple #iPhone7Pro first look to a BLUE WORKING prototype (source PCOnline.cn) pic.twitter.com/Z7oQzr6l4s— The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 16, 2016 These working prototype shots shared by prominent leaker the Malignant show Apple could also release a blue iPhone.  Although the iPhone might look fairly similar to the 6s at first glance, it is expected to feature a host of upgrades, including a bigger and better camera, improved battery life and a faster processor. Apple is also expected to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack, make the home button pressure-sensitive, and move the antenna bands to the top and bottom edges of the device.  The iPhone 7 is due to be unveiled on September 7 at the company's annual product launch event in San Francisco.  controversial decisions that made the iPhone better   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 02 Jan 2017, 12:51pm How to permanently delete your Facebook account 02 Jan 2017, 11:05am Delete yourself from the internet with this website 02 Jan 2017, 10:34am Teenager invents phone charger which generates energy from the human body 01 Jan 2017, 8:00pm CES 2017: New technologies on display are yet to convince the public of their value  Premium 31 Dec 2016, 7:01pm Google plans UK launch of paid-for YouTube Red service 31 Dec 2016, 4:41pm Letting technology ease the burden of business trips  Premium 31 Dec 2016, 11:28am The 10 best video games of 2016 30 Dec 2016, 4:18pm iPhone bug will break the Messages app with a single text - here's how to fix it 30 Dec 2016, 2:37pm CES 2017: What to expect and when is it? 30 Dec 2016, 1:38pm Hipster Michelin-starred restaurant uses iPads instead of plates 30 Dec 2016, 1:22pm Parents claim Hatchimals are mumbling swear words in their sleep 30 Dec 2016, 12:53pm The best robots of 2016 30 Dec 2016, 10:48am Twitter may finally let users edit their tweets 01:02 29 Dec 2016, 10:01pm Who was Charles Macintosh?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Sep 02, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Samsung recovery stumbles as Note 7 ‘catches fire’ ‘MAJOR BUZZKILL’:An expected product launch by Apple next week is putting pressure on Samsung to resolve the issue quickly, IDC analyst Bryan Ma said Reuters, SEOUL Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s mobile recovery was under pressure yesterday after it delayed shipments of its premium Galaxy Note 7 smartphone amid reports of exploding batteries, wiping about US$7 billion off its market value. Investors drove the stock to two-week lows after the global smartphone leader on Wednesday said the shipments had been delayed for quality control testing, and that shipments to South Korea’s top three mobile carriers had been halted. Faults with the new flagship device could deal a major blow to the South Korean giant, which was counting on the Galaxy Note 7 to maintain its strong mobile earnings momentum against Apple Inc’s new iPhones expected to be unveiled next week. “This is some major buzzkill for Samsung, especially given all of the hard-earned excitement that products like the Note 7 have been garnering lately,” IDC analyst Bryan Ma (馬伯遠) said. “The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn’t have been worse.” Samsung did not comment on what problem it was trying to address or whether other markets were affected besides South Korea. Sister company Samsung SDI Co Ltd said that while it was a supplier of Galaxy Note 7 batteries, it had received no information to suggest the batteries were faulty. Several people posted images and videos of charred Galaxy Note 7s online and said their smartphones had caught on fire. “Be careful out there, everyone rocking the new Note 7, might catch fire y’all,” one user said in a YouTube clip showing a burned Note phone. Samsung’s shares, which hit a record high of 1.694 million won last week, dropped 2.5 percent as of 2:08pm in Seoul, and Samsung SDI tumbled 6.1 percent, versus a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market. Last year, production problems for the curved displays for the Galaxy S6 edge model resulted in disappointing sales, and Samsung risks a repeat this year if it cannot address the Galaxy Note 7 problems quickly. Its mobile profit is on track to post annual growth for the first time in three years, thanks to robust sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices that it launched in March to critical acclaim. The Galaxy Note 7 received similar praise, raising expectations for strong sales in the second half. Samsung last month said demand for the new handset, priced at 988,900 won (US$882) in South Korea, was far exceeding supply, pushing the firm to delay the launch in some markets. Though a components pick-up would buttress overall profits, HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon said mobile operating profit might decline by up to 200 billion won between July and this month. The mobile division accounted for about 54 percent of Samsung Electronics’ January-to-June operating profit of 14.8 trillion won. This story has been viewed 1411 times. Comments will be moderated.

It's quite another for such power to be in the hands of a single individual, or a corporation that is legally bound to serve shareholder investment interests rather than public interests. Even as a retired IBM technologist and futurist with a historically optimistic view of the future, I worry about the potential negatives of the widening wealth gap and concentration of power as the pace of tech innovation accelerates exponentially and continually, and as capital adds more value than labor.

Several cars from BMW’s 2 to 7 series can now be purchased with CarPlay installed, in addition to the X SUVs and M sportscars. Even buyers of the $138,000 ALPINA B7 will need to decide to spend $300 to get access to Apple’s alternative infotainment system. Previous reports indicated that the X5 M and X6 M would be among the first vehicles to support CarPlay, and while the majority of BMW’s cars do now support CarPlay, a number still don’t offer the option, including the M5 Sedan, the 440i Coupe, and the electric i3 and i8 models. There is a chance those models will be updated at a later date as well. Apple is due to make significant upgrades to CarPlay with next month’s launch of iOS 10, including the ability to hide and rearrange icons, and have an iPhone push a parking marker to Apple Maps when it disconnects. BMW joins a long list of automakers that offer CarPlay, including Acura, Audi, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Citroën, DS Automobiles, Ferrari, Ford, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Lamborghini, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Porsche, Peugeot, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen, Volvo, and others. appleApple CarPlayCarPlay Previous post BMW M4 “Battleship Edition” Comes from Germany Next post BMW i8 Spyder runs hot on the Nurburgring RECOMMENDED FOR YOU BMW First Automaker To Introduce Wireless Apple CarPlay Integration The 2017 5 Series is the first car to hit roads to use Bluetooth for CarPlay, saving you from the trouble of plugging your phone in.

Sep 01, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Image via Complex Original Metro Boomin took to Twitter to let the fans know that his forthcoming project will be available on every music and streaming service. "Apple Music, tidal, Spotify, Pandora, whatever you use, my album will be instantly available and accessible for you. Because thats the point," he tweeted. "Fuck the money I do this for the culture." The whole thing started after Metro searched for Jay Z's "Song Cry" on iTunes, but couldn't find it. That's when he "remembered tidal vs apple," which spurned a series of tweets venting about the streaming war and current landscape of service exclusives. "Shouldn't have to have subscriptions to 2 different services just to listen to blueprint and views. Makes me miss how simple CDs were." Related Metro Boomin Joins ComplexCon Lineup Skrillex, Kid Cudi, and Travi$ Scott to Perform Night One of Our Inaugural ComplexCon (UPDATED) Lil Yachty to Perform at ComplexCon x Pigeons & Planes Stage His decision brings up the big issue of music exclusives that has been a hot topic in the music industry lately. Frank Ocean's visual album Endless and second new album Blonde were both released as Apple exclusives. Immediately following that release, the CEO of UMG instructed his company to stop making exclusive distribution deals with music services.  Meanwhile, Spotify executives have gone on record saying that exclusives are bad for business because they require users to pay for multiple streaming service subscriptions, which many do not, and that this practice leads to illegal downloads. The sentiment was shared by Kanye West who personally tried to end the Apple and Tidal beef because it's "fucking up the music game." "We all gon be dead in 100 years," West said. "Let the kids have the music." You can read all of Metro Boomin's tweets below and be sure to catch the producer at Complex's forthcoming ComplexCon that is stacked with a lineup featuring Skrillex, Kid Cudi, Travi$ Scott, Lil Yacthy.

On August 30, the Commission announced its finding that Ireland has granted undue tax benefits to Apple since 1991, and ordered the Irish government to recover unpaid tax from the company for a ten-year period beginning in 2003. It was a ruling that provoked an angry response from some members of Congress, who have already criticized the Commission for attempting to use EU state aid rules to collect tax retroactively from US firms. Describing the decision as "awful," House Speaker Paul Ryan (R - Wisconsin) said: "Slamming a company with a giant tax bill – years after the fact – sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic. It's also in direct violation of many European countries' treaty obligations." On the other side of the aisle, Senator Ron Wyden (D - Oregon), the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, called the Commission's ruling "extremely concerning" and agreed that it could undermine internationally accepted legal principles in the area of taxation. According to Wyden, "the European Commission has effectively stepped outside the terms of existing bilateral tax treaties to hand an American firm a massive, retroactive tax bill." "This ruling could set a dangerous precedent that undermines our tax treaties," he noted. Furthermore, Wyden warned that the ruling could disrupt multilateral efforts to change the global corporate tax system under the OECD's BEPS project. "Right now countries ought to be working in partnership to prevent tax evasion and crack down on the unfair practices that have eroded tax bases in the US and around the world, but [the] ruling could make that kind of partnership more difficult," he said. For his part, Kevin Brady (R - Texas), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, denounced the move as a "predatory and naked tax grab." However, he also observed that the case highlighted major flaws in the United States corporate tax system. "This is occurring because our uncompetitive tax code strands American profits overseas instead of allowing businesses to bring those profits home to reinvest in our jobs, research, and growth," Brady contended. "Instead of standing by and allowing other countries to deliver multibillion-dollar tax bills to American companies, Washington should act now to ensure this doesn't happen again," he said, urging Congress to approve long-awaited reform to the US corporate tax code.

Lew to discuss the upcoming G20 leaders’ summit. Secretary Lew discussed the top agenda items of the summit, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Apple’s tax battle with Ireland and the European Union, U.S. economic growth over the last eight years, policies that include emerging economies in global economic growth, combating cybercrime, fossil fuel subsidies, and carbon pricing. Secretary Lew was introduced by Kemal Derviş, vice president and director of the Global Economy and Development Program. Following his opening remarks, the Treasury secretary was joined by David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, in a discussion on what to expect from the G20 Summit later this week. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email The secretary said that, at the G20 Summit, President Obama will encourage inclusive and shared growth, investment in jobs, pro-growth policies, and new fiscal measures while discouraging structural reforms that are not paired with macro-economic policies and combating excessive production. Obama will also continue to emphasize American leadership on financial reform and fiscal policy. The president is also expected to focus heavily on environmental issues at the summit, including discussions on implementing the final stages of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and adopting the recommendations of the Green Finance Study Group. During his opening statement, Secretary Lew remarked on how the G20 contributed to impressive growth and economic improvement in the wake of the 2008 recession. Lew explained that comparing the state of the U.S. economy eight years ago to the current economic situation is similar to comparing “night and day.” He expressed that, while there is still room for improvement, the U.S. remains a “pillar of strength in the world economy” as a result of coordination among G20 countries. Watch: The secretary also discussed inclusive growth, one of President Obama’s top priorities for the G20 Summit. He explained how including emerging economies in growth can improve quality of life globally and commented on how increased globalization benefits the U.S. and global economies. Additionally, he highlighted the need for policymakers to discuss inclusive growth regularly, instead of solely in the context of trade agreements.

He emphasized that the president remains committed to TPP and will use “every ounce of energy” that he and his administration have to see the deal through before he leaves office. Watch: Secretary Lew expressed his concerns on the accusations that Apple evaded taxes in Ireland. He explained his desire to work with Congress to close tax loopholes and combat tax evasion. Secretary Lew also explained that companies should think about their reputations when making decisions on their tax policies. He stated that “a company doesn’t have to take an action just because it’s permitted” and that CEOs should think about the long-term effects of their tax policies before implementing them. When asked if he believed that the European Union was unfairly targeting U.S. firms, Secretary Lew answered that the EU seemed to be highly focused on U.S. firms. Additionally, he mentioned that this could be an attempt by the EU to draw profits from the U.S. tax base. Watch: Related Books Upcoming Russia’s Addiction By Clifford G. Gaddy and Barry W.

Gaming of cross-border tax rules has risen inexorably. Apple, with its abundance of intangible assets, which are easier to play around with, has been one of the cleverest at exploiting the gaps. A bill of €13 billion ($14.5 billion) plus interest, the amount that the European Commission says Ireland must recover from the firm for tax avoidance, would pay for all the country’s health-care budget this year and barely dent Apple’s $230 billion cash mountain. But in tilting at Apple the commission is creating uncertainty among businesses, undermining the sovereignty of Europe’s member states and breaking ranks with America, home to the tech giant, at a time when big economies are meant to be co-ordinating their anti-avoidance rules. Curbing tax gymnastics is a laudable aim. But the commission is setting about it in the most counterproductive way possible. It says Apple’s arrangements with Ireland, which resulted in low-single-digit tax rates, amounted to preferential treatment, thereby violating the EU’s state-aid rules. Making this case involved some creative thinking. The commission relied on an expansive interpretation of the “transfer-pricing” principle that governs the price at which a multinational’s units trade with each other. Having shifted the goalposts in this way, the commission then applied its new thinking to deals first struck 25 years ago. Back then, there was no reason for Apple to think it might one day fall foul of the state-aid rules. The firm shook hands with a sovereign government, which continues to defend the arrangement to this day. Even if the plan had been legally suspect at the time, it makes as much sense for subsequent penalties to fall on the country that offered it as on the company that took it. Either way, firms that invest in Europe will be entitled to wonder what other deals reached with governments can be unwound retroactively. Ireland itself is bridling at interference in affairs that are typically the province of EU member states. It is considering whether to appeal; Apple has said it will. Better together By using new arguments to fire broadsides at deals done long ago, the commission is not helping the fight against egregious tax-dodging. Ireland and other obliging European states, such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands, have already succumbed to pressure to close several of the loopholes of the past. Last year the OECD, a group of rich countries, led the way on a set of guidelines designed to crack down on avoidance. By going it alone the commission risks stoking conflict, not co-operation. American politicians quickly branded the judgment a naked tax raid; in a white paper released before the commission’s verdict, America’s Treasury hinted ominously at retaliation. Some see a bright side. Money paid by Apple and other American firms to European governments will not go into tax coffers back home; the realisation that European politicians might gain at their expense could, optimists say, at last spur American policymakers to reform their barmy tax code. American companies are driven to tax trickery by the combination of a high statutory tax rate (35%), a worldwide system of taxation, and provisions that allow firms to defer paying tax until profits are repatriated (resulting in more than $2 trillion of corporate cash being stashed abroad). Cutting the rate, taxing only profits made in America and ending deferral would encourage firms to bring money home—and greatly reduce the shenanigans that irk so many in Europe. Alas, it seems unlikely. The commission has lobbed a grenade; a tax war may result. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (115) Editors’ picks A peace prize, but no peaceAung San Suu Kyi fails to calm Myanmar’s ethnic violence Ending it will need far more courage Asia Northern lightsMexican attitudes to marijuana mellowAmericas Medieval memesThe far right’s new fascination with the Middle AgesDemocracy in America The Economist explainsCan markets be too free?The Economist explains Latest Updates Daily chartWhat counts as success for “Super Mario Run” Graphic detail Medieval memesThe far right’s new fascination with the Middle Ages Democracy in America The Economist explainsCan markets be too free?

But when it comes to a public response, the decision has given Apple a powerful ally: the United States government. As White House press secretary Josh Earnest pointed out, the ruling amounts to "a transfer of revenue from U.S. taxpayers to the EU," and that the Obama administration is "committed to fairness in fighting for the interests of U.S. taxpayers and U.S. businesses." While he refused to get into specifics about what actions the administration plans to take, Earnest also stated, "You’ll recall that when it comes to cases that have been decided by the WTO [World Trade Organization], the Obama administration’s record is undefeated. And that means that we have been tenacious advocates for American businesses and we’ve been effective advocates for American businesses." Apple CEO Tim Cook was more vociferous. In a Sept. 1 interview with RTE, Ireland's national TV and radio broadcaster, he flatly denied allegations of wrongdoing straight off the bat, stating, "There wasn't a special deal between Ireland and Apple. It didn't exist." Though his demeanor was calm, his defense of Apple decidedly belonged to the "no uncertain terms" category, as in his response to the Commission's finding that Apple's effective tax rate was .005% in 2014: "It's a false number. I have no idea where the number came from. It is not true." Cook also aligned himself and his company strongly with Ireland, praising Apple's Irish employees and the nation's people in general. He stressed that the ruling, which he characterized as "politically-based," would not affect Apple's commitment to Ireland. Although Ireland has yet to officially decide if it will appeal the ruling, Finance Minister Michael Noonan indicated it would. So is Cook effectively uniting Apple, the U.S. and Ireland against the EU? BBC business editor Simon Jack weighed in on Cook's interview, calling it "a skilful and very nuanced performance, but one which obscured a few key truths." A New York Times editorial went further, arguing that "Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation." Regardless of the facts behind the story, it's a good bet that Apple's stakeholders are pleased with the way Cook is handling the situation with cool aplomb. As Jack puts it, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has "picked a very wily political opponent."

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 01, 2016 12:18pm   Comments Share: Related SSNLF Fake Metrics To Fake Accounts: 2016's Big Corporate Scandals This Manager Of A $55 Billion Fund Is Dumping Equities In Favor Of Cash Samsung to soon reveal Note 7 probe results (Seeking Alpha) Samsung (SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000) (OTC: SSNLF) suffered a major setback on Thursday when its Korean-listed stock (KRX: 005935) (KRX: 005930) shed $7 billion of market value. According to Reuters, the company said it has decided to delay shipments of its high-end Galaxy Note 7 smartphone following reports of exploding batteries. Naturally, the timing of Samsung's announcement is troubling, as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Samsung's largest competitor within the high-end smartphone segment, is expected to introduce its latest iPhone next week. Related Link: Within 5 Years, A Majority Of Americans Will Own A Chinese Smartphone Samsung had hoped to maintain the strong momentum seen as of late, but a delay in shipments due to quality control testing all but guarantees Apple will gain at the very least a near-term edge. "This is some major buzz-kill for Samsung, especially given all of the hard-earned excitement that products like the Note 7 have [sic.] been garnering lately," Bloomberg quoted IDC analyst Bryan Ma as saying. "The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn't have been worse." Reuters also noted that Samsung did not detail specific issues with the battery, but several images and videos of burnt Galaxy Note 7 devices were spread across social media and news sites. For instance, Business Korea posted an image of a charred Galaxy Note 7, as the phone was already released to major Korean cell phone providers. New shipments have now been halted.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « HP Shakes things up in the Home Computer Space with a New Speaker-Tower Form Factor | Main | It's Official: Samsung Announces Worldwide Note 7 Recall » September 01, 2016 Apple Keeps Tweaking their Wraparound Display Patents   Someone at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office responsible for publishing each week's patents must be on holidays this week as they were posted more than 8 hours later than usual. Most were continuation patents – but one patent application of interest caught my eye. It's Apple's patent titled "Electronic Device with Wraparound display." With the rumors surrounding Apple's 2017 anniversary iPhone having a new form factor that is primarily made of glass with curved edges, there seems to be a lot of patent activity surrounding two of Apple's patents regarding a wraparound display.   Today, USPTO published Apple's continuation patent application 20160252933 covering the wrap around display form factor as noted below.     While Apple was just granted this patent back in June, the new continuation patent scrubbed most of their patent claims. Granted patent 9,367,095 carried 19 patent claims. The continuation patent published today simply presents a single patent claim as noted below:   Claim 1: "An electronic device, comprising: a housing comprising a transparent housing component having a curved interior surface formed of a single layer of transparent material; a flexible display assembly coupled to the curved interior surface of the transparent housing component, the flexible display assembly being arranged to present visual content through the transparent housing component, wherein the transparent housing component provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation of the flexible display assembly during use of the electronic device; and a processor configured to direct the flexible display assembly to present a first user interface through a first portion of the transparent housing component and a second user interface through a second portion of the transparent housing component that is oriented in a different direction than the first portion."   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "The Joke of the Week: Apple is going to Copy Samsung's Edge Smartphone Design," which illustrated Apple's three main patents covering curved edges and wraparound displays that Apple has been working on for years.   Apple's activity surrounding these patents appear to strongly suggest that they want to clarify all aspects of their intellectual property on this new kind of form factor whatever version it ends up looking like.   Keep in mind that the designs presented in Apple's patents are concepts and not necessarily the final design. This isn't a design patent confirming a set design. The patents are merely presenting design concepts supporting features described in the actual patent filings such as 'curved interior." Below is another form factor of interest to Apple.     Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

On early Thursday morning he let it be known that his fans would be able to stream his upcoming album on any streaming service. "Apple Music, tidal, Spotify, Pandora, whatever you use." It was all spurred by Metro searching for Jay Z's "Song Cry" on iTunes and not being able to locate it. Then he "remembered tidal vs apple." This brought on a string of tweets where he addressed this "streaming war shit" and how people shouldn't have to have two separate subscriptions to listen to Drake and Jay Z.

Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) Sep 1, 2016 at 11:16AM Image source: Getty Images. In the eyes of a dividend investor, the only thing that is better than a dividend payment that can be maintained for a long time is a dividend that can be raised. If we look across the investing landscape, there are companies where the possibility of a dividend raise is obvious, the result of a major corporate change, or maybe not the best thing a company can do with its cash. With that in mind, let's take a look at three companies that fill each of those situations.   The obvious candidate Was there a ever a better candidate of a company that has the financial strength to raise its dividend more than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does today? Yes, the company faces several headwinds, ranging from slowing iPhone 6 sales and a less-than-stellar response from the Apple Watch to the underlying feeling that some think the company's best days are behind it. Despite all of these issues, the fact of the matter is that the company continues to generate gobs of cash flow and sits on an unparalleled war chest. Even if we were to account for the recent EU-related tax charge that could ding the company for $14.5 billion, Apple still has $217 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments at its disposal. What's more, the company continues to generate enough cash to pad those coffers even more. Over the past 12 months, Apple's levered free cash flow was $43.2 billion. Granted, much of that cash hoard and a decent chunk of that cash-generating ability come from overseas and sit in accounts there to prevent costly repatriation taxes. The underlying idea here is that the company has plenty of cash on hand to use at it sees fit.  Even if the company were to experience a couple more hiccups with its operations, the company has more than enough wiggle room in its profitability to make up for it from a dividend standpoint. Some investors may be worried about some aspects of Apple's future -- based on its current valuation, there are a lot of them -- but one thing that likely isn't a worry is the company's ability to grow its dividend.  Unleashed capital One of the issues that has held General Electric (NYSE:GE) back from significant dividend raises in recent years has been the company's designation as a Systematically Important Financial Institution -- the too big to fail moniker. This meant that the company had billions of dollars in cash that was restricted from being deployed, as it was a guarantee on any bad debts the company may have been holding as part of GE Capital. At the end of the most recent quarter, the company had more than $42 billion in restricted cash on top of the $9 billion in unrestricted cash. Now that the company has significantly wound down GE Capital to a much smaller part of the business and has shed its designation as a too big to fail entity, it has greater ability to deploy that cash, either toward capital investment or toward shareholders, notably dividends.  It also helps that GE is a more focused company that has a couple of intriguing irons in the fire that could help sustain further dividend growth. One of those irons is its Predix software. Predix is an operating system that is specially designed to bring the Internet of Things to industrial applications. For customers, it means more efficient operations, thanks to constant monitoring of equipment. For GE, its a recurring revenue source from software licenses that it has never had before in its industrial manufacturing businesses. The combination of all that extra cash today and improving cash streams suggests that there will be plenty of room for GE to raise its dividends both now and in the future. Could, but maybe not the best move Sometimes, a company's financial statements suggest that it could raise its dividend, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is the best thing to do. One great example of this is oil services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). On paper, the company could completely justify increasing its dividend: It continues to generate free cash flow at a decent rate, its balance sheet is in decent shape, and the company has weathered the downturn in the oil and gas industry better than most.  If we start to look at the landscape of the oil and gas industry, though, it would seem that perhaps foregoing a big dividend raise and holding on to that cash for a while is a better move. This is the case because of the changing dynamics of the industry. The ability to access shale resources as a very commercially competitive source is likely going to mean less investment in the more expensive offshore reservoirs. This is important because Schlumberger is a larger player in offshore drilling than in shale and has even doubled down on its offshore business with the recent acquisition of subsea equipment maker Cameron International. Then there is the fact that there are still plenty of struggling companies that could be acquired for the right price. This could be an opportune time for Schlumberger to deploy that cash elsewhere -- and raise its dividend at a later date.

They’ve placed themselves well ahead of every other wearable fitness tracker company in terms of accessories – and they’ve given themselves another big boost this week with a variety of items that will make owners of the Misfit Ray and Mistfit Shine 2 joyous for having already joined in on the party. It’s time, once again, for Misfit to push themselves deeper into the Apple fold – the Apple Store, specifically, where they’ll have several more devices in Apple-friendly colors. They’ll match Apple products already sold by Apple, that is to say. Just this past July, Misfit showed off four new colors for the Misfit Ray as well as 30 new accessories to enliven the already-lovely-looking device. With these new colors and accessories, Misfit boasted a cool 150+ combinations of colors and materials. This week, Misfit has revealed four new Misfit Shine 2 colors as well as a variety of new accessories. Also included in this new batch is 14x new Sport Bands for the Shine 2 and 4x more Field Bands made from woven nylon and leather. “We’ve always been focused on providing our customer unique options for ￼personalizing her wearable, and now she has almost limitless options,” said Preston ￼Moxcey, General Manager of Misfit. “Between Shine 2 and Ray, there’s something for ￼every style.” Also shown this week was the new Halo Necklace for the Misfit Shine 2. This necklace comes in three different colors. With this addition of accessories to the full bunch, Misfit suggests there are now “over 80 new ways to wear Shine 2.” These newest Shine 2 accessories will be priced and released “this Fall” according to Misfit. Misfit also announced that Misfit Ray (as shown at the head of this article) will be made available at Apple Stores this Fall, and there will be offered in “exclusive Apple-coordinated colors.” As shown above, these activity trackers will include Space Grey, Rose Gold, and a third unnamed color.

It will come running on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. What is iOS 10? Every year, Apple claims its iOS update is the biggest and best yet. With iOS 10, however, that claim actually rings true. This year's tweaks to the iOS formula breathe new life into Apple’s own apps and make things ever so slightly more open. But the headline features aren’t the real success here; it’s the smaller changes and shortcuts that although not obvious, are satisfying and genuinely useful. iOS 10 – iMessage The headline-grabbing feature of iOS 10 is the updated iMessage app. Text messaging is pretty much dead, replaced by services such as iMessage, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Although Apple’s service has been steadily gaining ground, it’s always been a tad feature light compared to its rivals. This changes in iOS 10. Actually, Apple has crammed so many features into its new chat app that it feels like it’s throwing everything at the ceiling in an effort to see what sticks. Related: iPhone 7 Deals and Contracts On the surface, the app looks very similar. Blue and white are the colours of choice, with contact photos sitting beside the message. Open up a thread, though, and the changes become apparent. Alongside the text-input screen are a couple of new options: a camera icon, a heart and an App Store symbol. The latter is probably the most intriguing, and the one with the most scope for the future. It’s an App Store for iMessage, which lets you download "extras". It’s great, if novel. The GIF searcher is endless fun, while the Apple Music add-on lets you quickly send someone a snippet of a song. Obviously, time will see the range increase, and hopefully developers will find some clever ways to make use of it. Citymapper has already updated its app, as has IMDb. WATCH: iOS 10 tips and tricks The next icon across, which resembles a heart, is a little less interesting. It’s plucked straight from the Apple Watch, and feels out of place. You can send your "heartbeat" (which isn’t actually your heartbeat, since there’s no HRM in the iPhone) or draw out little images. They render back in real-time when opened by the receiver, which is cool – but I can’t imagine using it constantly. You can annotate images too, which is certainly more useful. So there are plenty of neat features to the iMessage update, but there's also quite a lot that feels like MSN Messenger circa 2002. Someone’s birthday? You can send a screen-overtaking animation that blows confetti everywhere. You can also send a message that slams into the conversation and shakes the pages, or one that appears in invisible ink. I'm sure there will be folk who have an appreciation for such items, but I can't say that they've stuck in my mind. On the whole, the updated iMessage is great. It’s busy, yes, but given time, hopefully Apple will see fit to streamline it to include only the features that work. It’s a step in the right direction, though. Related: iPhone 7 camera in-depth iOS 10 – 3D Touch finally makes sense 3D Touch was introduced to much hype with the iPhone 6S. It demoed well, but in day-to-day use it was limited. I tended to forget it was there, or it didn’t offer anything to make me use it. This changes with iOS 10, where 3D Touch finally makes sense. There are now 3D Touch actions dotted everywhere. The most useful is hard-pressing the "X" icon in the notifications tray to clear all. You can also 3D Touch the shortcuts in the updated Control Center to quickly alter the brightness of the torch, change the timer length and so on. The only real issue with these improvements is that they’re not obvious. If you’re not told about them, you probably won’t notice they're there. Widgets have seen a 3D Touch boost too. For example, in iOS 9 a hard press on the News icon would have merely thrown up text-based shortcuts; in iOS 10 it actually shows the latest news. I can check the morning news, and weather, without going into the app. This way of using widgets is, in my opinion, much cleaner than it is on Android. Best Deals for Apple iPhone 7 Compare plans iOS 10 – New lockscreen, Control Center and improved notifications Three aspects of iOS that I’d say needed the most work were the lockscreen, Control Center and notifications. And as if the developers at Apple had looked deep into my mind, each has received an update. However, the big question is whether the changes made are for the better? For the most part, yes. This is a huge step-forward, one that manages to improve the overall user experience no end. I’ll start with the new lockscreen, which is more a visual update than a functional one. The iconic "Slide to Unlock" option is no more; now you have to physically press the home button to unlock the phone. This is a result of many people, myself included, feeling that the Touch ID sensor was so fast that you blazed past your notifications whenever you opened the phone. It now takes a little longer to get into the phone, but it works a lot better. Apple has added "Raise to Wake", which is easily one of the most user-friendly of iOS's new features. The screen will burst into life whenever you pick up the phone. The swipe-up gesture to quickly open the camera is gone. Now you swipe to the right; swiping to the left takes you to a new screen entirely. This is where all your "widgets" – useful tidbits of information pulled directly from apps – are located. Widgets aren't new for iOS, but the implementation is certainly better here. This can be attributed to the improved quality of the widgets themselves. Apple has updated all of them, from Activity that shows your daily targets, to the weather slide that displays the conditions over the coming week. Older third-party widgets now look a little weird, with a strange discoloured border. Hopefully, developers will update these too. The spruced up Control Center is probably the biggest step forward in terms of design, especially considering it was fairly useless before. Access is still via a swipe up from the bottom of the screen, but it’s now split into three distinct panes. The first is familiar, with shortcuts and toggles, but it’s cleaner than before. This is because the music playback options have been moved to their own panel – a wise decision. There’s also a panel that ties into the new Home smart home controller app, which lets you quickly tune your connected tech without opening the app. I’d still like to be able to add my own toggles, and the lack of a quick option to jump into Settings is bizarre, but the spread-out approach makes the Control Center much more functional. Best Deals for Apple iPhone 7 Compare plans Finally, there’s notifications. I have to switch between iOS and Android fairly frequently, and the biggest win for Google’s OS in my eyes is it’s far superior notifications system. Apple’s interpretation has always felt cluttered and aimed far more at the casual consumer rather than someone who has to deal with a constant stream of emails, messages and general alerts. Related: Apple Watch 2: What you need to know Even in iOS 10, Apple doesn't get close to Google's implementation of notifications. Nevertheless, the improvements are welcome. 3D-Touching a message pops out a quick-reply box complete with the rest of the conversation, so you can knock out a reply from the lockscreen, while the "Clear All" option is a godsend to those who have a messy inbox.

At least not enough to want to jump on the iOS 10 bandwagon. It's nice that Apple FINALLY is allowing us to delete their useless apps. Left swipe for quick access to camera is moot. What's the difference between that and the current swipe up frOm the corner? The keyboard? That interests me. Is it more intuitive now. So when I hit "o", it won't be an "i" that comes up? Or "n" instead of a space? That I don't have slow my typing so that ios can catch up? Lol The rest is useless to me. The one thing I was really hoping for, when it comes to the 3D touch, was to make a quick access to camera settings (framerates and resolution) right from the Camera app itself. Instead of having to keep switching back and fourth from camera app to system preferences. You'd think Apple would have thought of this really simple, yet very useful feature. Considering the iPhone 7 is built around the camera. I miss Jobs. Not a lot of innovation from Apple. Not nearly as much when Jobs was at the captain's chair. Time for Apple to stop giving us what they want to give us. And start listening to its users. Plenty of great ideas thrown around over the years, but very few make it to fruition. Opening up being snatched up by the competition. If they can't be innovative, they should at least stop with the useless glitz and glam. And work in improving what's already there that has been useful. Or could be very useful. This iOS 10 is not the special I was hoping for. Oh, and they just REFUSE to STOP pushing updates to my phone! If and when I want to update, I WILL UPDATE. I don't want crap I don't want or need on my phone without my permission. And fix the random reboots already. Radosław Górny September 14, 2016, 9:30 am Notifications in iOS 10 look fugly. Who is their designer? :D Ruthless007 September 15, 2016, 10:14 am Moan, moan, moan.... Sounds like you should shift to Android! It's interesting how you "miss Jobs", considering how much hassle he received when he was at the helm of the company, launching a phone that you had to hold a certain way, launching a tablet that was just a larger iPhone, releasing iOS 6 that was almost identical to iOS5, etc. etc. Amnesia springs to mind. lish bergeron September 15, 2016, 4:01 pm I HATE this update! The worst ever!!!!! For the first time I am disappointed with update. It is COMPLICATE, annoying, hate the close sound (why did they change???!). I hope Apple is not going to become complicate like android... Please, Keep simple!!! Stefan Fischer September 15, 2016, 10:09 pm this is not a good update at all 1. apple removed start rating for music for people like me who have their whole library sorted by star rating this is bad. 2. New music app feels like designers stopped somewhere mid design and just left it unpolished and not thought trough. 3. side swipe to unlock gone, vital for anyone who has often dirty hands 👎👎👎👎 Harsha Sai September 15, 2016, 11:01 pm Well, the concept of owning music and albums rather than renting them, and putting it all on the internet was Jobs' idea. So was the insanely popular iPod, and then the precursor of all smartphones, the iPhone. And all tablets are bigger phones genius, and the iPad is the most popular.

Jeremy Semanhyia September 16, 2016, 6:02 pm They've removed the feature for suggesting the music app when headphones are plugged in. Second, I DON'T LIKE the new music app. It's horrible Dj GJ September 19, 2016, 5:30 pm There is a locked lock screen and unlocked lock screen ?!?...WTF ? Who comes up with this suff, the swipe right to unlock is gone, bad....the left swipe is camera....bad, camera non removable from lock screen (unless you remove it from normal screen too)...it's like in supermarkets, you go there and get used to items on certain shelves....then they move them to others so you left wandering around looking for stuff like an idiot...I don't like ios 10 at all... Samia September 28, 2016, 5:45 pm I like overall changes but what I found annoying is unlocking the screen by pressing Home Button. I tried to disable that but It didnt work. Changes are not much as compared to prev iOS version, I think i should have stayed with my prev version of iOS not the latest one. leart September 30, 2016, 2:56 pm there is a way to increase the size of interactive text, like email, notes and even of the main menu, since iOS 6 (2012) Lol I guess you just have to chose your right text size leart September 30, 2016, 2:59 pm if you hurry you can downgrade .. go to ipsw dot me, chose your device and download the ipsw for your device, open iTunes shift + restore to the downloaded ipsw and you'll be back to iOS 9, but you will end with a new device configuration .. the iOS 10 backup will not work on iOS 9.3.5.. good luck leart September 30, 2016, 3:04 pm yeah.. I'm a designer obsessed with Apple mainly for their high class design.. but their new music app is the most ugly interface they pushed.. don't know, maybe they are just confusing the concurrence since android community is out there copying anything Apple lol and they will fix it later :P Randommexi October 1, 2016, 3:55 pm i hate apple now. i'm getting a new phone. this "upgrade" was a giant step backwards. thanks.... Brooklyn Boone October 3, 2016, 3:51 am I like The update overall. But I extremely dislike that I have to press the home button for my phone to unlock. And I think that Apple should have left the control center the way it was, instead of me sliding to the right to access my music. Also Apple should add patterns to the selection of security on the phone. Thomas ward October 3, 2016, 10:51 pm I can't get my I tunes music to show I upgraded my iPod touch now I only have music that I down loaded I pay every month for Apple Music now it just says loading jonesy555 October 6, 2016, 12:12 pm Feels like an update for the sake of it: - Mail app is baffling. Worked perfectly before, now can't work out what is what. Conversations jumbled and hard to read what order the messages are in and which you've read. Truly terrible, - Lock screen or is it unlocked...why bother with that?? I know you can change it but that still doesn't make it much better. - In call, goes to a sort of lock screen but you have to tap the number to get the controls back. Again why? If you get mails/messages/notifications in call, these aren't displayed, phone just lights up or vibrates. Jorge Medrano October 7, 2016, 1:16 am This update feels like those Android versions that have been heavily modified by the manufacturer. The worst is the lock screen: confusing, slow and cluttered. It took me forever today to deactivate an alarm. I guess IxD folks at Apple are fully functional the milisecond after they hear their alarm clock. For me, it is the first Apple update that feels mediocre. Alex Edwards October 7, 2016, 5:35 pm Personally, i'm unhappy with some of the things apple did. Yes, the made some good back end moves but they've changed things that did not need to be changed. The Contact Info bar is obnoxiously big. taking up screen area needlessly. Dedicating a part of the lock screen to widgets was a completely stupid move to me. I always turned off the entire "today" feature because a lock screen was meant to keep people out of a phone, not give tid bits and reminders of your day and news. Slide to unlock...this was a key feature for me for security, and it got dumped for a dedicated "today" widget screen I disabled anyway? What was wrong with pulling down for this screen? The control center was great in 9.3.5. Consolidated, not huge but not so tiny it couldn't be used. And it was all one pane. Dedicated panes have made it more complex than it needs to be. It feels like Apple's trying to force more use of Touch ID, something I don't like using to unlock a phone. I'm more content to stick with the PIN. There's good like the added iMessage stuff. Though I don't use most of the stuff like gifs and enhanced Emoji much, I can see why this was added. I like the bed time feature in the clock app. I like the Siri dev options opened up and the deeper 3D integration. This does open a new world for Apps. but the short comings to me outweigh the improvements. I'm not going to Upgrade my 6S, i made the mistake on my 5C and regret it. I wont go to iPHone 7 either. I'm content as it stands now to run my 6S until the Wheels fall off. Michael October 16, 2016, 3:46 am m***** f***** piece of s*** ios 10 BS nothing works okay anymore all is going crazy. Can't use my data after I leave the house, must restart the phone all the time for nothing, if I receive a youtube from my friends cant watch it on full screen just on one". It's f up :( October 17, 2016, 3:22 pm This update is honestly ruining my life. My alarm only works 33% of the time, the messaging is slow. I feel like my life is falling apart and i'm blaming this update. Stotri Thavanesh Huthesh November 14, 2016, 4:53 am People in many countries use bikes and scooters. Maps do not show narrower lanes that a two wheeler can use to reach a destination. Google maps at one time allowed you to plot a bicycle trip. It worked in a silly way. If there was no dedicated cycle path it did not show that choice. WTF? Now that is also gone and the walking path isn't always suitable for 2 wheelers. Dumb @$$e$ made the swipe up interface colossally foolish. Who gave them the idea of swiping the first layer left to get the music player? Clowns. Alarms sometimes slide down. There is no snooze or stop button in that. WTF are you supposed to do with that sliding alarm thing? We miss Steve Jobs.

In an effort to combat the rash of Apple Music exclusives which have been cropping up of late, Spotify has allegedly been manipulating search results so that artists who provided with Apple with such exclusives don't appear in top rankings, as well as keeping them off its curated playlists.   ____________________________ Guest Post by Bobby Owsinski on Music 3.0 Talk about a sore loser, it looks like Spotify is punishing artists who do exclusives with Apple Music. According to an article in Bloomberg, the service is manipulating search results so that those who provided Apple Music with an exclusive on a new release don’t appear in the top ranks of searches after their music becomes available when the exclusive is over. Spotify has also warned artists who provide Apple Music with an exclusive that they will no longer be included on its playlists. Spotify playlists have become a very important promotional tool, so any exclusion could hurt a song or album’s popularity on the platform. A Spotify spokesperson has denied the allegations, which appear from have come from inside the company. The fact of the matter is that Apple Music is using these exclusives in order to catch up with its rival. Spotify now claims to have 39 million paid subscribers while Apple Music sits at 15 million, so the company is using the artist exclusives to help close the gap. Whether that’s actually working or not is yet to be seen, since we’ve not seen subscriber numbers from Apple for a while, at least before the exclusive wars got into full swing. Of course, it’s easier for Apple to get artists to provide an exclusive on a new release because of the company’s deep pockets for an advance, and widespread television and social advertising and promotion, something that Spotify or most other streaming companies can’t easily match. Will it be worth it? Many in the industry actually feel that exclusives hurt everyone involved since the consumer isn’t able to get the music when she wants it on the platform she wants to use while the album is hot. My guess is that we’ll see exclusives die down in 2017 after Apple reaches subscriber parity with Spotify, or something close to it. Until then, Spotify will probably continue punishing artists who bow to Apple’s advances.

The first vehicles to get 4th Gen Uconnect are “properly-equipped” Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger, and a particular Jeep-branded model. In the video at the end of the article, Uconnect marketing manager Mike Novak is glad to demonstrate what makes the latest version of Uconnect better than the last one. If, however, you rather not press play, then I’m much obliged to tell you what’s new or improved for the model year 2017. 4th Gen Uconnect in 8.4-inch form promises performance improvements, more processing power, higher resolution, and sharper graphics. What’s more, users can now enjoy gestures such as pinch, tap, and swipe. Apple CarPlay for the Uconnect 8.4 infotainment system allows users to access to Music, Maps, Messages, and other functions through Siri, the personal assistant built into your iPhone, or via the touchscreen. As for Android Auto, the fourth-gen Uconnect system enables access to Play Music, Google Maps, as well as Google voice search via the touchscreen display or the steering wheel-mounted controls. What’s wrong with this picture? Yup, FCA had omitted to say whether Apple CarPlay can be controlled via the buttons on the steering wheel or not. Hopefully, a simple software update will fix this snag in the near future. These said, the 4th Gen Uconnect system is a little richer when it comes down to a particular Jeep model. According to the manufacturer, the 2017 Grand Cherokee’s Uconnect 8.4 includes Off-Road Pages. This add-on keeps the driver informed on off-the-beaten-track variables such as the steering angle, transfer case position, rear diff lock, wheel articulation, air suspension mode and vehicle height, coolant and oil temperature, oil pressure, the lot. You know, the whole nine yards.

QuickTime for Windows after Apple abruptly pulled support for the software amid the discovery of two zero-day vulnerabilities. Apple later announced that QuickTime for Windows had been moved to end of life. Why didn't Apple patch the vulnerabilities, or at least communicate its plans to end QuickTime support ahead of time? Is this a common practice for major vendors like Apple? It wasn't too much of a surprise when Apple announced the end of life for QuickTime for Windows, but it could have been handled better to give users more time to respond to the move. QuickTime, a multimedia solution mainly used to play video and audio, was first released for Mac OS in 1991 with a version for Windows made available later. After Microsoft added support for key media formats, like H.264 and AAC, to Windows in 2009, users had less need to use QuickTime to play modern media formats. QuickTime's popularity continued to wane as web browsers moved to support video without the need for browser plug-ins and websites moved to the HTML5 web standard for video playback. The first signs of QuickTime's demise came in 2011, when OS X Lion moved to the AV Foundation graphics framework, and in 2013, when Apple deprecated all developer APIs for QuickTime on Windows. The end came out of the blue, however. In April 2016, Trend Micro announced that Apple had ceased all security patching of QuickTime for Windows. It reached this conclusion after its TippingPoint threat defense unit released two zero-day advisories, ZDI-16-241 and ZDI-16-242, which can be used to remotely compromise Windows computers. The advisories were issued in accordance with the Zero Day Initiative's Disclosure Policy for when a vendor does not provide a security patch for a disclosed vulnerability. On that same day, US-CERT issued alert TA16-105A, advising users to uninstall QuickTime for Windows as the only sure way to protect against current and future vulnerabilities in the product. Apple announced a week later that it would no longer support QuickTime 7 for Windows. Even though Apple may have known its appetite for supporting QuickTime for Windows was waning, it's still no excuse for not forewarning users of such an important decision. Once vendor support for a product stops, the prudent response is to stop using it, uninstall it and find an alternative. For many organizations, there is no option other than to uninstall it, as running unsupported software is an unnecessary risk as the software will forever be vulnerable to exploitation henceforth, and is often prohibited under compliance standards. Apple doesn't have a published policy and doesn't publish official dates for retiring products. Based on past practices, security updates are released for the current version of OS X and the two previous ones, giving three years support from first release to end of life -- a new version of OS X is released each year. The status of support for individual products can be less obvious, as shown by the sudden end of life for QuickTime for Windows -- it's understood QuickTime for Mac will continue to receive updates. Enterprises need a reasonable amount of time to be able to plan migrating from one major software version to another; for example, Microsoft estimates that a full server migration from Windows 2003 to Windows Server 2012 R2 can take up to 200 days. To give administrators time to prepare for upgrades, software vendors should provide advance warnings, roadmaps or end of life guidelines for their products, and some do. Microsoft has a lifecycle support policy providing detailed guidelines for support availability throughout each product's life, as does Adobe. Oracle provides roadmaps for its main products, such as the Java SE Support Roadmap. This type of information makes planning for upgrades and product migration a lot less prone to sudden shocks. However, the industry needs to do more to warn users about the dangers of running unsupported software and encourage people to upgrade from legacy software. Despite repeated warnings about the approaching end of life for Windows XP, many users and businesses are still running it. Apple's instructions for uninstalling QuickTime can be found here. Uninstalling QuickTime also removes the legacy QuickTime web plug-in, which users should no longer need.
