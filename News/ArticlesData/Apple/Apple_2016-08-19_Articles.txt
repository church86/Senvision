Industry > Industry monitor > Telecom More reports on: Apple, Google Apple, Google join hands to strike at Robocallers news 20 August 2016 More than 30 tech leaders including Google parent Alphabet, Apple and telecom service providers have joined hands to crack down on automated phone calls, Reuters reported. The "Robocall Strike Force," a group led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), held its first hearing on the subject in Washington DC on Friday. Both prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers and automated text messages. The FCC has roped in companies like Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, AT&T, and Verizon in an effort to end the nuisance of unsolicited calls playing prerecorded messages from advertisers including big corporations. "We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls," said FCC commissioner Mignon L Clyburn. "We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the 'Do Not Call' list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action." The strike force is expected to submit its report to the FCC by 19th October with "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who is the chairman of the coalition. These solutions could take the form of Caller ID verification standards capable of blocking spoofed phone numbers, as also a list of numbers from government agencies and banks that telemarketers would not be able to spoof. The strike force would report to the FCC by 19 Ocotober on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," SReuters reported. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said yesterday calling robocalls the No 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction."  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2016 The Information Company Private Limited.

The information used to confirm the iPhone 7 release dates come from leaked store planning information 9 to 5 Mac obtained from sources connected to AT&T. “Specifically, the guidance calls out September 9 and September 23 as dates for merchandising resets. This could suggest that advertising for pre-orders could be planned for September 9 as expected and new iPhone models could hit the floor on September 23, a week later than previously expected.” The Apple blog also reported that an official announcement regarding the new iPhone 7 release is expected a few days before pre-orders, coming on September 7 at an event hosted by Apple. The iPhone 7 release is expected to be September 23, with a pre-order date of September 9, reports say. [Photo by Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images]With the iPhone 7 release all but confirmed for next month, many Apple fans are curious to know what will be in the latest iteration of the iPhone product line. Forbes reported on the iPhone 7 release date and said the biggest change will be the lack of a headphone jack. “That said I would argue it is crucial Apple ‘sells’ the loss of the headphone jack as a gain overall by arguing it allows the iPhone 7 to take new, appealing steps forward,” Forbes‘ Gordon Kelly said. “These include higher quality sound through the Lightning port, more space for a bigger battery, waterproofing and yes, stereo speakers and (in absence of a design overhaul) the compensation of an upgraded home button and internals.” While there has been talk of no headphone jack on the latest iPhone model, there has also been talk of a top-of-the-line iPhone model coming to market upon the iPhone 7 release next month. But according to a different report by Kelly, there appears to be no iPhone 7 Pro in the pipeline. Sourcing reports out of Japan, the Forbes writer said the iPhone 7 release will just focus on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, its larger sibling. The iPhone 7 release comes just less than a year before an expected release of the iPhone 8. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]He went on to explain that the biggest problem with designing a higher-end iPhone 7 Pro was the fact that quantities could have been limited for the high-end model with most production focusing on both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. “This would have seen the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus share the same single lens camera while the iPhone 7 Pro sat above them in limited quantities with the upgraded optics. “Now Apple believes manufacturing constraints around the dual lens camera have been resolved so it can be fitted into every iPhone 7 Plus and there is no need to expand the range. Such a scenario would also explain why we have repeatedly seen photos of three iPhone 7 models.” With the lack of a third high-end device upon the iPhone 7 release next month, it remains to be seen how many Apple enthusiasts will invest in the new iPhone 7 models or hold out for the iPhone 8 expected to be released in the United States sometime in Spring or Summer 2017. As for the iPhone 7 release in September, with AT&T and other stores prepping their stores to stock the unit, it appears Apple is moving forward with plans to roll out a mid-level iPhone that will neither thrill the masses nor make major advances in the smartphone market. What it will do is move the company forward with its eventual rollout of the iPhone 8 and the excitement expected upon the release of a new smartphone 10 years after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and his team shook up the mobile phone world, bringing the world to your fingertips and forever changing the world of computing, dialing, and so much more.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady The real reason Apple dumbed-down the iPhone 7 camera Posted by: Jason O'Grady Date: Thursday, August 18th, 2016, 08:00 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Opinion Tweet I agree 100 percent with Chris Smith’s post on BGR about how the iPhone 7 is about to become inferior to the larger iPhone 7 Plus in a very significant way. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-camera vs the single camera in the 7. (Photo: BGR.com) I greatly prefer the 4.7-inch form factor iPhone and won’t buy the larger “Plus size” iPhone because it’s too bulky and it can’t be used with one hand. Plus, my iPad Pro and MacBook usually aren’t far away for when I need a larger screen. In his article Smith lists several possible excuses Apple might trot out for omitting the dual-lens camera from the iPhone 7, but the real reason is after the jump. Here’s Smith’s excuse list: It’s too bulky If Apple removes the headphone jack, shouldn’t this have created some additional room inside the device? It will impact battery life Apple could add a setting to turn off one of the cameras to save battery (which almost no one would use). Supply concerns Bullocks. Apple could use its significant influence to get the camera parts from suppliers, and if not, I have concerns about Cook’s reputation as “operational genius” and “master of the supply chain.” It’s more expensive Most likely true, but how much more expensive? The rear camera module in the iPhone 6s is estimate to cost $22.50. Does the dual-camera module cost 10, 50, 100 percent more? Apple could either, a) eat the increase, or b) increase the cost. Altough I think that Apple should eat the extra cost, I’d definitely pay as much as $50 more for the better camera). This is where Smith nails it: …Apple likes its high iPhone prices and its high iPhone margins. Apple isn’t willing to absorb the additional cost of the better, dual-camera module in order to keep the base $549 price of the 4.7-inch iPhone. And by extension it is willing to punish its iPhone 7 customers with an inferior camera to protect its margins. iPhone sales dropped 16 percent last quarter and the 4.7-inch iPhone outsells the 5.5-inch iPhone (by as much as by seven to one). What better way to jump start slumping revenue and profit? Nudge millions of (reluctant) iPhone 7 customers to buy the pricier iPhone 7 Plus for its better camera. Bummer. Update 2016-0808: If you share my concern about your next iPhone including a dumbed-down rear camera, take solace, it’ll probably include Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).

Home / News / Apple analyst claims BMW/Apple Joint-Venture… Apple analyst claims BMW/Apple Joint-Venture Apple Car News | August 20th, 2016 by Nico DeMattia 2 Tweet According to Apple analyst Gene Munster, the Silicon Valley-based giant will partner with BMW to develop its much rumored Apple Car. It’s been long rumored … According to Apple analyst Gene Munster, the Silicon Valley-based giant will partner with BMW to develop its much rumored Apple Car. It’s been long rumored that, if Apple even ends up developing a car, it would joint forces with an existing automaker to help manufacture it. However, this has largely been conjecture, it seems that Munster, an analyst for Piper Jaffray investment company, believes Apple will end up partnering with BMW. Admittedly, this isn’t the first the Apple/BMW rumor we’ve heard, as its been long rumored that the two companies could work together. However, there’s been no evidence to back up any of these claims. In fact, BMW squashed claims of such a venture between it and Apple to build a car. Also, Munster doesn’t have the best track record of predicting products for Apple. But he is adamant about the Apple/BMW venture for a future car. The thinking here, along with the thinking of other Apple/BMW rumors, is that Apple will develop the software and technology behind the Apple Car, while BMW would handle the manufacturing of it. Munster isn’t the only person to believe Apple will search for an outside manufacturer, as it has no previous experience with such a business. In fact, even the long time automotive executive, Bob Lutz, felt that would be the best direction for Apple. The venture between Apple and BMW also makes some sort of sense, as BMW is already heavily invested in electric and autonomous car technology. So having Apple help with the software side of things could be quite beneficial for both Apple and the Bavarian brand. We must remember, though, that there is no real merit to any of these claims, as it’s all speculation. The ideas are sound and make sense, but there’s no evidence to prove such a venture between the two giants. It is an interesting thought, though, and could be very helpful for both brands.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 20, 2016 at 3:41PM If you're looking for new investment ideas, look no further. Why not follow famed investor Warren Buffett into some stocks? After all, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock has more than doubled the S&P 500's annualized return since 1965. And Buffett and his two lieutenants haven't lost their touch. The stock has nearly doubled the S&P 500's return in the last 10 years, and its 114% return in the past five years is well ahead of the S&P 500's 91% gain during this same period. Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. Looking to Buffett's Berkshire for some ideas, here are two stocks that the Oracle of Omaha's company has positions in that are looking tasty this month. Apple... again I already praised Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a buying opportunity in July, but this bargain stock is worth taking a look at again. Why not? Apparently, Berkshire is pretty bullish on the company. It was revealed earlier this month that Berkshire upped its stake in Apple by 55% during Q2, bringing the total value of its Apple stock to about $1.7 billion at the time of this writing. With a position this large, Berkshire's Apple position is now worth more than its $1.6 billion position in General Motors. Given Berkshire's tendency to avoid technology stocks, Buffett or his investing lieutenants must be confident the stock is undervalued in order to build a position worth nearly $2 billion in such a short period of time. Of course, it doesn't take a genius to realize Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of under 13 does look a bit like a buying opportunity; it's not very often market leaders trade with valuations this conservative. Coca-Cola Another Berkshire holding worth looking at this month is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Sure, Berkshire didn't add to its position in the beverage company in Q2. But Berkshire doesn't need to add to this position to express its confidence in this investment. The company owns $17.6 billion worth of Coca-Cola, making it Berkshire's third-largest holding after Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 25, the stock certainly doesn't look as cheap as Apple. But when it comes to a sustainable business, Coca-Cola is one of the best examples there is. So investors shouldn't expect Coca-Cola to trade at a cheap-looking valuation any time soon. Combining its powerful beverage brands with the company's unparalleled global distribution, Coca-Cola boasts both pricing power and economies of scale -- a formidable combination, making up a strong competitive advantage. As Buffett says, "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." Coca-Cola is one of these castles. Thanks to Coca-Cola's consistent ability to drive decades of healthy profits for shareholders, it has a nice dividend, too. Investors who buy today get a dividend yield of 3.2% (this easily beats Apple's dividend yield of 2.1%) and the comfort of knowing future increases are likely: Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 53 years straight. Apple and Coca-Cola are both great long-term, low-risk investments for investors -- typical characteristics of Buffett investments. If not worth buying, they're at least worthy of a spot on your watch list. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

August 20, 2016 Cristina Lee Contrarian investor and Dohmen Capital Research Group founder Bert Dohmen appeared on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” to discuss whether or not it’s a good idea to invest in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to which, Dohmen bluntly said, “You’d have to be ‘deaf, dumb and blind” to buy the name. Although Apple has been performing poorly in the past 52 weeks, the Cupertino tech giant is steadily rebounding, gaining 3.92% year-to-date vs. the S&P 500’s 6.5% gain for the same period. Last month, Apple shares jumped to more than 10%. Ticker has advanced nearly 18% in the past three months. Despite the rebound after its last earnings report, the investor said he wouldn’t touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole, adding, “The deterioration is accelerating.” Since 2014, the tech firm’s revenue has been disappointing every quarter, “worse than the one before” Dohmen added. Last Monday, Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it increases its stake in the tech giant by 55% and now owns a little more than 15 million shares. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster appeared alongside Dohmen on the show. He said that although he remains bullish on Apple’s prospects, the near term of the iPhone cycle is likely to boost shares. Munster also placed a $151 price target on the stock. He predicts that Apple’s revenue will be up 10% next year as users upgrade to the new iPhone. “They’ve had a difficult period. I think it has nothing to do with their core strength of coming out with great devices, and I think they’re going to continue on that path for the next five years,” Munster told “Closing Bell.” “That gives some optimism for investors that this isn’t just a one-year trade. There’s some groundwork that could help it get into big growth markets in the future.” Dohmen noted that iPhone sales have been down 15% in the last quarter and the profits are also down by 27%. He added that despite entering the Chinese market – a supposed big money maker – Apple sales were down 33%. Although investors are focused on Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone and the potential for a supercycle in 2017, Munster believes that the rumored entry to augmented reality and automotive sometime in 2018 will do wonders for the tech giant’s performance on the market. “That would be constructive if we bought stocks based on things that happened in the past, but I think investors tend to look at what goes on in the future,” he explained. But Dohmen thinks otherwise. He said Apple hasn’t been betting big on innovation for some time and this is one of the reasons for the company’s plummeting stock price. Instead, the firm has been investing its own money and borrowed money into “paying dividends and buying back its stock.” “This is not innovation. It’s financial engineering,” he said. AAPL closed Tuesday’s regular trading at $109.39, down $0.09, or 0.08 percent. However, in pre-market hours, the shares gained $0.26, or 0.24 percent.

Last we heard from him was when he called for an S-upgrade to the Apple Watch in February 2016 (he may have gotten that one right; the timing, not so much). He’s back now with some interesting thoughts (via AppleWorldToday) on Apple’s rumored electric vehicle and assumed virtual reality headset hardware. More advanced CarPlay Commenting on The Information’s recent report on Project Titan’s tentative 2019-2020 launch target internally postponed until 2021 amid technical issues and leadership problems, he said he believed we’d see some results out of the project before 2021. We think Apple could unveil some of its learnings before 2021 as it continues to develop its own car. For example, autonomous driving software could come out earlier via an automotive partner or more advanced CarPlay features. According to Bloomberg, Project Titan has shifted gear and is now about autonomous driving systems rather than actual vehicles. “The initiative is now prioritizing the development of an autonomous driving system, though it’s not abandoning efforts to design its own vehicle,” sources told the news organization. The analyst went on to explain why Apple’s potential market opportunity in the automobile space could be “a true needle mover”: In terms of the market, BMW might be the best comp for what Apple could do with the car in a wildly successful long-term scenario. For context, BMW sold 1.9 million vehicles last year at an average selling price of $75,000, which works out to approximately $142.5 billion in average revenue. Project Titan “a gigantic money pit” While we’re at BMW, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported in April 2015 that Apple and BMW had been running a secret vehicle research and development lab in the heart of Berlin. Two days later, unnamed sources shot down the report, saying that the German car maker wasn’t interested in collaborating with Apple on Project Titan in the first place. “Apple wants the car to be closely built into its own cloud software, while the German carmakers have made customer data protection a key element of their future strategy,” one of the sources reportedly said. Here’s GM’s former vice chairman calling Project Titan “a gigantic money pit”. Apple VR headset For one, Munster does not buy the idea of an Apple-branded virtual-reality headset due to high computing requirements for standalone VR headsets. “It’s hard to see Apple developing a computer-powered high-end headset in the current market,” he said. He’s adamant that the firm will instead open up the iPhone for third-parties to make authorized headsets by 2018, effectively creating a brand new virtual reality software platform from scratch. A report by The Financial Times from January 2016 contradicts Munster’s thinking. According to the financial newspaper, Apple assembled a large team of virtual and augmented reality experts for a top secret virtual-reality headset project and had been building prototypes of possible configurations “for several months” at the time. Apple’s boss Tim Cook in the past called virtual reality “really cool” and said cryptically that the technology, in his view, “has some interesting applications.” Intel unveiled Project Alloy, its merged reality system, at IDF 2016. Cook went on to confirm in a recent interview with The Washington Post that his company has been doing “a lot of things” in terms of augmented and virtual reality. “I think augmented reality is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain,” he said. What do you guys make of Munster’s latest predictions? Top photo: AirVR by Metatecture, a Kickstarter project that leverages iOS Retina hardware already in millions of people’s hands.

The Apple robot mispronounces the singer’s surname “Strei-zand,” not the correct “Strei-sand,” with a soft “s.” This is a big problem, so Babs leapt into action to rectify it. “I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30,” Streisand said during a “Weekend Edition Saturday” NPR interview. “So, let’s see if that happens, because I’ll be thrilled.” *Also Read:* Kanye West Wants Apple to Buy Tidal From Jay Z 'Now' Streisand is currently on tour in a select number of cities across North America and is out-and-about promoting her new album of duets called “Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway.” Among the famous names involved in the collaboration are Anne Hathaway, Daisy Ridley, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jamie Foxx, Melissa McCarthy and Antonio Banderas. In 2014, the EGOT winner — a nickname for the exclusive group of only 12 people who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award — appeared on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon. “I was afraid that you were going to be more of a nightmare,” he told her candidly, marveling at how charming and down-to-earth she was. According to Fallon, if there was one person on the planet who’d earned the right to be a diva, it was Streisand. *Also Read:* STX Entertainment Drops Barbra Streisand's 'Gypsy' Remake (Exclusive) She said that she’s “quite ordinary,” and that she and her husband James Brolin live a simple life. “We don’t really like the big time stardom thing, so we stay home most of the time,” she explained. “That’s why I’m gonna write a book,” Streisand said. “Because I swear to God these myths are so far-fetched.” Siri will be happy to hear that.

By my count, we have approximately seventeen million leaked photos and renders of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Some are good, some are bad, most are blurry. But they’re all here, in all their glory, ready for inspection. DON’T MISS: 7 awesome iOS 10 features you didn’t know existed The first iPhone 7 image we saw was a concept from Martin Hajek. His render looks very similar to the iPhoen 6s, so it’s probably right on the money. The big differences are a Force Touch home button, and slim top bezel that reduces the size taken by the front-facing camera and speaker. It’s a great render, and not technologically impossible for Apple. There’s a good chance we’ll see some of those features on the 2017 iPhone, from what we’ve been hearing.   Next up was another concept, this time from YouTube. It was published by ConceptsiPhone, and while it vaguely followed Apple’s design language, it looks way off with hindsight. Doesn’t mean it’s bad though — I love the small bezel and rounded back, reminiscent of the Moto X. Edge-to-edge glass is a nightmare, though, so I’m happy Apple doesn’t seem to be pursuing that too hard. A very different concept came from GdgtCompare, which took a lot of design liberties from the iPhone 4 and 5 series. It’s a trip back to the flat-edged design that the iPhone SE still sports, but with upgrades like curved glass to make it truly modern. Personally, I hate the glass back on the 4-series iPhones — or at least, how easily they crack. Most concepts and renderings stuck with traditional Apple designs to make a realistic guess at what the iPhone 7 will look like. But some of the designs are a lot more radical, showing the kind of radical rethinking of the iPhone that we’re expecting to see for the 10th anniversary iPhone next year. Curved edges, thin design and zero bezel make this phone almost impossibly good to look at, but the practicalities make me wince. There’s definitely no space for a headphone jack on this phone, that’s for sure. December saw us get one of the most realistic iPhone concepts yet. German website Handy Abovergleich posted an image thinking about what the iPhone would look like without a headphone jack. The concept isn’t very original — it’s really just an iPhone 6 with no headphone jack and thinner antenna lines — but as a result, it’s probably pretty bang-on what the iPhone 7 will look like. As soon as the clocks turned to 2016, we got our first actual leaked image. Nowhereelse sourced a photo of the iPhone 7’s backlight — not the most important internal component, but one that provided some clues at what kind of device we’ll be looking at come September. It’s about the same size as the iPhone 6s backlight. It wasn’t a surprise that Apple was planning on sticking with the 4.7-inch screen size, but welcome nonetheless. My favorite concept was made by graphic designer Arthur Reis, and it’s realistic and beautiful all at once. It takes inspiration from the old square-edged iPhones, but rounds off the 90-degree corners to make it a little easier to hold. It looks like the perfect mashup of the iPhone 5 and 6, which means Apple will almost certainly never make it. Our next leak of a physical thing wasn’t another iPhone 7 part, but instead a dive into the murky world of leaked iPhone cases. The first purported iPhone 7 case hints at a design familiar to the iPhone 6, but with no room for a headphone jack. Harbinger of things to come! The first real look at the outside of the iPhone 7 came in true leaked-photo style: a blurry photo of a render on a computer monitor. Not exactly definitive, but in hindsight, this leak looks pretty accurate. The back is similar to the iPhone 6, but with no antenna lines and a more integrated camera design. All our most recent reports point to this leak — from early March! — being right on the money. That case leak was just the tip of an iceberg. The next day, we got a peek at the dual-camera module that will likely be in the iPhone 7 Plus. This is the earliest photo confirmation I can find of the dual-camera rumor, which is one of the most persistent (and realistic) rumors about big changes to the upcoming iPhones. By the middle of March, iPhone 7 leaks had become so passe that the iPhone 7 Plus (or Pro?!) leaks started coming out of the woodwork. The first iPhone 7 Plus leak, complete with the dual-camera system that has become so familiar, was published by Chinese site Bastille Post. This image included a Smart Connector interface along the bottom, a rumor that’s been up and down in popularity for the last few months. We’re still not entirely clear how a Smart Connector interface or accessories would work with the big iPhone. The back case has been one of the most heavily-leaked components of the iPhone 7, and we got another look at the antenna lines in March. Nowhereelse showed off a case with a single-antenna line. The lines have been one of the most complained-about features on the iPhone 6, and speculation is rampant as to how Apple will get rid of them while avoiding another Antennagate. While all the plausible leaks were going on in March, a few more outlandish images continued to trickle out. One of the most suspect was this purported photo of an iPhone 7 without TouchID sensor or button. Those were supposedly integrated into the display, something we’re not expecting to see until the 2017 iPhone. With enough leaked photos in the open that we had a good idea of what it would look like, designer Martin Hajek put together his usual set of renders of the iPhone 7. The redesigned antenna lines stand out, as does the camera sitting flush with the body, and the lack of 3.5mm jack. As the rumors about the iPhone 7 losing that headphone jack picked up speed, we saw our first image of what would replace the classic Apple EarPods. It made sense that they’d just look like regular EarPods with a Lightning connector on the end, so that’s exactly what photo leaked to the wild. We have no idea if this is a real image or just a DIY job that someone with a spare pair of EarPods made, but it’s likely a good match with the real thing. One of the justifications for killing the 3.5mm jack is that it would allow a slightly bigger battery, fixing one of the iPhone’s longest-standing problems. So, as you’d expect, we got a look at that bigger battery in late March. It’s exactly what you’d expect: looks like an iPhone battery, but with  7.04 Whr rather than 6.61 in the iPhone 6s. After all the blurry leaks of the back case of the iPhone 7, it’s about time that we had some clarity and engineering precision. Cue the ever-reliable @Onleaks, who came up with a technical drawing of the back case, including precise measurements. From technical drawings, we go straight to dummy units. Macrumors found this silver iPhone 7 dummy. It’s mostly similar to the designs posted before, although the camera is clearly smaller and in a different place to most other leaks. USwitch then got its hands on supposed drawings of the iPhone 7, via an Apple sub-contractor. They look like exactly what we’re expecting the iPhone 7 to look like, minus a change to the edge that could be due to a case. No headphone jack, bigger camera — sound familiar? A more unusual leak was this version of an iPhone 7 case from OnLeaks at the end of May. It shows off a purple color that would be a big change to the lineup if launched, but more importantly, speaker grilles alongside the top of the phone. There’s a good chance that this was an early prototype with more speakers for better sound, since we haven’t seen much of this design since this leaked photo. With all of the leaked components and drawings doing the rounds, it was only a matter of time until we got our first look at a working iPhone 7. Turns out, we didn’t have to wait long. Towards the end of May, a photo was published on Chinese social media site Weibo, showing off a working iPhone 7 alongside two internal components, meaning there’s a good chance that this is the real deal. It’s very close to other leaked photos, and at the least, I suspect this is an early prototype of the 7 that might change a little by launch. As we started to see rumors of a dark blue iPhone 7 do the rounds, Martin Hajek came to the rescue again with this stunningly good render. People have talked a lot about the iPhoen 7 being a boring, incremental upgrade, which is partially true. But I will also say: just look at that color. As we got into June, the iPhone 7 leak machine kicked into overdrive. The camera details were getting nailed down, as a pair of photos of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’s cameras show. The 7 is getting a bigger camera sensor, while the 7 Plus gets a dual-camera system that should be better in low-light and at focusing. Which design would you prefer? #Apple #iPhone #iPhone5 #iPhone5s #iPhoneSE #iPhone6 #iPhone6Plus #iPhone6s #iPhone6sPlus #iPhone7 #iPhone7Plus #iPhone7Pro #iPhone8 #iPhone2017 #Glass #Aluminum #SpaceGrey #BlackAndSlate #Black #Design #AppleDesign @appleidesigner A photo posted by Apple® iDesigner (@appleidesigner) on Jun 24, 2016 at 1:20am PDT Another common rumor is the Space Grey color making way for a new, all-black color dubbed Space Black. Instagram user appleidesigner helped us out by releasing a slew of images that imagine the black iPhone 7. Martin Hajek again took things a step further by making photorealistic mockups of a Space Black iPhone 7. Accessory leaks also continued to trickle out, with the Lightning EarPods get some more love. Again, it’s difficult to know if these are the real deal or just a DIY mockup, since the two things would be so familiar. While Space Black leaks were taking center stage, TechTastic got its hands on photos of an iPhone 7 assembled from genuine Apple components. It’s not a fully-functional iPhone 7, but hopefully should be an accurate model of what the outside of the phone will look like. Big camera, no headphone jack, just like we know and love. To round things out, we also got a look at the case for a Rose Gold iPhone 7. The color seems a little more muted than the Rose Gold iPhone 6s, and may appeal to people who think the more pink Rose Gold is a little girly. NowhereElse also got photos of an assembled Rose Gold model, and the lighting in this photo shows it as being the same pinkiness we all remember. In July, we got some new photos that actually told us something new for a change. Images found on Weibo show an iPhone 7 without a mute button, which would constitute a major hardware change. The iPhone doesn’t have many physical ports or buttons to begin with, so removing both the headphone jack and the mute button is a big change. As we get closer to launch day, a leaked photo of just one iPhone doesn’t cut it. Instead, we need a full family portrait. This Weibo image claims to show off three different new iPhones, the 7, 7 Plus, and 7 Pro. Whether we’ll see two or three new phones in September is one of the enduring mysteries that the rumormill hasn’t quite sorted out yet. By mid-July, we entered Stage 4 of the iPhone leaking process: comparison videos. Here, we have an iPhone 7 being compared side-by-side with a 6s. Notable differences include the much better camera and slightly changed antenna lines. One video hasn’t convinced you, I hear? Well, thankfully, YouTube has a fix for that. This second video is so quick that we’re loathe to call it authentic, but the important details (headphone jack, antenna lines) do line up with previous leaks. With most of the hardware details confirmed, one of the remaining questions is colors. Assuming the classic iPhone colors stay alongside the extremely popular Rose Gold, we’re left wondering if Space Grey or dark blue iPhone 7 is really going to happen. The shot above would say no, since it’s supposedly laying out all the different colors of the iPhone 7, and there’s a distinct lack of black and blue. Those color options were later seemingly confirmed by a leak of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, with the colors being white, space grey, rose gold and gold. It makes sense that both the 7 and 7 Plus would be the same color, and two photos from two different sources is an encouraging amount of consistency. Two photos not enough? Well, since you asked, an anonymous Weibo user posted a photo of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, along with a video of the rose gold iPhone 7 next to the 4.7-inch iPhone from last year. As we got into August, the leaked video scene really started to take off. As ever, it’s difficult to know if these are good mockups or the actual devices, especially since they’re non-functional dummies. We take a break from the regularly scheduled programming to look at this photo, which addresses the iPhone 7’s most controversial “feature.” If the iPhone 7 ships without a 3.5mm jack, something that seems near-certain by this point, Apple will probably be shipping this Lightning-to-headphone adapter in the box. Prepare to lose it at once, and spend $19 every day for the rest of your life replacing it. This is the future. The question about the iPhone 7’s color was made even more puzzling by a leak from China Unicom, one of Apple’s biggest partners in China. It posted a picture to social media that seemingly confirmed that the phone will be called the iPhone 7, and that it will come in four colors, including a blue. Either that, or Unicom is a master of trolling. With all the iPhone 7 models floating around, one of the big missing pieces was a picture of a powered-on iPhone. That came a few weeks ago via Geekbar, a team specializing in iPhone repairs. The device is clearly running internal testing software, so it’s a less reliable leak than, say, a video of an iPhone 7 running regular iOS. After the photo, Geekbar also published a video of the device in question. It definitely seems to be an iPhone running some kind of software, although it could also be an elaborate Android mockup. #Apple #iPhone7 SPACE BLACK variant 1st act >>> Mute button 2nd act >>> SIM-tray FINAL ACT >>> Real Machine pic.twitter.com/AYnypb2RzM — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 7, 2016 My favorite rumor — the black iPhone 7 — was given more credence when a Twitter user published more photos of a rear casing and a SIM tray. In a follow-up tweet, the user also said that the iPhone 7 won’t have Corning’s new Gorilla Glass 5. While we’ve seen leaks of pretty much every external component, it took until last week to start seeing the guts. A logic board and an A10 processor both leaked in quick succession, helping confirm some rumors. Based on those images, it looks like the home button will be here to stay, but the 3.5mm jack is indeed going. One model we hadn’t seen much of was the gold iPhone 7. That all changed with a leaked image that showed off the gold iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. All the familiar leaked details are there, but the high-quality photos really show off the gold casing for the first time. Geekbar also came through with another component leak, this time of the display assembly. It’s not overly different to the assembly seen on the iPhone 6s, but with a slightly different internal connector system. Most importantly, there’s still room for a physical home button. Noted iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson has been quiet for most of the iPhone 7 season, but a couple days ago he finally entered the arena with a full five-minute hands-on video with mockups of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. #Apple #iPhone7Pro first look to a BLUE WORKING prototype (source PCOnline.cn) pic.twitter.com/Z7oQzr6l4s — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 16, 2016 #Apple By (great) request some nice photos of BLACK #iPhone7 PRO for you.@the_malignant & @KK低调, a nice pair! pic.twitter.com/92smawKVQa — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 15, 2016 The rumor about a blue iPhone 7 has been consistently floating around, but most leaks had it as a dark blue. Twitter user The Malignant thew a spanner in the works by posting the photo above, which clearly shows an iPhone 7 in a lighter, more powder blue color. Everything else is as we’ve come to expect, so either this is the real deal, or a fantastic bit of CGI. So what should we expect? If you’ve scrolled down through all those photos, you probably have a very good idea of which rumors are solid by this point. The removal of the 3.5mm jack and the changed antenna lines seem like a lock, as do the bigger camera for the 7 and dual-lens camera for at least one phablet. But there’s still a lot of details up in the air. Will we get a space black color, or some kind of blue? Probably most interestingly, will there be two or three new iPhones? The smart money is probably on two devices, with Apple have had plans for some kind of Pro as a step-up device at some point.   Tags: Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Photos, iPhone 7 Release Date Older StoryPrevious Newer StoryNext Trending How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more New leak shows how efficient Samsung has gotten at copying Apple Related Articles This futuristic iPhone 7 clear case heals itself from scratches Leak: iPhone 8's major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America BGR Store Pocket Tripod PRO Striiv Touch Activity Tracking & Notification-Enabled Smartwatch Bluetooth 3.0 Smartwatch with Camera & Pedometer PureVPN: Lifetime Subscription View Comments Hubs Apple No need to panic: Jony Ive is still designing new Apple products Leak: iPhone 8's major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature Android Buying microSD cards for your phone just got a lot easier You can now catch Ditto in Pokemon Go Mobile Sprint's Black Friday deals are great, if you like Sprint New leak shows how efficient Samsung has gotten at copying Apple Retail These are all the early Black Friday deals that are available right now Amazon's 13 best deals: 55" 4K Roku TV, Kindle Paperwhite, gigabit router, Bluetooth earbuds, more FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn BGR ON TWITTER Jonathan S.

The feature is set to debut as part of iOS 10, giving listeners the ability to find out what a singer is really saying in just seconds.” Hein reports, “Apple Music’s new lyrics feature comes right after Spotify turned off its lyrics due to the expiration of its deal with Musixmatch.” Read more in the full article here.

Loading... Comment Feed 11 Comments Herself Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 9:31 pm · Reply Yeah, right. Putting the “lyrics” to gangsta-rap “songs” is a great feature addition to Apple Music and iTunes—? I can hardly wait to find out if what these petulant rappers are “singing” is what my virgin ears are hearing. Apple had best consider extending their parental controls to these exploitive, misogynist, cynical messages. Hip-hop as a social phenomenon is vital human expression at its most basic level. But thugs invaded it. Thugs invade a lot of things and spoil the party for everyone else. That’s why bars have bouncers. ScreenPhiles Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 9:19 am · Reply You may not like rap, though enough people do to make such a venture worthwhile. You have your opinion, and while valid, it’s exactly the same thing a lot of people said about rock music at the time. If you don’t like the songs, don’t listen to them. Danox Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:25 pm · Reply Listening to Howlin Wolf, AC/DC, Tricky, or Portishead is not for most people either. If you want easy stick with Rascal Flatts. ScreenPhiles Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 10:09 am · Reply Exactly. It always interests me that just because people don’t like something–be it rap, rock or country–they somehow think that they can extrapolate that dislike to everyone. technicalconclusions Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 1:19 pm · Reply The point of her post was that these parental controls should extend to the lyrics content for these songs. That seems pretty reasonable to me and hardly worthy of the response you provided. I didn’t see where she categorically stated that she didn’t like rap for that matter. ScreenPhiles Saturday, August 20, 2016 - 1:40 pm · Reply That was not her point at all. If it were, you’d think she’d once have mentioned, I don’t know, parental controls. She was attacking rap for the purpose of attacking rap. That’s her right to do, but to treat it as if it weren’t anything more than a attack on the medium itself is wrong (and I am not even a huge fan of it). And by they way, how do can you claim that the the case when she said nothing of the sort? Either you’re psychic–because as I said, she didn’t say that at all–or you’re full it it. Take your pick. Herself Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 8:56 pm · Reply Excuse me, I believe I stated “Apple had best consider extending their parental controls to these exploitive, misogynist, cynical messages.” Psychic powers not required. ScreenPhiles Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 9:02 pm · Reply Correct me if I’m wrong, but you didn’t once mention parental controls. If you had we wouldn’t be having this discussion. So, based upon what you actually wrote, if that what you were referring to then being psychic would have indeed saved a bit of trouble because what you wrote wouldn’t have been quite so open to interpretation. Herself Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 9:46 pm · Reply It is right there in the leadoff comment: parental controls. Please read it more carefully. Dang Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:35 pm · Reply “Thugs invaded it”?? Wow. Some racist sh*t going on up here. Cool down, friend, or keep out of it. technicalconclusions Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 1:22 pm · Reply What part of the word “thugs” seems racist to you? Even suggesting so on your part is in itself, racist. Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple Can Unlock IPhones, But Won't Says Tim Cook Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:40am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     To commemorate Tim Cook’s fifth year as CEO of Apple as well as the fact that the company has produced a billion iPhones, Tim Cook gave an interview to the Washington Post. The interview takes the shape of a goodwill piece with a few snippets about Apple and himself that Cook decided to dish out. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Cook revealed that in the case of the San Bernardino iPhone the company decided to not unlock the phone despite spending a significant time figuring out a way to do just that because Cook felt that the technique would be exploited and it would be difficult to handle the backlash. He used the following words to justify his stance “the risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety." Cook revealed that the company did not acquire for revenue but to gain access to talent or intellectual property and therefore the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics was done not for the healthy stream of profits it generated but in fact for its streaming platform. Cook told the Washington Post that this acquisition enabled Apple to get its own music service out sooner than it would have been possible otherwise. The decision to make more original audio and video shows such as the planet of the Apps depends upon whether they would become the catalysts for pushing apps as the future of television. He wasn’t very keen to discuss the company’s tax status in Europe and claimed that Apple received no preferential treatment in Ireland which is in contrast to the EU’s view on the matter. The EU has opened up an investigation against Apple and the deal it made with the government when Apple Ireland was set up in 1991. But there is surely something going on considering the fact that Apple chose to direct two thirds of the profits it earned in 2014 to Ireland. Cook statement that where you "create value is the place where you are taxed," makes us wonder if he thinks whether US taxes are the only ones worth paying. Cook has denied the murmurs which claimed that Apple wasn’t as up to speed as Facebook, Google and Amazon when it came to Artificial intelligence. Cook also revealed that Apple was busy making a lot of headway when it came to developing technology focused on augmented reality.

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Give Songs Star Ratings on Your iPhone Justin Meyers 2 months ago Give Songs Star Ratings on Your iPhone Back in iOS 8.4, Apple introduce a new "heart" icon in their Music app, which works in direct correlation with their Apple Music service that was released at the same time. By hearting a song, you're telling Apple that you love that song, and they can make better suggestions for you (in the "For You'" tab) based on it. But if you don't subscribe to Apple Music—and don't think you ever will—that heart is virtually useless. And if you have a HUGE personal library of music and have been using the star-based rating system that's been around on iTunes since before the iPhone was even invented, you probably still want to star songs. Problem is, rating songs in iOS 9.3 to 9.3.5 is different, and the feature is completely absent from iOS 10. Previously, you would tap on the song name in the Now Playing view to bring up the rating system. If you try to do that now, you'll just open up the Album that the song appears on. Don't Miss: The 10 Most Annoying Things About iOS 10 for iPhone Right Now (1) Tapping on the song title... (2) Takes you to the Album page in iOS 9.3.x. (3) And the same happens in iOS 10. To rate songs in iOS 9.3 to 9.3.5, just tap on the Album artwork in the Now Playing view. The album with blur, and you'll see the dots and/or stars that you're used to seeing right in the middle. If you're using iOS 10, you'll only see Love/Dislike ratings. The only option you have for stars is using iTunes, and the only way you can see stars on your iPhone is by creating a smart playlist in iTunes based on each of the individual star ratings, then sync them with your device. (1) Tap on the album artwork in 9.3.x... (2) To see the star rating system. If the song has lyrics, it will show them as well, pushing the rating system up top near your status bar. In iOS 10, you have to pull up the Now Playing window to see lyrics, but there are no stars. (1) Tap on the album artwork in 9.3.x... (2) To also see lyrics, if any. (3) In iOS 10, you can still see lyrics, but no stars. If you've been tapping the song title since iOS 7, the iOS 9.3 change is not very intuitive, and the iOS 10 one even more so. Plus, these updates killed the previous ability of tapping on the song name to rate it from the Control Center or on the lock screen. So if you're at the gym, you have unlock your iPhone first before you can rate anything; If you're on iOS 10, you can't even Like a song from the lock screen. Even if you disable Apple Music to get rid of the "For You" and "New" tabs, it won't change the way any of this works. Thanks, Apple. And the star rating feature will likely never return to future versions of iOS 10, so start saying your goodbyes now.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 20, 2016 at 11:46AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has undoubtedly made more than a few millionaires. Sure, for more than two decades, it was largely a disappointment. But when the tech company's stock took off... it took off. Here's a look at the stock's interesting history. Apple stock history Since Apple went public on December 12, 1980 at $22, or a split-adjusted $0.39, it has appreciated more than 21,000%, handily beating the S&P 500's approximate 1,600% return during the same period. AAPL is up about 1,000% in the last 10 years. This chart shows the complete AAPL history. AAPL data by YCharts. Impressively, Apple stock's outperformance during its long history has largely been driven by less than 10 major achievements and innovations -- all of which proceeded to drive significant long-term success for the company. Key Events Behind AAPL Stock History Date Steve Jobs returns from NeXT Computer to be interim CEO 1997 Apple announces the colorful iMac 1998 Steve Jobs drops "interim" designation, becomes CEO 2000 Apple launches iPod 2001 Apple launches iTunes Store 2003 Apple launches iPhone 2007 Apple introduces iPad 2010 Data retrieved from Apple press releases. Chart source: author. Three products, in particular, were absolutely crucial in Apple stock's incredible track record. The first was Apple's colorful iMac, which was Steve Jobs' first consumer-facing product after his return to Apple. The second was iPod, along with more affordable models to follow, including iPod mini, shuffle, and nano. And Apple's most game-changing product ever was arguably iPhone. Along with its annual refreshes that followed the first version, iPhone can be largely credited as the key driver behind the bulk of Apple stock's market-crushing performance. Before these products began meaningfully impacting Apple's bottom line, the company struggled. Indeed, between its IPO in 1980 and the end of 2004, the stock actually underperformed the S&P 500. After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, the tech giant struggled from a lack of product focus and faced major headwinds from competition, namely the game-changing release of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. 10-year Apple stock history AAPL data by YCharts. The last 10 years have been particularly lucrative for Apple shareholders, with the stock outperforming the S&P about 15 times over. Investors can thank the iPhone for much of this period's return. iPhone sales have soared since the device's introduction. In the trailing 12 months alone, Apple has sold a whopping 215 million iPhones. This compares to about 6 million iPhone sales during the device's first year. Stock split history With a stock history as impressive as Apple's, you can bet the company has split its shares. Here's a look at the stock's four splits (a more complete look at Apple's stock splits can be found here). Apple Stock Split Date* 7-for-1 June 9, 2014 2-for-1 February 28, 2005 2-for-1 June 21, 2000 2-for-1 June 16, 1987 Asterisk indicates the first date shares traded on a split-adjusted basis. Table source: author. Importantly, all the returns discussed in this article were adjusted for splits. With Apple delivering such impressive returns for shareholders in the past, it's tempting to conclude investors should expect similar results in the future. But investors should note that Apple is a much larger company today. In the trailing 12 months alone, the tech giant has earned a whopping $220 billion in revenue. Gains in intrinsic value per share are simply harder to come by at this size. But investors shouldn't write off AAPL stock, either, as it would be a mistake to not give any weight to the company's excellent history of launching entirely new products in new categories, and capitalizing on growth opportunities.

According to a report from the New York Times, Lyft has recently held discussions with handful of companies to discuss a possible acquisition, with Apple being one of them. Other companies Lyft discussed a possible acquisition with include General Motors, Google, Amazon, Uber, and Didi Chuxing. In some instances, it was the other company that approached Lyft with interest in the purchase, though it’s unclear which companies Lyft first approached and which companies approached Lyft. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity. The biggest factor working against Lyft during the acquisition talks was apparently its asking price. The company, following an investment round by GM and others in January, is valued at $5.5 billion and has a cash pile of $1.4 billion. More than likely, Lyft was considering an acquisition as a way to better compete with Uber. In the past, Lyft has partnered with Didi Chuxing to work to defeat Uber. Despite those efforts, Uber still has a strong hold on the ride-hailing app market. Earlier this year, Apple announced a $1 billion investment in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, with Tim Cook explaining the partnership will allow for Apple to learn more about certain segments of the Chinese market in addition to delivering a strong fiscal return. During the company’s Q3 earnings call last month, Cook noted that while it’s uncommon for Apple to make cash investments in companies, it’s something he would consider to do again in the future. Apple’s interest in the ride-hailing market come as it is rumored to be developing its own electric car under Project Titan. Apple’s electric car is said to have a target release date of 2021, slightly later than the initial 2020 rumored release date.

None of the mentioned companies commented on the story. The nation’s second-largest ride-hailing firm also attempted a sale to China’s leading ride-sharing service, Didi Chuxing, into which Apple invested $1 billion, and to General Motors, one of its largest investors that refused to make a written offer to buy it. According to the article: Lyft has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties. The firm allegedly struggled to find a buyer because of cost, the fact that it’s not profitable and the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Lyft typically keeps 20 to 25 percent of the cost of each ride to itself. The article explains: With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft’s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company’s financials. That $400 million shrinks when you factor in costs like marketing, server infrastructure, software, licensing, research and development and so forth. They even provide drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road. If anything, the unsuccessful sale highlights a capital-intensive model of growth for ride-hailing services that typically spend billions of dollars in marketing and employee costs just to spread to new cities and recruit more drivers. The article states that “tensions have escalated” in the industry after Uber agreed to sell its Chinese subsidiary to Didi Chixung, which has disrupted a global alliance that Lyft had struck with Didi and others to fight Uber. Lyft has not said whether it will continue working with Didi. Based in San Francisco, Lyft was founded four years ago. The company was valued at $5.5 billion after an investment round by General Motors and others in January.

The company's online pages for all former Apple Stores now simply refer to places such as 'Apple Regent Street' or in the case of San Francisco's relatively new outlet, 'Apple Union Square'. The Cupertino firm has always referred to the latter as Apple Union Square, and has rebranded all its other stores to match this naming convention in the past few days. Related: iPhone 8 As MacRumours points out, an archived page for the Fifth Avenue Apple Store seems to show the shop itself still had the old 'Store' branding as recently as August 12. The site also notes that a memo was previously sent out to Apple retail staff to inform them of the change to both brick and mortar stores and online stores. Apple's latest branding move seems to point to an effort to convince customers that the shops are much more than just retail locations. The San Francisco outlet features an outdoor plaza called The Forum, which includes seating and a 6K video wall and hosts numerous events throughout the year. That doesn't mean all stores will be getting upgraded with such facilities of course, but it could hint at some sort of future upgrades to make Apple retail outlets into more interesting locations.

By doing so, the company showed its commitment to delivering a polished official version of its mobile OS in September.  ( William Iven | Pixabay ) Advertisement Apple fans are on their toes for September, when the OEM will finally roll out the rounded up variant of iOS 10, alongside a new iPhone model. Meanwhile, the company keeps machine gunning new iOS 10 betas in an attempt to polish all the rough edges of the software before the official unveil. This is the seventh beta the developer rolls out to both public testers and developers. Keep in mind that when looking at the version number of the public beta, it always stays one digit behind the developer version, making the latest iOS 10 beta the sixth public beta to come out. Apple did not say anything about updates for other OS, such as watchOS, tvOS or macOS. To check out if the over-the-air beta is available for your device, go to the Settings section, Software Update on your iPhone or iPad and update manually if necessary. Some experts urge caution from users, as some bugs can still be expected at this stage. To put it bluntly, users should install the public beta on their main phone at their own risk, as there is a small chance to render the device useless. So, what's new in this iOS 10 everyone is talking about? For one thing, the upcoming OS brings a major revamping of Siri, with third-party integrations to boot. Keep in mind that the integration will not be obvious in the betas, as third-party developers did not roll out iOS 10 apps yet. However, the reshaping of Siri could leave its mark on how users are tapping into their iPhones' capabilities. Apple has redrawn the lock screen so that iPhone owners will find their way easier among the rich notifications that display tiny live widgets. The Photos app will get an update featuring intelligent photo albums and deep learning categorization. Other areas that are getting a boost in capability and/or design are Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone app. Last, but definitely not least, the iPhone manufacturer has announced that the Messages app will come packed with a lot new possibilities, such as an emojify creator, message effects, link previews, third-party extensions and feedback on messages resembling the one on Slack. The official version of the much awaited iOS 10 is expected to hit the large consumer base in September, and until the day comes we must rely on a bit of patience. Which feature from Apple's latest mobile OS appeals to you most? Let us know in the comments section below. TAG iOS 10, iOS 10 Beta, Public Beta © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(Picture: REX/Shutterstock) The Apple Store has just announced it is undergoing a major, unexpected rebrand. It will no longer be called The Apple Store. From now on, it shall simply be known as (drum roll please)…… ‘Apple’! The absolutely groundbreaking change is apparently part of an attempt to make them sound less like places where you buy things, and more like community gathering areas (where you also buy things). MacRumors reported that the tech giant sent out an email telling its retail employees about the name change. Its newest stores will be the first to be rebranded, and the rest will gradually follow suit.

In fact, he’s remained pretty involved in tech, and his latest product, the Obi Worldphone MV1, has just launched in the U.K. after first being announced six months ago at Mobile World Congress. The new phone is powered by Android, has a 5-inch display, and is designed to compete with other low-cost smartphones out there, especially considering its 99 pound price tag (about $129). In other words, the Worldphone MV1 is not an iPhone-killer designed to go up against Sculley’s old employer. Related: Former Apple CEO John Sculley launches two low-cost Android smartphones Apart from the display, the phone features a 1.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, 16GB of storage with a MicroSD card slot to expand upon that storage, 2GB of RAM, an 8MP rear-facing camera, and a 2MP front-facing camera. It also offers a 2,500mAh battery. The best thing about this phone, however, isn’t the specs — it’s the price. At a tiny 99 pounds, this is one of the better deals out there. It boasts specs comparable to the super low-cost Moto E, even beating out the Moto E in some areas, such as in the processor — the Moto E’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, and is coupled with 1GB of RAM, compared to the Worldphone’s 2GB. Of course, it’s important to note that the phone has been available in Asia, the Middle East, and South America for some time now, and it will likely be available in other parts of Europe in the near future. There’s no word yet on the phone’s availability in the U.S. though. If you’re interested in getting the super low-cost Obi Worldphone MV1 for yourself and you live in an area where the device is available, you can buy it from the company’s website.

As Apple adds more features to the iPhone 7 next month and beyond, the battery life issue will be front and center even if it's not as sexy as a dual lens 3D camera. While tech companies like Apple are exploring the possible use of fuel cells for mobile devices down the road, it's safe to say that it's not likely to be on Apple's short-term road map. Apple's various engineering teams are intelligently working on both smarter CPU based solutions as well as battery improvement solutions to squeeze more life out of batteries as humanly possible. They're also working on ways, such as found in this invention, to ensure that batteries that are working harder in smaller spaces are designed with safety in mind.   Look at the great improvement that Apple made with their latest iPhone 6s 1715mAh battery versus the previous iPhone 6's larger 1810mAH battery illustrated below in a chart prepared by PhoneArena.   With a smarter battery, Apple's iPhone battery life went from the bottom of the pack with 5 hours 22 minutes of life to number three with 8 hours and 15 minutes … all with a slightly smaller battery.   On Thursday we posted a patent report titled "Apple Invents an Energy Harvesting Component to Augment Battery Power for iOS Devices." This is another area that Apple is exploring to expand battery life for mobile devices I the future.   Other revelations surfaced this week at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office focused on extending the run time for mobile devices. The second patent covers battery technology and specifically designing a "Dendrite-Resistant Battery." So what is Dendrite to begin with?   Apple's patent background explains what dendrite is and the problems that it causes in robbing battery life. Apple notes that as mobile devices "become increasingly smaller and more powerful, the batteries that are used to power these devices need to store more energy in a smaller volume.   A commonly used type of rechargeable battery is a lithium battery, which can include a lithium-ion battery or a lithium-polymer battery. Some lithium batteries may be thin-film batteries with a solid electrolyte. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries typically contain one or more cells that include a cathode current collector; a cathode comprised of an active material, a separator, an anode current collector; and an anode comprised of an active material. The cathode can comprise a cathode coating, and the anode can comprise an anode coating.   Lithium batteries conventionally include an anode that is comprised of a graphite material and a cathode that is comprised of a lithium salt material. One technique for increasing the energy capacity (mAh) of a lithium-ion or a lithium-polymer battery involves comprising the anode of a lithium metal material. A lithium battery that includes a lithium metal anode can be configured to have substantially increased energy capacity, relative to a lithium battery of similar size that includes a graphite anode.   However, charging and discharging such a lithium battery, in some cases, results in the formation of lithium metal structures on the surfaces of the anode. Such structures, referred to herein as lithium dendrites, can "grow" outward from the anode due to repeated charging and discharging cycles of the lithium battery.   Some of the lithium dendrites can grow between the anode and the cathode, including growing through various portions of the battery, including one or more battery separators, electrolyte layers, etc. Over time, some lithium dendrites can "grow" in a direction that results in the lithium dendrites approaching the cathode.   When a lithium dendrite reaches the cathode, an electrical short circuit (also "short" herein) can be established between the electrodes via the lithium metal comprising the lithium dendrite. Such an electrical short can result in failure of the battery and can further impose a safety risk due to overheating of the battery due to the short circuit, which can further lead to a fire."   Apple's invention addresses the build-up issue lithium metal structures or "dendrite. Apple notes that devices and methods presented in their patent application may be applied to resist, impede, suppress, and/or prevent one or more dendrites from causing a short circuit between the electrodes of the cell.   Some embodiments include a method that includes at least partially fabricating a battery including one or more cells that can resist dendrite growth between electrodes of a cell of the battery. For example, the battery may be a lithium battery that includes one or more lithium cells, each lithium cell having electrodes including an anode that includes lithium metal.   The method includes providing an electrochemically-neutral porous layer between the electrodes. For a lithium battery that includes at least one lithium cell, the electrochemically-neutral porous layer is configured to permit lithium ion transport across the porous layer and to resist lithium dendrite growth from the lithium anode across the porous layer. The electrochemically-neutral porous layer can include a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) layer that comprises a plurality of pores that are configured to permit lithium ion transport across the AAO layer and suppress lithium dendrite growth across the AAO layer.   Apple's patent FIG. 1A illustrates a lithium battery that includes dendrites growing between electrodes in the respective batteries; FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of an electrochemically-neutral porous layer that is configured to permit lithium ion transport and suppress lithium dendrite growth.   Apple's patent FIG. 4D illustrates a perspective view of a lithium battery which includes an electrochemically-neutral porous layer and at least one battery separator; FIG. 5 illustrates an exploded view of a lithium battery, which includes multiple layers arranged in a cylindrical coil configuration; and FIG. 9 illustrates a process for fabricating a lithium battery incorporating a porous layer.   For more details and examples, review Apple's patent application 20160240831 here. Apple filed their patent application on February 12, 2016.   Two of the four inventors listed on this patent filing are engineers that Apple hired from a company called A123 Systems that sued Apple back in February 2015 for employee raiding and misappropriation of trade secrets. Apple moved quickly to resolve the matter starting in March and then finalized a deal in May.   The first hire listed on the patent application is Shouwei Hao who is now an Apple Manager of a global team responsible for Battery Cell development for all of Apple's mobile devices. The second hire is Jie Guan, Technical Program Manager at Apple. Guan Led A123's materials R&D for high power and high energy cells. Interestingly Guan worked on fuel cells at both GE and Honeywell, an area of battery development that Apple has shown to be interested in as we noted at the top of this report.   Whether today's revealed technology and methods are in use today or are yet to be applied is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Apple users recommend increasing the new iPhone sizes to make way for a stronger and more powerful battery however this is not going to happen any time soon, says reports. However, a spinoff company from MIT has figured out how to improve battery life of an iPhone without changing its slim design. While users simply take this kind of discovery off hand, this new battery is not just a concept because it is going to be mass produced anytime soon. Anode-free lithium metal battery Startup SolidEnergy Systems has developed a new kind of battery that is denser than lithium – ion batteries. This is safe, long-lasting and will not affect battery size and thickness. In fact according to the creators of the new battery, with the improved density, they can create a battery that is half the size but will last the same time as an ordinary lithium battery. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit SolidEnergy has demonstrated their battery prototype using an iPhone 6. The battery was indeed half the size of the battery of the iPhone and it was able to provide 2.0 amp hours of use. This was more than what the usual iPhone battery can offer. Drone battery first, smartphones and electric cars next Come November, SolidEnergy plans to use their new battery on drones and then in 2017 on wearables and on smartphones. In 2018, this battery will be in electric cars. What makes this battery work is its very thin lithium metal foil as the battery anode. This very thin material is just one-fifth of what regular batteries have. This material is also thinner and lighter than graphite, silicon and carbon anodes. With these new improvements, SolidEnergy was able to reduce the size of the battery without affecting its life. The company has also developed a new solid and liquid electrolyte solution that will allow the battery to operate safely in room temperatures. The only thing that needs to be fixed, according to iPhone users is the pesky camera bump. Hopefully Apple techs could come up with a solution before their anticipated phone is released late September this year. Pre-orders for the iPhone 7 start on September 9, 2016.

Arts & Entertainment Music Expect more music to come after Frank Ocean releases visual album 'Endless' 2014 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival - Day 3 Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images Frank Ocean performs at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tenn., on June 14, 2014. Frank Ocean performs at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tenn., on June 14, 2014. (Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images) Gerrick D. Kennedy After weeks of rumors, new Frank Ocean music has arrived.  Late Thursday night the enigmatic R&B crooner released “Endless,” an 18-track visual album streaming exclusively on Apple Music. “Endless” adds to the growing trend of upending the traditional album release model that has buoyed recent releases from Kanye West, Beyoncé, Drake and Rihanna.  The 45-minute visual album — it’s an extended version of the video that originally debuted as a livestream event — is reportedly a precursor to “Boys Don't Cry,” the singer’s much-speculated-about follow-up to his Grammy-winning 2012 debut, “Channel Orange.” “Boys Don’t Cry” is expected to be released later this weekend on Apple, according to a New York Times report.  A representative for Apple didn’t return request for comment, and reps for Ocean declined to provide additional information about the singer’s plans.  Earlier this month, without warning, Ocean rolled out a mysterious livestream video. But the Internet tease didn’t give away much of anything. Caption 'The Zookeeper’s Wife' trailer Jessica Chastain and Daniel Brühl star in "The Zookeeper’s Wife."

See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >> » For instance, viewers didn’t hear any full tracks. Instead, Ocean could be seen working in a mostly empty warehouse, tackling a carpentry project, as instrumental tracks gave way to construction noises. Fans speculated that the album’s release was imminent, considering the video — which was titled “Endless” — contained the Apple Music logo watermarked in the corner of the video.  Upon the debut of the livestream, it was reported by major news outlets that the album would be issued on Aug. 5 alongside a video through an exclusive deal with Apple Music. A printed publication called “Boys Don’t Cry” was also said to be distributed at Apple stores.  The reported release date came and went — as did Ocean, until Thursday.  After being dormant, the livestream returned to life. Ocean reappeared, continuing work on the structure he began building weeks ago.  This time, however, there was music — a full album, in fact.   Shot by Francisco Soriano and directed by the singer, the black-and-white art film depicts Ocean (actually multiple versions of himself) working to build a spiral staircase in the middle of a room. Ocean is also credited as executive producer and creative director of the film.  “Endless” begins with a flickering electronic number, “Device Control,” pulled from German visual artist Wolfgang Tillmans. Tillmans, whose voice opens and closes the album, revealed on his Instagram account that the track will appear on his own EP, also titled “Device Control,” and that he shared the track with Ocean just three weeks ago.  “Endless,” the visual, unfolds as three Oceans work to complete the project. At one point in the film two are cutting wood while the third aimlessly looks at his cellphone.   As for the music, it’s an experimental trip inside Ocean’s mind. Contemplative and free-flowing, some tracks feel like avant-garde demos while others feel like fully fleshed out records. There are ambient interludes and jam sessions that don’t even last a minute.  Fans recognized his cover of the Isley Brothers’ “At Your Best (You Are Love)” that appears early on the album. It was released early last year to tease the album and was then titled “You Are Luhh.” Ocean raps on “U-N-I-T-Y,” while R&B songstress Jazmine Sullivan brings warmth to a number of tracks, including “Hublots,” where she takes the lead. There are flashes of acoustic-driven soul, techno, trap and icy electronics. A number of the songs on the album were first heard in instrumental form on the livestream. Other tracks on the album include “Alabama,” “Commes Des Garcons,” “Wither,” “In Here Somewhere,” “Sideways,” “Mine,” “Hublots,” “Slide on Me,” “Florida,” “Deathwish (ASR),” “Rushes,” “Rushes to” and “Higgs.”  For the album, the singer collaborated with Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Arca, Alex G, Troy Noka and Sampha. Ocean played piano and guitar on a number of tracks, and violins, double basses, violas and cellos from London Contemporary Orchestra accompanied others.  Before it was released on Thursday, the wait for “Endless” had seemingly felt as such. In April 2015, Ocean announced that he’d completed the album, to be called “Boys Don't Cry,” and his reps confirmed that the album and an accompanying publication would arrive in July 2015. A year later, the singer updated his website with an image of a library due-date card stamped with a number of dates — including July 2016. Ocean’s unconventional release — there’s still no way to purchase the album or listen to it outside of streaming the visual — adds to a year of artists eschewing traditional releases in favor of turning their album release into a major event. Beyoncé first debuted her latest visual album, “Lemonade,” through an HBO special before releasing it exclusively to Tidal. Rihanna gave away 1 million copies of “Anti” via a deal with Samsung and Tidal, while Drake premiered “Views” via a “global listening party” on Apple Music Beats 1.   And West, in typical fashion for the polarizing rapper, rolled out his latest album, “The Life of Pablo,” with a chaotic listening party/fashion show for a sold-out Madison Square Garden that also served as the debut for his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. He sold tickets to the event and 20 million people tuned into the livestream before he released the album for free on Tidal. He later lifted that exclusivity and has since been tinkering with "Pablo" in real time.    For more music news follow me on Twitter:@GerrickKennedy ALSO Prepare to get your groove on: Vaud & the Villains return to Ford Amphitheatre on Aug. 19 Rap 'feud' between Drake and Eminem shut down by joint Detroit appearance Fantasia is in control, and finally happy: 'I’m the definition of strength' UPDATES: 1:45 p.m. Aug. 19: This article has been updated with new details throughout.

Apple has recently announced the release of iOS 10 developer beta 7 and iOS 10 public beta 6. The announcement emerged yesterday as the part of the company’s plan to ignite excitement among the users. The launch of latest version of iOS 10 comes four days after the company released its fifth public beta. It also marks the shortest gap until now between public beta updates of iOS 10. However, it has led to several speculations about a big bug that Apple may have found in iOS beta 5, which forced it to release the next version of its upcoming operating system (OS). The latest public beta update is currently available to download on almost all iOS devices. Also, iOS 10 developer beta update is available to all the users with developers account. To install the update, users are required to open Settings, Software Update, and hit the Download button. It is highly recommended to plug the device to a power source while downloading the update. Otherwise, there must be at least 50% battery life left. Users would need to sign in to the Apple Beta Software Program; those who are not members can create an account for free. The final version of Apple’s upcoming iOS 10 is expected to come out this fall along with iPhone 7, Apple Watch, and hopefully a refreshed MacBook Pro. The tech giant claims that the final version of iOS 10 will pack many new features and prominent changes such as redesigned News and Music apps. Multiple reports and rumors suggest that Apple has planned to introduce the iPhone 7 at its September 7 event, ahead of pre-orders. The device may officially be launched on September 16. It’s pretty obvious that Apple will release final version iOS 10 few days before iPhone 7 starts shipping, around September 14. That latest public beta update is of about 60MB, which makes several experts believe that Apple probably fixed a small security or bug patch and didn’t include any new features and major fixes. It is unclear how many beta updates will be released before the final version comes out. The company released the last beta update of its existing OS, iOS 9, last year. Hence, if the current public beta is the final update, we may be getting close to the final version of iOS 10.

First introduced in 2006 and now a signature design element for all of Apple’s notebooks, the magnetic connector isn’t just beneficial for Apple’s iconic design elements, but lasts longer than using cable and port combinations with male and female connectors that can wear down with time. According to the article, Apple is working on new ways to use MagSafe connectors across several of its products, including the iPad and more. An example of one new patent by Apple reveals that the connector might replace their 30-pin dock connector. Connections would be made as they are now, but the magnets would be coded with info that would be transmitted when the magnets are connected with one another, allowing different accessories to use a single connector port on a variety of Apple products. So the new cables would act as a universal port that would detect the coded magnet and its info then reconfigure itself accordingly. But that’s not all since Apple’s patent also involves a new stylus technology for the iPad that would include coded magnets around the tip of the device and allow it to be placed in a doc connected to the iPad (or iPhone, etc) to exchange data. This is all in conjunction to its regular function as a standard stylus pen. All this info on the possibilities and expansion of magnetic MagSafe connectors was first filed in July 2011 and there’s no concrete plans or word from Apple if these ideas will become a reality.

Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review GO Check out one of the most compelling 7-inch tablets Aug 20, 2016 13:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Huawei is no longer just another Chinese device manufacturer, and living proof comes in the form of the company's most recent premium devices that it has launched to compete against more famous manufacturers, such as Samsung and even Apple. DESIGN HARDWARE CONCLUSIONS Furthermore, Huawei is the manufacturer of Google's Nexus 6P, a device that provides the Android experience in its purest form, so it's easy to see how the company has become one of the leading names in both the smartphone and the tablet businesses. And we're not the ones saying it because sales figures pretty much speak for themselves. Data provided by research firm Gartner in May puts Huawei in the third place when it comes to smartphone sales with 28.8 million sold units, after Samsung and Apple with 81 and 51 million sold phones, respectively. Huawei has undoubtedly become the manufacturer of devices that excel in terms of hardware and design, so when we heard about the Honor X2 7.0-inch tablet, we were quite eager to try it out. Available for around $375 at GearBest, the Honor (also known as MediaPad) X2 promises to bring very good quality for the money, without neglecting the user experience, hardware, and reliability that everyone is expecting today. We've received a gold version of the Honor X2, which looks quite exquisite at first glance but also feels great in hand thanks to features that bring it closer to the smartphone market than to the tablet industry. Read on to find out what exactly the Honor X2 is all about when you get to use it for more than a day. Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 has a super quality AMOLED screen DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY When looking at the Huawei Honor X2 for the first time, you almost can’t believe that it’s made by a Chinese company. But truth be told, Huawei has improved so much lately that it really deserves the premium manufacturer moniker, and the Honor X2 is living proof in this regard. The tablet comes with a 7-inch screen and is protected by a metallic case that not only looks excellent in gold but is also durable and can withstand hits and shocks that would otherwise damage the device if plastic were used. Furthermore, this metallic finish gives it a really grippy feel, so you can securely hold it in hand without any risk of dropping it. The X2 is super slim and is just 7.18 mm thin, which is impressive, to say the least, for a tablet of this size. It’s almost as thin as an iPhone, which, for a manufacturer coming from China, is quite an achievement. “Not the typical Chinese tablet.” The tablet measures 18.30 x 10.30 x 0.70 cm / 7.2 x 4.06 x 0.28 inches and weighs in only 249 grams, so it’s feather-light, and the chances are that you’re going to forget about it when carrying it around in a briefcase. Everything on the X2 is where you’d expect it to be, including the volume and the lock buttons, the headphone jack, and available ports - the tablet can be recharged with a micro USB charger but also comes with dual-SIM support, as well as a microSD card slot, and they’re all conveniently placed on its sides. The front side of the tablet features the typical parts, including a front-facing camera and a LED notification light, as is the case with the majority of Android phones, while the rear side houses the other camera, a Flash, as well as a speaker in the lower part of the device. Overall, the Huawei Honor X2 looks good, and the metallic finish is what makes it feel exquisite, especially when holding it hand. It has pretty good grip, and since it’s super light, you can always carry it around with no effort at all. HARDWARE Display 7-inch 1920 x 1200 FHD IPS LTPS touch display 10-point capacitive touch screen 323ppi 450 nits CPU 2.0 GHz Kirin930 64 bit octa-core CPU, 4 x 2.0 GHz+4 x 1.5 GHz GPU Mali-T628+ i3 co-processor RAM 2GB/3GB Storage 16GB/32GB + microSD card support Camera 13-megapixel BSI rear-facing camera 5-megapixel front-facing camera Sensors GPS Ambient Light Sensor Accelerometer Proximity sensor Gyroscope Compass Battery 5000 mAh lithium polymer Connectivity microUSB Dual-SIM support OS Android 5.0 with Huawei EMOUI #CPU, GPU, storage Hardware is where the MediaPad X2 excels, and the spec sheet pretty much speaks for itself. And it all starts with CPU, GPU, and RAM. Huawei has equipped the device with a 2.0 GHz Kirin930 64 bit octa-core CPU (4 cores are running at 2.0 GHz while the other 4 at 1.5 GHz), while the GPU unit is Mali T628. The available RAM on our test unit was 3 GB, but a 2 GB version is also available at a lower price in some specific markets. In terms of performance, this mix is impressive. Everything within the OS, including here apps such as browsers, email clients, and messengers, runs smoothly, and there’s no slowdown if you don’t launch any more demanding title. When playing games, it all depends on its requirements, but during our test, we discovered no title that couldn’t run on the X2. Due to the high processing power of the CPU, there are times when the tablet feels a little bit hot, but otherwise, it remains cold as ice all the time. It makes sense to heat up every once in a while when using it for gaming or similarly demanding tasks, but it cools down as fast as it gets hot. For storage, the Huawei MediaPad X2 comes in two versions, with 16 GB or 32 GB, but both models also include microSD card support to add a maximum of 128 GB of extra storage. #Display, touch, and Android First of all, the display. The X2 comes with a 7-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels that supports up to 10 points and that is protected with Gorilla Glass 3 to make sure that no scratches or hits damage it. The quality of the display is impressive, and you’ll notice that from the second you see the lock screen, as it offers vivid colors, excellent contrast, and adjustable brightness thanks to a dedicated ambient light sensor that’s integrated into the front fascia. Huawei rates the display at 450 nits, which is kind of average, but sunlight readability is generally good, although we found ourselves using the X2 outside on very rare occasions. Touch response is excellent, and it’s very clear that Huawei made no compromises here, with the X2 coming with the same display tech available on the company’s flagship phones. Then, it’s the software that contributes to the generally positive experience that you get with this small tablet. The X2 is powered by Android 5.0 Lollipop but is customized with Huawei’s very own Emotion UI 3.0, which has received a few updates in the meantime. Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 EMOUI 3.0 interface If you’ve never used EMUI before, this is Huawei’s very own Android version that integrates not only an improved look for the operating system but also additional tools that could come in very handy at some point. But if you’re the kind of user who prefers a raw Android experience, you might consider this bloatware and look into ways to remove it. The best way to deal with this is to install a custom ROM, but this involves additional tweaking, and you need to unlock the bootloader first. EMUI was designed not only to be eye candy but also to provide additional functionality, but when coming from the traditional Android to the MediaPad X2, you might find it a bit more difficult to work with. But it’s all just a matter of time, and if you give it a chance, you could end up liking EMUI more than the stock Android. Have a look at the photo gallery to see the UI of the X2, but keep in mind that this is more or less just a restyled version of Android with some extra Huawei tools. The performance of EMUI is similar to stock Android, and it’s hard to spot a difference without benchmarks. And we’re not going to run any because, as always, we focus on the typical experience of an average user who just wants the device for common activities such as browsing, video playback, and light gaming. #Battery life Let us say from the very beginning that there’s no way you’re going to be disappointed with the battery life of the Huawei MediaPad X2. First of all, the official specs. The device comes with a 5,000 mAh lithium-polymer battery, which, according to Huawei, should provide you with 24 days of standby time and 3.5 hours of charging time. In terms of standby time, we couldn’t measure how long it takes for the battery to drain completely, but if you leave it in standby mode during the night, you barely lose 1 percent of battery life until dawn. As far as the recharging process goes, it indeed takes up to 4 hours, but this is only because the device comes with a pretty big battery, and no dedicated fast charge feature is being offered. “Two days of battery life, easily.” As for the typical usage, the Huawei MediaPad X2 went from 100 percent to 0 percent in approximately 3 days with mixed activities, including watching YouTube videos, sending emails, and browsing the web. Gaming dramatically reduces battery life, and so does calling, if you use it with a SIM or two - dual-SIM support is being provided, and this can lead to 1 day of battery life. Overall, if you want to use it as a tablet and mostly on Wi-Fi, then the results are impressive. If you wish to unleash its full potential and also use a SIM card for on-the-go Internet access, but also play games and watch movies continuously, you might need to recharge it daily. #Other features The hardware section is not done yet, as the X2 also comes with plenty of other features that you can read about below and that you’re going to find super helpful at certain times, or even more often, depending on how you plan to use the tablet. There are two cameras available on the X2, and they both provide good quality, although we find it a bit difficult to shoot photos with a tablet. But if you’re the kind of user who travels a lot and wants to take some pics every now and then, the 13-megapixel BSI (back-illuminated sensor) rear-facing camera should come in handy in the majority of lighting conditions while the 5-megapixel front-facing unit is good enough for video calls and conferencing. And since we’re talking about cameras, the 13-megapixel unit’s BSI is there to compensate for the amount of light coming inside the sensor and thus provide you with better pics regardless of the conditions. Of course, this is clearly an overstatement because the X2 is not by any means supposed to provide super high photo quality, but it takes decent shots in good lighting conditions. There’s also video support, including 1080p full HD video recording and video playback, as well as support for the majority of formats, including MPEG-4, 3GP, 3G2, RM, RMVB, ASF, FLAC, APE, MOV. For movie aficionados, the X2 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but also with DTS sound technology that should offer good quality when not using a headset. And truth be told, we’ve found the audio quality to be above the average, but still not iPad-like, for instance. It is somewhere close to the iPad, but improvements in this regard are still needed. The X2 come with several built-in sensors, including the aforementioned ambient light sensor, an accelerometer, proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, and GPS. And last but not least, in addition to Bluetooth 4.0 and a dual-antenna Wi-Fi, the device also features dual-SIM support covering most of the bands, but also offering LTE Cat6 and HSDPA+ speeds (300 Mbps DL / 50 Mbps UL and 42 Mbps DL / 5.76 Mbps UL, respectively). Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 what's in the box THE BOTTOM LINE Overall, the Huawei Honor X2 is one of the best choices in the 7 to 8-inch tablets. It has a pretty premium look, excellent hardware, and impressive battery life that easily tackles the demands of those looking for such a device. In most of the cases, customers of small tablets want one to watch movies, listen to music, or perform simple tasks such as browsing the web or sending emails while on the go. A 7-inch tablet comes to the rescue when a phablet or a bigger phone is not around and certainly appeals to those who still want to stick with a 4-inch phone, such as the iPhone SE. The Huawei Honor X2 is one of these tablets, and given its feature lineup, it’s one of the most compelling products on this side of the market. It’s hard to find a major drawback, especially given how much you have to pay for it, and the only complaint that people might have concerns software.

The video shows black-and-white footage of Ocean building a staircase in a warehouse to the sound of new music, which looks more like a visual-art project compared with the more cinematic approaches by artists such as Beyoncé and Prince. “It feels to me like what a bonus disc would be,” said Jem Aswad, a senior editor at Billboard magazine. “I suspect the main album is yet to come.” Ocean is credited as the director of the video, which also features a cover of an Isley Brothers song and guest musicians James Blake, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead and the London Contemporary Orchestra.

It's been nearly five years since Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects." Photo by Andrew Burton for The Washington Post Video: Tim Cook on asking for advice Video: Cook: Jobs took praise, blame   Jena McGregor Washington Post     On a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook's fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson, a rose-gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone. That celebratory milestone -- Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he'll stop counting, as McDonald's did with its hamburgers -- aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant's chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On Aug. 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects." related advertisement video Tim Cook on asking for advice video Cook: Jobs took praise, blame   It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That's because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple's massive growth during Cook's tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike -- combined. But the iPhone has been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 percent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 percent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple's second consecutive quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth. Just after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of corporate America's most glaring spotlights. In two sprawling and self-reflective interviews -- one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks -- Cook described why the visibility of the job has been "shocking," how he's learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he's turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay). He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he's made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple's retail stores ("that was clearly a screw-up"). He fiercely defended Apple's tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone -- calling Apple's big presence in the smartphone industry "a privilege, not a problem" -- and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs's memory. "I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point," he said, "but I had convinced myself that he would bounce." Cook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favorite phrases -- many things are "deep," and Apple's mission is always its "North Star" -- he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he's quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be "lonely," that "I'm not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don't need any sympathy." That reflects how Cook's imprint on Apple has often been described -- making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI's request to unlock the San Bernardino, California, killer's phone. As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year -- all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost startups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain -- such as a reported car project -- appear to be years away. Some analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook's tenure is viewed. "Investors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture," says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. "I think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years." In the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years -- hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity. -- -- -- Q. Your first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, "I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change." Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view? A. The DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way -- enrich people's lives. And so our reason for being hasn't changed. Other things do change. But that's the thread that ties everyone together. Q. And what has changed? A. The obvious things are we have more employees. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We've broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision and I think a very good one. We've gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. Q. You've said you don't want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that? A. I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs -- they're not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don't think they're all that's important. There's an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. But I've never wanted to be the stereotypical CEO. I don't think I'd be very good at it, honestly. And I don't think for Apple that would in the long run be good for the company. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical. Q. You've got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 percent of the company's sales came from iPhone. Now it's close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that's cooling off? A. This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don't think there is another one. Q. Meaning? A. The global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number's been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I'm convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won't all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on Earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future -- like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't leaving home without it today -- you're really going to be connected to it in the future. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either. I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, "Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent." You know, the global economy's not that great right now. But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. Q. So to those who ask where's the next big, world-changing category for Apple -- it's sitting on this $231.5 billion pile of cash -- are you saying there's nothing like the smartphone? A. Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks -- look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, "Why aren't you making one?" Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those. I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else. I'm saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this "better days are behind us" thing. Q. Some analysts have said that. A. And it doesn't bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 -- this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing? Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can't grow any more from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we're coming down some this year. Every year isn't an up, you know. I've heard all of it before. And I don't subscribe to it because it's traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can't get large because you are large. Q. How do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company? A. In today's products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we've said it's going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products. And then, of course, the markets. We have done fairly well in China. India is fast-growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn't have 4G today. You can't enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer. And so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise -- huge. Geographies? India is one I've talked about, but there are others. Products? We purposely don't talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what's Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that's an "aha" for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we're not in today. There's not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area. Q. You succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes? A. To me, Steve's not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later -- six weeks later, whatever -- Q. Quickly. A. It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just -- I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. Q. What did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong? There's nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don't mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the 'hey, this broke, I'm mad.' Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother's or father's bedside before they died only because of it. Q. But what about in terms of running the company? A. I learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny -- social networking was taking off at that time -- and so a lot of the "love," so to speak, and interest from customers, I think, transfers to media interest as well. And so there's a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere. Q. You and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinized. How do you get used to that? A. You don't. You're both praised and criticized, and the extremes are wide -- very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up -- my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don't mean in a bad way. I don't mean that I'm callous and don't care. I think I'm a bit better today about compartmentalizing things and not taking everything so personally. That was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn't. Q. You've been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change? A. I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though -- for a company that's all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better -- it doesn't sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you're not making sure your carbon footprint isn't poisoning the place. Or that you're not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues. Q. Who were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay? A. I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn't achieve anything. They couldn't do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought -- I've got to do something. Q. And you speaking out would do what? A. I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it's not a limiter. It's okay to be. That it's okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it. It had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do. I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That's what I know, that's who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length -- multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it. Q. There are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It's mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice? A. Whoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn't mean I always do what they say. But I think it's incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you're sort of living in the echo chamber. Q. Who else? A. For the hearing [in 2013 before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple's tax practices], I've never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who's done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he'd be honest with me. He gave me great advice. I called up President [Bill] Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I'd not met him through a political connection. I'd met him through the foundation. And he was great. I went to Laurene, Steve's wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. And so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it's important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say. Q. With the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into? A. We knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on "what is right here?" People who were really key on this decision are folks like [senior vice president of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else. The light bulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too -- deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn't be assured. The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety. We knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy -- security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn't, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren't you unlocking this? Q. Did the FBI fight change how you view the mandate of your job? A. Customers should have an expectation that they shouldn't need a Ph.D. in computer science to protect themselves. So I think they depend on us to do some things on their behalf. So with that responsibility comes an obligation to stand up. And, in this case, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and not something that we wished for, wanted -- we didn't even think it was right. Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this. Q. You've talked about privacy being part of Apple's values. How personal is it for you? You're known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy? A. Undoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view. But in terms of privacy, I wouldn't link the two. There's a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it's really both of those -- not really the growing up in the South. Q. Back in 2009, you said, "We believe in saying no to thousands of projects." Name one product or project in the past five years you have put on the shelf. A. [Laughs]. I don't know if I want to do that, because it gives competition some heads-up about things. But be assured that we have. More than one. Because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things. We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well, and so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out. So more than one big thing has left the page. Q. When you look back, are there mistakes you've made that you've learned something from? A. Maps was a mistake. Today we have a product we're proud of. But we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn't our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That's important. It's the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them. Their pride or ego is so large that they can't say we did something wrong. And I think the faster you do that, the better -- change gears to something else. If you're honest, people will give you the benefit of the doubt. But if you have your head stuck in the sand and you just keep doing it, I think you lose your employees and your customers as well. Q. What else? A. I hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I'm not saying anything bad about him. He didn't fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I'm proud we did that. A lot of companies would have said, "Oh, he hasn't been here very long." But when you're looking at more time with [then] 50,000 people in retail -- that's a lot of people that you're affecting in the wrong way. That was a mistake. I probably have a long list. It's sort of a lonely job. The adage that it's lonely -- the CEO job is lonely -- is accurate in a lot of ways. I'm not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do. Blind spots move, and you want to not just have really bright people around you, but people who will push on you and people to bring out the best in you. People that amplify whatever you're good at. And then also the people who plug the parts that you're not and may never be. Q. What are you reading? A. I have two books going right now: One is the Bobby Kennedy book ["Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon," by Larry Tye] that just came out. The other is quite an old book. It's a Gandhi book ["Mohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth"] that I got interested in because we went to the Gandhi museum when we were in India recently. I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth. Q. When Steve handed you the reins, he said Apple had never had an orderly transition of CEO, and he wanted that to happen. What are you doing now to make sure the next transition, whenever it happens, is orderly? A. At the end of every board meeting, I discuss succession with the board because I might step off the wrong curb or something. We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with -- there's some really just superb talent in the company. Q. You've made more acquisitions at Apple, including the purchase of Beats, which was its largest ever, at $3 billion. At its current size, does Apple need big acquisitions like that to grow? A. Do we need them? No. But we always are looking for companies that have really talented people and great intellectual property, and when we find them we do acquire them. To put that into context, we've acquired 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years. Q. Do you think there will be more at that size going forward? A. I think we'll continue to acquire companies. If you're asking me would we do another one the size of Beats -- Q. Or bigger? You certainly could. A. We clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. But we'd only do it if it were great for Apple strategically. We don't acquire for revenue. So the essential for us is the talent and/or [intellectual property]. Those are the things that we optimize around. Now with Beats, we also got revenue. But it wasn't the purpose of it. The purpose was that we were going into streaming -- we'd already made a decision to do that. And we looked around at people who might be able to help us. I think we got Apple Music out probably a little sooner than we would have otherwise. It's infused some great talent on the team. Q. Sales in greater China were down 33 percent in the most recent quarter. Low-cost competitors like Huawei are getting into building premium phones. Let's talk about China. How much are you worried about competitive and regulatory threats there? A. We make our investment decisions based on long term. We have to report every 90 days because that's the rules, but it's not how we run the company. So as I look in the long term, I think China is an unbelievable market -- not only from a demand point of view and the revenue potential there, but also as a great source of talent. We have over a million and a half developers there. The reach is unbelievable. There are, sort of, speed bumps now with the economy. In a year-ago quarter, we were up 112 percent. So I think you have to back up and put it in perspective. If you look at it over a two-year basis, we were up over 50 percent in the quarter. Q. We were talking about getting advice from people before your first testimony on Capitol Hill. That hearing focused on the corporate taxes Apple pays. Apple is now awaiting a European Union ruling on whether you owe billions in back taxes, and corporate tax reform is a big election-year issue. Does either a Trump or a Clinton campaign give you or the company any hope that there could be corporate tax reform anytime soon? A. I think it's in the best interest of the U.S. to have corporate tax reform, regardless of which political party is in charge of the White House. Because if you look at it, the U.S. rules today are that international companies like us and many others can keep their earnings that they earn overseas overseas, and then when they bring them back it triggers the tax liability. What I've always felt should happen is that every dollar should be taxed immediately with no deferral. But as a consequence of doing that, you should have free flow of capital. What would happen is if a system like that were put in place, it should have more investment going into the United States. We're the only major country in the world that has a system like this. It's not good for the U.S., it's not good for the economy, it's not good for jobs, it's not good for investments. I think there's wide agreement to that in both parties, by the way. There's a difference of view with different people about how to fix it, but I think everybody agrees the current system isn't working. So I'm optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform. The U.S. needs to invest more in infrastructure -- so what would be great is, if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports. Q. What do you say in response to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz's comments on Bloomberg [television], where he called Apple's profit reporting in Ireland a "fraud"? A. I didn't hear it. But if anybody said that, they don't know what they're talking about. Let me explain what goes on with our international taxes. The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back. And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It's not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn't go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are. And so what we've said -- we think it's fine for us to pay more, because right now we're paying nothing on that and we leave it over there. But we -- like many, many other companies do -- wait for the money to come back. In the meantime, it's important to look at what we do pay. Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the U.S. is over 30 percent. We are the largest taxpayer in the United States. And so we're not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some. We don't have these big loopholes that other people talk about. The only kind of major tax credit that we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States. That's important to know. The second thing I would point out is we have money internationally because we have two-thirds of our business there. So we earn money internationally. Q. Do you feel picked on by the EU? A. You know, they haven't ruled yet. I don't know how they will rule. I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it. It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the EU is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody -- it wasn't something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law. And the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren't arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They're arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there's a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits. Q. Let's jump to Apple's future. You made some statements in the earnings call about artificial intelligence that got a lot of attention. Can Apple catch up with the AI efforts from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon? A. Let me take exception to your question. Your question seems to imply that we're behind. Let's take a look at that. We've been shipping Siri since 2011, and Siri is with you all of the time. Which I think most people would want an assistant with them all the time, whether they're at work or at home or in between or on the soccer field. You don't think of your to-do list, so to speak, only when you're in your kitchen. And the breadth of Siri is unbelievable. Increasingly, Siri understands things obviously without having to memorize certain ways to say things. The prediction of Siri is going way up. What we've done with AI is focus on things that will help the customer. And we announced in June that we're opening Siri to third parties, so third-party developers can now use Siri. So a simple example with that, whatever kind of ride-sharing app you might use, Uber or Lyft in the United States, you could just -- using your voice -- order the car. So third-party developers are writing tons of those that will be available to the public in the fall. And that's how we're broadening Siri in a huge way. But there are other things in there, like if you're typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just -- Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. The simple things, like do you drive to the airport? I haven't done that in a little while, but when I did, I always forgot where I put my car. Q. I just take a picture of the sign on the wall. A. But you don't even have to do that anymore because Siri will know where you parked. And so things like this really make a difference to people -- we do all of that while protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that information to the cloud, where we're maintaining it all, we do a lot of it on the device itself. So you're in control of your own data. Q. Do you have a concern about privacy as you push into AI? A. No. I think that talented people can come up with fantastic ways of using AI without violating privacy. There's a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy. Now there are some things that we do look at -- like if you buy songs, it's a reasonable expectation that we know what songs you buy because you buy them from us. And we use that information with machine learning to recommend other songs you might like. Q. What about augmented or virtual reality? A. I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about. [Laughs.] Q. You mentioned earlier about how much more difficult it is to keep things secret. There's been a number of reports about Apple's car project -- the people who are being hired or moved into place to lead it. It gets enough attention that it almost seems like an open secret. Why not say something about it? A. I can't answer a question about something we haven't announced. [Laughs.] Q. But there's just constant attention about it. Is it tempting to share any kind of details? A. We've always viewed that people love surprises. We don't have enough anymore in our lives. Q. Sometimes it seems like Silicon Valley companies are all blending together -- everyone's converging on the same big race. Self-driving cars, AI, Google is reportedly building a smartphone. In a tech industry where companies are trying to be "all things to all people," how does Apple's longtime philosophy of simplicity, and being very focused, move it forward? A. It's as important as it ever was. We're a bit larger today, so we can do a bit more than we could do 10 years ago or even five years ago. But we still have, for our size, an extremely focused product line. You can literally put every product we make on this table. That really is an indication of how focused it is. I think that's a good thing. Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level -- personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking. Q. Apple has really ramped up spending in research and development. One analyst noted your [incremental] R&D is now greater than the 14 largest automakers, combined. What's the most exciting technology out there to you right now? A. That one I don't want to answer, because it would give too much of an insight into the things we're doing. But we have ramped up R&D because we are heavily investing in the future -- both in current product lines and things that aren't visible as well, including in services. In due time, some of those things will be visible. But there will always be other things that will replace those things that are invisible. Q. Any final reflections on your tenure? Moments that stuck out at you? A. I've got the best job in the world. I think about my day and weeks and months and years -- I put them in three buckets: people, strategy and execution. I sort of move between those on a daily basis as to where I put my time. I always think the most important one of those is people. If you don't get that one right, it doesn't matter what kind of energy you have in the other two -- it's not enough.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, 2016)   Hayley Tsukayama Washington Post     All tech companies face a constant demand to innovate while also producing huge profits and sales growth. That means that Apple, the world's largest company, is also one of the few that can post a $13.6 billion profit and still miss expectations because the product it's sold a billion of isn't selling quite as well as it once did. Those sounding the alarm bells over Apple point to a few factors, chief among them that the smartphone market is slowing down and growing "saturated" -- a term analysts use when they want to say that most people interested in buying a new smartphone probably have one already. For Apple, which makes nearly two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, it looks like that could be a big problem. Of course, Apple chief executive Tim Cook is aware of this. It doesn't really bother him. "This is actually a privilege, not a problem," Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post. Talk about turning lemons into lemonade and bugs into features. Cook's optimism -- some might say denial -- is not particularly popular, even among devoted Apple watchers. Some are even saying that Apple's crested the peak and is on its way back down. The bears continued to roar after the company reported that its revenue had dropped from the previous year for the second quarter in the row. That just doesn't happen at Apple, or at least not at the Apple we've come to know in the past decade. Yet even that doesn't seem to faze Cook. "I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, 'Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent.' You know, the global economy's not that great right now," Cook told my Post colleague Jena McGregor. "But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth." He believes that, over time, "every person in the world will have a smartphone." And he's willing to wait for it. In that way, Cook is an outlier in a go-go-go tech world. His accomplishments are on a long-term scale. They take investment. They're about refinement, about maturity. As chief operating officer, Cook was credited with what some could arguably call Apple's greatest but most boring accomplishment -- the massive manufacturing and distribution chains that made it a household name in Beijing, Baltimore and everywhere in between. So Cook's ears are closed to the criticism Apple gets for not being as flashy or open about its moonshots as its competitors. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, for instance, are all very vocal about the spaghetti they throw at the wall. Sure, Apple may try a wearable here or a cheaper smartphone there, but it's not running headlong into anything. "Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to," Cook told The Post. Further, he said, "Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level -- personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking." There's a touch of (dare we say?) Jobsian hubris in that. But it does speak to Cook's own brand of innovation, which is in setting foundations rather than breaking ground. He cements success. It's no coincidence that, as Apple's hardware divisions see slower growth on the horizon, its services division is seeing more investment. In Cook's mind, the addressable market for the iPhone is 7 billion -- and he knows those people will constantly need things to watch, listen and do on their phones. That's great for a company that's looking for stability. It's great for a firm making sure it has enough money to stoke the future flames in research and development, which has grown under Cook's watch. But the slow innovation philosophy can be hard to jell with a company vocabulary and culture that's steeped in superlative. So much of Apple's appeal has been due to its dramatic history, its deep lows that made its highs all the more breathtaking. The truth is that Tim Cook could probably keep Apple humming along forever. The question is whether the rest of the world can ever accept an Apple that isn't run by one of the crazy ones.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business posted: 8/20/2016 7:17 AM Why is the iPad Pro a 'computer'? Because Apple's courting the business market. Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a "computer." (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, 2015)   Hayley Tsukayama Washington Post     Apple, it seems, would like to see more tablets in briefcases next year. A new report from MacRumors cites noted Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says there will be three new iPad models in 2017 -- including a brand-new iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a "computer." There's a good reason to sell the iPad Pro as a "computer" rather than a tablet. Tablets aren't selling nearly as well as they used to be. And while computers are also in a sales slump, there is growth in the "detachables" category -- devices that blend the tablet and the traditional laptop and have, well, a detachable keyboard. Casting the iPad Pro this way is important to Apple to catch the eye of businesses and business people, who may want something light but still functional for work. It is a bit of a departure from Apple's past. Steve Jobs, Apple's late co-founder and chief executive, famously disliked courting businesses. Per ZDNet, in 2010, Jobs told then-Wall Street Journal writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher: "What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go 'yes' or 'no,' and if enough of them say 'yes,' we get to come to work tomorrow. That's how it works. It's really simple. With the enterprise market, it's not so simple. The people that use the products don't decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions sometimes are confused." Given that Jobs created Apple to make personal computers -- a counter to the computing grip IBM and Microsoft had on offices -- his disdain for the sector makes sense. But the business market has changed in ways that blunt Jobs's old criticisms. He didn't like that enterprise devices weren't personal; that's no longer the case in a BYOD world. Even when there's a set list of devices approved by a workplace, it almost always includes an iPhone, an iPad, or at least some iOS-friendly apps. And businesses are a great market for the tablet and the "post-PC" vision that Jobs envisioned with the introduction of the iPad. With a more mobile workforce, the iPad and the iPad Pro -- along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and other 2-in-1 devices -- make a lot of sense for moving from hotel room to living room to board room. It must also be said that the enterprise market isn't the only thing that's changed since Jobs vocally dismissed the sector. Apple has, too. Chief executive Tim Cook has made enterprise a key focus for Apple. And while some consumer enthusiasm for Apple's products has ebbed -- Target reported its Apple sales were down 20 percent across the board this quarter -- businesses are still buying enough to make Apple's enterprise play a $25 billion business. In his recent interview with The Post's Jena McGregor, Cook specifically highlighted Apple's enterprise market saying: "We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products." This is an area, of course, that could fire up old rivalries -- in fact, Microsoft has already released a commercial calling Apple's "computer" claim into question and comparing the iPad Pro unfavorably to its own Surface Pro 4. The commercial raises some good points. The iPad Pro is still functionally a mobile device and lacks features such as multiple ports that traditional "computers" (and, of course the Surface Pro 4) do have. Then again, Apple has a line of laptops that only have one port, so there's really no hard and fast definition of "computer"- and Apple's clearly working hard to stretch the definition enough to fit the iPad Pro under the umbrella. --- Videos: Apple ad Microsoft ad Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

By DealNews August 20, 2016 Save for later Saved iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York. Andrew Kelly/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you're thinking of buying a new iPhone right now, don't do it! You could save yourself a small fortune by delaying that purchase until September, when  Apple is set to unveil the next models of its world-conquering smartphones. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will almost certainly be unveiled in early September. The rumor mill has been grinding for months already, suggesting the new  iPhones might be water-resistant, have Touch ID built into the screen, feature an updated home button, and  come without a headphone jack. There's little doubt they'll sport improved cameras and faster performance, but it's best to take the rest of the rumors with a healthy pinch of salt. You always pay a premium to get the latest tech. But whatever Apple unveils this fall, last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are still going to be great smartphones, and we're expecting to see a healthy discount for both. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Saying that any new device gets cheaper the longer you wait to buy it may sound like stating the obvious, but we've also been digging into our research. We'll tell you when and how far the iPhone prices will fall, so you can get an idea of whether it's really worth waiting. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 After the Apple Announcement, It's Cheaper to Buy Last Year's iPhones When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. It has a tier pricing system, so the latest phone is $649 to buy outright or $199 on a two-year contract, and you can buy last year's iPhone for a one-time payment of $549 or $99 on contract. The iPhone Plus models work exactly the same way, but start at $749 to buy outright and $299 on a two-year contract. When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. If you want to buy a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, whether you buy on contract or pay the full price up front, it will be $100 cheaper as soon as the next iPhone is announced. T-Mobile has disrupted the standard two-year contract model by offering any iPhone model without any money down — by simply splitting the cost of the handset across 24 months. So, you'll pay a higher monthly fee, but it will cover service and the iPhone's price tag. The other carriers have followed suit, but be careful to calculate the full price you'll pay on any deal before you pull the trigger. Older iPhones Are Cheaper Still In the past, Apple has also dropped an extra $100 off the next model down, so when the iPhone 6s was announced, the iPhone 5s was made available for no upfront fee and monthly installments totaling $450. However, the release of the iPhone SE has muddied the waters a little here. It effectively replaced the iPhone 5s and is being offered for a one-time payment of $399, or for nothing up front with an installment plan. We don't expect to see any further price drops on the iPhone SE. The question is whether the iPhone 6 will drop to $449 and be made available for nothing up front with installments, which is a definite possibility. Retailers and Carriers Offer Deeper Discounts Retailers and carriers sometimes offer aggressive discounts to try and draw in customers, but iPhones tend to hold their value very well, so you have to watch out for them. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s at Boost Mobile and $50 off the 64GB model from  eBay sellers in February, five months after release. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s five months after release. It was a similar story with the iPhone 6, which dropped about $40 after seven months and then fell by as much as $150 in September 2015, when the iPhone 6s was unveiled. In February of this year — 17 months after release — the iPhone 6 dropped to $380 at Boost Mobile, and by May this year it was $399 at  Walmart. Plus-Sized Deals Are Harder to Find The iPhone 6 Plus was Apple's first larger smartphone, and it took a long while before we saw any discounting. It was eight months before we saw an eBay seller offering a $90 discount, but it dropped by over $200 after around 19 months. And by May this year, it was $499 at Walmart. We haven't seen any discounts of note for the iPhone 6s Plus yet. Some eBay vendors have dropped $50 and $150 off the price of the higher-capacity 64GB and 128GB models respectively, but that's it so far. (The 128GB 6s Plus still costs a whopping $800 even at $150 off.) These discounts might be slightly bested when the iPhone 7 debuts, but we probably won't see much deeper discounts than that for quite some time. Carriers Entice Consumers With Buy One, Get One Free Deals One eye-catching iPhone 6s deal that was available just three months after release was  AT&T's buy one, get one free offer. It wasn't advertised for the iPhone 6s, though that was eligible. You had to add a second line and commit to 30 months, but it was possible to claim bill credits for the full price back after three months. (This deal is no longer available at AT&T.)  Sprint is still offering a deal like this on the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus, if you're willing to sign up for a second line with the carrier. Deals on the iPhone 7 If you're already an iPhone owner, then you'll find some attractive deals on the new iPhone if you're willing to trade in your old handset. It's also worth seeing what you can get in the secondhand market, because iPhones hold their value better than any other smartphone. You will generally make more by selling your iPhone directly than you will for trading it in, and you can put that extra money toward the new one. It's likely to be at least six months before we see any significant discounting on the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But if you and your partner both want a new iPhone, then it's worth watching out for buy one, get one free offers. This article first appeared in DealNews.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update Apple iOS 10 Beta 7 Now Available For Developers And Public Testers Adie Pie First Posted: Aug 20, 2016 03:30 AM EDT Apple introduces several useful features in its new iOS 10. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Apple is putting everything on high gear to ensure that the upcoming iOS will arrive without a hitch. The Cupertino-based company is doing so by speeding up the releases between the beta testings. How To Get iOS 10? According to BGR , Beta 7 is available for anyone with a developer account, or anyone that is already registered in the beta testing program. In order to download the new testing, those capable need only to go to Settings → Software Update. The entire thing is only 60MB to acquire, which only means that the update is a small one. On the other hand, if without iOS Beta 6 or lower, developers need to go directly to the Apple Developer site in order to get the update. The same thing is applicable for users that are only enrolled on the public beta testing - however, can only acquire until the 6th beta testing. What Is New In The iOS 10? Reportedly, Apple has a new lock screen coming with iOS 10, as Tech Crunch reports. The new lock screen is expected to have a new notification feature, complete with live widgets. In addition, the Photo app will receive an overhaul, allowing it to use facial recognition, deep learning categorization and automated album-creation. The other application that is receiving a major renovation is the Messaging app. Users will able to place effects on messages, view link previews and third-party extensions, as well as get creative with an emoji feature. Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone application are also expected to receive their own respective face lifts. Unless Apple strays away from its regular schedule, iOS will be made publicly available in the next few weeks, or at least before the year ends. But if the speed results of beta tests are anything to by, added to the fact that the recent test likely only has small fixes, it is possible that the iOS 10 will be made available soon.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science  • Technology •  Computer Industry Internet Automotive One News Page > Technology > The iPhone 7: What We Know The iPhone 7: What We Know Saturday, 20 August 2016 by Graham Pierrepoint While Apple have always courted media attention with the release of their new handsets and tablets, they have courted similar controversy over the years based upon a number of choices they have made to the design of their flagship iPhone. With the iPhone 7 allegedly due for release this September – earlier than many will have predicted – some sources are claiming that the latest model of Apple’s smartphone may not be as game-changing as it would have you believe. While iPhone 7 will hopefully be more efficient than its predecessor, a handful of design changes to the smartphone may not be enough to convince some buyers – apart from die-hard Apple fans, of course. Rumored design changes include the incorporation of a waterproof shell – which may well come in handy – alongside a sleeker design and alleged removal of the traditional headphone port. This alone will supposedly make the new model considerably slimmer than the iPhone 6S – but will it be enough to convince the average smartphone user to make a purchase? The handset is also said to monopolize on a 1080p display, edge-to-edge, meaning that it may well be the sharpest and most user-friendly model on the market to date. With higher RAM and greater efficiency also on the table, Apple appears to be doing enough to entice current iPhone 6 users to make the change to the latest model – but with rumors on the backburner that an all-glass iPhone 8 could be on the cards in future, will Apple users hold out for the next one? It’s not entirely certain. For one, the iPhone 6S suffered from battery issues which many users are hoping will be picked up on with the launch of the iPhone 7. While the battery in the iPhone 7 is said to be larger in size, will it necessarily offer greater efficiency? The phone is also said to offer easier home screen access and wireless charging – making for a somewhat feature-intensive model that could well benefit from a smarter charger to allow for smarter features. In any case, if you are a follower of Apple it is highly likely that you will be excited for the launch of the iPhone 7 – particularly if you are interested in seeing what changes have been made upon the previous generation. While we may not know all the facts just yet, some sources are claiming that the iPhone 7 just isn’t ‘different enough’ – but we will only know the true score upon its release next month.

to Gallery Apple co-founder Mike Markkula and his wife, Linda, first purchased 8,000 acres in the bucolic Carmel Valley in 1982. Over the years, Markkula grew Rana Creek Ranch to 14,000 acres, creating the largest landholding among the golden, rolling region just 15 miles inland from the dramatic beachscapes of Carmel-by-the-Sea. Now, this Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who funded Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the early days of Apple and went onto become the company's second CEO, is selling this stunningly beautiful ranch for $45 million. The real estate offering comes nearly three years after the property was listed for $59.95 million, but never sold. The ranch is massive, its land largely untouched and pristine. To get an idea of the size consider that at 22 square miles, it's only a little under half the size of the city of San Francisco. Among its grassy, oak-studded hills and meadows, you'll find an airstrip, a private lake, two barns, a riding arena and a 300-head cattle operation — everything a modern-day cowboy could ever need.  At the heart of the property is a luxurious 5,000-sqaure-foot, ranch-style home with a "cowboy" bar where Markkula likes to play cribbage, according to the Wall Street Journal Street. Guests can stay in a separate wing or in the two-bedroom guest cottage.  ALSO Incredible views, a theater and 18-foot sliding wall equal modern luxury in Sausalito Nearly 90 percent of San Franciscans cannot afford a median-priced home in the city Rent increases slow dramatically as increased construction catches up with demand The Markkulas' permanent residence is in Woodside and the couple originally planned to retire in Carmel Valley but have found they spend more time in the Bay Area and are ready to pass on the property to its next owner. Who will the next owner of this swath of the Golden State be? A family looking for a quiet getaway, someone with agriculture dreams? A developer who will build homes on its 12 legal parcels? Listing agent Bill Mitchell of Carmel Realty Company says there are endless opportunities here, but Markkula would especially love for a conservation group to purchase the property to preserve the land and its natural beauty.  Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Apple Stores will no longer be called Apple Stores. Instead, these “community hubs” will simply go by Apple *insert store’s location*. For example, the newly opened Apple store in World Trade Center is now just Apple World Trade Center. The tech company is looking to reframe the idea of its stores just being a place to purchase Apple products and accessories. There will be things like 6K video screens, greenery, and even the dismantling of Genius Bar setups in some stores to put in more seats. This change is spearheaded by Apple’s Senior VP for retail Angela Ahrendts. She was quoted saying at the unveiling of Apple Union Square, “The store becomes one with the community.” Some of the other changes you can expect in Apple’s stores will include a more boutique feel to them with seasonal displays that will showcase various products. This time, they’re showing off iPhone photography accessory. It goes to show Apple is looking to sell you a lifestyle instead of just products.

Apple, which launched its 10th location in New York City and named it Apple World Trade Center, dropped the word 'Store' from its name. According to a MacRumors report, Apple has informed all its retail staff with confirmation that 'store' will disappear from both online and in retail stores. The re-branding is already reflected on every website for Apple's various stores. "Apple stores, with fancy headphone setups and avenue displays will now change on a seasonal basis to showcase different products," the report stated. Apple was yet to comment on the report. --IANS vc/na/vm Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Current Affairs Old currency notes can be deposited in post office accounts Maliwal pins hopes on court for women's safety Infosys invests Rs 31.6 crore in venture fund (Lead, Correcting dateline) Sayyeshaa Saigal not finalised yet: Producer Manish Singh Driver flees with Rs 1.37 cr cash in Bengaluru [ more ] Top Stories ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim SBI cuts bulk deposit rates by 1.25-1.9% [ more ] Markets ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Sesame output likely to fall 40% due to unfavourable climate Impact of demonetisation largely priced in: Ridham Desai [ more ] Companies Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim Azim Premji-backed FSS plans to raise $250 million [ more ] Opinion Gujarat Gas results set off downgrades Expect lower growth at Eicher Reliance Industries valuation at 10-yr low Don't revive inspector raj Resolving a disagreement [ more ] Latest News ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Finders can't be keepers Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Sesame output likely to fall 40% due to unfavourable climate [ more ] Today's Paper Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster Zara's recipe for success: More data, fewer bosses Debit card charges dropped, farmers to get easier cash access We should have 5 million customers by 2020: David Mcmillan, Aviva Europe Pakistan's jihad makers [ more ] News you can use Demonetisation: Stricter norms for NRIs Spread equity investments over three-four months Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh: Don't panic if you receive the I-T notice Expect your household budget to shoot up: Going cashless comes at a cost Opportunities amid chaos New Balance created its PR crisis.

It’s a slight change as the Apple Store is now simply Apple with the location. It’s nothing flashy or a massive change that it should cause customer outrage and it makes things more uniform. The rebranding is the project of senior vice president of retail, Angel Ahrendts. She pointed out that the rebranding allows for Apple to become “one with the community” by taking on the location’s name. Think of it as a local business featuring the street name and having been there for years. Rebranding is something that isn’t new in tech or retail, but sometimes it is when a product or store is successful or doing good business and the chain formerly known as the Apple Store regularly got customers and cash. As stated before, this isn’t a dramatic change and Apple is keeping everything the same as far as how the stores operate.

Overall sales of mobile phones contracted by 0.5 percent with only five vendors from the top 10 showing growth. Among them were four Chinese manufacturers (Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK Communication Equipment) and South Korea’s Samsung. Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year. All mature markets except Japan saw slowing demand for smartphones leading to a decline in sales of 4.9 percent. In contrast, all emerging regions except Latin America saw growth, which led to smartphone sales growing by 9.9 percent. Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Company 2Q16 Units 2Q16 Market Share (%) 2Q15 Units 2Q15 Market Share (%) Samsung 76,743.5 22.3 72,072.5 21.8 Apple 44,395.0 12.9 48,085.5 14.6 Huawei 30,670.7 8.9 26,454.4 8.0 Oppo 18,489.6 5.4 8,073.8 2.4 Xiaomi 15,530.7 4.5 15,464.5 4.7 Others 158,530.3 46.0 160,162.1 48.5 Total 344,359.7 100.0 330,312.9 100.0 In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung had nearly 10 percent more market share than Apple. Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets. Apple continued its downward trend with a decline of 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Apple sales declined in North America (its biggest market) as well as in Western Europe. However, it witnessed its worst sales decline in Greater China and mature Asia/Pacific regions, where sales declined 26 percent. Apple had its best performance in Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe regions in the second quarter of 2016, where iPhone sales grew more than 95 percent year on year. Among the top five smartphone vendors, Oppo exhibited the highest growth in the second quarter of 2016 at 129 percent. This is due to strong sales of its R9 handset in China and overseas. Features such as an anti-shake camera optimized for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditized smartphone market. In terms of the smartphone operating system (OS) market, Android regained share over iOS to achieve an 86 percent share in the second quarter of 2016. Android’s performance continued to come from demand for mid- to lower-end smartphones from emerging markets, but also from premium smartphones, which recorded a 6.5 percent increase in the second quarter of 2016. A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with the Galaxy S7, introduced their new high-end devices, but Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium smartphone ranges with more affordable devices. “Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology,” said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. “Facing a highly commoditized smartphone market, Google’s focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV.” Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Operating System 2Q16 Units 2Q16 Market Share (%) 2Q15 Units 2Q15 Market Share (%) Android 296,912.8 86.2 271,647.0 82.2 iOS 44,395.0 12.9 48,085.5 14.6 Windows 1,971.0 0.6 8,198.2 2.5 Blackberry 400.4 0.1 1,153.2 0.3 Others 680.6 0.2 1,229.0 0.4 Total 344,359.7 100.0 330,312.9 100.0 Editor LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Where Will Black Friday Shoppers Go?

First, you need to open your phone You can install the Light Kit on the iPhone by turning off the phone and opening it. You can use the provided pentalobe screwdriver from the kit and unscrew the screws at the bottom of the phone. The screws are found on either sides of the charging port. There is a suction cup in the kit, put it on the lowest part of the screen and pull up on it. A small gap will be created under the screen at the bottom. Place the pry tool into this gap and turn it slowly to separate the screen from the casing. Then, pull the screen back to 90 degrees and not beyond that. Its optional to remove the screen There's no necessity to remove the screen from the casing, but it will make it easier to remove the battery. To do so, you need to unscrew the screws holding down the metal plate over the screen's cables. Then, remove the metal plate and use the pry tool or your fingernail in order to disconnect the cables. The battery and Apple logo have to be removed You need to remove the screws that hold the metal plate near the bottom right of the device over the cable connecting the battery. Then, remove the metal plate. It is pretty hard to disconnect the battery. Use a butterknife or another small and flat metal object. Wedge it under the battery slowly to separate the battery from the glue. Place the battery aside and use the pick or your fingernail to remove the pieces of tape holding down the metal Apple logo. Installing the Light Kit Insert the light kit that the LED is placed into the new Apple shaped hole in the place of the logo. Put the tape that was removed earlier and just hold it down. Place the battery. There is a tiny cable coming from the top left of the earpiece. You need to scrape away the tape on top of it till the three metal connectors are exposed. Place the screen back Reconnect the cables that connect the screen and the motherboard, if you had opted to remove the screen from the iPhone's motherboard. Attaching the Light Kit Use a small sticky sponges from the light kit and place it at the top of the flimsy part of the light kit cable and form a T shape. Then, connect that part of the cable to the exposed connectors that are seen at the back of the screen. Use another sponge in the kit and stick it to the right of the cable vertically. Then, stick the electrical tape in the kit over all in such a way that there are no exposed connectors. The final touch Now, you need to reconnect the battery to the motherboard and replace the metal plate on top. Then, screw the metal plate and tape down the lower part of the LED cable. Place the screen back down and press on the sides slowly to snap it back. Make sure you don't crack the screen. Put the two screws back and turn on the phone.

Would You Spend $249 on a Levitating Apple Watch Charger? August 20, 2016 Christine Torralba 1 Comment There’s a new Kickstarter project for a levitating Apple Watch charger currently making the rounds online. But if you’re curious to know about its price, the charger will be sold at $249. If you think that’s a lot of money for a charger, you can pledge as a backer on the Kickstarter campaign so you can get one for as low as $159. Since the Apple Watch is built to charge itself inductively, the LIFT charger was designed to take things to a different level; literally. Instead of typical chargers, the LIFT charger suspends the charger from the ground with the help of magnets. As a result, the Apple Watch appears to be floating freely in mid-air as it charges itself on the dock. According to the designer, Levitation Works, the design of the LIFT charger was patterned after Porsche. Built with an aluminum and ceramic body, perhaps the only thing missing on the LIFT charger was a Porsche logo. The materials used were specifically chosen for suitability and non-conductivity. On the side of the unit is a practical touch along with a built-in battery. When the charger is not being used to charge an Apple Watch, it can be used as an optional levitating light. Even though the unit costs a pretty sum, there has already been a number of people who have pledged to the Kickstarter campaign. And with 34 days left, the LIFT charger has already hit its $44,000 goal and has gone over by up to four times. Would you be interested in the charger?   Source: 9to5Mac   Tags: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Charger, charger, LIFT, LIFT Charger About Christine Torralba View all posts by Christine Torralba → ← Apple seeds iOS 10 beta 7 to developers, sixth public beta Apple may have been talking to Lyft about potential acquisition → Aaron Britt Interested in the charger: absolutely. Interested in the price: absolutely not. I’d take the $249 and just buy another watch. Or I’d buy a different style charge buy at a cheaper price. Though I must say, the levitating charger is pretty damn cool.

By Rida - 20 Aug '16 02:23AM Leaked images of cases and renders of the phone show the device could gain acceptance if dual-camera, smart camera, additional RAM, storage, new chipset and iOS 10 are considered   Apple -"The ruler of International smart phone market" has disappointed some users with the battery life and camera bump. Though, the back camera bump is not a big concern for the users who are more concerned with the battery life. Users who are addicted to social networking sites needs a high battery backup mobile phones and Apple being the top brand in smart phones has disappointed the high end online users. Will Apple increase the thickness of its upcoming new smart phone? The answer is "No". The thickness of the new iPhone is much similar to the current one and size of battery will remain the same. The chances of battery life of the new upcoming iPhone may be inclined or remain the same. Users !!!  Do not be disappointed. Apple has come up with the new battery technology which will allow users stick to their smart phone more than twenty four hours in a day. There is a MIT spin off company who is currently working to enhance the best battery life in Apple phones and other devices. Unlike, the other promising battery technologies, this new system is heading towards mass production. So called SolidEnergy systems, started experimenting on anode-free lithium metal batteries, which emerged to be a success. These batteries are twice dense than lithium-ion batteries, safe and long lasting. According to bgr, " With two-times the energy density, we can make a battery half the size, but that still lasts the same amount of time, as a lithium-ion battery", said CEO of SolidEnergy and inventor Qichao Hu. "Or we can make a battery the same size a s lithium-ion battery, but now it will last twice as long" SolidEnergy systems has already demonstrated their battery in comparison with iPhone 6s lithium-ion battery and the results were quite happening. The company is planning to bring the same system of battery in drones in November, to smart phones and wearables in coming twenty seventeen and cars in future. For the batteries to operate safely at room temperature, SolidEnergy systems has come up with solid and liquid hybrid electrolyte solution. Will this success be incorporated in upcoming devices of Apple? The answer comes only with its release.     Share ( 0 ) Tweet ( 0 ) TAGSiphone, battery life Copyright © 2016 News Everyday Fun Stuff See More << Sailor Moon Takes Part On Preventing Sexually Transmitted Disease Through Custom-Made Condoms 'One Piece' Chapter 847 Spoilers, News and Update: Straw Hat Pirates Will Suffer, Sanji Escapes Wedding Capcom's Monster Hunter is in the Works!

Yarn Harlot Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Post navigation ← Previous Next → Away with me Posted on August 19, 2016 by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee Ah, Friday, where the heck did you come from? This week sped by, as I tried to get caught up, and was thwarted at a few turns. Most notably, I smashed the everloving daylights out of my phone on Wednesday evening. (A stumble in the dark, and I prevented a fall with an outstretched phone, which in retrospect was pretty stupid. I heal and have health care. My phone, not so much.) The day dissolved into a journey to the Apple Store, which turned into a wait at the Apple Store while they repaired the phone, and a period of three hours in which I had no phone, which was odder than I’d imagined. It reminded me of my mother in a power outage. She’s the smartest person I know, but outages are her kryptonite. She goes from activity to activity – “Balls, the power is out and I can’t put the TV on. Never mind, I’ll listen to the radio. Dammit, the power is out, the radio doesn’t work. I’ll do a little ironing. Son of a gun, that won’t work either. Never mind pets, let’s plug in the kettle and have tea….” You see how it goes, and that was me with no phone. I decided I’d listen to podcasts while I waited, remembered I had no phone, decided to listen to an audiobook, remembered I had no phone, decided to check my email instead…. I was the living embodiment of my mother in the dark. At one point I realized that without a phone I didn’t even have a clock, and approached a stranger. “Excuse me, do you have the time?” She was holding her phone, and looked at me like I’d just asked her if she could help me shear an alpaca, right there in the Eaton’s Centre. “The time?” She goggled, and I had to tell her that Apple was holding my phone hostage, and I don’t wear a watch because, you know. I use my phone for that. She checked her phone, told me the time, and then asked me when I was getting my phone back. Her response was a bizarre mix of incredulity and sympathy, and I could tell, as she clutched her phone a little more tightly, that she was imagining what it would be like. “Wow” she said, when I told her it would be a few more hours. “I know” I sighed. “It’s a difficult time.” A cleverer knitter would have seen the phone thing coming, and perhaps taken a sock or  printed out a nice reliable paper pattern to take with her, but as it stood, I’d handed the PDF version of my pattern over to the Apple people, and couldn’t even knit. I did try for a while, using previous repeats as a guide, but it was slow and silly. In the end I bought a dress with birds on it, and then a book – since I’d given my current book to the Apple people in the form of my phone.  It all ended well (except that I sat in something yucky on the subway, then I stepped in gum, and a bird crapped on me and some dude with a questionable grasp on reality yelled at me on the sidewalk) and I got home, and decided to essentially end it all nicely with a glass of wine (2) and a nice long knit. That knit (now that I had my pattern/phone) back again, finished the Ghazal Cowl - Well, it’s almost finished, I’ve pulled out the provisional cast-on I did at the beginning, and I just have to graft the two halves together, but I yesterday must have been some sort of sacrifice to whatever force of destiny decides how my days go, because when I’d done all the repeats I could, and ended on the right row, this is how much yarn I had left. That there is a winning game of Yarn Chicken, and a perfect ending to a knit using handspun. When I’m done the graft I bet there will be less than 10cm of remaining, and that was worth stepping in gum for. (I am less sure about the phone.)  Tonight I’ll graft, and then block, and then I guess I have to make another decision. I’m off on Sunday with the indomitable Jen and her two girls, to whom I am an honourary Auntie, and we’re headed far, far up north for some Canadian fun and games. Tents, canoes, camping and hunting for fireflies. A Thelma and Louise roadtrip – if you add in two little kids. There should be tons of knitting time (the drive is 8 hours, for starters) and I’ll be packing along lots of wool. We are going far enough North that summer is already gasping her last there, so it will be all fires, and sweaters, and hunts for fairy houses through the woods. Now, a few Karmic Balancing gifts, just to make sure my luck holds? You bet. (PS. I’ve added a teaching gig in Calgary at Pudding Yarn the weekend of September 18th to the roster. There’s spots, if you’d like to join us.) First up, Terri Major (friend of the show, lovely lady) has free patterns for three of you. Any three patterns for three knitters, your choice from her shop. Pictured is the lovely Rose Arbour Baby Blanket, and I’d get that for sure, but Krystal L, Kristin and Lee T will somehow choose. Next, a trio of beautiful cases from Grace at the aptly named “Grace’s Cases“.  I love her stuff, and these cases are so pretty – of the first, Grace says “This new Basic “Anything Goes” Spillproof Needle Case has just two pages and is perfect as an expansion case or a starter case.  It is Multi-purpose in that you can store a wide variety of items.  Page 1 has 7 snap pockets that can hold either fixed circulars or lots and lots of cables Page 2 has 13 graduated slots that can hold dpns sizes 0-9, regular or interchangeable hooks up to 6″ in length, or interchangeable tips sizes 2-15. Generous notions pocket included in cover.”  Better than that, it’s bike themed.  I hope that Kelly M loves it. Second “The Petite Lovely Tote. A great size to use as a project bag / bucket, or perfect for shopping at your local yarn store.  We kept it simple and clean on the inside and out. No pockets, no padding, nothing to catch on things – the space is all yours!  Measures 10” tall, 10” wide, 5” deep at base – Perfect for knit night projects!!” and also bike themed! I bet Ruth D has somewhere to take it. Last, but certainly not least “Cupcake Bags are divided project bags specifically designed for color work or TAAT projects. The lower portion of the bag is divided into two sections to keep your cakes from tangling and the upper portion has room for project storage.  Roll the top down to form a divided yarn bowl! Or attach a carabiner or clip to the included loop to hang it anywhere. Dual drawstring top closure.” and that’s going to Sarah E. If you’d like your own, Grace’s shop is here.  From The Mountain would like to donate 1 skein of worsted weight yarn in a natural colour, and several one-skein pattern options.  Their yarn is 100% cashmere and is hand spun in Afghanistan by women who are earning a fair wage for their work.  After over a decade of conflict, many women in Afghanistan have been left as heads of household, but with very few safe income opportunities.  Spinning for From the Mountain offers them a way to earn income and be home with their families at the same time.  I hope that Chris A loves it, and where it comes from. Amy has a pretty gift, bless her generous heart, a kit for Mrs. Beaton’s Wrist Warmers. She’ll happily mail that sweet little package off to Emily W. Brenda, another pretty awesome knitter, went into her stash and came up with two skeins of IndigoDragonfly merino-silk 4-ply sock in “Partying is Hafla Fun.” She’ll be mailing that off to Julie B, and I know they’ll love it. Jan has an adorable bag that she’ll be sending off to Muriel T.  It’s a “Tour de Forest” bag (how appropriate!) If you can’t live without one of your own, her shop is here. (I might not be able to live without one.) Phew! I’ve emailed all the lucky knitters concerned, and I’ll try to get another batch up tomorrow. While I decide what knitting comes camping. Maybe something brown. That’s always a good camping colour. Save This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee.

Reply ↓ Rams on August 19, 2016 at 8:55 pm said: Yarn chicken. A phrase so perfect you will never get credit for having synthesized it.

Reply ↓ Elaine on August 19, 2016 at 9:08 pm said: Hmmm, what to knit, what to know — I know! Aren’t you going to need a new sweater for a trip to some festival in New York in, oh, about — 55 days? Of course, that is a very long time and it isn’t like you are going to need to do anything else between now and then. . . . Reply ↓ Cara on August 19, 2016 at 9:27 pm said: Joe’s Gansey! It’s the perfect time to put a real dent in it. Reply ↓ Joni on August 19, 2016 at 9:36 pm said: When I was a kid there was a huge storm where many trees fell and there was power out all over town, including our house. After several days, late one evening the guys from the power company, who had been working pretty much 24/7 made it to our house to take care of the neighbor’s tree that fell on the power lines between our backyards. It was dark, the driveways were narrow and they were having trouble getting the trucks set up so that the lights were in the right place. Without thinking, my Mom offered to turn on our back spotlights, which were used when my brother & friends wanted to play basketball in the back yard. The head of the work crew looked at my Mom and said “Lady, if you can do that, I’m going home” and then chuckled. Sounds like our Mom’s would have gotten along Reply ↓ Diana on August 19, 2016 at 9:43 pm said: Can you share the pattern for the cowl, or is it elsewhere on your blog? I took to following your blog a few months ago, and I’m, hooked! Started out with the one row handspun scarf, which of course I did NOT spin, and I have made at least 50 of these scarves. Super easy and a no brainer when I am running on fumes. Love your stories and your life so far removed from mine in Iowa. Thanks Stephanie! Reply ↓ HeleninBoise on August 19, 2016 at 10:27 pm said: Ghazal – its on Ravelry. Reply ↓ AlisonH on August 19, 2016 at 9:59 pm said: Phones can be fixed or replaced and sometimes healing doesn’t come so easily. I think you made the right choice in that tumble. Awesome on that Yarn Chicken win! And I love all the Karmic Balancing Gifts. Reply ↓ Jo-Anne on August 19, 2016 at 10:17 pm said: I think the campfires are going to depend on whether there’s still a fire ban in whichever northern community you are headed for, but add in the endless sky of stars, and orange harvest moons, and you’ll have an amazing adventure. Reply ↓ christine m east of toronto on August 20, 2016 at 12:50 am said: 8 hours…. EIGHT HOURS NORTH OF THE CITY?! I get nervous travelling anywhere beyond Muskoka! Courage to you, brave women. I know it will be beautiful and wild and wonderful, the type of memories the children will cherish a lifetime. Godspeed, friend! Reply ↓ Renee Anne on August 20, 2016 at 12:52 am said: I know how you feel about the phone. Toward the end of last school year, I pulled my phone out of my pocket on my way to pick up Little Man from school, and my phone slipped right out of my hand, landed flat onto the road, and shattered the screen. ::sigh:: It took a couple hours to get it fixed, I was a bit at a loss…I could still *use* my phone but it had to be in a plastic bag so I didn’t wind up with glass shards in my fingers. Luckily, I was able to get it fixed within a reasonable timeframe. They wanted me to come in three days later for an appointment. I took my chances and did a walk-in, wherein it was fixed that day. It still sucked. Reply ↓ Lani on August 20, 2016 at 2:10 am said: I’ve seen photos of you with a tablet (iPad?) at airports and on planes, so you needn’t have been sans clock, pattern or reading material while your phone was at Apple’s hospital. Batteries save the day during power outages. Perhaps your mum could get a transistor radio (yes, they do still exist) to help her through the next one, and reading a hardcopy book can be done using a flashlight/torch. Live like a pioneer! I bet you’ll survive just fine without an internet connection on your Thelma and Louise trip up north. It’s good to disconnect now and then. Reply ↓ Marlyce on August 20, 2016 at 5:23 am said: I am so glad the phone got the fall. The broken wrist I got in similar circumstances (2013) is called a FOOSH— Fall On Out Stretched Hand. It meant no knitting for a long time and even now I can only knit for short periods. The Apple repair is much quicker and easier on the spirit! Glad you’re okay! Reply ↓ Daisy on August 22, 2016 at 12:02 am said: Yep — that’s how I fractured my scaphoid three years ago. It was 18 months before I could knit for more than 10 minutes at a time. Reply ↓ juujika on August 22, 2016 at 2:17 pm said: Ouch. Yeah, scaphoid breaks are always a bit dicey. Reply ↓ AlisoninOz on August 23, 2016 at 11:09 pm said: My mum broke her wrist three times like that. Eventually she learnt not to try and save herself and to use her walking frame all the time. Not that I’m suggesting you need a walking frame dearest Ms YarnHarlot, but I have learnt from my own experience not to try use my hands to stop a fall. I get vertigo and have the odd fall myself Reply ↓ Kath on August 20, 2016 at 6:58 am said: I live in Sault Ste Marie ( which is about 8 hours from Toronto, depending on how you drive!) I hope you’re in the area for Monday, not just Saturday and Sunday, cause I don’t think you’ll like the weather we’re having right now. But it will definitely be cooler than Toronto.

When you have most of your life on your computer, you feel like you’re missing a limb without it. I suppose your incident is a good reason why a knitter should never be without yarn and needles for a pair of vanilla socks!

That cupcake bag is brilliant since I do socks two at a time on two circulars. I am glad you won yarn chicken! I just lost on Saturday. Three very short rows and a bind off left. Expensive yarn. Lace pattern so I had to do the full repeat or it would look seriously odd. Heavy sigh. I am now doing a sheep toy with a plentiful supply of super cheap worsted. Sometimes you need to not worry about running out, like right after you lose the yarn chicken game!

Then I read Hank is a teenager. I am sure you have mentioned it before but after reading Meg got married, this particular piece of information FLOORED ME! How dare he be a teenager! He is only 5! (Again, only in my mind, I know.) I cried while reading, as I occasionally do. When I read about Erin, my heart bled a little. It hits close to home in a multitude of ways. I can’t imagine taking the ride that you do for a worthy cause. It is amazing and heartfelt. Thank you for sharing your life and talent. I love the humor that you add. I mean, who hasn’t played yarn chicken and lost? Who hasn’t talked themselves out of a knitting issue, KNOWING it really wasn’t going to work out but yet, still somehow managing to convince themselves it would? I appreciate how human you are. You are an experienced knitter (to say the least) and teach those of us that are just trying to figure it out how to do it and you mess up. It makes me feel more confident in my knitting.

These things might not be a given if you fall on your hand. Even … you might have a functioning phone but be unable to use it because you broke your hand/wrist/elbow/whatever. Ugh. I hope you change your priorities and favour your hand over your phone again next time. And one of the other commenters brought up something I had not thought of, but would be dangerous for your family and neighbours: you might not be able to knit. For … months … even over a year.

Yes, I have that hand-cranked radio … it’s all right. Try to get an easier to operate one … maybe one that cranks by a pedal or something. Maybe I should get my friend to add an attachment to my treadle sewing machine that can keep my xxx-cranked radio operating : -) I read a while ago about a better generator for third-world countries, it doesn’t require two hands and is very power-efficient. Those ones that you turn in a circle with one hand while holding the radio with the other hand 1) require two hands and 2) are not that power-efficient.

Rare Apple 1 is up for auction, and bids are topping $270,000 Re/code 20/08/2016 Ina Fried © Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns    A rare Apple 1 computer, possibly even a prototype, is up for auction on Charitybuzz; bids have already topped $270,000 with six days remaining. The computer differs from many of the production units in ways experts say make it likely the unit is one of the earliest of the Apple machines. “It’s the rookie card, for lack of a better word,” Apple expert Corey Cohen told Recode. The Apple 1 up for auction contains original manuals, a cassette tape with BASIC programming language and other accessories and documentation. Cohen said most of the early machines were hand finished by either Dan Kottke or Steve Jobs, and there’s a good chance this one was put together by Jobs. “Dan doesn’t remember assembling this one,” Cohen said, saying he talked to the early Apple employee about the machine up for auction. The BASIC cassette, which Kottke did create, contains the words “Good Luck” written in his handwriting. Cohen said the original owner of the unit is not known. The present owner bought it back in 2000 for $18,000, then the going rate for such machines. While it’s hard to say how much the machine will fetch now, other Apple 1s have garnered as much as $900,000. A portion of the proceeds from this auction are set to benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Arizona.

A few days ago, the Japanese automaker Nissan announced the arrival of its first vehicle integrated with Apple CarPlay technology. This new technology allows iPhone users to use their smartphone applications through the interface of the vehicle, so they can stay connected without neglecting their driving. Original Image: “Apple CarPlay” bysmoothgroover22, used underCC BY 2.0license, viaFlickr. You will be able to find this technology in the 2017 Maxima, making it the first model of the Japanese brand to adopt Apple CarPlay in Mexico. One advantage of this interface is that it allows users to access their contact list, receive and make calls, listen or send written or voice messages, navigate through the maps and even use third-party applications. Original Image: Still taken From“Apple CarPlay”, bywww.apple.com It is important to note that to use the Apple CarPlay you must have an iPhone; this new platform will be added to the already existing NissanConnect – currently featured in other models like the Nissan March, Altima, Sentra, Maxima, NP300 Frontier, NOTE, Versa – which allows drivers to navigate, make calls and use some applications like Google Places, Facebook and Twitter. According to David Marquez, senior manager of Vehicle Connected Services of Nissan, the integration of the Apple CarPlay to the Nissan Maxima opens a huge window of possibilities that are intended to facilitate the navigation and interaction of people with their smartphone without having to take their hands off the steering wheel, and keep attention on the road. Apple CarPlay is compatible with iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models, and is available in all versions of the 2017 Nissan Maxima.

Image Credit: Getty Images Does Frank Ocean's album 'Endless' contain a shady dig at Apple on "Device Control?" By Chris Riotta August 19, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Two days before Frank Ocean released his Endless livestream on Apple Music, Kanye West pulled out his (presumed) iPhone on July 30 to write a fury of tweets about the state of music streaming exclusivity, directing this Twitter storm at Apple's Tim Cook.  "Fuck all this dick swinging contest," he wrote. "Let the kids have the music."  It seems Frank Ocean made his own jab at the tech company with the release of Endless — albeit in a much more artistic, less crass fashion.  Before diving into its lush, high-minded ambient R&B, Ocean's album starts on an odd foot, name-dropping the name of very company sponsoring its live stream. The first track "Device Control," sounds like creepy, 1984-themed pro-Apple propaganda: "With this Apple appliance, you can capture live videos/ Still motion pictures shot at high frequency/ Blurring, blurring the line between still and motion." It later discusses the advanced features of similar Sony and Samsung devices, seemingly mocking the epic way all three companies try to brand their products. The album closes with an even longer version of the same track. The shade is disarming, poignant and all too real. Listening to "Device Control" like #FrankOcean #Endlesspic.twitter.com/dcF7FJXiq9 It's unclear what specific point Ocean is trying to make, but the robotic voice highlights a definite absurdity surrounding society's infatuation with today's tech giants and users' need for constant communication in the digital age. The song actually belongs to German photographer and producer Wolfgang Tillmans who created "Device Control" for his upcoming EP with the same title, set for release on Sept. 16, Complex reported. Endless samples a 20-second portion for its intro and the album ends with the full 7-minute, 30-second version, which Tillman was elated to hear when Ocean's album dropped. He gushed about it in a lengthy Instagram post, detailing how they connected. Pitchfork caught up with Tillman Friday and asked him to elaborate on the type of commentary the track is intending to make. "The absurdity of living life through constantly depicting and broadcasting it is so funny when looked at in the serious words of the phone manufacturers," Tillmans said. "As if any of it matters, and at the same time we are all doing it to varying degrees." If Ocean interprets the lyrics similarly, it amounts to an extremely self-aware moment on the album, and an extremely side-eyed look at Apple's and its mission to "think different." If nothing else it serves as a multilayered conversation-starter on what priorities this generation places on technology. It's definitely not the only conversation Ocean's fascinating Endless will start.  Source: Giphy Like us on Facebook: SHARE TWEET POST Chris Riotta Chris Riotta is a culture reporter at Mic, covering news, music and entertainment.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The enigmatic flow of Frank Ocean is finally here. Well, kinda. His 45-minute visual album Endless was released through Apple Music at midnight on Friday and was then linked from the album’s site.  Nearly three weeks since its launch, the live stream familiar to fans, called Endless, reappeared on Ocean’s website, boysdontcry.co, this time to a soundtrack of what appeared to be complete songs instead of the little musical interludes that were featured before. When the stream was reactivated on Thursday night, Apple quickly confirmed that a video version of the Endless stream would be available exclusively on Apple Music that night.  “ENDLESS” A film by Frank Ocean. Now on Apple Music. #ENDLESShttps://t.co/IKMm2PNsUH pic.twitter.com/nlLxXoQ296 — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 19, 2016 However, an Apple Music rep confirmed to Rolling Stone on Friday that Endless was a separate project from the long awaited sophomore album, which would potentially be released over the weekend and the endlessly elusive album was going to be renamed. This announcement comes after Malay, a music producer for Ocean’s Channel Orange, took to Reddit early this week to address the delayed released of the then-titled album, Boys Don’t Cry. “It’s about making sure that the perfect aesthetic for the situation has been reached, to do that, takes constant tweaking, trial, and error… That goes for any creative situation,” he wrote to users in his Ask Me Anything session.   Related ‘Art can’t be rushed’: Frank Ocean’s music producer, Malay, comments on album delay Oh come on, now. Frank Ocean still hasn’t released his new album, and it’s driving his fans bonkers Between August 1-4, a video stream of random woodworking and music clips teased fans into thinking a August 5 release date was in the cards, and was certainly egged on by a New York Times article that was tipped off by an unnamed source. With no new release from Ocean that Friday, the video stream stopped after Ocean appeared to be assembling a spiral staircase reaching to the roof of the warehouse. Perhaps the new album can be found up there? As the video version of Endless drops on the annoyingly exclusive and pricy Apple Music, Twitter pandemonium isn’t even worth noting anymore.  Fans are either going nuts over the new Ocean material or are still unabashedly airing their (Frankly) justified frustrations.

Eric Jhonsa Aug 19, 2016 6:01 PM EDT If the reviews Samsung received earlier this year for its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge flagship phones were positive, the ones received this week for its Galaxy Note 7 "phablet" have been even more so. That's welcome news for chipmakers with strong exposure to the Note 7, and it throws the gauntlet down for Apple  (AAPL) ahead of next month's expected iPhone 7 and 7-plus launches. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. Superlatives abound in Note 7 reviews. Business Insider declares the device to be "the most beautiful phone ever made." The Verge calls it "the best big phone," and The Wall Street Journal deems it the "best new Android phone." Many similar comments can be found by quickly scanning review headlines via Google. The Note 7's body and materials are receiving a lot of praise. The phone sports a curved OLED display (echoes of the S6 and S7 Edge) that's separated from a curved glass back panel by a thin metal frame, and yields a symmetrical body that's easy to hold. Regarding the display, The Verge calls the Note 7's 5.7-inch, 2K-resolution panel "pixel-dense, color-rich, and gorgeous to look at." Display software firm DisplayMate proclaims it "the best smartphone display," matching or breaking records in several categories. The camera, similar to that found in the S7 line and replete with large optical image stabilization, unsurprisingly got high marks. As did the performance of the phone's Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon 820 processor -- some international models use Samsung's Exynos 8890 processor, which is roughly as powerful -- and the phone's waterproofing. And outside of a couple of quibbles, reviewers liked the Note 7's revamped S Pen stylus, which provides improved sensitivity and can now let users quickly turn videos into GIFs.

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US AT&T, Apple, Google to work on ‘robocall’ crackdown Reuters | August 20, 2016 AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. WASHINGTON: More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the US government to crack down on “robocalls,” automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a “scourge.” AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the “Robocall Strike Force” that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a “Do Not Originate” list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. “This scourge must stop,” Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. “The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,” Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue “due in large part to industry inaction.” Stephenson emphasized “the breadth and complexity” of the problem. “This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,” Stephenson said. “Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.” The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. “We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,” Stephenson said. “We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.” Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had “preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.” Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. “We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet,” she said. “Nothing by itself is going to do it.” Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd (BB.TO), British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and US Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign “phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

However, the suppliers have rejected the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant’s request, citing that they could not risk their reasonable profits at this time. DigiTimes published a story earlier today to reveal what had transpired between Apple and its iPhone components suppliers. According to the supply chain monitor, Apple asked its Taiwanese suppliers — save for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Largan Precision — to make some adjustments on their quotes for the parts and components they supply for the iPhone 7 handsets.  Apple reportedly sought to have the price points lowered to as much as 20 percent, since mainland China-based parts suppliers offer the same products at lower price points. Unfortunately, Apple’s request was met with resistance by Taiwanese downstream parts suppliers Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and other companies under the Foxconn Group, citing that their reasonable profits will be compromised.  Related Stories Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 7 As iPhone 7 Launch Date Looms Why Apple Ditched ‘Store’ Moniker From Its Retail Outlets DigiTimes pointed out that Apple’s request did not make sense because Taiwan-manufactured and China-manufactured components are on different levels in terms of quality. Furthermore, it was also revealed that Apple asked for lower quotes though its order volumes dropped by 30 percent compared to last year’s volumes when it was manufacturing its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices. Meanwhile, Apple excluded TSMC and Largan Precision from its request because there are no alternative sources to the products they make. Apple Insider reported that TSMC is the manufacturer of the A10 chip, while Largan Precision is the supplier of the iPhone camera modules.  The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are slated to debut on Sept. 7. Both devices will not have headphone jacks, but they will come with fast charging capability and enhanced features. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to sport a dual-lens camera system.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Adelanto man arrested on suspicion of reckless driving and child endangerment Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 5:38 PM Aug 19, 2016 at 5:38 PM By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A 43-year-old man was arrested Thursday evening on suspicion of reckless driving and child endangerment, officials said. At approximately 4:29 p.m., Deputy Verral from the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station was in the area of State 18 Highway and Rancherias Road when he observed Chester Farris, 43, of Adelanto, driving a black motorcycle at speeds over 100 miles per hour. Additional deputies and Sheriff’s Aviation responded to the area and a traffic stop was attempted, but Farris continued driving at a high rate of speed, officials said. Farris failed to stop for red lights, violated other traffic laws and entered a residential neighborhood where a pursuit was not initiated for the safety of the public, according to officials. Deputies located Farris traveling north on Apple Valley Road later as he failed to stop for a red light and did not yield to children in the crosswalk. He then traveled west on Hwy 18 from Apple Valley Road, officials said. Shortly after, Farris pulled into the KOA Campground off of Stoddard Wells Road just north of Hwy 18, where deputies arrived on scene and took him into custody. Farris was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment and failure to yield and his motorcycle was impounded due to his arrest and reckless operation, officials said. Farris has a bail of $100,000 and is scheduled to appear in court Monday afternoon at 12:30 p.m., court records show.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley animal shelter takes in hundreds Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 4:45 PM Aug 19, 2016 at 4:55 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Amid evacuation orders issued to some 82,000 residents affected by the still-raging Bluecut Fire, staff and volunteers at the town’s animal shelter helped keep nearly 450 displaced animals out of harm’s way. Within 48 hours of the start of the fire in the Cajon Pass, which had scorched 37,002 acres as of noon Friday, the Apple Valley Municipal Animal Shelter became an around-the-clock hub of security and generosity, as locals and people as far away as Orange County answered the call for donations of food, bowls, cat litter and cleaning supplies. Animal Services Director Gina Whiteside said the shelter’s primary purpose is to care for the community’s animals, which she described as the most vulnerable of residents. “We’ve taken in 302 dogs, 111 cats and 25 other animals such as lizards and guinea pigs that were evacuated due to the fire,” Whiteside said. “These displaced pets will be loved and cared for until they are reunited with their families.” Staff and volunteers worked tirelessly to construct emergency holding pens in the staff parking lot and along the interior courtyard of the shelter to accommodate the influx of animals. Teams are now working in shifts to feed and water all of the animals, sanitize surfaces, change litter boxes and walk dogs. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press on Friday that one dog taken in by the shelter ran from a burning home in the Phelan area and into the arms of Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mike Mohler. The family that owns the dog was separated from the animal when they were evacuated from the home, according to a CBS LA report. The dog was treated for minor burns and is being cared for at AVAS, Martin said. “We don’t have a name on the dog, but he is here,” Martin said, adding that the shelter has only addresses for a large number of the evacuated animals. “We need to start putting owners’ names to the animals so that we know who to give them to when it's time to send them home.” Martin also addressed a Facebook post that led some to fear for the safety of animals that were in the shelter’s care prior to the the displaced animals being taken in. The post called for fosters to take in animals or the shelter would have no choice but to euthanize, according to Martin. “We contacted that poster,” Martin said. “She eventually took the post down and the town responded to a number of comments related to the post.” In addition, fellow Town spokeswoman Charlene Engeron said AVAS’ goal is to provide love, attention, food and water to all the animals in the shelter’s care. “No animals of any kind are being euthanized to make room for the evacuated pets,” Engeron said. Whiteside added that the community is encouraged to adopt animals during normal business hours to give the shelter more space for evacuated animals. The shelter is accepting monetary donations only for the continued care of the animals at this time. Financial contributions can be made in person, or by credit card by phone at 760-240-7000 ext. 7555, or via PayPal at animalservices@applevalley.org. Additionally, adult volunteers will be needed for the next week or longer, especially for the late shift from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m, according to the town. Contact 760-240-7000 ext. 7555 to offer availability. The same number may be used by owners looking to reunite with pets that were displaced by the fire. The shelter will be open this weekend from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 20 August 2016 ‘i’ on Globetronics by daniel khoo Slowdown: The drop in Globetronics’ performance year-to-date was due to declining smartphone sales and the volatile ringgit. — Reuters Can iPhone 7 help lift the earnings of the Apple contractor? Globetronics Technology Bhd could be in focus in the coming weeks as the new iPhone 7 launch date comes closer in early September. The company, which is a contractor in the Apple supply chain, saw a strong sell-down in its shares at the end of April this year due to a deterioration in its quarterly results. The drop in its performance year-to-date was due to declining smartphone sales and the volatile ringgit, Globetronics said then. Smartphone sales constituted some 50% of Globetronics sales in the financial year 2015. Fortunes could turn for the company if iPhone 7 sales eventually exceed the low sales expectations for the iPhone 7. “We are stepping closer to the launch date with very low expectations for sales on the new iPhone 7 judging from the performance of Apple and suppliers such as Globetronics shares,” an analyst with a local research house says. “But it could surprise if consumers, especially users of the iPhone 6, feel it is time to upgrade and decide to change their phones. “The iPhone 7 signifies the next generation update from the 6 and could have key visible difference especially to the exterior of the product, although market expectations are quite to the contrary now,” he says. The iPhone 7 will reportedly have slight exterior changes and will do away completely with the earphone jack to enable the phone to enable it to be much slimmer than what it is today, and this may attract a new group of buyers. However, some involved in the industry also indicate that the next major upgrade to features of the iPhone would only come next year and not this year as earlier anticipated with the iPhone 7. Industry insiders also note that the key issue here hindering stronger growth in the industry is that software requirements of smart devices have not actually caught up with the strong advancements in the technology or hardware of smart devices. “Once we see a new revolutionary upgrade in software operating system ability probably such as smart devices being able to display say for example 3-Dimensional images or hologram that will require more hardware to support then only will we see real demand for more advanced hardware in the smartphones going up,” an industry observer says. “Otherwise it will just be an improved version of what is already on the market and there are many alternatives with the numerous Chinese brands on the market such as Xiaomi or Huawei. “Probably the next break will come with the widespread adoption of 5G,” the observer adds. For Globetronics, the company also said then that it expects to see a gradual recovery in the business and expects some product loading towards the second half of this year. “The group will continue to focus on escalating up the value chain and riding on the research and development initiatives in new products design and development with our key customer. “This initiative is expected to result in the manufacturing of new products in the second half of the financial year,” the company says in its results. Analysts who are covering the stock are mostly either neutral or bearish on Globetronics with an average 12-months target price of RM3.29. After stripping out the unrealised gain on foreign exchange amounting to RM1mil, the company’s second quarter earnings saw a decrease of 66.2% year-on-year on lower volume loading from some of its key customers. MIDF Research, in a report after Globetronics results were announced in July, says that it is perturbed with the soft volume loading of Globetronics’ products and expects this could possibly prolong in the second half of the year. “This will adversely impact the group full year FY16 earnings outlook. “Moreover, we are sceptical on the possibility of volume ramp up for the new sensors components in early third quarter,” MIDF Research says. The research house further adds that the mass production of the new sensors components can only be seen towards the end of the first half in 2017 to cater for smartphone launches next year and maintained its neutral call on the stock with a lowered target price of RM3.07 from RM4.07 previously. Meanwhile, Affin Hwang Capital Research says in their report that its “hold” rating on the stock is pending the mass introduction and rollout of Globetronics’ new sensor. “There could be downside risk to earnings should this fail to materialise. “Risks that Globe’s proximity sensors reach their end-of-life in the production cycle or the company’s immediate Swiss customer’s products being eliminated from future products or Globetronics being replaced as a contractor, are also possible,” Affin Hwang Capital says.

The company needs to do that to remain competitive with Google and Microsoft. But, over and above that, the beneficial side effects will have even deeper implications for Apple as a company and its future. Back when Apple was selling iPods by the tens of millions, university and national laboratory computer scientists were building supercomputers to solve some very special problems. And learning, leaps and bounds. Back when Apple launched the iPhone, a whole other world of computer scientist were were working on artificial intelligence. Yet Apple’s success in the consumer market was unparalleled, and we accepted that as Apple’s forte. A company flows with the technical timeline that it’s in and does the very best it can. Apple did wonderfully. Times have changed dramatically. The iPhone has gone from a fairly limited handheld internet access device, music player and telephone to a remarkable device that can recognize faces and objects as well answer our questions via Siri. Advances in battery powered 64-bit hardware have allowed the iPhone to flourish in ways that, perhaps, the original designers never envisioned. Turi’s website paints a dazzling picture of what they’ve been up to, and yet it simply reflects what the rest of the AI world has been up to for the last decade. Turi Distributed is a server product that allows distributed execution of machine learning jobs on a cluster of machines. Jobs can include distributed training of machine learning models, parallel model scoring & predictions, distributed hyperparameter tuning, model ensembling, and evaluation tasks. In addition, the use cases for Turi technology includes a recommendation engine, fraud detection, analysis of customer needs, and analysis of human sentiments. All this is where the technical action will be for the foreseeable future. Building the Infrastructure Coincidentally, Apple has laid the foundation for its use of vast computing resources, supercomputers and compute clusters, with its own data centers. Apple knows how to build data centers that are reliable and redundant. The company knows how to cool and maintain a giant farm of servers. It knows how to interface those data farms to the Internet. Augmenting those giant data centers with tools developed by a company like Turi, with Turi’s expertise, shouldn’t be a hard thing to do. What’s essential now, and I think Tim Cook has the temperament for this, is to create a more open and academic interface to the AI experts that are being absorbed into the company. While the specific details of some initiatives need to be properly kept secret, the evolution of machine intelligence will force Apple executives to get more involved themselves. And their new, in-house experts, accustomed to the affairs, conferences and publications of the academic world will have to retain those connections. This will be good for Apple. Apple in the Long Term Apple is advancing from a company that focused, almost to exclusion, on stylish, quality, easy-to-use consumer electronics. However, going forward, Apple will necessarily become more involved in the integration of machine intelligence with its customers’ lives. This entails the rapid maturation of Siri, autonomous vehicles, family service robots, augmented reality, the merger of personal health monitoring and personal electronics, home automation, and who knows what else. It may also suggest that Apple’s vision for home products may morph. Where we once had desktop Macs for browsing and email, and miniature Apple TVs, we may soon see Hal 9000-like servers with local AI agents that can manage a modern household. Our displays for TV and internet will simply be windows into the workings of such a powerful supercomputer—a cubic-foot device in a closet. The purchase of Turi is a gateway to this future of Apple, soon to be a company we would hardly have recognized a decade ago. It’s going to be a glorious ride.

We know Apple’s servers don’t run macOS server, so the synergies are not quite as strong as they might be. But a lot could be done on the backend to improve client apps. We shall see.

Humanity is not in good shape, our new tech overlords (including Apple) are not helping. Apple used to solve problems, no more; they follow rather than lead. Technology now is just western capitalism at its absolute worst, and I don’t know what to say. We live in the worst possible version of our future our science fiction progenitors envisioned.

The timing may seem to be rushed since the sixth beta started rolling out a couple of days ago, but this is already expected since the launch date of the iPhone 7 is drawing near. Since announcing iOS 10 at the 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference more than two months ago, the Cupertino-headquartered tech company has been releasing beta versions of the upcoming mobile OS for testing.  While the speedy release of the iOS 10 beta 7 may appear to suggest that Apple is rushing iOS 10 for its upcoming iPhones, Apple Insider claims that this is just an indication that the company may have found a “show-stopping bug” in the the sixth beta, so it quickly fixed the issue and released a newer beta.  The four-day gap between iOS 10 beta 6 and iOS 10 beta 7 is not so typical of Apple because the company usually releases a new beta update weeks after the previous one is launhced. Plus, new beta versions are usually released on a Monday or Tuesday and not on a Friday. Related Stories Optical Image Stabilization Confirmed For 4.7-Inch iPhone 7? Meanwhile, it isn’t clear yet what the iOS 10 beta 7 includes, but MacRumors stated that the update may come with critical bug fixes.  For developers and beta testers who are enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, they may now download iOS 10 beta 7 directly via Apple’s Developer Center. The beta software is also available as an over-the-air download.  Based on previews betas, the iOS 10 is going to come with big improvements and new features. It is said to put 3D Touch support on the lock screen and add a new widgets screen to the UI. The Messages app has been improved with the addition of background animations, Digital Touch, predictive emoji, Tapback replies and many more.  Apple's iOS 10 is scheduled to launch this fall, specially on the same day that the next-generation iPhone is introduced to the market.  Based on earlier leaks, the iPhone 7 is set to debut on Sept. 7.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Search for: Welcome Philosophy Services What Sets Us Apart Client Letters Blog Contact Us Leading Tech Companies All Chasing The Same “Next Big Things” August 16, 2016 10:23 AM | Leave a Comment | Chad Brand I miss the old days of tech investing. Times were simpler. Companies were more focused. There were one or two companies that tended to be dominant within a certain fragment of the industry. Google was search and online advertising. Amazon was e-commerce. Intel was chips. eBay was marketplace. Microsoft was operating systems and productivity software. Cisco was networking. Apple was high-end devices. Facebook was social networking. Netflix was movies. You get the picture. Oh how times have changed. The tech landscape now has led us down a different path. Each of these companies has been extremely successful in conquering their home turf. They are all wildly profitable and have more money than they know what to do with. So they repurchase shares and pay dividends and buy startups to add talent and new technology. And after they do all of that they still have billions of dollars extra sitting around. What to do? It appears the answer now is to become a tech conglomerate. Heck, if we took over one area of the marketplace, why not shoot for the stars? Why not be everything to everybody? So now when we talk about the leading tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) the future looks far less predictable. In the old world Tesla would be the de facto electric self-driving car play. But Google is building cars. So is Apple. In the old world Oculus would have been the virtual/augmented reality play. But in the new world Facebook acquires them and then Microsoft and Apple and Google all start working on the same thing. In the old world Netflix would be the benchmark for streaming video. Nobody would argue that households looking to get rid of their $100/month cable bills would substitute them with a half dozen individual services that cost $10-$20 per month. The expensive cable bundle is no worse than a bundle of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube Red, and CBS All Access. And as if there are not enough competitors vying for your TV dollars, it was recently reported that Apple has decided it has identified the next big thing; producing original TV content. Are you kidding me? I understand that self-driving cars and streaming over-the-top video and virtual reality could all very well be huge markets over the long term. But everyone can’t be a winner. Do you really think GM and Ford lack the ability to produce self-driving, electric cars? Are the Big Three auto makers going to be replaced by Apple, Google, and Tesla a decade from now? Are we really going to cancel our Comcast service and pay the same amount of money for less content by buying subscriptions to 6 or 8 streaming services? The leading tech companies got to where they are today by being laser-focused on creating or improving upon one big tech trend. Becoming indispensable in that arena has made them billions of dollars and created a ton of shareholder wealth. They did not win out after a long, brutal battle with the other tech titans at the time. The biggest risk to Apple, for example, is that the innovation they are focused on revolves solely around virtual reality, electric cars, and streaming TV and movies. That is not how Apple became Apple. And it is not the secret for them to stay at the top. The same goes for Google and Microsoft and Facebook. As long as these companies are battling against each other, as opposed to paving their own way to the future, I am afraid that those of us hoping for the next big thing to come out of the mega tech stalwarts may be disappointed. To truly develop a market-leading position you have to try something new and do so long before everyone else. Nobody is likely to catch Amazon in the public cloud computing space (although Google and Microsoft are trying, of course). They are years ahead because they saw the trend before anyone else and went all-in to the number one. Enjoy this post?

Under new management this year, the Apple has been rebranded for its 34th anniversary, but the series of races offered remains the same. Highlighting the weekend on Sunday morning are the Olympic distance races, which will double as the B.C. Provincial Championships. The sprint distance event and the paratriathlete race will also be staged on Sunday. Saturday's events include the youth and junior races along with the Super Sprint, also known as the Try-a-Tri for newcomers to the sport. After 15 years as president, Richard Montgomery stepped down after the 2015 race, making way for the new management team of James Young, Malindi Elmore and Graham Hood. All three are immersed in the sport of triathlon, whether it's competing, coaching or running events. Spouses Elmore and Hood are also former Olympians. While the roster of races remains in tact, athletes and spectators will see a few changes surrounding the event. "It'll be more of an event-style weekend," said Jessica Samuels, who is responsible for media relations for the 2016 Apple. "There'll be more sections for spectators, we'll have food truck vendors, a beer garden…the idea is to give it more of an expo feeling. "There's an effort to try and incorporate the community into this heritage event."

The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking. ‘WATCHING’ AROUND The company plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking While the company shipped 1.6 million watches from April to June, that was less than half as many as during the same period in 2015 Apple had been in talks this year with mobile phone carriers in the US and Europe to add cellular connectivity to the watch The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren't public. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple shipped its first watch in April 2015, hoping for a new blockbuster product amid slowing iPhone sales, which contribute almost 60 per cent of revenue. While the company shipped 1.6 million watches from April to June, that was less than half as many as during the same period in 2015, according to IDC. With investors expecting a revenue decline this fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is banking on a slew of new gadgets, including a new iPhone with a faster chip and improved cameras, and a slimmer MacBook Pro laptop, to reignite growth in 2017. Ever since its inception, network carriers have been urging Apple to release a version of the watch that can connect to data networks independent of the iPhone, and the Cupertino, California-based company had been working to untether it from the handset, one of the people said. As it is now the watch must be synced with an iPhone to download most types of content and consistently track location. Apple had been in talks this year with mobile phone carriers in the US and Europe to add cellular connectivity to the watch, according to people familiar with the talks. A cellular chip would have theoretically allowed the product to download sports score alerts, e-mail and mapping information while out of an iPhone's reach. During the discussions, Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation, according to the people. Apple warned that, even on an aggressive schedule, the earliest possible shipment time-frame for cellular models would have been this December, one of the people said. The source of the delay is that current cellular chips consume too much battery life, reducing the product's effectiveness and limiting user appeal, according to three of the people. Apple has begun studying lower-power cellular data chips for future smartwatch generations. Even without cellular connectivity, Apple still anticipates shipping models of the watch that can more precisely determine a user's location by way of GPS chips that communicate with satellites. This technology would allow the device to track running and walking distances more precisely and improve the accuracy of data submitted to health tracking applications, two of the people said. The GPS would also make navigation on the watch more accurate, the people said. Apple said in June that it's adding health features, such as a new app to track breathing, and watch faces with integrated activity statistics, to the device's software this fall. The update also launches apps more quickly, allows users to more easily move between different watch faces, and adds a new swipe-up menu to access battery and audio controls. While the plan for this year had been to at least partially untether the watch from the iPhone, Apple's ultimate goal is to eliminate any need to connect the two devices, according to a person familiar with the company's strategy. That ambition is currently stymied by technological limitations.

Apple hits roadblocks in cutting watch ties to iPhone The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking Apple has hit roadblocks in making major changes that would connect its watch to cellular networks and make it less dependent on the iPhone, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking. ‘WATCHING’ AROUND The company plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking While the company shipped 1.6 million watches from April to June, that was less than half as many as during the same period in 2015 Apple had been in talks this year with mobile phone carriers in the US and Europe to add cellular connectivity to the watch The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren't public. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple shipped its first watch in April 2015, hoping for a new blockbuster product amid slowing iPhone sales, which contribute almost 60 per cent of revenue. While the company shipped 1.6 million watches from April to June, that was less than half as many as during the same period in 2015, according to IDC. With investors expecting a revenue decline this fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is banking on a slew of new gadgets, including a new iPhone with a faster chip and improved cameras, and a slimmer MacBook Pro laptop, to reignite growth in 2017. Ever since its inception, network carriers have been urging Apple to release a version of the watch that can connect to data networks independent of the iPhone, and the Cupertino, California-based company had been working to untether it from the handset, one of the people said. As it is now the watch must be synced with an iPhone to download most types of content and consistently track location. Apple had been in talks this year with mobile phone carriers in the US and Europe to add cellular connectivity to the watch, according to people familiar with the talks. A cellular chip would have theoretically allowed the product to download sports score alerts, e-mail and mapping information while out of an iPhone's reach. During the discussions, Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation, according to the people. Apple warned that, even on an aggressive schedule, the earliest possible shipment time-frame for cellular models would have been this December, one of the people said. The source of the delay is that current cellular chips consume too much battery life, reducing the product's effectiveness and limiting user appeal, according to three of the people. Apple has begun studying lower-power cellular data chips for future smartwatch generations. Even without cellular connectivity, Apple still anticipates shipping models of the watch that can more precisely determine a user's location by way of GPS chips that communicate with satellites. This technology would allow the device to track running and walking distances more precisely and improve the accuracy of data submitted to health tracking applications, two of the people said. The GPS would also make navigation on the watch more accurate, the people said. Apple said in June that it's adding health features, such as a new app to track breathing, and watch faces with integrated activity statistics, to the device's software this fall. The update also launches apps more quickly, allows users to more easily move between different watch faces, and adds a new swipe-up menu to access battery and audio controls. While the plan for this year had been to at least partially untether the watch from the iPhone, Apple's ultimate goal is to eliminate any need to connect the two devices, according to a person familiar with the company's strategy. That ambition is currently stymied by technological limitations.

He would be right, the iPhone 7 is, but it is not the leap of technological advancement that many of the fanboys would have liked or hoped for. Indeed, the iPhone 7 is more the refinement of a phone that is been nine years in the making. But even if Apple is playing it safe, safe is a great place to be. Here's why the iPhone still cuts it in today's market. Apple iPhone 7 review: Similar design with some tweaks The new iPhone might come in a similarly designed chassis to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models, with the same 4.7-inch screen, but it looks noticeably different thanks to the more subdued antenna lines. Oh, and there are two new finishes - glossy "Jet Black" and matte "Black" - which join the gold, rose gold and silver colour options also available. We have the glossy black model on review, which is a fingerprint-magnet of a model - reminiscent of the iPhone 3G. The deep black colour hides the newly designed antenna incredibly well, while the new finish also makes the transition from metal to glass almost impossible to see. It is "proper shiny". In contrast, the new "regular" black model is more the stealthy option. The finish, which replaces the "Space Gray" option of the previous 6S range, is less likely to be prone to smudges and scratches (those old enough will remember that issue made the iPhone 3G look rather tatty by end of its first year), and it is a much blunter finish compared to the whimsical rose gold and gold options. It is on those models that the new antenna design is more apparent - it now cuts around the top edge of the phone rather than intersecting top and bottom. New finishes aren't the only design changes. The headphones socket has been dumped (yep, no 3.5mm jack here) and replaced with a speaker grille, while the physical Home button has also been changed from a solid state one to one that doesn't move. Apple iPhone 7 review: No headphone socket At the iPhone 7 launch hysteria quickly settled in that Apple had lost the headphone jack and that it would be the end of the world as we know it. Turns out it wasn't, and it makes barely a jot of a difference. Pocket-lint In the iPhone 7's box you get a set of in-ear headphones that connect via the phone's Lightning port instead. If these aren't for you then there are so many brilliant wireless headphones on the market. But we realise that, for some, that might mean the prospect of buying new cans all over again, and sucking up the expense, or using the included adaptor in the box to convert Lightning to 3.5mm. READ: Best Bluetooth headphones 2016: 10 of the best on- and over-ear cans for wireless listening During our testing we've been using the rather controversial-looking but quick-pairing AirPods (which aren't included in the box, they're £159 extra) and a range of other headphones. All work seamlessly. Apple iPhone 7 review: New Home button The iPhone 7's Home button is the part on the phone you probably interact with the most, and upon hearing Apple was ditching the physical "click" element and replacing it with the same technology found in the Apple Watch and MacBook trackpad, we were worried.  In practice, though, it works amazingly well. Like the MacBook trackpad that uses the same technology, you get the feeling that the button is moving when "pressed" - without anything physically moving. Pocket-lint Tap the Home button, and the so-called Taptic Engine inside the phone makes it vibrate gently - making you believe that the button is moving when in reality it isn't. Removing the physical element means there are less parts and less things to "stick". It's all-round neater. The Home button offers three sensitivity settings to make it as responsive as you prefer. It still allows you to flawlessly use it for double-tapping or Touch ID fingerprint recognition. Although Apple says that Touch ID hasn't been upgraded, it feels a lot more responsive to our touch in the iPhone 7 - even with sweaty hands after a run. Once you try it, you'll wonder why Apple hadn't changed the Home button earlier. Apple iPhone 7 review: Water-resistance Apple has made the iPhone 7 water-resistant to a rating of IP67 - meaning it can be immersed in a metre of water for around 30-minutes without drowning. Pocket-lint Yep, dropping your phone down the toilet or in the swimming pool isn't going to be the major headache it once was. We nervously ran ours under the tap and it continued to work just fine. It's not going to allow you to take pictures under water in a pool, because the screen won't necessarily operate properly, but it should protect you from any accidental dunks. Apple iPhone 7 review: Taptic Engine The same Taptic Engine as used to convince you the Home button is physically moving is also used to greater affect across the new iOS 10 user interface. Pocket-lint Playing Codemaster's F1 2016 game, for example, it adds vibrational nuances when crashing into the barriers or going over bumps. Likewise, the rather dull Zombie Gunship showcases the technology too. In both cases it's as if the whole phone is vibrating rather than just a part of it. "Feeling your phone" is going to be a thing now. Apple iPhone 7 review: Stereo sound The space where the headphone socket was in the iPhone 6S is now replaced with a speaker in the iPhone 7, meaning the new phone offers stereo sound from the two speakers at the bottom. There's an extra speaker at the top, too. Pocket-lint The audio enhancements certainly make a difference: the iPhone 7 produces a richer sound that the iPhone 6S. It's not as good as the speaker setup on the iPad Pro, nor will it be loud enough to fill the room with music, but it's ideal for watching a YouTube video or Facebook Live stream around the house (if you're not plugged into the Lightning port or making the most of wireless). Apple iPhone 7 review: Upgraded cameras  The iPhone 7 has a camera update on both the front and back. However, it misses out on the dual-camera offering and wide-angle lens of the iPhone 7 Plus. READ: Apple iPhone 7 Plus dual camera tech explained Pocket-lint Instead the iPhone 7 offers a new 12-megapixel sensor and an improved lens, plus an improved 7-megapixel front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies. Apple has also added a new flash for better skin tones and plenty of processes in-camera to make sure your photos zing. The camera protrudes out the back of the iPhone 7, just as it has before, and sports a more accentuated circular design - meaning your old cases are unlikely to fit. That's something else for the shopping list. The protrusion is visible, but it's not enough to warrant any concerns and certainly not enough to make the phone wobble when laid on a desk or table. Although you don't get the dual lens technology, the iPhone 7's camera isn't to be sniffed at. It's very good in all situations and noticeably better than the already very good camera on the iPhone 6S. At a team meeting we snapped some side-by-side comparisons to get a closer look and the new camera produced sharper-looking results in all cases. Pocket-lint That's partly thanks to the new f/1.8 aperture lens and the addition of optical image stabilisation (previously OIS was only available on the 6S Plus), but we also suspect a lot of the image processing Apple is able to do with the new more powerful processor on board. The colour in all our test shots looks just natural; the camera auto-detects and handles exposures for different situations well (back-lighting, neon strips, faces, etc); there's detail in the close-up shots we've snapped; and that f/1.8 aperture doesn't overdo things - so further-away subjects remain crisp, while close-up subjects get that lovely blurred background effect. However, we can still see grain in some areas (we're talking when zoomed to 100 per cent) and we've found that images look better on the phone at smaller scale than they do on a larger computer monitor. Some processing does smear away some detail, too, such as the thread in a shirt, as one example. Pocket-lint For those really wanting to take things to the next level, you can now shoot raw, but Apple has held back from adding that capability to its own Camera app, so you'll need a third-party app to get access to that feature. Unlike previous years, there aren't any new camera modes to play with the iPhone 7, and it won't be getting the Portrait mode that the iPhone 7 Plus will be getting later in the year. Apple iPhone 7 review: Speed and performance A new iPhone means upgraded speed. The iPhone 7 gets the new Apple A10 Fusion processor that promises to increase the power and performance over previous models. Pocket-lint Ultimately, it means your phone will be able to load things faster, process things faster, and generally not be in any way sluggish. That's exactly what we've found in our testing to date: games load almost instantly and graphics are rich. The screen - which is the same 4.7-inch size and 1334 x 750 resolution as the iPhone 6S - also feels a lot brighter (it's 25 per cent brighter and comes with a greater colour gamut according to Apple). It's not the Tru Display technology found on the iPad Pro 9.7, though, so no ultra-high resolution to be found here still - but that ought to help battery life. Apple iPhone 7 review: Battery life Apple made a fairly big song and dance over how the battery life had improved for the iPhone 7 following efficiencies in processor and software performance. But we've not really seen those in our tests. After the initial few days using the iPhone 7 and trying to catch-up (the Photos app blasted our battery trying to work out what to do with the 15,000 images we've taken over the years) and we've still not seen the huge improvements promised. Pocket-lint The iPhone 7's battery still lasts a whole day, but it soon drains away - especially if you use social networking or chat apps. A full day in London when using GPS, camera, Slack, Twitter, Facebook, and Mail meant that 13-hours in, by 6pm, we had around 20 per cent battery left. For us that's not improved over our iPhone 6S experience. As always, how you use your phone will determine how long the battery lasts. Play Pokemon Go and you probably won't make it past breakfast, let alone dinner. Apple iPhone 7 review: iOS 10 The new iPhone comes with the latest operating system, iOS 10, as standard. Like the hardware refinements, this new software experience is a subtle change over what users will have seen in iOS 9. iOS 10 comes with a number of new features like a dedicated Home app to allow you to control and manage your HomeKit accessories, a much more advanced Messages app that bring things like apps and stickers, and Widgets to the lock screen so you can quickly grab information snippets from your favourite apps (if they are supported). READ: Apple iOS 10 review: Bringing more complexity and features to your iPhone and iPad The notion that iOS is a simple operating system is now a long and distant memory, given the complexity it opens up for power users. In iOS 10 Apple has focused on layering the experience with even more complexity and depth than ever before. In the same breath, if you're not a phone geek it's still a breeze to use. Verdict The iPhone 7 is not the overhaul that Apple usually presents us with every two years, but there is enough here to keep those upgrading from the iPhone 6 happy. At first glance, however, it's perhaps not the phone to draw in iPhone 6S fans who might be upset that their phone is now old and needs to be replaced - for the iPhone 7 could almost be seen as an "S" version of the iPhone 6S. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack may remain briefly controversial, while the odd-looking AirPods (£159) have also raised some eyebrows. But this biggest point of change isn't really going to impact most users as much as it might sound. Ultimately it's the iPhone 7's other, more subtle changes - the new Home button and glossy/matte black finishes with better hidden antennas - that add to the refinement, without tearing up the rule book and starting again. It's also these technologies that continue to ensure the iPhone 7 is a state-of-the-art smartphone. So Tim Cook is right: the iPhone 7 is the company's best iPhone yet. It's just that the best is only slighter better than what we've already had for the past year.

Apple Music hide caption toggle caption Apple Music A still from Frank Ocean's Endless visual album. Apple Music The Record After Building Anticipation, Frank Ocean Releases 'Endless' The wait for a new Frank Ocean album is over — sort of. Late Thursday night, the reclusive singer unveiled Endless, a starkly minimal multimedia project that does indeed feature new music, but leaves many other questions unanswered. With listeners everywhere processing Ocean's latest creation in real time, we asked our NPR Music's Jason King and Ann Powers to share their first impressions. Jason fired the first volley: Hear his chat with All Things Considered at the audio link, and read on for his discussion with Ann. Jason King: Discombobulation — to be confused, or upset, or disconcerted, or pained, or to feel like you've come apart, that you're all over the place — is the word that randomly popped into my mind this morning. Feeling discombobulated is the way many of us live these days, given the crushing weight that our overdeveloped media and war industrial complexes seem to impose upon us; living in the era of Trump swagger and Syrian warfare and Ryan Lochte falsehoods and music you want to hear but can't because it's locked behind a streaming-service paywall feels jarring more often than not. In some ways, discombobulation has become the new normal; even the randomness of feeling out of sorts can work like perfect serendipity, if you look at it from another perspective. Article continues after sponsorship Discombobulation is also a word that suits the unconventional, messy rollout of two of this year's most highly influential albums: Kanye West's The Life of Pablo and Rihanna's Anti. We can now add Frank Ocean's to the list of pop releases surrounded by misinformation and controlled by someone disinterested in getting with the program. Since going largely off-the-radar after his watershed 2012 studio debut Channel Orange, and teasing fans in the interim with numerous false starts and canceled deadlines, Ocean's new project, called Endless, finally dropped today. What's frustrating is that we haven't been given enough information to know if Endless is just a teaser for a more pop-oriented album that's rumored to be coming or if this is it. Indeed, Endless provokes a crisis of legibility — how to effectively read its value and meaning given the deliberate withholding of information that would help contextualize it. But context may be overrated these days. The Record What We Talk About When We Talk About 'TLOP' The Record Anti-Everything: The Culture Of Resistance Behind Rihanna's Latest Album Endless is billed as a visual album, meaning there are 18 tracks you listen to as you watch a 45-minute video (directed, executive produced and creatively directed by Ocean himself) in which the singer engages in some sort of unexplained power-tools construction project. If I were feeling especially generous I'd say the black-and-white video is wonderfully Warhol-esque in its pursuit of anti-narrative, but I can't help think that it's really painfully slow, visually inert and much less stimulating than Beyoncé's highly considered Lemonade. Far more compelling is Frank Ocean's new music itself, featuring buzzy-hip collaborators like Jazmine Sullivan, Sampha and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. The music and sonics of Endless are hydra-like, featuring a surfeit of creative ideas: The whole affair can be dark, moody, drifty, ambient, textured, druggy, somnambulant, melancholic, Eno-ghostly, synthy and depressive. It can be melodically rich, even if its lethargic sameness can sometimes be snoozy. But the ADD way that Endless' songs and interludes change, move, shift and blend and bleed into each other, as Frank himself moves between languorous singing and draggy rapping, makes the hyperactive scrawl aesthetic Dev Hynes / Blood Orange recently explored on this year's Freetown Sound album seem comparatively straight ahead and conventional. Standout lyrics like "How come the ecstasy always depresses me?" on Arca-assisted interlude "Mine" and Ocean's ranty, freestyle-type delivery on "U-N-I-T-Y" are among the album's most artistically impressive moments. Still, after the first few listens, I'm not particularly sure what Endless adds up to or if it's even supposed to gel at all. It's like having only one corner section of a jigsaw puzzle — it just so happens to be a musically gorgeous one. Keeping fans in the dark and teasing them only with eccentric, confounding parts of a larger whole is certainly one way to hijack their short-span attention. And if it's too early for my definitive critique of a 45-minute audio-visual project that probably needs more time to wash over me, props to Frank Ocean for releasing the most bizarre and artsy example of corporate-event pop ever. We all know that Ocean has collaborated with Apple as exclusive distributor of the album (at least for now), and it's more than a bit strange that he chooses to close the album with "Device Control," a Euro-disco-esque track featuring Wolfgang Tillmans chatting about a range of smartphones including ones made by Apple, Sony and Samsung. Given that it's the last track, the idea of Frank giving so much shine to Apple's competitors on an Apple-distributed project is either a curious F-you to the hand that's just fed him, or it's one blithely WTF moment in an album that seems to be full of them. So double props to Frank for introducing a potentially discombobulating, disruptive moment to the usually unassailable Apple. Ann, I'd be curious to know your initial impressions of the album. Ann Powers: Jason, Last night, when Frank Ocean's livestream workshop came back to life after sitting dormant for two weeks and it became clear he was building a stairway to sudden-release heaven, I sat listening to the muffled music coming from his speakers in the background and started to think about other staircases: ones that lead nowhere, like those in the Winchester Mystery House, a famous haunted California manse where carpenters worked around the clock to stave off the demons of its mistress. That house has doors that open to walls, weird turrets and twisted hallways, and a Séance Room that only those who understand its mazes can reach. Endless is the sonic equivalent of that structure. Even after several listens to the actual album, I feel like this music is still being constructed. Ocean welds these tracks together in spiral patterns; the video asks us to observe this process of creation, to slow down and ponder how this carpenter builds along the lines of his story pole. As someone with a 2016-appropriate short attention span, I have always found such process-oriented music somewhat difficult to absorb. But I welcome Ocean's challenge that we do so. Endless does fit in with the year's other "discombobulated" releases, especially Rihanna's, which has a similarly labyrinthine structure and depressive ambiance. The associations it immediately brings to mind, however, come from the art world. Ocean made his aspirations toward gallery life explicit by enlisting sculptor Tom Sachs as a collaborator, recreating his Jamaican-style sound system simulacrum and getting his advice on those stairs. Making his fans live with that off-and-on live stream, where he only tinkered for so long, did both challenge the norms of corporate product and make gentle fun of Apple's own irritating roll-out delays (come on, I really need a new Macbook Pro). But it also was part of the longstanding tradition of endurance-oriented performance art, which stretches back at least to the days when The Velvet Underground performed as part of Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Hip-hop has always been intertwined with the gallery scene, from graffiti genius Jean-Michel Basquiat's 1980s heyday to Kehinde Wiley's current streetwise classical portraiture. Both Kanye West and Jay Z have extended this connection in recent performances: West has worked extensively with Vanessa Beecroft, known for her discomfiting use of live mannequins who must stay silent for long periods of time; Jay Z formed a brief, controversial partnership with Marina Abramović, who sat for nearly a month in MoMA's Atrium, welcoming silent interlocutors. In the rock world, PJ Harvey did something similar when she recorded her last album inside a glass studio in London's Somerset House. Waiting for Ocean to do something, anything with his power tools also made me think about the time-stretching magic of Christian Marclay's work, which is aesthetically and formally enmeshed with punk and art rock: the rough textures of Endless as heard in that first live-stream made me think of his film Guitar Drag, which, like much of this new release, confronts the tensions of a violent, racist world by releasing some noise into it. There's no getting past it — Ocean is super-arty. Releasing Endless before his hotly anticipated, "official" new album, Boys Don't Cry, tells us something about where he feels at home as a creator. The Record From The Isleys To Aaliyah To Frank Ocean, The Evolution Of 'Love' He also clearly wants to connect with an eclectic library of classic recordings. Many of the songs on Endless are very personal, with lyrics about Ocean's family troubles ("Alabama" is poignant and angry), his chemical proclivities (alcohol, ecstasy, insomnia), and his sex life ("He came up in Dallas / He had no hazel in his eyes / Had them sailors on his thighs," from the sexplicit "Commes Des Garcons," is a line Jean Genet would have recognized). But it's also essentially, slyly referential. Tom Sachs is known for jerry-rigging versions of other people's masterpieces, using duct tape and foamcore to comment on the ersatz nature of creativity. Ocean does something like that throughout Endless. As I listen, I hear so many ghosts of other gnomic masterworks and the artists who made them. He name-checks the Fugees at one point, and offers a homonym of The Beach Boys' Endless Summer at another, when he sings, as if from inside a wave, "I know you're in there somewhere." Production-wise, he and his collaborators are deeply indebted to Lee "Scratch" Perry and the experimental reggae of the great On-U Sound crew; I'd argue that his version of the Isley Brothers ballad "At Your Best You Are Love" is more evocative of the Caribbean than of standard quiet-storm R&B. The simmering thickness of these tracks, the way they veer from druggily rhythmic to diffuse — not to mention Ocean's self-tortured grapplings with success in songs like the moving lament, "Rushes To" — also makes me think about Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On, another album deeply reflective of the dark political moment in which it was produced. From this sawdust-covered pile of reference points, Ocean constructs his own meanings, grounded in an artistic identity that probably couldn't have sustained itself in earlier pop moments. His frankness about erotically fluid desire harkens back to the urban night wanderings of Lou Reed and the poetic challenges of Essex Hemphill. Has Ocean read Hemphill's profanely gorgeous "American Wedding," or spent time with Reed's odes to abjection on Berlin? I don't know, but those sources that never mingled in the past all seem to run through him. Ocean does strike me as an artist who absorbs source material eagerly, always adding more to the process he so openly shares. (And yes, I think of Kurt Cobain, too, of the hidden Nevermind track "Endless, Nameless," which announced the Seattle rock savior's refusal to conform to anyone's commercial hopes.) If Endless is merely the precursor to the larger reveal of Ocean's intentions and realizations that Boys Don't Cry will offer, it's still a work with plenty of currents that draw me in. I'll see you at the top of that never-ending staircase.

Fossil Q Wander Smartwatch Has Appealing Features, Traditional Flair The Fossil Q Wander may look like a traditional watch, but it's an Android Wear-based smartwatch that works with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It Fits Into the Fossil Watch Design Tradition Fossil hasn't strayed from its roots with the Q Wander's design. The device has a round face and looks nearly identical to some of its traditional watches. Users also will find Fossil's own wristbands and a dial on the side. Absent a closer look, one might be fooled into believing the Q Wander is a traditional watch. It's Powered by Android Wear Google's Android Wear powers the Q Wander, giving users full access to the operating system's slate of features, including support for countless watch faces, alerts to texts and much more. Android Wear generally has been well-received in the marketplace, which makes Fossil's decision to go with the operating system a smart one. Q Wander Works Across Platforms The Q Wander won't only work with Android-based devices. In fact, Fossil said the smartwatch will notify users of calls, texts and other notifications on iPhone 5 or newer iPhones running iOS 8 or up. On the Android side, the device requires Android 4.3 or higher. The Battery Will Last All Day Fossil has promised somewhat solid battery life in the Q Wander, saying it will last for 24 hours on a single charge before it needs to be powered up. That's only an estimate, though, and Fossil was quick to note that heavier usage could drain the battery more quickly. Either way, expect to charge the Q Wander at night. There Are Plenty of Activity Tracking Features In addition to telling time, the Q Wander is a fitness tracker that comes bundled with several sensors that can track a person's steps, distance traveled and calories burned. Despite that, surprisingly the smartwatch doesn't come with a heart rate sensor for tracking a person's pulse. Find Built-In Wireless Connectivity The Fossil Q Wander comes with WiFi built-in. With WiFi connectivity, users can control apps such as Apple Music or Spotify directly from the watch face. In addition, users don't always need to have their smartphones in their pockets to get notifications. WiFi integration in smartwatches has nearly become a requirement in today's mobile marketplace, and it's nice to see it in the Q Wander. Getting a Sense of the Fossil Q Wander's Size With so many shapes and variations available, a smartwatch's size should be considered before making a purchase. The Q Wander has a case size of 45mm and features support for all types of 22mm straps. To put that into perspective, the popular LG Watch Urbane has a 46mm face with a 22mm band, making them nearly identical in size. It Supports Wireless Data Synchronization and Charging Fossil's Q Wander is all about going wireless. In addition to WiFi networking, the device comes with wireless synchronization, allowing users to transfer data over Bluetooth between smartphone and smartwatch. The smartwatch ships with a conductive magnetic charger, which means that it supports wireless charging. Pick From Several Watchband Options Thanks to an "interchangeable design," the Q Wander is compatible with any 22mm strap, Fossil says. The company is currently selling four Q Wander variants, starting with a sports-friendly black silicone strap, along with a light brown leather strap. Customers also can choose a stainless steel wristband or a rose gold-tone stainless bracelet. Preorder Now and Get It Later As of this writing, the Fossil Q Wander is available for preorder through the Fossil website. The device is slated to ship on Aug. 29. When it does, customers will find the leather, silicone and stainless-steel versions all cost $295. The rose gold-tone stainless version will be priced at $315.

The Apple Watch is the most popular smartwatch in the world, while Google is the creator of Android Wear, a mobile operating system that runs on an increasing number of wearable computers. Traditional watchmakers, meanwhile, view the smartwatch market as new, desirable territory for them. These watchmakers often rely on Android Wear to bring new smartwatch designs to the market, and the Fossil Q Wander is one of the latest smartwatches to fit that mold. The device, which comes with a round face, runs on Android Wear and delivers several appealing features, including Bluetooth support, wireless charging, and the ability to work with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It's also an attractive smartwatch that won't break the bank with its $295 starting price. This slide show discusses the Fossil Q Wander's key features and why the device, which is scheduled to go on sale at the end of August, could be a nice option for people looking for a smartwatch that reflects a more traditional watch design heritage.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

The iPhone is done! The high-end smartphone market is saturated! No one is upgrading to new handsets anymore! Tim Cook is lost and has no idea what he's doing! To glance over recent headlines and themes being tossed around by tech bloggers and many analysts, things are looking pretty bleak for the largest company in the world by market cap. Then, matters were made even worse when Apple caught investors off guard and posted a massive drop-off in iPhone sales during the March quarter this year. Apple's share price plummeted and doomsday preppers crowed that the end was in sight. Then Apple beat estimates and offered impressive September-quarter guidance when it reported its fiscal third-quarter results in July, and the stock is up nearly 12% since then. Of course, anytime Apple dips big funds seize the opportunity.

AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a "Do Not Originate" list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction." Stephenson emphasized "the breadth and complexity" of the problem. "This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps," Stephenson said. "Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop." The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. "We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute," Stephenson said. "We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal." Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had "preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives." Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. "We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet," she said. "Nothing by itself is going to do it." Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign "phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls."

From now on, the company's stores will simply go by "Apple" followed by the location of that specific store. For example, only a couple days ago, Apple opened the doors to Apple World Trade Center — not Apple Store, World Trade Center — inside the stunning Oculus / Westfield Mall in lower Manhattan. This is the 10th Apple store in New York City alone. One thing that's not changing: the employees still welcome in the first shoppers with thunderous applause and hand them free t-shirts marking the store's opening. The first shoppers are welcomed into Apple World Trade Center on August 16th, 2016. Yes, this is a very Apple thing to do. Silly? Just a little bit, sure. But Apple would argue that it's not quite change for the sake of change. Beginning with Apple Union Square (which we toured in May), the company has set out to reframe its retail locations as more than the place you go to buy an iPad or Mac. Now, the stores feature gigantic 6K video screens, lush greenery, and some have ditched the traditional Genius Bar setup in favor of giving customers an area to just sit down and hang out. If that's the sort of thing you'd ever want to do at the Apple Store store. Apple's newest stores feature sections where customers can simply... sit. It's a move spearheaded by Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior VP of retail. "The store becomes one with the community," she said at the unveiling of Apple Union Square. According to MacRumors, Apple has emailed its retail staff with confirmation that "Apple Store" is no more. The rebranding is already reflected on every website for Apple's various stores, though the change may take slightly longer to completely roll out in-store. Aside from being positioned as more of a community hub, Apple stores are quickly taking on a more boutique feel, with fancy headphone setups and "avenue" displays that will change on a seasonal basis to showcase different products; currently they're focused on iPhone photography accessories. Everything you expect from the Apple store (see? lowercase) remains, but Apple is changing up the feel — and name — to keep that foot traffic high day in and day out.

Apple Releases Surprise iOS 10 Public Beta 6 Update, Beta 7 Build for Developers GO Users can install the new update right now Aug 19, 2016 19:05 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Apple surprised everyone tonight by releasing one last Beta build of the upcoming iOS 10 mobile operating system to both public beta testers and developers enrolled into its Apple Developer program. Both iOS 10 Public Beta 6 and Beta 7 development milestones are now live for those running any of the previous releases, and you can update your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch devices via the built-in updater (Settings -> General -> Software Update). We believe that this might just be the last Beta builds Apple seeds for its upcoming iOS 10 mobile operating system before the official launch in the first week of September, when the Cupertino company will also announce new, long-anticipated products. It appears that Apple seeded new Betas only for the iOS 10 operating system, most probably to patch a severe security issue discovered and reported by security researchers since the previous Beta builds. The next iPhone will be powered by iOS 10 There are a lot of rumors right now about the launch of a new iPhone this fall, which might happen around the date of September 7, but Apple hasn't invited the media to its forthcoming event yet. The next iPhone could be dubbed iPhone 7. The so-called iPhone 7 smartphone will definitely and without a doubt be powered by the iOS 10 mobile operating system, which will also be available for many of the existing devices on the same day when the launch of the new iPhone takes place. More details about the launch of the new iPhone and iOS operating system should become available to the press sometime on the last days of August or the first days of September, so right now, we can only dream of a powerful 5-inch smartphone. Apple will also announce the macOS 10.12 Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 operating systems for Macs, Apple Watch devices, and Apple TVs respectively, so stay tuned and keep an eye open on our Mac news section for future stories on this matter. #iOS 10 Beta 7#iOS 10 Public Beta 6#macOS Sierra Public Beta 6#macOS Sierra Beta 7#Apple subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases Fourth iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Betas, Update Now Apple Seeds Fifth Betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3 to Devs Apple Outs iOS 9.3.4 for iPhone, iPad & iPod to Fix an Important Security Issue Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra to Public Beta Testers Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    iOS 10 Public Beta 6 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed - Updated more on: iOS 10.2 Beta 3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Here’s what we know so far… New Features | There has long been speculation about whether or not Apple Watch 2 would include cellular connectivity to allow for independence from the iPhone. New features reportedly planned for Apple Watch will allow you to do more with the device without being tethered to your iPhone, but it won’t become entirely independent. The latest reports claimed Apple Watch 2 won’t be getting cellular functionality, meaning it will still rely on a connected iPhone in your pocket for phone calls and other features. But it will, according to the reports, include GPS for improved standalone fitness features alongside enhanced waterproofing and a step-up in performance. We reported last year that Apple was considering a FaceTime camera, improved iPhone-free Wi-Fi functionality, and new $1000+ models, but noted it was unclear if those features would make it into the upcoming second-generation Apple Watch. Report: Apple Watch 2 won’t include cellular, focusing instead on GPS for fitness KGI: Apple Watch 2 coming late 2016 w/ GPS, better waterproofing, improved performance, same design Report: Faster Apple Watch 2 may feature built-in cellular connectivity [Poll] Apple Watch 2: Apple plans FaceTime camera, iPhone-free Wi-Fi, $1000+ models, similar battery Same design | With all the features above and likely some new straps and model configurations, at least one report says the new device will otherwise maintain the design of the current Apple Watch. But even with the same overall physical design, Apple could and likely will offer some new models with a mix of new casing and band options or even new casing materials. A couple older reports from around the time the device launched in April of last year noted Apple was experimenting with titanium and other casing materials that could serve as new high-end options that are less expensive than its 18 karat gold models. KGI: Apple Watch 2 coming late 2016 w/ same design Apple could be planning a platinum model for future designs KGI: Apple Watch with new casing materials likely arriving in Q4 this year Availability | Apple Watch 2 is expected to arrive in late 2016 according to the latest reports with one claiming the device will launch alongside iPhone 7 in September. We noted earlier this month that Apple Watch availability continues to deplete ahead of the expected upcoming refresh, and supply chain sources indicated Apple was preparing ‘aggressive’ volumes for the device. In addition to iPhone 7, Apple is also expected to launch its much-anticipated MacBook Pro with OLED touch panel in late 2016. It’s unclear, however, if either the Apple Watch 2 or new MacBook Pro will share stage time with iPhone 7 in early September, or if Apple will host a second this year before the holidays.

Called the "Robocall Strike Force," the group is led by the Federal Communications Commission, which held its first hearing on the subject today in Washington, DC. Robocalls include both prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers and automated text messages. The FCC is turning to companies like Apple, Alphabet, AT&T, and Verizon because it’s seeking a solution to prevent telemarketers and even big corporations from harassing consumers with prerecorded messages. "We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls," said FCC Commissioner Mignon L. Clyburn. "We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the ‘Do Not Call’ list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action." The strike force is expected to report to the FCC by October 19th with "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who is the chairman of the coalition. These solutions could come in the form of Caller ID verification standards that could block spoofed phone numbers, as well as a list of numbers from government agencies and banks that telemarketers would not be able to spoof. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler calls robocalls a "scourge" Speaking today at the meeting, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called robocalls a "scourge." In fact, the FCC says complaints filed under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) accounted for more than half of the 175,000 tickets filed at the FCC’s help center in the first six months of 2016. The FCC first began addressing the problem from a technical end last year, when it gave phone makers and telecoms the go ahead to implement robocall-blocking software. However, companies like AT&T have been dragging their feet, claiming to need FCC approval for such technology. That prompted Wheeler to post a call to arms in July with a post titled "Cutting Off Robocalls," in which he called on tech companies and carriers to work together with the commission. The FCC is pushing companies to work together on blocking robocalls Commissioner Clyburn was careful to point out in her statements today that the group is walking a fine line between helping consumers and allowing anticompetitive behavior. For instance, the FCC stopped AT&T from blocking iPhone VoIP calls, including those from Google Voice, as part of a contractural agreement it had with Apple. "The Commission has a long-history of prohibiting abusive or anticompetitive use of call-blocking technology," Clyburn said. "But consumers want real relief and I am optimistic that beginning with today’s conversation, we will be able to deliver to consumers the change they are clamoring for." Tech companies and telecoms also have another reason to cooperate with the FCC. The TCPA has often been used aggressively in the past to sue companies over even basic automated messages. Although the law was devised to crack down on harassing robocalls from, say, a third-party debt collection agency hired by a bank, it’s gotten companies like Facebook and Yahoo sued over notification texts about account sign-ins and welcome messages. By participating in this strike force, tech companies may be able to ease the loose application of the TCPA in these types of class action lawsuits.

Fans have been awaiting the arrival of the album for four years.

But according to a report from Bloomberg, this isn’t going to happen. It seems the cellular connection chips that Apple intended to use in the watch drained too much battery life from the device. The company has now abandoned plans for implementing the feature in the Apple Watch 2; instead, it is "studying lower-power cellular data chips" that can be used in future generations of Apple Watches. While having no cell connectivity may come as a disappointment, the report goes on to state that the new Apple Watch will come with GPS-based location tracking; a feature it hopes will appeal to those looking to use the device for fitness purposes. It should also make navigation on the watch more accurate. Both the lack of cellular connectivity and the addition of GPS functions were predicted by renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He believes cellular features won’t arrive in the Apple Watch until at least 2017. Smartwatch shipments fell 32 percent in the second quarter of 2016, according to figures from the International Data Corporation – marking the first ever year-over-year decline. But Apple still held on to its number one position and will likely cement its spot at the top with the second generation of its wearable. WatchOS 3, an updated version of the operating system used by the Apple Watch, will also be released this fall.

That earliest of Apple paraphernalia is about as rare as they come, but if you act fast (and drop a boatload of money), you can snap one up now. Fundraising site Charitybuzz has one of the super, special, extra-limited edition early computers up on its site for auction, currently going for $270,000. That’s a steal compared to the decidedly nutty estimated value of $1 million listed on the site, but the auction’s still got under a week left, and past models have actually gotten pretty close to the 1 million mark. Corey Cohen, who runs the site MyAppleComputer.net has a lot to say about the machine, explaining that the so-called “Celebration” version is likely among a small number of prototypes that were never sold to the public. Says the site, “At this time, this is the only known Apple-1 to show the signs of starting out as a blank original-run board and not part of the two known production runs, so this board appears to be unique from all other known Apple-1 boards.” And hey, for good measure, your hard-earned Apple bucks will also get you the ’76 Apple-1 instruction manual and a slew of cassettes, including Star Trek and Blackjack, for some truly old-school computer gaming action. via Recode 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Photo: Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images email The wait is finally over—for real this time: Two weeks after Frank Ocean unveiled a cryptic looped video on his website, boysdontcry.co, and left fans disappointed after once again blowing off a rumored release date, the mysterious artist has finally debuted his new album. True to form, Ocean’s follow-up to his hit album, Channel Orange, is surprisingly different from what we were expecting. For years, the artist referred to his sophomore album as Boys Don’t Cry, but yesterday he premiered a black-and-white visual album on Apple Music titled Endless. It’s rumored that more music is coming our way, so Boys Don’t Cry might still be in the works. While we wait for answers, we’ve pieced together everything we know so far about Ocean’s new album, Endless, below. Where is it available? The 45-minute visual album is available to stream on Apple Music. As of now, individual tracks or a full album are not available for download. What’s this I hear about another album coming out? According to Rolling Stone, Endless is just the first project Ocean will be unveiling this week, and another album (previously called Boys Don’t Cry, but now apparently switched to another title) will be dropping over the weekend. A rep from Apple Music further added fuel to the rumor fire, saying in a statement that we should “keep an eye out this weekend for more from Frank.” If Ocean’s previous actions are any indication, it might be best not to get too excited. Is the visual album anything like Lemonade? Quite the opposite. Ocean’s movie, shot entirely in black and white by conceptual artist Francisco Soriano, is devoid of any sort of narrative. It mostly shows Ocean (sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by two other Ocean clones) working on a craft project in an empty warehouse—taking turns using a power saw, spray painting wood, or washing supplies. By the end of the video, Ocean has built a spiral staircase made up of wooden boxes. As he begins to ascend the steps, a flash of purple briefly appears on-screen. Perhaps the weekend album will be titled Channel Violet? How many songs are featured? Eighteen songs are listed during the end-credits sequence of Endless. Some songs do appear in their entirety in the visual album, others are just heard in snippets. The full track list includes a cover of Aaliyah’s take on the Isley Brothers’ “(At Your Best) You Are Love” and “Device Control,” a song by German artist Wolfgang Tillmans. The complete track list is below: “Device Control” “At Your Best (You Are Love) ” “Alabama” “Mine” “U-N-I-T-Y” Ambience 001: “In a Certain Way” “Commes Des Garcons” Ambience 002: “Honeybaby” “Wither” “Hublots” “In Here Somewhere” “Slide on Me” “Sideways” “Florida” “Deathwise (ASR)” “Rushes” “Rushes To” “Higgs” Who are some of the collaborators? For Channel Orange, Ocean worked with several collaborators including Pharrell Williams, André Benjamin, and Tyler the Creator. On Endless, the featured artists come from even more varied genres. Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood lends his skills to “At Your Best (You Are Love),” as does James Blake, whose last album, The Colour in Anything, features an appearance by Ocean. Venezuelan wunderkind producer Arca, who has worked with Kanye West and FKA twigs, had a hand in “Mine,” while producer SebastiAn is credited on “Slide on Me,” “Rushes,” and “Higgs.” R&B artist Jazmine Sullivan appears on “Alabama,” “Wither,” and “Hublots,” and British singer Sampha, a frequent collaborator of electronic outfit SBTRKT, lends his voice to “Alabama” as well. And indie rock guitarist Alex G contributed to four tracks.   Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Musician Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2016 Condé Nast.

 Apple's retail boss wants Apple stores to resemble 'town squares' Avery Hartmans Aug. 19, 2016, 8:32 PM 8,801 facebook linkedin twitter email print Angela Ahrendts at an Apple Store. AP/Tony Avelar Apple retail boss Angela Ahrendts doesn't necessarily want to open more Apple Stores, but she wants the stores to act like "town squares." Business Insider caught up with Ahrendts at the grand opening of a new Apple Store at the World Trade Center, and she told us how Apple Stores are changing in terms of layout and design. But she also talked about her vision for what they should be. Here's how Ahrendts described it: "We don't really need to open more stores, but we need to open incredible places that almost behave like a town square, like a gathering place. Right? So when all the events start to turn on, that's what, you know, we want you to meet people at Apple. See what's happening." When we asked Ahrendts if she plans to open more stores in New York, she was mum — but we do know that there could be changes on the way for the company's existing locations. You can see the full video of our chat with Ahrendts here.

Related Stories How a Kitten Video Can Transmit Secret Instructions to Criminals Exploring the Forgotten Art Deco Artifacts of the New Yorker Hotel New York City's Mail Chutes are Lovely, Ingenious and Almost Entirely Ignored An early Apple Mac computer, signed by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple. (All photos courtesy of Jack Goodman) On a busy street just off 6th Avenue in the Flatiron district of Manhattan sits a humble storefront. Rows of Apple Macintosh computers in a variety of colors and shapes line up on shelves behind glass, each one slightly less cuboid than the one to its right. At some point, the beige transitions into candy colored monitor cases. This is the “Mac Museum” at Tekserve, the computer sales and repair shop that served techies in New York City for 30 years, and it’s about to go dark. The store is a wunderkammer for tech geeks. Next to the computers stands a tall, wooden 1950s Bell telephone booth. Opposite is a cabinet overflowing with transistor radios and next to that, old adding machines. One of the very first models of television lies on the floor. Dick Demenus, Tekserve’s founder, owns everything here. He picks up a radio and runs a finger over one edge as if to admire the workmanship. Demenus views technology and mechanics through his engineer’s eyes. The older things were built to last, he says. Too much of today’s gadgets are mere fads. “I’m very critical of contemporary design,” says Demenus. “A lot of very frivolous stuff that doesn’t stand the test of time.”  Preparations for the Tekserve auction in full swing. Tekserve’s lease on the building expires at the end of August and the rent will triple, prompting Demenus to shut it down for good. Tekserve will be buzzing on August 23rd, however, when almost every item here goes up for auction—by Thursday afternoon, the highest bid for the “Mac Museum” stood at $23,000. The auction will be a swansong for a main street store that was considered the original Apple store. When Tekserve opened in 1987, its staff catered to the few Mac enthusiasts in New York City. It grew into the nation’s largest Apple reseller. Demenus started the business in his loft apartment and then moved around several locations, before they found a permanent home in 119 West 23rd Street, some 15 years ago. Demenus lives next door and will continue living there as the new tenants move in.  Tekserve founder Dick Demenus has a vast collection of antique radios like these.  Way before there was a Genius Bar, Tekserve operated as the city’s one-stop-shop for artists, architects, graphic designers and writers who used Apple products. Demenus and his engineers took it upon themselves to learn how the first Apple computers were built. The team became indispensable for users in the city. The business grew from a simple idea: to provide a quality and cheaper alternative to authorized repair centers.  A very early model of television. But it soon became apparent that they had the space, and the ambition, to move into retail. The building has two floors and occupies the width of a block. Classical-style columns stand from floor to ceiling. They started selling the technology too. At the company’s peak, Tekserve employed 200 people. Demenus has a long-standing fascination for gadgetry; his collection of computers, radios, microphones, cameras and technological miscellany is huge and will fill the store floor on the day of the auction. He built the collection from years of going to auctions and flea markets across the county. His desk is on the lower level of the building, where many of the antiques were kept hidden away. Behind his chair, and the obligatory Mac desktop, is one item not for sale: a cardboard cutout of Princess Leia. Leia, says Demenus, has been watching over him. The Tekserve Blue Robot.  That afternoon, he had just received a book full of signatures and good luck messages from members of staff past and present. Tekserve employees filled out a local pub on Monday night for an impromptu farewell party.  Demenus was surprised and touched at how many people turned up, but says he always looked after his staff. “We tried to provide a humane and very supportive work environment. We did things Google are now famous for,” says Demenus. He referred to the company’s policy of free lunches.  The “Mac Museum.” Roland Auctions organized Tuesday’s sale, which will take place inside the store and also online. It will mark the closure of another New York tradition; an independent main street-style store. There are seven Apple Store’s within walking distance of Tekserve and Demenus says the company simply couldn’t compete anymore. The store will close but the collecting may not. Recently, Demenus says he bought a vintage Bakelite radio, to add to his collection of dozens. It’s the thrill of the hunt, says Demenus, that will never go away. “If you want a hobby, it’s better than Las Vegas.” Update, 8/23: An earlier version of this story stated, incorrectly, that Dick Demenus bought a Baker Light Radio. We regret the error. #new york city#computers#technology#history Read Next As Siberia Heats Up, This Lake Turns Pink Recent Stories Read the Original Pitch for Thanksgiving, From the Editress Who Created the Holiday Sarah Josepha Hale imagined a day of Christian celebration.

Banks in the country have been resisting the adoption of Apple Pay, saying that it insures hefty fees and no user control. Apple says Australian banks are creating an anti-competitive environment by not allowing payment services such as Apple Pay into the country. The banks are demanding Apple to open up the iPhone’s NFC chip to third-party developers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission provided an interim judgment, and plays a small role in the final decision that is expected to be made in October. The committee ruled that the Apple Pay is far too complicated to make a quick ruling. Unfortunately, for Australian consumers, this most likely means that no change will be made until the final decision is made. At the earliest, we’d expect Apple Pay rollout in Australia in November, but even then that’s unlikely.

However, Digitimes reports that Taiwanese suppliers are starting to resist Apple’s demands. Apple is said to have asked downstream part and component suppliers […] to reduce their quotes for iPhone 7 devices by as much as 20% even though order volumes for new phones are reportedly 30% lower than those placed a year earlier. Major downstream suppliers, notably Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and associated companies under the Foxconn Group, have replied Apple that they could not be able to accept orders without reasonable profits at this time. Both sides have strong arguments and it doesn’t look like either one is backing down. Apple is reportedly citing massive supply-chains in China as a reason for Taiwanese suppliers to reduce cost. But, on the other hand, companies in Taiwan are citing higher quality products as a reason to resists. In fact, Apple agreed to the terms of two Taiwanese suppliers because of this. Apple appeared to have chosen to by-pass TSMC and Largan and did not require the two companies to reduce their quotes simply because it is difficult for Apple to find alternative sources to replace TSMC or Largan to offer foundry services or high-end camera modules, respectively. It appears Apple’s largest supplier, Foxconn, is also pushing back on pricing as the company had just acquired display maker Sharp, making Apple’s business less valuable.

Although the details weren’t clear then, they are clear as day now. Last night, Apple Music revealed the official trailer for Cash Money’s forthcoming documentary entitled “Before Anything.” According to the one-minute clip, the documentary is set to focus on Bryan “Birdman” Williams, his brother, Roland “Slim” Williams, and their journey to stardom in the rap game. The film will highlight how they built the Cash Money empire that eventually acquired top tier artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, Nick Minaj, and more.

It is not clear what is included in beta 7, but given its unconventional release date, it may contain critical bug fixes. iOS 10 beta 7 is available as an over-the-air download to those who installed the first six betas or the beta configuration profile and it's available for direct download via Apple's Developer Center (developers only). iOS 10 is a major iOS update with a ton of new features and design tweaks, including a new Lock screen experience with 3D Touch-enabled notifications, a more easily accessible camera, a redesigned Control Center, and a new widgets screen. According to Apple, iOS 10 is the company's biggest iOS update ever released. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The Messages app in iOS 10 has been overhauled with features that include background animations, bubble effects, Digital Touch, handwritten notes, Tapback replies, predictive emoji, and a dedicated App Store, and Photos has gained new facial and object recognition capabilities along with a Memories feature for rediscovering forgotten moments. iOS 10 is currently available to developers and public beta testers, with a full public release planned for the fall. iOS 10 beta 7 is likely to be the final update before the golden master version is released.

The software update will be ready for everyone likely sometime next month, and we’ll dig through the seventh developer version of the iOS 10 beta below. The update follows just five days after the last release on Monday. The sixth public beta version of iOS 10 is also available. If you’re already testing iOS 10 beta on your iPhone or iPad, head to the Software Update section of the Settings app to find the OTA update. If you’re a registered developer deciding to start testing iOS 10 with beta 6, head over to the Apple’s developer page to install the beta profile. iOS 10 includes loads of new features and changes including redesigned Music and News apps, the first Home app for HomeKit, a redesigned Lock screen and Home screen experience for widgets, tons of iMessage features in Messages, and much more. Apple is rumored to be planning a September 7 event to debut the iPhone 7 ahead of pre-orders on September 9 and launch on September 16. New versions of iOS typically roll out a couple of days before new iPhones so we could see iOS 10 publicly launch as soon as September 14.

Apple, Amazon and Google are all in the race but who will take the history-making title. By James Billington August 19, 2016 18:21 BST Who will be the world's first trillion dollar company? Apple could be one launch away but is Amazon is a rising threat Reuters The race to become the first trillion dollar company is on and the big three in contention is Apple, Google and Amazon. But which one will cross the line first? It's been widely assumed for many years that Apple would be the favourite to break this barrier with an indomitable rise to the top of the tech tree, but after a recent shift in smartphone sales this has been thrown into doubt. As Apple hits a slight speed bump it's Amazon that's moving up through the pack - even projected to slingshot past thanks to its ventures outside e-retail. Despite ranking some way behind Apple's $582 billion valuation at $365 billion, Amazon's wide-ranging ventures offer a future that gives it a bright future to reach that target. Through its Amazon Web Services, which offers hosting to some of the world's biggest companies, as well as its move into the space race, drone delivery and a logistics service, its moves on the line graph have been heading steadily northwards in 2016. This sharply contrasts Apple, who have endured a shaky downward dive since 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the third richest man in the worldReuters In an article by The Motley Fool, however, it believes that despite the slide in iPhone sales all it will take is one big product push from Apple to get it well on-track to hit the $1 trillion mark. But don't hold your breath for that to happen this year. With the 2016 iPhone 7 expected to rock a less than different look and a controversial removal of the headphone socket, which will undoubtedly perturb those millions of consumers who are worried about the fate of their 3.5mm audio cabled headphones. But we're reminded that Apple is still the world's biggest company for a reason. Its Q1 2016 profit result of $18.4 billion is still the highest by any company on record. Ever. Experts recognise the smartphone market is becoming an increasingly more difficult place for Apple but also know its history, expertise and resources are a delicious recipe for success. Its 2018 iPhone, the ten-year anniversary since it first left consumers slack-jawed, is expected to overhaul the handset fans have been waiting for (or expect at every new launch). Rumours of a totally new design and OLED display might just be enough to have consumers gushing once more and if the Apple Car rumblings are to anything to go by it may well be enough to put the wind back into its sails. But, that's still an 'if'. Samsung has taken the game to Apple. Budget, high-quality handsets from the likes of OnePlus have rocked the market. As for the expected electric/autonomous car effort, well there's still the little issue of Audi, Jaguar, Ford, Nissan and Uber to name a few to compete with. Life is a little more secure for Amazon, however. It's already taking home a huge slice of markets where it reigns supreme and doesn't have to look over its shoulder. Estimates that global retail sales will surpass $28 trillion by 2018, and Infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) spending will reach $141 billion by 2019. The long-term growth here is something that will power an upward trend for years to come. What about Google? How could we discount Google, its parent company now rebranded as Alphabet. It's currently valued at $538 billion so is by no means a small fish. It's search engine is the internet epitomised, it's behind Android – the most widely used mobile OS in the world – and has been investing in everything from VR to medical tech. Research claims Alphabet will post a rise in profits of 16 percent in the next two years, with revenues of $96 billion in 2018. Its stock is strong and if it continues it could soon become favourite to hit a trillion dollar valuation first. All three companies are dominant players but if money were to be put on the line, experts are backing Amazon based on its diverse portfolio of investments and ventures putting it in a prime position. "To be sure, Apple and Alphabet both offer investors plenty to like, but I see Amazon as the tech company with the most favourable outlook to reach and grossly surpass a $1 trillion valuation in the decades to come," the article read.

Photo: Lyle Kahney/Cult of Mac The scourge of robocalls may be coming to an end, thanks to a new task force comprised of over 30 top tech companies, including Apple. The U.S. government has enlisted the help of Apple, AT&T, Alphabet, Verizon, Comcast and others to crack down on unsolicited, automated, prerecorded phone calls that have become the most frequent complaint the U.S. Federal Communications Commission receives from citizens. As part of the newly formed “Robocall Strike Force,” Apple and other members held their first meeting with the FCC this Friday and with AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson chairing the group. “This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,” Stephenson told Reuters. “Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.” FCC president Tom Wheeler said the issue of robocalls still plagues citizens largely due to industry inaction. Phone providers in the U.S. are not required to offer robocall blocking services, however, the FCC has recommend companies add them. The strike force is set to reply to the FCC on October 19 with concrete plans to accelerate the elimination of robocalls. Other companies in the strike force include Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Blackberry, Qualcomm, T-Mobile and LG.

Twitter: @bst3r. Deals of the Day See all deals P-Man “The scourge of robocalls may be coming to an end”, because of a task force? Get serious. First, this task force will have what – 50-60 people on it? 30 tech companies, probably some trade associations, and various government people. And these 50-60 people (who will be adding this task force work to their full-time jobs) are going to come up with a consensus on “the answer” in two months? Yeah, right. They’ll basically just be endorsing what the FCC has already come up with (some of which is mentioned in the Reuters article). Second, robocallers are like spam senders. As long as the business remains profitable, they’ll find ways around whatever changes get made. Whack a mole.

This jailbreak allows Apple TV 4 owners running tvOS 9.0 and 9.0.1 to jailbreak their devices. Although it is possible to jailbreak the Apple TV with a paid developer account, it’s also possible to do so with a free account as well. In this tutorial, we’ll show you step by step how to jailbreak the Apple TV 4. Watch our video walkthrough inside to see how. Also, the current Apple TV 4 jailbreak is GUI-less at this time, meaning that only SSH access is available. This means that currently no Cydia-like interface is available for jailbroken Apple TV 4 units. That said, this is only the beginning. Before starting you will need to login Xcode with an Apple ID that has sideloading privileges. You can get this for free by visiting the Apple developer member center and agreeing to the terms. To login to Xcode, go to Xcode → Preferences → Accounts and click the ‘+’ sign. Pangu’s post implies that you will need a paid developer account, although our tutorial shows you how to do so for free. It is our understanding that the jailbreak will still work as we’ve outlined below using our free method, but we are not responsible for any negative side effects that using this method will have. Things you will need An Apple TV running tvOS 9.0 or 9.0.1 A USB-C cable Xcode A Mac A free Apple ID account with sideloading privileges Pangu jailbreak tool iOS App Signer How to jailbreak the Apple TV 4 Step 1: Connect your Apple TV to your Mac using the USB-C cable. Step 2: If you haven’t already, disable Automatic Updates on your Apple TV. Go to Settings → System → Software Updates and turn off Automatically Update. Step 3: Download the Pangu jailbreak tool and iOS App Signer ZIP files and extract both to your desktop. Step 4: Open Xcode and go to File → New → Project → tvOS → Application → Single View Application → Next. Step 5: Fill out the following fields Product Name: Jailbreak Organization: <Your name> Organization Identifier: com.jailbreak.appletv Keep everything else as is, and click Next → Create. Video walkthrough Step 6: Click Product → Destination → Apple TV. Step 7: In the team area, select your personal Apple ID. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to create a free Apple ID, and link it to Xcode via Xcode → Preferences → Accounts. Step 8: Click Fix issue to clear up any provisioning issues. Step 9: Launch iOS App Signer and use the Browse button to select the atvipa.app file from the Payload folder in the Pangu download that you extracted to your desktop in Step 3. Step 10: In iOS App Signer, select the Certificate and Provisioning Profile for the app that you just created in Xcode. Step 11: Click Start on iOS App Signer, select Desktop and click Save to save the atvipa.ipa file to your desktop. Step 12: Open Xcode and go to Window → Devices and select your Apple TV. Step 13: Click the + button under Installed apps, and select the atvipa.ipa from your desktop. Step 14: The Pangu jailbreak tool should now be deployed to your Apple TV. Once it appears on your Apple TV’s Home screen, launch the app to initiate and complete the jailbreak. Step 15: Congratulations. You can now SSH into your Apple TV  using the Apple TV’s Wi-Fi IP address. Keep in mind that Pangu’s method uses a paid dev account. There could possibly be a reason for them taking this approach, which I hope that they comment on later. With that said, this method does work as far as being able to SSH into my Apple TV. Whether or not there are any downsides by using the free method is still yet to be seen. If you’re looking for an Apple TV running iOS 9.0.x, be sure to check out our Apple TV 4 jailbreak preparation tutorial for details on how to do just that. Otherwise, stay tuned for more coverage relating to this exciting new release. How to fix the Apple TV 4 black screen of death Some users have complained about being stuck in a black screen reboot loop after jailbreaking the Apple TV 4. This, as it turns out, can be easily fixed by a few simple SSH commands. Step 1: Turn on your Apple TV Step 2: Open Terminal Step 3: Type the following in the Terminal window: ssh root@<ip address of apple tv> (password = alpine) wget http://nitosoft.com/ATV4/fixBoot.sh chmod +x fixBoot.sh ./fixBoot.sh This will run the following commands automatically upon startup, which resolves the issue: launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mobile.lockdown.plist launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mobile.lockdown.plist This, as was discovered by @nitoTV and Morpheus______.

As you can see in the screenshot above, non-paid apps are now presented with the word ‘GET’ rather than ‘FREE’. While the reason for the change in how Apple is presenting non-paid apps isn’t clear, it’s likely due to the popularity of ‘freemium’ apps and in-app purchases, something that has been the source of controversy for Apple in the past… Apple has taken a great deal of flack from customers and consumer protection groups through the years over apps marketed as free that push in-app purchases. The freemium model has been used in some cases to circumvent the lack of app trials on the App Store. For example, a developer may make an app free to download, but require an in-app purchase to unlock the app’s full functionality. The new ‘Get’ labels seem to address such a use case where previously ‘Free’ could be misleading. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced earlier this year that the company had settled with the Federal Trade Commission over a dispute involving in-app purchases, although he insisted “the consent decree the FTC proposed does not require us to do anything we weren’t already going to do.” A class action lawsuit in which Apple settled during 2013 previously lead to the company to add an “offers in-app purchases” label to apps on the App Store that offer paid content within the app. Apple previously agreed to offer credit or refunds to customers as part of the class action lawsuit. While ‘Free’ apps are now labeled with a ‘Get’ button for downloading, paid apps continue to list the price for purchasing the app, and previously downloaded apps display the cloud icon. With apps like the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game reportedly expected to earn $200 million from in-app purchases, the change from ‘Free’ to ‘Get’ makes sense (although personally I think ‘Get’ may be a strong word). The change is also being reported by App Store users in other countries with various translations of the change. Free apps on the Mac App Store also now reflect the label change with new ‘Get’ buttons. (That’s a lot of ‘Get’.) Shouldn’t these be “Top Get iPhone Apps”? pic.twitter.com/G1EXkd22AX — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) November 19, 2014 Update: It appears Apple is continuing to experiment with how it is presenting FREE/GET on the App Store. Rather than presenting either ‘Free’ or ‘Get’ below a non-paid app on a screen without a download button, Apple is now opting to leave that space without any label (including free) while paid apps continue to list price. Non-paid upfront apps continue to show ‘Get’ for the actual download button. You can view yesterday’s approach in the screenshots above and the latest change in the screenshots below.

It’s about eliminating those shameless developers who design around a business model, never resulting in the highest quality apps. All of freemium apps with consumable IAP’s are crappy, bloated apps designed to never make te user feel entirely happy for maximising temporarily satisfactory boosts through IAPs. This isn’t the quality of apps developers (or anybody else) would want to use themselves if there were better alternatives. I can’t think of a single app with consumable IAPs that is actually great. On the other hand, free/paid apps with or without non-consumable IAPs (or even subscriptions in some cases) are of noticeably higher quality on average and provide all the productivity, creativity and entertainment we could wish for. LikeLike beyondthetech - 2 years ago Reply I still think that sites like TouchArcade and other app review sites should add a ‘freemium/premium’ meter to give potential users an idea of how useful or enjoyable an app or game will actually be before an in-App Purchase is required. With their revenue models exposed and their customer base becomes more wary, maybe some of these greedy developers (more like dev companies, not the indie devs) will have to change their tune. LikeLike icerabbit - 2 years ago Reply That is only going to lead to more confusion. I don’t get it … why Apple would even replace FREE with GET. Makes no sense. Get Free.

Now it says GET everywhere and that looks absolutely stupid. So now, the morons who caused this problem in the first place are going to be same morons who complain that nothing is free on the App Store. Apple needs to stop giving in to stupidity. At least they could have come up with something better than GET. GET doesn’t tell you that it is in fact FREE still (which is fucking is). They could do FREE+ and just put an explanation someplace which pops up first time you enter the app store after an update. You have to click a button which says “I understand” to continue.

Putting “Get” is even more confusing cause now you don’t know if it’s free or freemium. Using the word “get” seems intentional cause it does two things. It protects Apple from further litigation and at the same time is confusing to get people continue to download apps. the best solution is to have three labels. the price for paid apps…”Free” for 100% free apps…and “Free +” or “Free Plus” for freemium apps.

Many users complained about the issue online: they had randomly found their Macs no longer connecting to the Internet and their Ethernet port simply not working. Apple has now officially acknowledged the problem on its support pages. Luckily, the software problem isn’t permanent and the bug can, usually, be easily resolved. Apple has already fixed the Ethernet software problem for users going forward. Here’s the fix if you were affected … If your Ethernet port has stopped working on your Mac, check System Information to find the version number of the Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration file installed. If the number reads 3.28.1, you’ll need to update the configuration to get the Ethernet port working properly. It seems that Apple accidentally blacklisted its own networking kext, which is the cause of the issue. To check your Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration version number, hold the Option key and click the Apple menu. Then open System Information. Find the Software section and select Installations. Look for rows labelled ‘Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration Data’ and find the most recent version installed. If the number is 3.28.1, you need to update the profile. If you can connect to WiFi, then luckily updating the file to restore the functionality of the Ethernet cable is easy. Open Terminal. Type the following command into the command line; it will ask for your admin password: sudo softwareupdate --background Quit Terminal and restart the Mac. After rebooting, the Ethernet port should work again. If you can’t connect to WiFi,  the steps are a bit more involved. You’ll have to restart the Mac in Recovery mode and manually delete the offending files through Disk Utility and Terminal. rm -rf “/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Library/Extensions/AppleKextExcludeList.kext” Read the full steps on Apple’s Support Site and take care not to delete anything but the file in question. If you don’t mind losing data, it may be simpler to use Recovery Mode to just Reinstall OS X. This will fix the problem when OS X is started afresh, but obviously has the big downside of deleting other data. Make sure you have recent backups in any case.

By the time I checked for the update, it had already been applied. All I had to do was to renew the DHCP lease and everything was fine again. I had actually been in contact with Apple earlier today, as my Mac is still covered by AppleCare, and they came to the conclusion that the adapter was faulty and that I should go and buy a new one. What a waste of money the would have been! LikeLike carpetbomberz - 9 months ago In my case I booted to the Recovery volume. I had the update, but it was in the disabled Kext list too! So I booted into Recover deleted that whole folder of black-list .kext files. On reboot I ran software update from command line. As soon as it updated Whammo!

So IF you have a time machine backup you can restore the system from a 1-2 day earlier backup. I had two Macs effected, I did a full time machine restore via Recovery Mode on one Mac (took 2+ hours) and the ethernet port worked fine while in Recovery mode. I found the faster way for the second Mac was to (again via Recovery Mode) reinstall OS X which downloads from Apple over the internet. This was much faster and preserved all my OS X settings, apps and data (it is an in-place update not a reformat install). My suggestion to anyone that will need to provide phone support to friends and family: talking them through a Recovery Mode full (1-2 days old) time machine restore or reinstalling OS X is much simpler and less prone to confusion than the Apple instructions.

Although a paid developer account is still required to deploy apps to the App Store, users wishing to sideload open source apps on a personal device can do so with relative ease. In this post, we’ll show you how easy it is to create a free Apple developer account for sideloading apps using Xcode. Creating an Apple developer account Step 1: Visit developer.apple.com Step 2: Click Member Center. Step 3: Sign in with your Apple ID. If you already have an Apple ID, you’ll just need to agree to Apple’s Developer Agreement to turn it into a free developer account. Type in your Apple ID and click Sign In. If you don’t already have an Apple ID, you’ll need to create one first. Click Create Apple ID, and fill out the required information and click Continue. You’ll then need to sign in with the Apple ID that you just created, and go back to the Member Center. Step 4: On the Apple Developer Agreement page, click the first check box to accept the agreement and click the Submit button. Your Apple ID now works as a free developer account. As stated at the outset, this account can be used for sideloading apps via Xcode. You will not be able to submit apps to the App Store, or download iOS, OS X, watchOS, or tvOS developer betas. A $99/year paid developer account is still required to enjoy those privileges. Video walkthrough Signing in with Xcode Step 1: Download Xcode from the Mac App Store. Step 2: Launch Xcode. Step 3: Click Xcode → Preferences → Accounts and click the ‘+’ sign and choose Add Apple ID. Step 4: Login with the Apple ID that you just enabled with free developer privileges. You can now use Xcode to sideload apps on your favorite platforms. This tutorial can also be used in concert with our Apple TV 4 jailbreak tutorial. This is a basic tutorial that will be referenced in future tutorials involving sideloading on the Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad. Stay tuned for additional discussion regarding sideloading apps.

LikeLike savichmichael - 8 months ago First off, Apple has made it clear side loading of other’s apps is not the intention of this system. If people come to depend on these side loaded apps, Apple could squash those projects at any time as they have done with f.lux. Second, this is just an awful system for side loading from a usability standpoint. If Apple were to somehow tolerate this method, and it grew into a widespread practice, the experience would be much worse than any dedicated method Apple devised, and in a world where side loaded apps are handled this way, Apple would have less incentive to develop a proper way to side load. Finally, if this practice becomes widespread enough there is the chance that Apple will just straight up remove this method. After all, the reason this wasn’t possible till now is Apple was afraid people would side load. And of course it almost goes without saying that there is the malware issue, but hopefully anybody trying this isn’t stupid enough to compile and install malware.

From now on, the company's stores will simply go by "Apple" followed by the location of that specific store. For example, only a couple days ago, Apple opened the doors to Apple World Trade Center — not Apple Store, World Trade Center — inside the stunning Oculus / Westfield Mall in lower Manhattan. This is the 10th Apple store in New York City alone. One thing that's not changing: the employees still welcome in the first shoppers with thunderous applause and hand them free t-shirts marking the store's opening. The first shoppers are welcomed into Apple World Trade Center on August 16th, 2016. Yes, this is a very Apple thing to do. Silly? Just a little bit, sure. But Apple would argue that it's not quite change for the sake of change. Beginning with Apple Union Square (which we toured in May), the company has set out to reframe its retail locations as more than the place you go to buy an iPad or Mac. Now, the stores feature gigantic 6K video screens, lush greenery, and some have ditched the traditional Genius Bar setup in favor of giving customers an area to just sit down and hang out. If that's the sort of thing you'd ever want to do at the Apple Store store. Apple's newest stores feature sections where customers can simply... sit. It's a move spearheaded by Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior VP of retail. "The store becomes one with the community," she said at the unveiling of Apple Union Square. According to MacRumors, Apple has emailed its retail staff with confirmation that "Apple Store" is no more. The rebranding is already reflected on every website for Apple's various stores, though the change may take slightly longer to completely roll out in-store. Aside from being positioned as more of a community hub, Apple stores are quickly taking on a more boutique feel, with fancy headphone setups and "avenue" displays that will change on a seasonal basis to showcase different products; currently they're focused on iPhone photography accessories. Everything you expect from the Apple store (see? lowercase) remains, but Apple is changing up the feel — and name — to keep that foot traffic high day in and day out.

Well, kinda. His 45-minute visual album Endless was released through Apple Music at midnight on Friday and was then linked from the album’s site.  Nearly three weeks since its launch, the live stream familiar to fans, called Endless, reappeared on Ocean’s website, boysdontcry.co, this time to a soundtrack of what appeared to be complete songs instead of the little musical interludes that were featured before. When the stream was reactivated on Thursday night, Apple quickly confirmed that a video version of the Endless stream would be available exclusively on Apple Music that night.  “ENDLESS” A film by Frank Ocean. Now on Apple Music. #ENDLESShttps://t.co/IKMm2PNsUH pic.twitter.com/nlLxXoQ296 — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 19, 2016 However, an Apple Music rep confirmed to Rolling Stone on Friday that Endless was a separate project from the long awaited sophomore album, which would potentially be released over the weekend and the endlessly elusive album was going to be renamed. This announcement comes after Malay, a music producer for Ocean’s Channel Orange, took to Reddit early this week to address the delayed released of the then-titled album, Boys Don’t Cry. “It’s about making sure that the perfect aesthetic for the situation has been reached, to do that, takes constant tweaking, trial, and error… That goes for any creative situation,” he wrote to users in his Ask Me Anything session.   Between August 1-4, a video stream of random woodworking and music clips teased fans into thinking a August 5 release date was in the cards, and was certainly egged on by a New York Times article that was tipped off by an unnamed source. With no new release from Ocean that Friday, the video stream stopped after Ocean appeared to be assembling a spiral staircase reaching to the roof of the warehouse. Perhaps the new album can be found up there? As the video version of Endless drops on the annoyingly exclusive and pricy Apple Music, Twitter pandemonium isn’t even worth noting anymore.  Fans are either going nuts over the new Ocean material or are still unabashedly airing their (Frankly) justified frustrations. © Copyright (c) National Post Original source article: Frank Ocean’s video album Endless indicates the artist’s second coming is just that much closer       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       Frank Ocean in a post from his sophomore album's website       E-mail this Gallery Print this Gallery Share this Gallery         Entertainment Photo Galleries »   Lindsay Lohan The funniest celebrity mugshots...

The company tweeted a link to the music video "Endless" by the R&B artist on Thursday night. The link is only available to subscribers of Apple's music streaming service. The video shows black-and-white footage of Ocean building a staircase in a warehouse over new music, a different approach from the series of connected music videos that Beyonce released on HBO for her visual album, "Lemonade." Ocean is credited as the director of the video, and it features a cover of an Isley Brothers song and guest musicians James Blake, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead and the London Contemporary Orchestra. Ocean has been teasing information about his next album on his website boysdontcry.co, but representatives from Universal Music Group and Apple Music didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Fans have been anxiously awaiting the 28-year-old singer's first album in four years. Ocean's widely acclaimed debut album, "Channel Orange," was released in 2012. The record featured the hit song "Thinkin bout You" and earned him two Grammy Awards, including best urban contemporary album. Ocean is known for his previous association with the alternative hip-hop group Odd Future. He has also written songs for Beyonce, Justin Bieber, John Legend and Brandy. He appeared on two songs from Jay Z and Kanye West's collaborative album, "Watch the Throne."

Photo: Reuters Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密) has committed itself to Apple Inc’s initiatives for a clean environment by reducing waste and using sources of renewable energy. Apple said that Hon Hai, known as Foxconn Technology Group (富士康) outside Taiwan, is among its 14 final assemblers in China that have “safety science” firm UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification. According to Apple, the UL standard certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted or used to generate energy when possible. Apple said that since the landfill validation program began in January last year, assembly sites have diverted more than 140,000 tonnes of waste from landfills. Hon Hai assembly sites in Guangdong Province’s Shenzhen and Shanxi Province’s Taiyuan were the first in China to receive the certification in terms of waste treatment, Apple said. Hon Hai, which operates a broad production site in China and employs about 1 million workers there, makes iPhones and iPads for Apple. Hon Hai has a production compound in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, where the Taiwanese firm is to complete a program to build facilities capable of generating 400 megawatts of solar energy per year by 2018, the US firm said. Apple said that Hon Hai’s first project to produce 80 megawatts of solar energy was proceeding smoothly. Apple said that it will partner with suppliers in China to install more than 2 gigawatts of “clean” energy in the coming years in a bid to cut more than 20 million tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution in the nation by 2020. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson said in a statement. In related news, Hon Hai is expected to see improved sales this quarter on the back of the upcoming launch of new iPhones, analysts said. “We expect Hon Hai to go into mass production for new iPhones from the end of this month, benefiting its revenue performance this quarter,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Thompson Wu (武光明) said in a note to clients on Monday. Wu forecast that Hon Hai’s revenue would expand by 9.4 percent to NT$1 trillion (US$31.63 billion) this quarter from last quarter’s NT$922.13 billion. Gross margin is estimated to climb above 7 percent this quarter from 6 percent last quarter, due to a bigger revenue scale and higher production utilization rate, Wu said. Daiwa Capital Markets Inc analyst Kylie Huang (黃奎毓) said in a note on Friday last week that a larger revenue scale and favorable product mix would boost Hon Hai’s gross margin to 7.1 percent this quarter. Hon Hai reported net profit of NT$17.7 billion in the second quarter, with earnings per share of NT$1.13, 30 percent below the market’s consensus estimate, Huang said.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Aug 20, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Australian regulator says no to banks, Apple tie-up Reuters, SYDNEY Australia’s anti-trust regulator yesterday said it would not grant the nation’s three biggest banks interim approval to collectively negotiate with Apple Inc to install their own electronic payments applications on iPhones. Australia’s three biggest banks, including No. 1 lender National Australia Bank Ltd, last month lodged a joint application seeking permission to negotiate as a bloc from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The commission said that its decision to not grant the banks the interim ruling was not indicative of whether the full ruling, expected in October, would be successful. “The ACCC has considered interim authorization within a short time frame at the request of the applicants,” commission chairman Rod Sims said. “However, given the complexity of the issues and the limited time available, the ACCC has decided not to grant interim authorization at this time,” he said. “The ACCC requires more time to consult and consider the views of industry, consumers and other interested parties.” Apple, which operates its own Apple Pay mobile wallet, does not allow third-party electronic payment apps to be loaded onto the hugely popular smartphones. The banks are seeking to be able to negotiate jointly for access to Apple’s smartphones without themselves being accused of breaching anti-competition law. The three banks contend that while Apple allows apps on iPhones using other commonplace technology, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, restricting the technology through which mobile wallets function — known as near-field communication — constitutes anti-competitive behavior.

Thursday night, singer Frank Ocean released a long-awaited new work: Endless, available exclusively — at least for now — as a 45-minute film on Apple Music. This is Ocean's first studio project since his Channel Orange was released in 2012, the musician's breakout year as a solo artist after his days as a member of the Odd Future collective and, prior to that, as a songwriter for artists like Justin Bieber, John Legend and Brandy. Ocean himself has been feeding into the sentiment that his new project, thought to be titled Boys Don't Cry, released instead as Endless, has been all too long in coming — and his team has been slyly building up anticipation for it, beginning with the image that greets visitors to the home page of the album's website. It's of an old-fashioned library card, with "July 02 2015" scratched out and followed by a string of now-passed dates (save one). For the past week and change, the site has also carried an odd video of, for the most part, nothing remarkable — benches in a what look like a glaringly lit warehouse with an occasional appearance by Ocean, who seemed to be cutting or painting wood, and brief stretches of ambient or looped music. All of it fueled the flames of Frank Ocean fans' ardor. According to a report published at the beginning of August in the New York Times, this launch is being accompanied by some kind of print publication, which will be available in Apple's retail locations — making for a multi-platform, multi-media release entirely exclusive to Apple's distribution chain. Ocean's deal with Apple appears to be the latest volley in the competition between subscription streaming services to stake claims to early-distribution deals with certain high-profile artists, as Beyonce, Kanye West and Rihanna did with their most recent albums (Lemonade, which aired on HBO as well, The Life of Pablo and Anti, respectively) on the platform of which they are all co-owners: Tidal. These days, considering the constant and direct communication that many artists have with their fans on various social media channels, a four-year gap between releases seems like almost a generational divide (though, for comparison's sake, five years went by between the release of Radiohead's 2011 album The King of Limbs and the group's A Moon Shaped Pool earlier this year). Frank Ocean's preferred platform has been Tumblr; it's where he has written, searchingly, about his sexuality and, more recently, a meditation about the treatment of LGBT people in the U.S. and across the globe in this visibly violent year.

Overall sales of mobile phones contracted by 0.5 percent with only five vendors from the top 10 showing growth. Among them were four Chinese manufacturers (Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK Communication Equipment) and South Korea’s Samsung. “Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, in a statement. In addition, the decline in sales of “feature phones” (down 14 percent) bolstered the decline in overall sales of mobile phones in the second quarter of 2016 (see Table 1). All mature markets except Japan saw slowing demand for smartphones leading to a decline in sales of 4.9 percent. In contrast, all emerging regions except Latin America saw growth, which led to smartphone sales growing by 9.9 percent. Table 1: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Gartner: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Source: Gartner (August 2016) Apple continued its downward trend with a decline of 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Apple sales declined in North America (its biggest market) as well as in Western Europe. However, it witnessed its worst sales decline in Greater China and mature Asia/Pacific regions, where sales declined 26 percent. Apple had its best performance in Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe regions in the second quarter of 2016, where iPhone sales grew more than 95 percent year on year. In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets. Among the top five smartphone vendors, Oppo exhibited the highest growth in the second quarter of 2016 at 129 percent. This is due to strong sales of its R9 handset in China and overseas. “Features such as an anti-shake camera optimized for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditized smartphone market,” said Mr. Gupta. In terms of the smartphone operating system (OS) market, Android regained share over iOS to achieve an 86 percent share (see Table 2) in the second quarter of 2016. Android’s performance continued to come from demand for mid- to lower-end smartphones from emerging markets, but also from premium smartphones, which recorded a 6.5 percent increase in the second quarter of 2016. A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with the Galaxy S7, introduced their new high-end devices, but Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium smartphone ranges with more affordable devices. “Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology,” said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner, in a statement. “Facing a highly commoditized smartphone market, Google’s focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV.” Table 2: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Gartner: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Source: Gartner (August 2016) “The top five smartphone manufacturers together continued to gain market share in the second quarter of 2016 — up from 51.5 percent to 54 percent year on year, led by Oppo, Samsung and Huawei,” said Mr. Gupta.

Overall sales of mobile phones contracted by 0.5 percent with only five vendors from the top 10 showing growth. Among them were four Chinese manufacturers (Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK Communication Equipment) and South Korea’s Samsung. “Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, in a statement. In addition, the decline in sales of “feature phones” (down 14 percent) bolstered the decline in overall sales of mobile phones in the second quarter of 2016 (see Table 1). All mature markets except Japan saw slowing demand for smartphones leading to a decline in sales of 4.9 percent. In contrast, all emerging regions except Latin America saw growth, which led to smartphone sales growing by 9.9 percent. Table 1: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Gartner: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Source: Gartner (August 2016) Apple continued its downward trend with a decline of 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Apple sales declined in North America (its biggest market) as well as in Western Europe. However, it witnessed its worst sales decline in Greater China and mature Asia/Pacific regions, where sales declined 26 percent. Apple had its best performance in Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe regions in the second quarter of 2016, where iPhone sales grew more than 95 percent year on year. In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets. Among the top five smartphone vendors, Oppo exhibited the highest growth in the second quarter of 2016 at 129 percent. This is due to strong sales of its R9 handset in China and overseas. “Features such as an anti-shake camera optimized for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditized smartphone market,” said Mr. Gupta. In terms of the smartphone operating system (OS) market, Android regained share over iOS to achieve an 86 percent share (see Table 2) in the second quarter of 2016. Android’s performance continued to come from demand for mid- to lower-end smartphones from emerging markets, but also from premium smartphones, which recorded a 6.5 percent increase in the second quarter of 2016. A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with the Galaxy S7, introduced their new high-end devices, but Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium smartphone ranges with more affordable devices. “Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology,” said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner, in a statement. “Facing a highly commoditized smartphone market, Google’s focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV.” Table 2: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Gartner: Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Source: Gartner (August 2016) “The top five smartphone manufacturers together continued to gain market share in the second quarter of 2016 — up from 51.5 percent to 54 percent year on year, led by Oppo, Samsung and Huawei,” said Mr. Gupta.

I spent some time looking around the internet and talking to people about why they love their Macs. Most of the answers are ones you’d probably expect, but a couple of them might catch you by surprise! Durability This is one that comes up a lot. Computers all wear out, but Macs tend to run for a very long time. One Facebook commenter put it this way: “Was sick of replacing PC after every 3 years for bs slowness and not user friendly. Have had my Macbook for 4 years now.” And a commenter on a recent article reported that he’s still using a Mac from 2009 — getting seven years of use out of a computer is nothing to scoff at, especially when many cease to function after four.

Read More is a good idea, it’s rarely necessary. Low Maintenance Speaking of maintenance, that’s another point that people brought up a lot: Macs don’t need much. A number of people mentioned the fact that they rarely have to go through long update processes: many updates simply install by themselves, often not even requiring a restart. And many of the maintenance tasks that need to be done are completed automatically. Ads by Google When it actually comes to performing maintenance, there are some really great apps that you can use to get it all done with minimal effort (all-in-one app OnyX OnyX Gives Access To All Kinds Of Hidden Mac Options [Mac] OnyX Gives Access To All Kinds Of Hidden Mac Options [Mac] Keeping your Mac running in tip-top shape is important.

A number of people emphasized the reliability of Macs, with one commenter pointing out: “Reliability. The fact I don’t I don’t need to fiddle with it every week in order to disable some annoying pop up. . . . Not having to reinstall every year because something has slowed the entire system down.” While there are things you can do to automate maintenance on Windows machines, the fact that Macs need little attention compared to other systems is what leads to the oft-maligned sentiment that “Macs just work.” You may disagree, but you’ll find few Mac users who don’t love how easy is it to keep a Mac running smoothly. Ease of Use One of the most common refrains you’ll hear when people talk about why they think Macs are better than Windows machines is that Macs are “easier to use,” though few people are able to identify exactly what that means. Taylor Wilson at KSL.com puts it very well: “Apple’s operating system, OS X, hides a lot of things that you don’t usually need to see. Finding the app you want is usually as simple as clicking its icon on the dock, and doesn’t involve digging through any menus or folders. Connecting to Wi-Fi is the same thing — click the Wi-Fi icon; click the network you want; and type in the password. In general, the things you use the most are easier to get to than on Windows.” He also points out that OS X contains really useful things for finding your way, like Spaces and Mission Control. And it’s tough to beat the power of Spotlight Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Spotlight has been a killer Mac feature for years, with Cupertino regularly schooling Redmond in the art of desktop search. Here are a few tips to help you find more on your Mac. Read More . The tradeoff for hiding the things you don’t need is usually that there’s less customizability, which is usually granted with Macs, but the vast majority of dedicated users seem to find this an easy trade to make. Stability OS X is a very stable operating system: it almost always does what you want it to do when you want it to do it. This is, of course, something you could say about a lot of operating systems, but one thing that stands out is that it’s really hard to crash a Mac. When I was still using Windows computers, I had crashes on a fairly regular basis Why Does Windows Crash? The Top 10 Reasons Why Does Windows Crash? The Top 10 Reasons Oh, great. Another blue screen, boot issue or frozen screen in Windows. Now you have to restart and lose most or all of the work you’d been trying to accomplish. It’s frustrating both because of... Read More ; but I’ve only irretrievably crashed a Mac a handful of times in the decade or so I’ve been using one. One of the biggest reasons why Apple’s operating system is so stable is that it’s highly tailored for the hardware that it’s run on. While you can cobble together a Hackintosh, the vast majority of people using OS X will be using it on an Apple-made computer. Windows, on the other hand, is run on an entire spectrum of machines, from the cheapest knockoffs to the most expensive gaming rigs — and trying to craft an operating system that works well across that range isn’t easy. Apple simply has the natural advantage by way of controlling the hardware and software ecosystem. If you want to upgrade your Mac when you buy it, you can do so but you’ll only be able to choose from a few Apple-approved options like more RAM, and a spacier SSD. Design There’s little point in arguing against the fact that Apple products are extremely well-designed. Apple’s Chief Design Officer, Sir Jony Ive, has won a number of awards for his designs, including being knighted and recognized for “services to design and enterprise.” You might not agree with all of Apple’s design decisions, but there’s no denying that they appeal to a huge portion of the public. Or, as a friend of mine put it, “My hipster points went up by 34 so sitting pretty cool in the coffee shops.” There’s certainly something to be said for trendiness. It’s not just the hardware design, though; Apple’s software design team has created phenomenally well-designed user interfaces for its products, combining pleasing aesthetics with ease of use. You can talk trash about their fling with skeuomorphic design Digital Leather Binding: The Rise And Fall of Skeuomorphic Design Digital Leather Binding: The Rise And Fall of Skeuomorphic Design "Skeuomorphic" design – software that resembles the physical objects it replaces – went from being the hot design principle to an insult in an amazingly short period of time. Read More , but in general, people find Apple software pretty easy to use. Ecosystem This could be construed as either an advantage or a drawback of using a Mac, but a number of the people I talked to pointed out the fact that having an Apple computer is a notable convenience when using an iPhone and an iPad. If you’re an Android fan, this isn’t going to appeal to you very much, but Apple’s phone and tablet are hugely popular, so it’s a big deal to a lot of people. While some people might feel trapped by Apple’s ecosystem Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget You love your Android phone and want to buy a tablet. Everyone tells you the iPad is the best tablet, and it really is the best; but you should still buy an Android tablet. Read More , the fact that many of their devices and a great deal of their software is created to work together perfectly is great for people who don’t have a problem with it. By making desktops, laptops, phones, tablets, MP3 players, and a variety of software that are meant to mesh perfectly, Apple has created an experience that is appealing to a lot of users. “[T]he ecosystem is incomparable,” said a Facebook commenter. He’s definitely right, but whether you think that’s a good thing is largely subjective. Customer Service Being able to talk to the same customer service people for problems with any device in the ecosystem is another big benefit that people appreciate. There’s no doubt that the men and women staffing the Genius Bar at any Apple store really know what they’re doing, and anecdotal reviews of experiences with Apple customer service are generally positive. Apple techs undergo a lot of training What Training Do Apple Technicians Need to Fix iOS & Mac Devices? What Training Do Apple Technicians Need to Fix iOS & Mac Devices?

High customer satisfaction ratings and a large network of stores capable of performing certain repairs on-site give AppleCare the edge over the average warranty - but are the benefits really worth the price? Read More is a good idea or not, or if you think paying extra for a computer so you can get great customer service is a great deal or a rip-off, it’s definitely one of the reasons many people choose Apple hardware. They don’t usually tend to have a lot of problems, but when they do, there’s always someone that’s available to help you fix it. Unix While it doesn’t come up as often as the other items in this list, a lot of people really appreciate the fact that a Unix command line is only a click or two away, and it can be a really great way to interact with your Mac Mac CLI Simplifies Your Command Line So You Can Work Faster Mac CLI Simplifies Your Command Line So You Can Work Faster The Terminal is a powerful and fast way to work but it can be intimidating for many users.

Read More can make some processes a lot easier, and taking the time to become a command line master can help you go from a Mac newbie to a power user in no time. One Facebook commenter put it this way: “Access to an actual *nix command line, so any Linux tricks you find will work, and working the latest Node / Ruby / Python is trivial. I pity any web developer trying to make a living on Windows. Actually I don’t, because they don’t exist. :-)” The command line is great for Linux users, web developers, programmers, and anyone else who needs a bit more power than is offered by the GUI. Another commenter who has experience with both Windows and Linux put it this way: “Put simply, Apple’s desktop operating system it’s roughly as powerful as open source operating systems 3 UNIX-Like Operating Systems That Aren't Linux 3 UNIX-Like Operating Systems That Aren't Linux Recently, people started to confuse "UNIX" with "Linux."

These eight reasons explain why a lot of people love their Macs, but everyone has their own reasons. Every user has unique needs, mission-critical apps, and separate reasons for sticking with Apple when there are more powerful, flexible, and affordable options out there. We want to hear what you love — or even what you don’t love — about your Mac. Why do you stick with your Mac? If you don’t use a Mac, what would get you to try one? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

The office strictly uses Windows. My machine at work is an i5 Dell Windows 10 machine. At home I have a MacPro 15" retina I purchased in 2013. My wife has a 13" Macbook Pro. At home I have been using Macs and iPhones for about 8 years now. I enjoy how everything works together, but I am not going to knock MS. They have come a long way. Windows 10 is a beautiful operating system that loads faster and runs more solidly than previous versions. I enjoy working with it everyday. I prefer Mac, but I would gladly run Windows 10. To each his own, but they both have their perks and faults! Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:35 pm They both certainly do have perks and faults; there's no denying that! I haven't had the chance to use Windows 10 yet, but I heard good things. Do you find it difficult to switch between the two so regularly, or has it just become second nature? Reply Robyn August 24, 2016 at 11:22 am The best thing I'm liking about working on my 2011 MacBook Pro (and a MacBook White - Core 2 Duo, which I'm slowly refurbishing) is that in a LOT of ways, they behave JUST LIKE LINUX MINT! Rock-solid, stable, predictable, no-dramas computing, which I can't say for my high-maintenance Windows machine, which I wouldn't even keep around except for certain software the developers don't have the insight to develop a Linux version for. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:34 pm "high-maintenance" is something I've been hearing people use to describe Windows machines more often now. People talk trash about the "Macs just work" thing, but it really seems to hold true. The licensing stuff is a huge pain; it would be much easier if everyone could just develop for the systems they want! Reply Blip August 24, 2016 at 3:26 am The whole "hipster in a coffee shop" reminded me of a funny story where my brother and I were sitting in an airport bar. We had our laptops out connected by a crossover cable playing Starcraft having a good old time, when a couple of hipsters sat down next to us and pulled their MacBooks out. Eventually we started getting a crowd around us watching us play and this really annoyed the hipsters because no one was paying attention to them or their lame computers. Macs are not an option if you are a gamer. I'm a web developer as well for a huge company and we have about 10 times as many people using PCs than Macs. Graphic designers are a different story, but they're technically challenged anyway. So maybe look somewhere other than Facebook for real world data. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:33 pm Were the "hipsters" audibly talking about how they wanted people to pay attention to them, or are you just assuming that they wanted that attention? The gaming argument is one that's solid; gaming on a Mac isn't easy. It can be done, but you have to make sacrifices, cobble together a Hackintosh, or stick with pretty small-scale games (with the quality of indie games coming out now, though, that's not just a sacrifice). And yes, there are a lot of graphic designers that use Macs; creative of all types, really. Photography, design, visual arts, music . . . Macs are set up really well for that stuff. Reply Bryan Wolfe August 23, 2016 at 5:36 pm Continue to love Mac and sometimes use Windows 10. Both operation systems are mostly stable and short on new features each year. Very mature market, obviously. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:31 pm "Short on new features each year" is a funny way to say that . . . but totally true. It often seems like OSes are a step behind where they should be. I haven't tried Windows 10 yet, but I hear good things! Reply Tom J. Maggio August 22, 2016 at 2:59 am I'm a MS-SQL guy...well, really a database guy but most experience goes back to MS-SQL 6.5...but I digress. About a year and a half ago, my younger son gave me his 2005 PPC based Mac mini. I fell in love with it even though it has minimal hardware... but that started my Mac addiction. So now I have 5 Mac minis that I play on every day 2005, early 2006 Core Solo, Mid 2007 Core 2 Duo, Late 2009 forgot the processor on that one, and a Late 2012 i5. I love them all, I've had a blast accessorizing them and I'm gradually learning each of the OS X's starting with Tiger. I bought my wife a 2013 MacBook Pro about a month ago. I love both the skeuomorphic and minimalist designs. The bottom line is that they are elegant, crisp and fun to work with. I love to tinker upgrade and improve them. In the past, I thought Apple was meh, but when my son gave me his machine it opened a whole new world to play in and made me enjoy technology again. Plus my birthday is the same as Steve Jobs, February 24. The other devices are fun too..I have an iPod Classic which is totally fun but I want to get a Pink iPod Touch...I don't know why...just for the heck of it. And I've had the opportunity to help others get more milage out their older machine through SSD and more RAM. Enough about me...but I just love em. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:30 pm Glad to hear you're enjoying your various Macs! That's a lot of Apple machines in one household. :-) Do you do work on either your Windows or Apple computers? I'm curious as to which people use to work and which they use for personal stuff. Reply Tom J. Maggio September 11, 2016 at 7:31 pm Hi Dan: Replying to your comment below. At work, I am on Windows all day. So when I get home I get to "play" in Mac world till I go to sleep. I've brought my Mini to work before and it was a lot of phone doing work on it. There is something about the environment that just makes it enjoyable, whether for work or play. I did my tax return on the Mac this year...a good work use at home. Very happy with my experience with Apple so far. Tom Reply AgentX August 20, 2016 at 6:30 pm "I pity any web developer trying to make a living on Windows. Actually I don’t, because they don’t exist." that's just ridiculous. i'm a CS student and i know a lot of web developers, and lived with two for a year. with the exception of few all of them use windows as their primary operating system. my brother is a senior web developer he has a macbook pro even he does most of his work on Windows PC Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:29 pm It's possible that it depends on what you're developing for. Not being a developer myself, and not having any experience in the field, that's just a guess. I could certainly be wrong. Reply Oldcoot August 19, 2016 at 6:12 pm OLDCOOT HERE Sounds like a love affair rather then actual performance, usability, etc. I have a Win XP since 2001, it still works very well and still use it mostly now as a backup computer, and a Win Vista since 2006, which I converted to Win 7 (Vista was a real pain), this same computer is still awesome updated automatically to Win 10. I strongly believe Microsoft dropped the ball, XP was by far the best OS but needed changes to be made to accommodate today's requirements, the old saying don't fix it if it's not broke couldn't be truer today - take head Microsoft. Any Win Computer is darn good unless an idiot uses it. My reason for the Windows is the price, believe it or not, the XP I paid $300.00 for and now it's'2016 and still in great working condition, so why on gods green earth would anyone fork over at least 1200.00 + now. Also the choice of software for Windows was greater, not sure about now since I haven't looked, found no need to. It's not the machine, it's the one using it that makes a bad computer. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:28 pm It's not that Windows machines are BAD, it's just that Mac users really love their Macs, and a lot of them cite the same reasons; build quality, display, OS layout, and so on. Usability is definitely something that's brought up over and over, and has been for a long time, so there's definitely a good argument there. As for performance, you can get a high-end machine from any company, so that's pretty much a moot point. Interesting that you say XP was the best OS; that's not something I've heard before. What do you think made it so good? Reply Rann Xeroxx August 19, 2016 at 5:04 pm I support both Macs and PCs (and some Linux desktops) at my enterprise. We buy premium PCs, spending over $1k for good laptops, which are still cheaper then comparable Macs. We find about the same failure rate in both hardware and OS on both platforms. Our PCs are locked down as Standard Users, much like a Mac setup, so little ability to screw up the OS. Vendor relations with Mac re-sellers or Apple directly is, not bad, but vendors like Dell are just so easy to work with that they put any other vendor, including other PC vendors, to shame. One thing I can say about the Macs is that although their processors and mem are on par with PCs, they do make great screens and having a great screen really keeps an older computer a much longer life span as display is typically one of the best upgrades now that PCs are about as fast as they all need to be. Reply Dann Albright August 31, 2016 at 6:26 pm That's a good point; the screens on Macs are pretty amazing. I don't know anything about working with vendors, but that's definitely something it makes sense to consider if you're deciding between the two for a business. Thanks for your comment!

And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark’s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark’s Daily Apple community please contact me here. I’ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading! It all started with a shopping cart full of Marie Callender’s frozen meals, lean pockets, and cereal boxes. I had decided that I wanted to stop being fat. As an elementary schooler, this meant that I would ask my mom what this would require and follow her advice. “Don’t eat anything with over 1/3 of the calories being supplied by fat. Here’s how to do the math…” Who doesn’t love the taste of processed carbs and sugar? These low-fat shenanigans (eeeeeevil shenanigans) transitioned into the “cereal for every meal” diet, during which my uncle presented me with a dozen or two of generic cereal boxes. I loved eating it and it was what I was told would lower my body fat. As I was often the fattest body in the room during school or other gatherings, I followed any advice I received wholeheartedly. The only time I was safe from being the heaviest set soul in the building, was when I was fortunate enough for my little brother or the half dozen more obese kids in my school to steal people’s attention with their own chubbiness. Soccer was always an integral part of my life, and I’m sure it helped my body composition, but it never solved the issue. My triathlete, body-building, never-stop-moving uncle was kind enough to help motivate me to join him in his endurance endeavors as well as provide support for the gym. I followed his body-building style, extended session workouts while simultaneously dabbling in P90X, Body By Science by Kris Gethin, and the conventional low-fat, high PUFA propaganda. I even poured my heart and soul into two years of MMA training followed by two years of wrestling in high school. The body fat wouldn’t go away. Combined with mild gynecomastia, self-confidence and self-worth was not very high. The MMA and wrestling made me feel a lot better about myself, but all too often I could be found wasting copious amounts of time watching the cooking channel, playing Call of Duty, or reading. Sedentary living was my default setting. All the way until college, I had a negative image of my body and no real passion in life, aside from being a health nut that didn’t appear to know what he was talking about. And then one of the ROTC cadets posted Sugar: The Bitter Truth on our Facebook group page. I was enthralled. I went straight to Amazon and bought The Paleo Diet for Athletes by Lorain Cordain. I read the book cover to cover as fast as my engineering work load at The Ohio State University would permit. Internet searches of “Paleo” inevitably led me to Mark’s site. Ever since the day I stumbled upon it in March 2011, I haven’t missed a single post! I immediately ditched all grains, sugar, soy, diary, legumes, and alcohol. I also implemented a workout regimen more in line with The Primal Blueprint’s fitness pyramid. There was never an immediate weight loss, or anything else visibly dramatic, but I slowly gained more muscle and lost fat. Most beneficial for me though were the posts about social implications of the decisions humans make. Because of Mark, I was pushed toward my passion in life: sustainable agriculture. Somewhere in the onslaught of interesting posts, Mark created a vision in my head that we need to be more careful of how we grow food and grow it in a manner that creates high nutrient yield, while reducing pollution. These ideas inspired me to watch Peter Bane speak on campus about Permaculture. The presentation was so interesting, I changed majors from Mechanical Engineering the following day! The other lesser acknowledged, but highly beneficial, component of going Primal is the phycological considerations. The posts about body image and accepting one’s self were highly influential to my life and raised it’s quality tremendously! The idea that I could completely ignore how I look, and focus on how I feel, while in the process of making good decisions that promote my holistic wellness and health, was liberating and motivational. I now make decisions based not on “What will cause me to lose another ounce of body fat?” but “What will make me more capable of providing benefits for society or a friend, partner, or family member?” I now am very nearly completely accepting of who I am and what I look like, and it feels so great to acknowledge that every day. I can’t say definitively that the changes in my mind wouldn’t have occurred without Mark’s guidance, but “going primal” has been so influential that I have to give it the benefit of the doubt. Eating in a manner that minimized carbon dioxide emissions, hazardous pesticide use, nutrient runoff, soil erosion, and ingestion of toxic and detrimental compounds (sugar, processed grains, and industrial oils) while maximizing nutrients and flavor is a joy, my passion in life, and hopefully my career! I say “hopefully” because I am currently searching for employment this moment in Puerto Rico. 🙂 Zach   Print Post navigation twentysixteen < Previous post Why Grok Didn’t Have Work-Life Balance and Neither Will You twentysixteen Next post > Primal N’Oatmeal Subscribe to the Newsletter Related Posts Five Years Paleo—and NEVER Looking Back!

Follow TechnoBuffalo I thought Apple was silly when it first introduced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. A few months later, I believed Apple was scamming customers when it followed it up with the still-uber-expensive iPad Pro 9.7, a smaller model with most of the same features. I didn’t think it was going to be a really productive tablet, and I doubted the claims that people actually worked from one. Instead, a few months back, I bought an ASUS Chromebook Flip, which I still love, and was more envious of colleagues with the powerful Surface Pro 4, which I’ve since used. A couple of weeks ago, though, as I started looking forward to my upcoming trip to IFA in Berlin, I began researching a new tablet for myself. I wanted something that would enable me to work on-the-go, but also something for movies, light gaming and staying in touch with my wife from abroad. I walked into Best Buy, as I’m still apt to do when I want to try something I haven’t reviewed, and started playing around with the tablets. I was first struck by the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, a tablet that’s currently priced at a budget-friendly $349 and which features a gorgeous display. I know it’s also getting long in the tooth, though, so that wasn’t going to work. Then I thought, heck, my colleagues love the iPad Pro, maybe I’ll give it a look. The price scared me. All in, for the 128GB iPad Pro 9.7, with the keyboard and Apple Pencil, I was looking at $1,000 or so. Knowing Best Buy’s return policy, though, I figured I could give it a try for 14 days and then return it if it didn’t work out for me. So far it has, and it’s not going back to Best Buy The iPad Pro 9.7 has changed my work habits. When I wake up in the morning, I’ll take it from my nightstand and start the day sitting at my kitchen table, reading the news, drinking coffee, and cruising through Twitter. If there’s something big going on, I’ll write a story before I take my wife to the train. The rest of the day is spent on my Windows 10 PC in my office, for the most part, until the evening when I return to the iPad Pro. I’ll finish editing and scheduling posts for some of our west coast writers from the iPad Pro while doing the daily NYT Crossword, for example, an app that I found isn’t available on Android tablets. I love the portability. If I decide to change my work habits, I’ll bring the iPad Pro with me in the car, ready to edit or write a story from a coffee shop or diner over lunch. It’s lighter than my other devices and offers exactly what I need. And while my Chromebook offered a similar experience in terms of productivity, the better display, comfortable keyboard (it’s really amazing) and larger selection of apps keep bringing me back to the iPad Pro. At night, before bed, it’s the perfect tablet for browsing the WSJ and NYT apps, chatting with friends on GroupMe and reading books. The Night Shift feature, which I love, filters out blue light so it’s easier to fall asleep. Then, when I decide to hit the sack, I put the iPad Pro on my bedside table and the cycle begins anew. I’m quick to criticize new products, our readers know that all too well, but I was wrong about the iPad Pro.

Smartphone snappers cannot have failed to notice that the images they take are of mediocre quality at best – and totally appalling at worst. And it’s no surprise really, considering the tininess of smartphone lenses and the shakiness of the often drunk people who operate them. Reuters 1 But Apple has been heroically trying to boost the quality of the world’s pictures and appears to have big plans for its upcoming iPhone 7, which is set to be revealed in September. The latest piece of gossip to emanate from the Apple rumour mill suggests the camera in the tech titan’s next smartphone will be fitted with special stabilisation technology to make snaps a little less shaky. The image below was published by a French blog called NowhereElse. It shows “purported” camera which could be set to feature in the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 : Son capteur photo en fuite ? https://t.co/Sh4JB3AR0E #iPhone7 pic.twitter.com/mSqwX4Whas — Steve Hemmerstoffer (@stagueve) August 18, 2016 Apple watchers suggested the lens is equipped with technology which lets it “float” slightly, cutting down on wobbles to produce a clearer, sharper image. A similar feature was installed on the larger, more expensive “plus” models of iPhone, but if the rumour is true, Apple is planning to bring the feature to the masses. Of course, Apple can only help with the technical aspects of photography and not the creative ones. Sadly, the fruity firm won’t be able to stop people snapping endless images of their mates lined up in front of the bar of some dingy town centre nightclub or publishing “sausage leg” pictures taken on the beaches of Benidorm.

AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among the members of the 'Robocall Strike Force,' which will work with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.  The group was holding its first meeting with the FCC on Friday. More than 30 major technology companies are joining the U.S. government to crack down on automated, prerecorded telephone calls.  THE ROBOCALL SCOURGE  Hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have suffered from the calls, particularly from personal protection insurance and accident claims companies.  The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on 'concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,' said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, who is chairing the group. The group hopes to put in place Caller ID verification standards that would help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and to consider a 'Do Not Originate' list that would block spoofers from impersonating specific phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists.

Share this article Share 55 shares 'This scourge must stop,' Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. Wheeler has said robocalls continue 'due in large part to industry inaction.' 'The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,' Wheeler said. Stephenson emphasized 'the breadth and complexity' of the robocall problem. 'This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,' Stephenson said.  'Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.' The FCC does not require phone providers to offer robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged providers to offer those services at no charge to consumers. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. 'We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,' Stephenson said.  'We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.' Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had 'preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.' Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Taiwan Commentary Says Apple is Losing Market Share and Influence with Local Supply Chain Players | Main | Apple Invents a Dendrite-Resistant Battery that Reduces Overheating and More » August 19, 2016 Apple Watch Navigation User Interface for Maps is now a Patent fulfilled   While Patently Apple would love to see every Apple invention in a patent application prior to it coming to market so that we could broadcast it to the world first, it doesn't always work out that conveniently of course. Yes we reported on an Apple smartpen six years straight before we saw the Apple Pencil (one and two). We were miles ahead on a tablet before there was the iPad (2006 and 2008), and even had in-depth patents about Touch ID days before it actually launched (one and two). We covered Apple's first discussion of fingerprint biometrics in a patent back in 2009 or four years before Touch ID came to market. In today's case, Apple's patent application for the Apple Watch working with Maps and the iPhone in sync for turn-by-turn directions was published yesterday at the U.S. Patent Office. It's been out for a while now and so it's technically a patent fulfilled. For Apple fans that are curious to see how a so-called simple feature starts off as a detailed patent application – check out the details here.   Apple's patent FIGS. 6A/6B/6C/6G illustrate exemplary techniques and user interfaces for managing navigation alerts on an Apple Watch; FIG. 7 is an exemplary flow diagram illustrating a method for managing navigation alerts using an electronic device.   Apple patent application 20160238402 was filed in Q3 2015.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

That brings the amount of Apple stock owned by his Berkshire Hathaway to a little more than 15 million shares, or roughly $1.6 billion worth at a recent price of $109. Apple’s share price has risen nearly 20% since trading at $92 less than two months ago. Buffett buying more Apple comes as no surprise, since it’s the type of reliable cash cow that he has built his fortune upon. Apple generates positive cash flow, and shares that largesse with its stockholders in the form of steadily rising dividends. It also enjoys a level of global brand recognition that few other companies can. As I have often said over the past two years, Apple is no longer a growth company but has become the quintessential value stock. With a market capitalization of $590 billion, Apple is simply too big to grow earnings at the same rate it could when it first introduced the iPhone nine years ago. That’s fine if you are patient, long-term investor like Buffett, but not so great if you are a hedge fund manager whose performance is measured in quarters instead of years. That probably explains why Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund managed by Michael Burry, recently sold all 75,000 shares of Apple it owned.  That’s the same Dr. Michael Burry made famous by the bestselling book and movie “The Big Short,” which portrayed him as the neurotic hedge fund manager who made a huge bet against collateralized debt obligations, and so profited as finance-fueled housing market crashed. As the movie accurately depicted, Burry is not one to second guess himself when he believes he is right about something, and in this case he decided it was time to ditch Apple. So far Burry hasn’t said much as to his reasons for exiting Apple, but he did disclose that he opened a large position in Alphabet (formerly Google) at the same time. Trading at nearly 20 times forward earnings, while paying no dividend at all, Alphabet is priced much more like a momentum stock compared to Apple, which trades at only 12 times forward earnings while paying a 2% yield. Clearly, Burry believes that Alphabet’s growth prospects are superior to that of Apple; otherwise, that kind of swap wouldn’t make sense. That’s the same decision that famed, hardnosed investor Carl Icahn made, as we reported back in April (“Icahn Swaps Apple for Xerox”). Icahn bailed out of Apple after concluding that economic weakness in China would prevent the company from achieving its near-term growth objectives. Like many hedge fund managers, Icahn also tends to take a short term view to owning companies, preferring to extract value quickly anyway he can. Burry and Icahn have impressive track records. The fact that they have independently arrived at the same conclusion regarding Apple, which is diametrically opposed to Buffett’s opinion, does not necessarily mean that they are wise and Buffet is foolish. If you are an aggressive investor looking to quickly and vastly outperform the stock market, then owning Apple doesn’t make much sense.  But if you are a conservative investor interested in dependable stocks that should beat the market over the long haul, then Apple fits the bill. Here at Investing Daily, Apple is a core holding in the growth portfolios of both Personal Finance and Utility Forecaster, primarily due to its strong fundamentals. While my IDEAL Stock Rating System assigns a solid score of 7 (on a scale of 0-10) to Apple, it also earns a very high score of 7 (on a scale of 0–8) from our Safety Rating System. It’s rare that the same company scores highly from these two very different rating systems, but when that occurs it usually means that there isn’t much risk in owning the stock.   Stock Talk — Post a comment Comment Guidelines Our Stock Talk section is reserved for productive dialogue pertaining to the content and portfolio recommendations of this service.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Frank Ocean finally released a new album on Friday, but you’ll need an Apple Music subscription to give it a spin. Endless is a 45-minute-long visual album from the elusive artist, and it may just be the first part of a two-pronged musical attack. “ENDLESS” A film by Frank Ocean. Now on Apple Music. #ENDLESShttps://t.co/IKMm2PNsUH pic.twitter.com/nlLxXoQ296 — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 19, 2016 Endless takes place in a large warehouse filmed in black and white. The music is mostly toned down, though there are a few standout moments. The final track, which references various competing smartphone brands like Apple, Samsung and Sony, is a lot of fun. The more atmospheric sections are enjoyable too, and it’s just great to hear so much new music from Frank Ocean all at once. The album also includes contributions from major artists like James Blake, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and the London Contemporary Orchestra, according to the tracklist offered up by Apple Music. Ocean gets musical credits for piano and guitar. He’s also listed as executive producer and creative director. Rolling Stone reports that Endless is actually a separate project from the main album, which was previously called Boys Don’t Cry but will launch this weekend under a new name. The second album will also apparently be an Apple Music exclusive, so it may be time for Frank Ocean fans to subscribe to the service if they haven’t already.

(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images) No chill After countless red herrings and purported release dates, Frank Ocean has finally dropped new music in the form of a mysterious visual album titled Endless on his website and on Apple Music. The black and white stream shows the enigmatic singer building a staircase while giving us a taste of his new tunes, similar to a live stream he posted on his website weeks earlier. Rolling Stone confirmed that Endless is a different project from his proper new album (which is reportedly hitting Apple Music this weekend), and that it is no longer called Boys Don’t Cry as previously reported. While his visual live stream wasn’t exactly the new material that was promised, fans were still overjoyed to be receiving something new and took to the Internet to share their glee. Frank fans knew that he wasn’t trolling when Apple released the good news and a free download for subscribers on their account. “ENDLESS” A film by Frank Ocean.

Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In Everything We Know About The Second Frank Ocean Album Coming This Weekend Bansky Gonzalez 08.19.16 3 months ago • 3 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Getty Image It finally happened, after four long years, Frank Ocean released… well, he released, something. Listed as a “visual album,” Frank’s Endless hit Apple Music late Thursday night and set the Internet on fire. For Apple Music subscribers, the 18-track album plays while Frank builds his literal and metaphorical spiral staircase in black and white, and that’s it. No MP3s, no streaming audio, no purchase option for the songs, simply a 45-minute video of a couple of Frank Ocean clones building stairs for your personal consumption. This is not to make any judgments of the music, it’s just clear this was meant to be consumed by unconventional means. Frank is hardly the first to debut an album by way of an extended video, but he might be the first present it only in that manner, aside from producer/singer The-Dream. What is next for Frank? Because there is clearly something. Before Frank could finish placing the last step on his staircase, the rumors were abound. So let’s sort through them while we wait for his next move. Again. Another Album Is Coming The most abundant rumor that was confirmed by multiple publications after Endless dropped is that Frank has a traditional new album on the way, and sooner rather than later. Originally it was Boys Don’t Cry, the album Frank announced a year ago. That made sense, given his original announcement included the caption “I got two versions. I got twooo versions…” so two albums seemed logical. Eventually, Rolling Stone, who clearly has a well placed source, confirmed the rumor and then noted that Ocean had apparently changed the album’s name. What the new name is remains unknown, as does the reason for the change. The Second Project Is Coming This Weekend The as-of-now nameless album is set to hit Apple Music at some point “this weekend” and what will appear there is anybody’s guess. At least one Endless track was heard last year, Frank’s Isley Brothers/Aaliyah cover “At Your Best (You Are Love),” previously listed as “You Are Luhh” on the day that would have been Aaliyah’s 36th birthday. In fact, a more stripped down version of the cover still exists on Frank’s Tumblr. A Lot Of Artists Who Spoke About Working With Frank Aren’t On Endless The concept of a second album also jives with all of the previous reports from artist who allegedly worked on the album, including Lil B and Iamsu who don’t appear on Endless. In fact, of the artists who publicly spoke about Frank’s album, only James Blake is included on Endless. His New Album Will Probably Feature Versions Of Some Endless Tracks In theory, the album could feature tracks from Endless, either remixed or simply carried over from the film. With the reported features not on Endless, though, there should at least be some new music. He’s had four years to create new music, surely he’s had enough time for two, completely separate and original albums. At some point, you would assume he also released a studio quality version of Endless, at the least to appease fans. But ultimately, this may be the way Frank wanted Endless to be consumed, with the visual and audio of him building a staircase in the background, so as an artist quirk, it’s possible that he never will release it in another medium. Who knows? The only thing that can be stated for sure is that Frank Ocean is finally back, and the world is waiting on and trying to guess what’s next.

Coming this fall to #AppleMusic.@BIRDMAN5STARhttps://t.co/6wQCW5Clxb — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 19, 2016 It was reported last week that Birdman has signed a deal with Apple Music, the Cash Money boss posting a picture to Instagram of himself alongside Larry Jackson, who heads Apple’s original music content. Soon after, the particulars of the deal were made clear, the basis of the partnership being Birdman’s upcoming documentary, with the trailer for that film released Thursday evening (Aug. 18) through the streaming service. Watch the minute-long trailer above, as Birdman’s family and friends detail the conditions that influenced the Big Tymer to become such a successful hustler. Before Anythang will be out this fall via Apple Music, and doesn’t look to be related to the Cash Money biopic that Slim and Baby spoke about in April. “Can I tell you something my brother told me?” Baby asked the moderator at Brooklyn Law School during a speaking engagement. “He said everything we’ve ever did – and I got 20 plus years selling records – nothing we ever did is worth more than that script. I’m excited about the script. That’s something I really want to do.” Whether the Cash Money – Apple Music deal includes anything beyond the Birdman-specific doc isn’t quite clear, but the relationship between the two is established, with Birdman having plenty of ideas, whether they be for clothes, music or film, and Apple having the platform to showcase them. Watch the trailer up above with the move just the latest for the power playing Cash Money mogul, who will appear in the upcoming season of Empire as well. 133 Rapper-Launched Record Labels From the Past and Present Image of Subscribe to XXL on Filed Under: Birdman Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive The stakes for iPhone 7 have never been higher (aapl) Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 9:03 AM Rob Price Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 7 on September 7 — and the stakes have never been higher. After years of staggering growth, the Cupertino company's smartphone business is in decline, ramping up the pressure on Apple to make sure the new iPhone delivers. And from what we've heard of the new handset from rumors, that's by no means guaranteed. According to data from research firm IDC, sales of the iPhone dropped by 7.7% in the second quarter of the 2016 calendar year compared to a year previously — the Cupertino technology giant's third consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline in sales. Apple shipped 44.4 million phones in Q2 2016, compared to 48.1 million in Q2 2015. There's always a decline in sales in the run-up to the launch of a new iPhone. But this decline is notable for two reasons: First, it's a decline year-on-year, rather than just from quarter to quarter. In real terms, people are buying less iPhones than they used to.  And secondly, its market share is also dropping — in Q2 2016, it captured just 12.9% of the global smartphone market, down from a healthier 14.6% a year prior. The lion's share of Apple's revenue comes from iPhones; the health of the business is intimately linked to the health of its smartphone business.  In April this year, the company announced on its quarterly earnings call that the decline in iPhone sales had caused the company's first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenues since way back in 2003. As such, investors are nervously watching to see if the iPhone 7 will help Apple return to growth.  So what's behind this drop-off? IDC says that globally, smartphone sales increased 4.3% year-on-year last quarter. (344.4 million, up from 330.3 million.) But sales in mature markets like the US and Europe are slowing. It is emerging markets that are driving the industry's growth now, and Apple's expensive handsets are poorly positioned to capitalize on this trend. In fact, in some of these markets, Apple is performing appallingly. According to IDC data, the Chinese smartphone market grew by 4.6% — but Apple shrank 31.7% year-on-year (8.6 million sales in Q2 2016, down from 12.6 million). This decline means there is increased pressure on Apple for the launch of the iPhone 7. But it's questionable as to whether the new smartphone will generate the hype previous years have managed. It is expected to be largely similar to the current iPhone 6s, with few cosmetic changes and one of the key features being a new camera. This lack of redesign — out of keeping with Apple's usual practice of revamping its flagship smartphone every two years — is ahead of a more radical overhaul planned for the device in 2017, for the tenth anniversary of the launch of the iPhone. So if customers decide to wait another year for the iPhone 8, then Apple's growth nightmare might not end any time soon.

Utilizing Sony's unique technology, the XAV-AX100's high power sound and EXTRA BASS feature will transform your vehicle into an elaborate sound system, all while making your drive as safe and comfortable as possible with rotation volume control and voice command features. Apple CarPlay Connecting your phone to your car has never been better with the option of Apple CarPlay. CarPlay allows you to use your phone in a safe and smart way whilst staying focused on the road, letting you access Apple Music, Maps, make phone calls, and send messages all through the touchscreen, or vocally with Siri. Android Auto Android Auto extends the Android platform into the car in a way that's purpose-built for driving. With a simple and intuitive interface and powerful new voice actions, it's designed to minimize distraction so you can stay focused on the road. The XAV-AX100's clear and responsive touchscreen features a lighter touch operation and improved visibility to help improve late night drives and glaring sunshine. Optimal Sound High power sound comes full throttle with the XAV-AX100 in-car audio system. 55 watts x 4 Dynamic Reality Amp 2 and EXTRA BASS low boost circuitry overcome engine noise and reproduce clear sound at any volume level with deep and punchy bass. The 10-band graphic equalizer gives an astonishing variety of sound, perfectly complementing EXTRA BASS for an enjoyable drive. 3-pre out connectivity allows system expandability to connect external amplifiers with a wide range of speaker connections, allowing sound enthusiasts to build their own bespoke system. The unique Sony technology in the Dynamic Stage Organizer (DSO) compliments the XAV-AX100 features, overcoming the inherent acoustic disadvantage of front-door mounted, full-range speakers which can sound muddy or unclear. The DSO adjusts the signal creating the illusion of dash-mounted virtual speakers to provide an ideal, high quality sound experience for the journey. Pricing and Availability: The XAV-AX100 in-car audio system retails at $499.99 and will be available across North America as of late November.

In the four years since the release of Ocean’s Grammy-winning, happy-making Channel Orange, the 28-year-old singer-songwriter has been teasing us with promises (and more promises…and more promises) of new music. There have been cryptic missives, some intriguing video clues, at least one fake-out release date—all revolving around an album that was rumored to be titled Boys Don’t Cry. But it wasn’t until Thursday night that we finally got a drop of the Ocean, courtesy of Endless, a 45-minute, 18-track “visual album” available exclusively through Apple Music. It’s a part of the new visual album trend spearheaded by Beyoncé’s Lemonade earlier this year. Directed by Ocean himself, and shot in crisp black and white, Endless is a single-location, slow-building narrative that finds the singer working out of a massive warehouse, putting together what turns out to be a giant wooden staircase. The music is layered and dreamy, full of mid-tempo numbers that highlight Ocean’s supple, soaring vocals. Along with such new tracks as “Florida” and “Device Control,” Endless includes a handful of ambient songs, as well as a cover of the Isley Brothers’ 1976 hit “At Your Best (You Are Love”), which was also covered by Aaliyah. According to the movie’s end credits, the strings for Ocean’s “At Your Best” were orchestrated by Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood; other artists to work on the album include James Blake, indie singer-songwriter Alex G, and R&B queen Jazmine Sullivan (whose most recent record, Reality Show, is so, so great, and absolutely worth picking up while you’re on iTunes). More Let’s Look for Clues in Frank Ocean’s Weird New Streaming Video Apple Music’s New Look Is Clean and Karaoke-Friendly Beyoncé’s Lemonade Is Making the Lemon Emoji Very Popular But Endless is just the beginning of what looks to be a long weekend for Ocean: According to a statement from Apple Music, listeners should “keep an eye out this weekend for more from Frank.” Considering that the singer once promised he had “twooo versions” of his latest project, it’s highly possible that we’ll also hear Boys Don’t Cry this weekend, as well, so get ready to … oh, wait! According to Rolling Stone, Ocean has changed his mind yet again, and the album’s title is no longer Boys Don’t Cry (a fact that will no doubt make Robert Smith’s day, assuming that dude cares about his Google-search results). In conclusion: No one really knows what’s happening, but either Frank Ocean is going to put out more music this weekend, or he’s going to show up at your house and offer to build an extension to your bathroom. We’d be happy with either option! Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. album Apple Music Frank Ocean Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

According to the URL, the video is titled “Champaign,” and in a now-deleted Instagram post, director Francisco Soriano reportedly took credit for directing the “art project,” which consists of a black-and-white feed from what appears to be a giant industrial studio. Inside, a lone figure (possibly Ocean?) is hard at work, moving and sawing large planks of wood, all in an effort to make … well, we don’t actually know. (Maybe some giant pyramids? Or perhaps a shopping cart for his buddy Tyler, the Creator? Or maybe some stairs, as this tweet from March suggests?) During intervals, you can hear big, gorgeous swells of synthesizers and orchestral notes, or what sounds like looped, distorted vocals. But it’s mostly just a lot of sawing—maybe as part of a loop, maybe in real time (the video’s URL also includes the word “live,” but it’s not clear if this is, in fact, a livestream). What most fans were hoping to get out of today’s video, of course, is news about Ocean’s long-in-the-works, long-overdue new album. Last month, he posted a picture of a library return-date slip on boysdontcry, a clue that either pointed to a July or November release date, depending on how you interpreted it. So what date can we derive from this latest mysterious dispatch? Given his penchant for cryptic missives, let’s look at the clues in this new footage: In the video, the figure sAWs with GUSTo. That can only mean one month: AW GUST, or August. “Bandsaw” is an an anagram for “Abs Dawn.” There were only 2 lead actors in The Twilight Saga: Break Dawn films with excellent abs (Kellan Lutz and Taylor Lautner). The oldest tree in the world is approximately 5,065 years old. In conclusion: Frank Ocean’s next album—maybe titled Champaign, maybe titled Perfect Timber—will be released August 2, 5065.

Liz Stinson Design Date of Publication: 08.14.15. 08.14.15 Time of Publication: 3:19 pm. 3:19 pm This Music Video Is Made To Be Watched On Your Phone Few things inspire so much ire in the smartphone generation as the vertically-shot video. It’s a sin against humanity! A creative gaffe! Totally unwatchable! Or is it? Electronic band Harrison just released a video for its new song, “How Can It Be,” that was purposefully made to be watched on your smartphone. More specifically, with your phone gripped vertically in your hand. Oh, and it’s pretty great. The video, created by DTO Films, chronicles a text message thread between a young couple in the process of breaking up. It fills your phone’s screen and drops you in the middle of the action, your phone’s screen replaced with that of Katy, the young seductress who’s breaking her hapless boyfriend’s heart. As text messages volley back and forth, you voyeuristically follow along like a hacker who’s gained access to a fictional stranger’s phone. It’s a simple but compelling concept designed specifically for those of us whose phones are permanently attached to our hands. It’s also just the most recent in a series of phone-first music videos that make the most of the small-screen format: check out Party’s brilliant video for Namie Amuro’s “Golden Touch” and Jono Brandel’s video for Kimbra’s “Carolina.” It just goes to show that the smartphone isn’t a creative restraint anymore—it’s a whole new canvas.

In the inaugural “Robocall Strike Force” meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines … The AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Apple and Google, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time. Right now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Apple will play. There is a possibility Apple could add technology into iOS that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone. Although a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy. AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first “Robocall Strike Force” meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” Stephenson said. “Accelerate the development and adoption” gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it’s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game. In iOS 10, Apple has already started along this path with a new extension point for third-party app developers that lets the phone flag up known marketers. At WWDC, Apple advertised this feature in the context of the Chinese region (where phone spam is also very high) but it works worldwide. This is what Craig Federighi is demoing at the keynote in the image above. Phone adds integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and a new caller ID extension for spam alerts. However, Apple has not announced any plans to provide this data itself as of yet. If customers want to take advantage of the new iOS 10 feature, they will have to download third-party apps that offer the underlying database and provide integration with the system. iOS 10 is expected to launch next month in September. We’ll bring more details to follow on Apple’s telephone spam efforts as they are announced. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Apple renovating and updating their stores is a good thing. Yet we still have people that will go into a story about store renovation and complain about Apple's lack of innovation. When products do get updated, thats still not good enough and we here people saying things like..."Yeah well, it took em long enough" or "Its about time" Some people are just never satisfied.

The latest one suggests one of the significant additions to Apple iPhone 7 this year could be the new camera design with optical image stabilisation. According to new leaks, Apple will bring Optical Image Stabilisation to its new 4.7-inch iPhone 7, a feature that was earlier restricted to only the Plus versions. Apple introduced OIS with the iPhone 6 Plus in 2014, and re-imagined it with the iPhone 6S Plus in 2015. However, the feature remained absent in the smaller 4.7-inch devices each year. The presence of OIS in the Plus devices, was one of its selling points – apart from the larger display and the bigger battery life. But new images leaked by Nowhere Else show the new camera sensor for the iPhone 7, which looks remarkably close to the camera sensors of the iPhone 6/6S Plus that feature OIS. The leaked image of the iPhone 7 camera sensor includes four small cutouts surrounding the single lens housing, the same cutouts that are present in the camera modules of the iPhone 6/6S Plus. The additional cut outs in the housing are supposedly present to provide the lens room to float slightly. These cut outs are however missing from the iPhone 6/6S. Apple iPhone 7 Pro is rumoured to feature a dual rear camera setup. Apple’s strategy with the dual camera setup is still unclear, and is proposed to be for better dynamic range and colour representation, or to create a background blur. A recent rumour pointed at Apple introducing a new black colour for the iPhone. Leaked rendered images of a blue variant had also surfaced last month.
