Restart work at Emu Apple, which forms part of the Company’s recently acquired Kincora assets in the Roma shelf in Queensland, was completed safely and well below budget.  Emu Apple-1 well is currently producing at a rate of approximately 50 bpd.   The Emu Apple Field covers an area of 1.3 km2.  As first reported by the Company in its 7 October 2015 Target’s Statement, based on an independent report received by Risc Operations Pty Ltd on 30 September 2015, the Emu Apple-1 well is estimated to contain approximately 100,000 bbl of remaining recoverable oil in a 4 way dip closed structure in the Jurassic aged Boxvale Sandstone at a depth of 1400 metres. Armour’s Kincora Project covers 6 historic oil fields that have historically produced 2.9 mmbbls oil.  Armour has identified 5 wells with untested logged oil pay behind casing which was never tested, and further untested appraisal areas in the existing fields. Armour aims to re-enter and test the best of these opportunities as part of its campaign to bring the Kincora project up to full development status. Armour recently announced an increase in resources for the Kincora Project which offer the Company the potential to transform into a significant gas and oil producer.   Robbert de Weijer, Armour’s CEO, commented: “starting oil production from the Emu Apple field marks a key milestone for Armour.  We are now generating our first cash flow and, due to our low cost structure, we should generate a very healthy margin from each barrel that we produce.  Our operations team did a great job as the re-start of oil production was achieved without a glitch. This bodes well for the re-start of gas production which we are aiming to achieve by the end of this year.’ Nick Mather, Executive Chairman, said: “the Roma Shelf has historically spawned numerous oil and gas companies such has Hartogen, Crusader, Beach, AOG and Bridge and it goes on giving.  Armour will be the next.  Armour's advantage is a new generation of 3D seismic techniques to find oil and gas here and very efficient field development and oil and gas recovery techniques. Clearly there are many more oil and gas pools here. Historically 37% of wildcats on the Roma Shelf have been discoveries. That’s an enviable record.” Source: Company Press Release Share: Latest News Statoil reports fire break out on drilling rig in Norwegian Sea Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Revelation: Nominees of the INTERGAS Awards 2016 Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Rowan, Saudi Aramco partner to set up new offshore drilling company Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Castleton acquires Anadarko's East Texas assets for $1bn Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Total, SOCAR sign deal to develop Absheron discovery in Caspian sea Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Related News Related Sectors Oil & Gas> Drilling & Production Related Dates 2016> August Related Industries Energy and Utilities> Commodity> Oil Energy and Utilities> Upstream Energy> Production Select a Energy sector ------------------------ Drilling & Production Exploration & Development Refining & Petrochemicals Transportation & Storage ------------------------ Biofuels & Biomass Fossil Fuel Geothermal Hydro Nuclear Solar Wind ------------------------ Utilities Network Utilities Retail ------------------------ Carbon Coal Minerals & Materials Nuclear Fuels Drilling & Production News Related Insight Suppliers Directory Spotlight Suppliers By Sector A-Z PM Piping - Tailor Made Packages of Piping Materials The companies of the Project Materials Group supply steel products to engineering contractors and operators in the energy market.

Industry > Industry monitor > Telecom More reports on: Apple, Google Apple, Google join hands to strike at Robocallers news 20 August 2016 More than 30 tech leaders including Google parent Alphabet, Apple and telecom service providers have joined hands to crack down on automated phone calls, Reuters reported. The "Robocall Strike Force," a group led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), held its first hearing on the subject in Washington DC on Friday. Both prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers and automated text messages. The FCC has roped in companies like Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, AT&T, and Verizon in an effort to end the nuisance of unsolicited calls playing prerecorded messages from advertisers including big corporations. "We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls," said FCC commissioner Mignon L Clyburn. "We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the 'Do Not Call' list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action." The strike force is expected to submit its report to the FCC by 19th October with "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who is the chairman of the coalition. These solutions could take the form of Caller ID verification standards capable of blocking spoofed phone numbers, as also a list of numbers from government agencies and banks that telemarketers would not be able to spoof. The strike force would report to the FCC by 19 Ocotober on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," SReuters reported. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said yesterday calling robocalls the No 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction."  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2016 The Information Company Private Limited.

In essence, the banks asked the ACCC to allow them to collectively negotiate with Apple over the terms of its electronic payment system Apple Pay. They have argued that Apple is stifling competition by not allowing banks direct access to the NFC wireless functionality in the iPhone so that they can create their own “digital wallets”. The ACCC has decided not to grant their request, instead it has stated that it needs more time and more consultation before it makes a decision. Only 6 parties had responded to the request despite over 80 different parties being requested to do so. This was principally because the banks were pushing for a response within 28 days which didn’t give anyone time to respond properly. Ultimately, for the ACCC to grant the banks their request to act collectively, they will need to decide whether this is going to be in the best interests of consumers. The fact that it is not immediately obvious that this is clearly not in the interest of consumers reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the nature of the technology that is being discussed. Apple Pay provides secure access to your credit card not using the details of the card itself, but as an encrypted representation of the card provided by the issuing banks along with a token that is supplied by the card networks Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The encrypted data and tokens are stored in a piece of hardware called the Secure Element, an industry standard, certified chip. This communicates directly with the NFC wireless that in turn communicates with the payment terminals. The main points about this is that the banks are always in control over the transactions that happen and over which cards are added to the phone and how they are validated. This means that from a user perspective, there is absolutely nothing that can be gained from a consumer perspective by having the cards added separately in another digital wallet provided by the banks. For the benefit of the ACCC, it is worth emphasising this point. The functionality of the physical transaction between a card and terminal should absolutely not vary between card providers. What can vary is the functionality that is provided by banks via their own apps for consumers to track payments, pay off card balances, transfer money, etc. Apple Pay does not interfere with this aspect of functionality and so banks can, and do already, provide apps to do this. In fact, there are a large number of disadvantages that consumers would face by having the banks use their own digital wallets to actually load cards and carry out the payments: [1] Each bank would use a different process for loading cards and different security mechanisms for access them to pay with. This would contrast with the ability to pay from the lock screen using the fingerprint scanner using Apple Pay. [2] Customers would have multiple apps to store cards from different providers adding to the burden of updating them in order to make sure they had the latest security updates. [3] There would be no guarantee that banks would have apps updated for new versions of the iPhone operating system with each release – especially for beta versions of the operating system. This would mean that customers could be left without a payment mechanism until some time after new versions of the operating system are released. This was indeed the case with the Commonwealth Bank’s payment system on Samsung phones. [4] Apple Pay will be available through integration with Safari in the next version of iOS. Not having cards in Apple Pay would mean that this functionality would also not be available to customers using digital wallets provided by banks. [5] The banks have basically prohibited the Australian consumer from using their phones for payment in the way that millions of other users are able to. Indeed, the banks are wanting to actually charge customers for that privilege. As I have argued before, there is no chance that Apple will completely overhaul the architecture of its hardware and operating system to accommodate 4 banks in Australia when 3,000 banks worldwide have decided to adopt it. This is not an argument about stifled innovation or enhancing security, in fact, it is the opposite, what is being suggested will diminish both of these. What it is is an attempt for banks to maintain their dominant market power and continue to pass on unnecessary charges to customers. What the ACCC will achieve however by allowing the banks the ability to collectively bargain against Apple is that it will delay other banks and organisations from signing up. Again it is worth stressing that this is not just a fight against Apple, Australian consumers will be prevented from using equivalent systems on Android and Samsung.

Advertisement Jump to Comment The Conversation RECOMMENDED FROM AROUND THE WEB Herbert Allsopp Hey mate, agree with your analysis and insight but it begs the question, why didn’t you make a response to the ACCC in support of the Bank’s application? Surely 28 days is long enough for you, even if it isn’t for a corporation with legal teams and wider relationship considerations. I see an individual customer had a response against it so surely there could be individual responses for Common Sense Wow do you have shares in Apple? Not sure that you have a basic understanding or even grasp of what competitive behavior is or just general knowledge of business models or even basic economics. The Australian banks now supported by Wesfarmers and Australian Retailers Association are asking for Apple to open up NFC ability to other parties. This actually increases competition and allows consumers greater choice in what digital wallet they can use. Thus being restricted to just using Apple Pay is counter productive to consumer interests and competition in the market place. As a side issue Apple is piggy backing on the banks infrastructure and doesn’t have a right to dictate to Australian banks. To have such a one sided argument begs the question what is the standard like at university of Western Australia. I would suspect that ACCC would rule in favour of Australian banks.

Reuters Corning responds to that worrying Galaxy Note 7 scratch test video You've likely seen the video: Zack from JerryRigEverything performing his now-familiardurability test on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7.

A new glass from Corning that appears to scratch much more easily than its predecessor is admittedly hot news, but as is often the case, the "scandal" may have gotten blown a little out of proportion.

Independent | NASA SLAC, Stanford gadget grabs more solar energy to disinfect water faster In many parts of the world, the only way to make germy water safe is by boiling, which consumes precious fuel, or by putting it out in the sun in a plastic bottle so ultraviolet rays will kill the microbes. But because UV rays carry only 4 percent of the sun’s total energy, the UV method takes six to 48 hours, limiting the amount of water people can disinfect this way. Now researchers at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have created a nanostructured device, about half the size of a postage stamp, that disinfects water...

This, alongside a selection of pointedly anti-GIF imagery -- all proudly PNG files. Despite the obvious joke of setting files on fire, acknowledged with a winking plea to "extinguish all GIFs before leaving the vicinity," the anger was real and the mission was earnest... Popular Mechanics Eleven reasons to be excited about the future of technology In the year 1820, a person could expect to live less than 35 years, 94% of the global population lived in extreme poverty, and less that 20% of the population was literate. Today, human life expectancy is over 70 years, less that 10% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and over 80% of people are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information age. Medium Books you should read: Basic electronics I learned some basic electronics in high school physics class: resistors, capacitors, Kirchoff’s law and such, and added only what was required for projects as I did them. Then around 15 years ago I decided to read some books to flesh out what I knew and add to my body of knowledge. It turned out to be hard to find good ones. The electronics section of my bookcase has a number of what I’d consider duds, but also some gems. Hackaday The World Series of hacking -- without humans On a raised floor in a ballroom at the Paris Hotel, seven competitors stood silently. These combatants had fought since 9:00am, and nearly $4 million in prize money loomed over all the proceedings. Now some 10 hours later, their final rounds were being accompanied by all the play-by-play and color commentary you'd expect from an episode of American Ninja Warrior. Yet, no one in the competition showed signs of nerves. Ars Technica "I want to write video games" Do you? Do you really? Be honest with me. I mean, I don't want to shoot down your dream.

There are also lots of people who like the notion of getting into game development but figure they'll never have any real skills like programming or art so this is their best bet. Medium People ignore software security warnings up to 90 percent of the time Software developers listen up: if you want people to pay attention to your security warnings on their computers or mobile devices, you need to make them pop up at better times.

Phys.org Your Tesla is watching you -- whether or not you're watching the road In the wake of Tesla's first recorded autopilot crash, automakers are reassessing the risk involved with rushing semi-autonomous driving technology into the hands of distractible drivers.

Facebook76 Twitter Google + Reddit Email 16106 By Rob Copsey Twitter Frank Ocean released his long-awaited new album, called Blond.  The 17-track collection was released exclusively on Apple Music on Saturday night (August 21). Fans in London, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles could also pick up physical copies of the album at pop-up shops.  In stores, the physical album was reportedly being handed out for free and came packaged with a Frank Ocean-edited, 360-page glossy magazine called Boys Don’t Cry, which was expected to be the title of the record itself. Blonde artwork The magazine includes photographs taken by Frank, an interview with his mother, horoscopes and the lyrics of a rap called The MacDonalds Man written by Kanye West.  Some have reported that the physical copy has a slightly different tracklisting to the version on Apple Music, and there is also confusion around the album's title - listed as Blonde on Apple Music but spelt as Blond on the artwork. The sleeve shows a green-haired Frank photographed last year by the Turner prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans.  pic.twitter.com/hai4RMSNME — steven j. horowitz (@speriod) August 20, 2016 As well as Kanye, collaborators on Blond include Beyonce, Andre 3000, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams, Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, and even David Bowie and the Beatles. Speculation around the release of Frank's follow-up to 2012's Channel Orange started earlier this month, when he posted a video of himself online chopping up wood to clips of music. On Friday (August 19) he then released am 18-track 'visual album' called Endless. On Saturday morning (August 20) before the album's release, he released what was to be Blond's first single, called Nikes. The song pays tribute to Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old high school student shot by George Zimmerman.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Inside Frank Ocean’s ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ Magazine: Another Version of ‘Blond’ and a Poem by Kanye West Kanye contributed a poem about McDonald's to the glossy book accompanying Ocean's new album Anna Gaca // August 21, 2016 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Anna Gaca for SPIN New information is coming to light as the internet continues to parse Frank Ocean’s long-awaited new album Blond and its companion magazine, Boys Don’t Cry. (The spelling of the title appears to be intentionally inconsistent: It is Blond on the cover art, but Blonde on Apple Music and within Boys Don’t Cry.) As Ocean sings in “Nikes,” the album itself comes in two versions: One was released on Apple Music yesterday evening, and one appears on a CD mounted in the center of Boys Don’t Cry, the glossy physical magazine that was available free at four pop-up locations yesterday (pictured above). The two versions have different track lists: The Apple Music version includes “Nikes,” “Be Yourself,” “Self Control,” “Good Guy,” and “Close to You,” while the shorter CD version omits these but includes “Mitsubishi Sony” and “Easy.” Boys Don’t Cry features contributions from Wolfgang Tillmans, Tyrone Lebon, Viviane Sassen, Tom Sachs, Lil B, and many other artists. The book includes interviews with Ocean and his mother Katonya Breaux, a poem about McDonald’s by Kanye West, and a great deal of gorgeous photography: speciality cars, Rick Rubin’s home in Malibu, Ocean riding an ATV, stills from Lebon’s “Nikes” music video, young men with automobile logo designs shaved into their haircuts. Twitter user @duddersj snapped pictures of West’s poem, which appears as lines of text on a drive-thru screen: KANYE WROTE A RAP ABOUT MCDONALDS FOR FRANK’S MAGAZINE, IM DEAD pic.twitter.com/qdr2Ub2YNs — Jack Dudley (@duddersj) 21 août 2016 SPIN visited a pop-up event at a newsstand just outside Chicago in Evanston, Illinois, where staff said they arrived at 6 a.m. to box up the store’s regular magazine stock and replace it with foil-wrapped copies of Boys Don’t Cry. At its peak, the line at the Evanston store extended down the block, around the corner, and up a staircase to a nearby train station. By around 8 p.m., every copy was gone. CREDIT: Anna Gaca for SPIN A digital version of the magazine will eventually be available online, staff outside the Evanston pop-up said. On Sunday, unopened copies of Boys Don’t Cry were listed between $300 and $1000 on Ebay. CREDIT: Via Frank Ocean on Tumblr Meanwhile, Ocean posted an image from the magazine on his Tumblr (above). The spread includes a photo of a gold BMW and a personal reflection by Ocean about travel and his love of cars. “Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face,” the text begins. “A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head. The claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens, preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. The pressing on internal organs. I lean back and forward to release it. Then backwards and forward again. There it is — I got free.” “My memories are in these pages, places close by and long ass-numbing flights away,” Ocean continues. “Cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porsches. Throwing parties around England and mobbing freeways in four project M3s that I built with some friends. Going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads.” “I had the time of my life making all of this,” Ocean wrote in a subsequent Tumblr post. “Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of ya’ll. Haha. Love you.” Tags: frank ocean, Kanye West 0 Recommended for you \ Pusha T Remembers the Making of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in Emotional Instagram Post Report: Kanye West’s Doctor Says He Tried to Assault Gym Staff, Suffered From “Temporary Psychosis” Kanye West Reportedly Hospitalized After Canceling Saint Pablo Tour Kanye West Cancels All Remaining Saint Pablo Tour Dates Kanye West Is Posting Dozens of Fashion Catalog Photos on Instagram Kanye West Ends Another Show Early After Three Songs, 15-Minute Rant [UPDATE] Comments Reviews \ Read More » Review: PC Music Struggles With Identity and Grows Up on New Comp Review: A Tribe Called Quest’s Vital Final Album Reminds Us the Journey Continues Review: Body/Head Draw Narrative From Noise on Impressive Live Album No Waves Review: Lambchop Wring Pathos and Humor Out of the Machine on FLOTUS Bull Sessions.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Bloomberg’s Report on Apple Watch 2 Sunday, 21 August 2016 I have a few problems with Bloomberg’s report on the upcoming Apple Watch 2, credited to Mark Gurman, Alex Webb, and Scott Moritz. Starting with the headline: “Apple Hits Roadblocks in Cutting Watch Ties to iPhone”. Apple Inc. has hit roadblocks in making major changes that would connect its Watch to cellular networks and make it less dependent on the iPhone, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking. The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The use of present tense in the headline (“hits roadblocks”) instead of past tense (“hit roadblocks”), and “has hit” in the lede makes it sound like these are recent issues. If Apple ever had any hopes of putting cellular networking in the second generation Apple Watch and shipping it this year, those hopes were dashed months ago, if not last year. Hardware has long, long lead times. The lead time for new iPhone hardware is over a year long. I doubt Apple Watch is much shorter. Once the design is set, it takes many months to get the supply chain set up to produce the actual devices in volume. The only exception I’m aware of — the one time Apple made a last-minute change to a device — was the third-gen iPod Touch in 2009. Rumored to contain a camera, it shipped without one. But as proof that last-minute changes of this sort are highly unusual, teardowns of that iPod clearly revealed a socket where the camera would have gone. I’d bet my bottom dollar that teardowns of the new Apple Watch will not reveal places where the cellular modem and antenna would have gone. Ever since its inception, network carriers have been urging Apple to release a version of the watch that can connect to data networks independent of the iPhone, and the Cupertino, California-based company had been working to untether it from the handset, one of the people said. As it is now the watch must be synced with an iPhone to download most types of content and consistently track location. Since when does Apple take advice from network carriers? And of course Apple is working to add cellular networking to Apple Watch. The question at hand is only whether they had actually hoped to add to this year’s new models. I highly doubt that. During the discussions, Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation, according to the people. Apple warned that, even on an aggressive schedule, the earliest possible shipment time-frame for cellular models would have been this December, one of the people said. This makes no sense to me. If the best case scenario was shipment in December — the best case — then there would have been no question about it. Cellular would have been postponed for a subsequent generation. The holiday quarter is essential to Apple across all product lines, but it is particularly important to obvious gift items like iPods, a decade ago, and Apple Watch, today. It is highly problematic to ship a holiday quarter item as late as December. Too many people do their gift buying in November and even October. And new Apple items often hit a weeks-long backlog. A three-week backorder for an item that only shipped in December is too late for Christmas. And that’s the best case scenario. Any small glitch would mean the new Apple Watch would miss the holiday quarter entirely. That’s a disaster. If Apple wanted to ship the second generation Apple Watch this year, it was essential that they be able to begin shipments in October, perhaps as late as the first week of November at the very latest. Anything later than that is too late. Why does Bloomberg have no timeline on when any of these decisions were made? That, to me, would settle the matter on whether this is a disappointment or was the plan all along. The tone of Bloomberg’s report is that it’s a disappointment, even within Apple, that the new Apple Watches won’t have cellular networking. Consumers may well be disappointed, but within Apple I don’t think there was ever any serious hope that cellular networking would arrive before the third or even fourth generation models. The whole thing feels to me like Bloomberg wanted to have a story on the new Apple Watch, but the one and only fact they had is the addition of GPS, which has been widely rumored all year. That’s it. So since they couldn’t make a story out of what the new Apple Watch is going to have, they instead spun a story about a feature it almost certainly was never going to have.

The album, which is his first since his debut album "Channel Orange" in 2012, will be exclusive to Apple Music for two weeks. The 17-track album was originally set to release on August 5, but Ocean and his teamed pushed back the release once the news was out to maintain the element of surprise, according to The New York Times. The release also includes the music video for Ocean's single, "Nikes." A companion print magazine called "Boys Don't Cry" was reportedly going to be available at Apple retail stores. However, Ocean has only announced that four pop-up stores in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and London would carry the magazine. "Endless" and "Blonde" are just two of the high-profile exclusives that Apple has secured for its music streaming service. Other content includes Drake's "Views" and Taylor Swift's "1989 World Tour LIVE," "Blonde" can be streamed on Apple Music now.

Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple’s apps. Google recently underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime. The app fits squarely into Google’s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple’s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones. Duo is no exception. People can use FaceTime only to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, increasing the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation. “You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,” Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. All this feeds into Google’s strategy to attract iPhone users to Android. Google’s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google’s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple. I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable. A short history First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. Google announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to do. This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact. Duo vs FaceTime The Duo app is downloadable and free through Google’s Play store and Apple’s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call. Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures. With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone’s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered. I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, the picture quality can be expected to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds. Against the rest I also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo’s simplicity won hands down. In Facebook’s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake. On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger’s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronise your address book with Skype. The bottom line For now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo, so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users. But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo’s single-button approach.

Home Mac OS X iPhone iPad Tips & Tricks Jailbreak News iOS How to Upgrade & Replace an SSD in MacBook Air Aug 18, 2016 - 11 Comments The MacBook Air is not really thought of as being expandable or upgradeable, but it turns out that with a little effort and patience, you can replace the SSD on the MacBook Air yourself. Changing the SSD on a MacBook Air can allow you to dramatically increase the storage size of the Mac and can often increase performance too, and while those are elective reasons to upgrade the devices SSD hard drive, another common reason to require swapping the SSD drive is due to an all out drive failure. That latter scenario is what led me to replace the SSD on this particular MacBook Air model for a friend, but regardless of the reason for upgrading or changing the SSD, it’s really not that difficult to do and the process is the same. If you’re going to replace the SSD on a MacBook Air for any reason, you’ll need a few things; the new replacement SSD drive that is compatible with the Mac, a series of specific screwdrivers, at least two or three separate little bins for temporary screw storage, and some patience. Beyond that it’s really not particularly complicated, even if it involves taking apart the Mac and putting it back together again. There are many great detailed tutorials that walk through the entire process from sites like iFixIt, and we’ll link to a few below. Keep in mind this is really only applicable to Macs that are outside of warranty service, and for those who are comfortable tooling around in their hardware. Swapping hardware may void a warranty on a newer Mac, so if the Mac is under warranty just take it to an Apple Support provider or Apple Store and they can handle all of this instead. Step 1: Checking Replacement SSD Compatibility with MacBook Air The first step is to insure the replacement SSD is compatible with the MacBook Air model. This typically depends on the model year of the MacBook Air itself, so it is critical that you know which model year the computer is. You can get the model and model year of any Mac by going to the  Apple menu and choosing “About This Mac”, where in the overview screen you will see something like “MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2012)” or similar. Once you know the exact model and model year of the computer, you can find a compatible SSD drive on a reseller site like Amazon. For the sake of this article, let’s say the MacBook Air is a 2012 model year. Step 2: Picking the Replacement SSD Upgrade / Kit There are many brands and types of replacement SSD drives to choose from, you can research this if you want to, or if you have a preferred brand then go with that. My particular choice for this project was this Transcend 240GB SSD Upgrade Kit. I like the Transcend option for several reasons; it’s well priced, it’s very fast, it’s highly rated, it offers a good warranty, and it comes with a complete upgrade kit which includes an enclosure for the old SSD as well as the necessary screw drivers to complete the job. The Transcend SSD upgrade kit is basically an all-in-one solution, meaning you won’t need to shop for the screw drivers independently (and yes, other brands offer some similar package solutions, Transcend just happened to be the best overall deal when I was shopping for this MacBook replacement drive) Transcend JetDrive 480GB for MacBook Air (late 2010 – mid 2011 models) Upgrade Kit Transcend JetDrive 480GB for MacBook Air (mid 2012 model) Upgrade Kit Transcend JetDrive 480GB for MacBook Pro Retina 13″ (late 2012 – early 2013 models) Upgrade Kit See other Transcend SSD mac Upgrade kits here on Amazon And yes you can absolutely buy a different compatible SSD that does not come in a kit as well, just be sure you get the appropriate pentalobe screwdrivers and insure compatibility with the drive and the Mac. It’s entirely up to you. Step 3: Back Up the Mac You need to backup the Mac before you change or attempt to replace the SSD drive. I recommend setting up Time Machine backups on the Mac at a minimum, and some more advanced users like to do this in addition to using SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner tools to clone the drive directly over. The only exception to this is if the drive is completely dead or missing, and then obviously there is nothing to back up. Do not skip a backup, if you don’t backup you won’t have anything to restore the Mac to, and the replacement drive will not have your data on it. That’s not what you want. Using Time Machine also offers the advantage to being able to perform a clean install (of El Capitan or whatever else) on the replacement SSD and then restoring the Mac from the Time Machine backup after installation. Do not skip backing up the Mac. Seriously. Step 4: Upgrading and Replacing the MacBook Air SSD Now comes the fun part; opening the Mac and swapping out the old SSD with the new replacement SSD. Get some sort of containers or a cupcake tray so that you have somewhere to keep the screws in, keeping mind that there are multiple screw sizes, lengths, and types that you’ll encounter. I like to arrange mine by size and general location of where they come out of the Mac. This part of the process is the most technical. Users who have a strong background in tinkering with electronics will likely be comfortable on their own, but almost everyone else is going to want to review some sort of guide that details the process well. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we recommend following the detailed iFixIt guides as they are well explained, detailed, and thorough. iFixIt.com: MacBook Air Repair Guides – find the appropriate model and year, and choose the appropriate “Solid State Drive Replacement” guide for the Mac MacBook Air 13″ (mid 2012) SSD replacement walkthrough guide Basically what you’re doing is disconnecting the Mac from a power source, unscrewing the bottom panel and lifting it off, disconnecting the internal battery, then replacing the SSD. If you follow the iFixIt guide they rate the difficulty of a MacBook Air SSD replacement as “moderate” but I am confident that anyone with patience and the ability to follow instructions can get the job done rather easily, even if they’re a relative novice. I highly recommend following the thoroughly detailed aforementioned iFixIt guide, but here are the basic steps if you’re curious as to what you’re getting yourself into: 1 – Removed the screws from the bottom of the MacBook Air (the screws are temporarily stored in the little bins above the Mac) 2 – Disconnect the internal battery – don’t forget this (and don’t forget to reconnect when finished) 3 – Remove the stock SSD drive (it is held in by another screw) 4 – Replace with the new SSD drive, screw it in, then reconnect the internal battery 5 – Put the bottom lid back on and screw it back in, done! Once everything is sealed back up again, you’re ready to go. Now it’s on to the software part. Step 5: Reinstalling Mac OS X and Restoring Data Admittedly I do things in this tutorial a bit different than some other technical people do; mainly that I put a blank SSD drive into the Mac, which then required an OS install and restore, rather than cloning over the drives first. Cloning the drive ahead of time is often the best approach, but in this particular instance it wasn’t possible however because the internal stock SSD had completely failed (question mark on boot, confirmed with Apple Hardware Test), meaning there was nothing to clone. Fortunately there was a recent Time Machine backup however, which is why I went with the install and restore approach. If you want to go the cloning route, Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper are both excellent and get the job done. Anyway, what I did in this scenario was two steps; perform a clean Mac OS X software install using a bootable USB flash key, then restore from Time Machine during setup. It worked perfectly. We’ve covered these topics before, so if you want to go this particular route (typically necessary if the original SSD failed) then refer to the following detailed walkthroughs: Clean install OS X Mavericks (you can clean install OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or any other Mac OS X release too Restoring a Mac from a Time Machine backup Keep in mind that if you’re restoring a Mac from a Time Machine backup, you can start that process immediately after clean installing Mac OS X during the setup process. (Quick side note: you can also attempt to restore the Mac SSD from Time Machine directly, but doing so means you typically have to re-create the Recovery partition manually and you may encounter EFI partition errors, both of which are avoidable if you just perform a direct clean install of Mac OS X system software ahead of time). Once Mac OS X and the data has been restored to the drive, the Mac is ready to go and use as normal with a nice new shiny SSD! Enjoy! Have any experience replacing or upgrading a Mac SSD?

(Vegard Grott/NTB Scanpix via Reuters) Frank Ocean’s “Blonde” dropped Saturday night on Apple Music. But this is not like most album releases. Yes, it’s not every day that an album release is accompanied by pop-up shops in a handful of cities, where you could pick up the 17-track LP and accompanying publication that includes interviews, short stories and a poem about McDonald’s written by Kanye West. But that aside, the release of “Blonde” is a pretty big deal. Fans and the industry had been waiting four years for this moment, which came after numerous rumored and reported release dates passed by without new music. Anticipation about how the avant-garde R&B artist would follow his successful debut had built up considerably. #BLONDE from Frank Ocean. Exclusively on Apple Music.https://t.co/bk5j3bWsja pic.twitter.com/AHOHnbCPJJ — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 20, 2016 “I had the time of my life making all of this,” Ocean posted to his Tumblr shortly after the album’s release. “Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y’all. Haha. Love you.” [Review: Frank Ocean and the virtues of boredom] Ocean’s first major label album, 2012’s “Channel Orange,” became one of the most critically acclaimed releases that year, earning the new artist six Grammy nominations, including for the top prizes. He took home two. Post music critic Chris Richards referred to that album, which “exploded the emotional possibilities of contemporary pop music,” as the only masterpiece to emerge from 2012. “As a singer, songwriter and storyteller, Ocean is every bit as fluid as he is commanding, delivering songs crammed with moods, memories and detailed characters — all sung by a protagonist who’s earned himself a place among the greats,” Richards wrote. Ocean first came onto the scene as a member of the hip-hop collective Odd Future. His self-released “Nostalgia, Ultra” became one of 2011’s most acclaimed albums, and he appeared on the Jay-Z and Kanye West project “Watch the Throne.” Frank Ocean performs during the 55th annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 10, 2013. (Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS) Ocean also became a pop culture icon of sorts when he revealed that his first love was a man, writing about the experience in an open letter after a journalist noted that Ocean addresses a male love interest on “Channel Orange.” “Most of the days I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence … until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him,” Ocean wrote in 2012. “By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant, It was hopeless, There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling, no choice. It was my first love, it changed my life.” The announcement earned Ocean increased attention and prompted a conversation about sexuality within R&B and the hip-hop community. “Today is a big day for hip-hop,” Russell Simmons wrote of Ocean’s announcement. “It is a day that will define who we really are. How compassionate will we be? How loving can we be?” [Waiting on Frank Ocean’s new album? There’s a website for that.] Then came the hints that Ocean was busy cooking up new jams. In 2013, he said he was “like 10, 11 songs” into the project. “It’s another cohesive thing, bordering on a concept record again,” Ocean told the BBC at the time. “At the end of ‘Channel Orange,’ there’s ‘Golden Girl,’ and it’s this beach scene. And I kind of want it to extend that feel into the next record all together, kind of make it that theme.” It's been four years since singer Frank Ocean released "Channel Orange." With new album "Boys Don't Cry" rumored to be released soon, is the wait finally over? (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) In April 2015, a photo showing the singer looking at magazines titled “Boys Don’t Cry” was posted to his Tumblr with the hashtag #JULY2015. A representative of Ocean confirmed to Billboard that the album and a publication were due in July that year. Fans braced themselves for the imminent release. But it never happened. A “Due Date” library card image, with dates stamped and crossed out, appeared this July on Ocean’s site, an apparent acknowledgment that, yeah, he was running a bit late. Earlier this month, a cryptic black and white live feed showing a barren warehouse with studio equipment appeared on BoysDontCry.co, Ocean’s Tumblr connected to the project. The New York Times reported that “Boys Don’t Cry,” accompanied by a major video and publication, was to drop Aug. 5. Then, nothing. Fans wondered whether this was all an elaborate scheme and that a new album wouldn’t drop until November, the latest date on that library card image. One side effect of the years of speculation was that it kept Ocean’s name afloat and built anticipation, even while he remained relatively low-profile. The enthusiasm for new work by him was such that hordes of people on Twitter immediately noticed Thursday night when Ocean’s live feed began showing the artist building a structure in that barren warehouse as new music played in the background. Moments later, Apple Music released Ocean’s visual album “Endless.” Up until this week,”Boys Don’t Cry” was the expected name of Ocean’s project. That’s the name of the publication, but there are still some discrepancies with names. Apple Music refers to the album as “Blonde,” while some of the cover art has it spelled as “Blond.” Hours before the new LP became available on Apple Music on Saturday, Ocean released a video for the track “Nikes.” (Some explicit words ahead). #NIKES on @applemusic A video posted by RIP DYLAN RIEDER (@rryanbreaux) on Aug 20, 2016 at 10:20am PDT The list of contributors on Ocean’s project, as reported by Billboard’s Steven Horowitz, is varied and includes musical heavyweights, such as Beyoncé, David Bowie, the Beatles, Rick Rubin, Kendrick Lamar and Elliott Smith (spelled “Elliot Smith” in the liner notes) By Sunday morning, “Blonde” topped Apple Music charts. lifestyle style-blog true Please provide a valid email address.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Lyft made a big bet on Apple's secret smash hit Swift and it paid off in a huge way Sunday Aug 21, 2016 at 12:03 PM Matt Weinberger Just over a year ago, car-hailing app Lyft made a huge bet by rewriting its iPhone app entirely in Swift — the Apple-created programming language that's taking the technology world by storm.  It was a big risk: Swift is still largely untested in real-world apps, having only been introduced in 2014.  Meanwhile, Objective-C, the language that most iPhone apps are written in, was invented in 1984, making it a very tried-and-true and familiar experience for many programmers. But it was also a very calculated risk, explains Lyft CTO Chris Lambert. With Swift, Apple "signal led that this was the future" of iPhone app development, Lambert says, and Lyft wanted to be ready for whatever came next. "It turned out to be a really fortuitous move," Lambert says. In the year since rewriting its iPhone app in Swift, Lambert says, it's been able to add more features faster while simultaneously cutting down on the time it takes to open the app. The net result: More iPhone owners taking more Lyft rides, which is very good for business. It's had some other, mostly unanticipated benefits, too. In the last year, Lambert says, they've actually doubled the lines of code that powers the Lyft app, owning largely to the fact that the startup's developers are that much more productive in the new language. Outside of Lyft, Swift is winning praise as the easiest programming language to learn, and one that's just fun to write code. Lambert praises Apple for its willingness to use Swift to rethink how programming languages are made. "Every small detail of the language has been rebuilt," Lambert says. Swift on the job Plus, adopting Swift in such a big way was a sign to top job candidates that they're not just "dabbling" in the programming language, meaning that they've added 10 new Swift developers in the last year alone — no mean feat amid the ongoing Silicon Valley talent recruitment wars. Lyft is serious about Swift, and the developer community is responding. The switch to Swift brought new energy to Lyft's iPhone team, Lambert says. When Swift was first announced in 2014, Lambert says, Lyft's developers started teaching themselves the new programming language on nights and weekends in preparation for the big shift.  People were so excited, they got a little ahead of themselves: it wasn't yet time to move over from Objective-C. "We actually had to actively stop people from using Swift," Lambert says.  Still, Lambert says that he's glad Lyft made the move when it did: Rewriting the app "is not a trivial effort," he says, and the sooner they did it, the less code they'd have to reinvent in Swift from scratch.  In the meanwhile, Lambert admits Lyft runs into "rough edges" with Swift here and there, but Apple is working hard with the programming language's community to make it better for everybody. "Apple has been very, very responsive to getting the kinks worked out," Lambert says.  NOW WATCH: Apple invested $1 billion in this Chinese company See Also:Obamacare has gone from the president's greatest achievement to a 'slow-motion death spiral'American runner is told during live TV interview he was disqualified after thinking he won the silver medalDating app founder: Response rates go up 60% when your first message is like this SEE ALSO: Apple and Microsoft are fighting a secret war for the future of technology About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's macOS Finder & Apple Music Icons are now Registered Trademarks | Main | Apple Continues to Dominate the Premium Smartphone Market » August 21, 2016 Apple Reinvents the Battery Icon with a Time Stamp System based on Apps running on your device   This week the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that revealed the reinvention of today's battery power icon found on mobile devices. The new system will be able to intelligently measure time remaining before recharging based on the apps currently running on your device. Today, the battery power icon on our mobile device communicates this in terms of a percentage of battery power remaining, as in 23%, for instance. With this new invention in place, we'll be able to simply see an actual time, as in 7 mins. 53 seconds left to run a device based on the apps that are actually running on the device at that point in time. Every app depletes time on a battery, yet some apps deplete power more quickly than others and the new system will be able to calculate time remaining by knowing how to calculate time depletion per app running.   Apple's Patent Background   Most electronic devices include an internal portable power source, such as a rechargeable battery, that provides power to the devices. One technique for informing a user about the amount of charge on the power source is to represent the amount of charge in as a battery charge status icon. The amount of charge on the power source can be represented by a color indicator that completely fills or partially fills in the icon. For example, when the power source is fully charged, the battery icon can be filled in completely by the color indicator.   The battery icon, however, may not provide information to the user about whether or not the power source has a sufficient amount of charge to power the device for the applications and functions the user will be running over an upcoming period of time.   For example, the user may be running a navigation program to receive turn-by-turn directions for two hours, which means the electronic device will be in near-constant or constant use during that two hour period. Based on the battery icon, the user may not be able to determine that the power source has a sufficient amount of charge to provide power for that application for the entire two hours.   In general, some users can be anxious or uncertain about the displayed amount of charge remaining on a power source because the user may not be certain that the remaining charge is sufficient to meet the user's use of the electronic device over an upcoming period of time.   Apple's Invention: Displaying Use Time Remaining on Fast Charge Devices   Apple's invention is about how iOS will be able to learn how a user uses an electronic device and provide more accurate information about the remaining use time of the electronic device to the user.   Apple's patent FIG. 5 below is a flowchart depicting an example method for displaying remaining power on an internal power source in a portable electronic device;   In some embodiments, a fast charging battery or power source can be included in the electronic device.   In one aspect, an electronic device includes a power source configured to supply power to one or more components of the electronic device. A processing device that is in communication with the power source can be configured to determine an estimated power requirement of the mobile electronic device during a time period and determine a charge state of the power source.   The processing device can be adapted to determine if the charge on the power source will meet the estimated power requirement, and to produce an indication as to the remaining use time for the electronic device.   Apple's patent FIG. 6 illustrated below is a conceptual diagram of example factors that can be considered when performing block 500 in FIG. 5 above; FIG. 7 is one example of a display for displaying the remaining use time for an electronic device; and FIG. 8 is another example of a display for displaying the remaining use time for an electronic device.   The remaining use time can be determined independently for one or more users of the electronic device, and the indication can be displayed to each user in several different ways. For example, in one embodiment, the processing device can determine that having 50% charge on the power source provides a first user with twenty-four hours of use but provides a second heavier user with twelve hours of use. The appropriate amount of remaining use time can be displayed to each respective user.   In another aspect, a method for operating an electronic device can include a processing device estimating a power requirement to be needed in an upcoming time period and determining an amount of charge on a power source of the electronic device. An indication of the amount of time a user has to use the electronic device can then be displayed to the user.   The displayed remaining use time can be updated continuously, periodically, or at select times. The amount of use time can be learned by the electronic device.   Additionally or alternatively, a user can enter desired or expected use times for one or more applications and the electronic device can utilize the user-input information to determine the amount of use time. The amount of use time remaining can be determined using data from one or more sensors, such as GPS, applications, such as a calendar and/or navigation or location service or application, and/or from one or more network connections or configurations, such as an IP address.   Power Profiles   In yet another aspect, one or more power profiles can be created for the portable electronic device. A power profile can include estimated power requirements, historical power usage, and/or options regarding the power management of the portable electronic device.     A method for creating a power profile can include a processing device analyzing historical power requirements of the electronic device and creating the power profile based on the determined historical power requirements. The power profile can be modified based on input received from a user.   Apple further notes that the portable electronic device can sample data regarding power usage over time to create a database of power use data, or the mobile electronic device may have a "test" time such as a number of days or a week during which the device may store data corresponding to the "typical" power consumption.   Embodiments can provide an indication of how much use time remains for one or more users of the electronic device based on a power profile the device has created or received.   The power profile can include estimated power requirements, historical power usage, and/or options regarding the power management of the portable electronic device. For example, a power profile can include information about the amount of power used in a given time period for text messages, emails, cellular telephone calls (e.g., when the electronic device is a smart telephone), internet browsing, camera use, travel applications, other applications such as health monitoring applications (e.g., heart rate monitor), and so on.   A power profile can be created for each day of the week, or for each repeating activity or meeting that appears on a calendar program. Additionally or alternatively, a power profile can be produced for each regularly used application on the portable electronic device or on one or more locations frequented by the user.   A power profile can be created to reserve power for an application or function to allow the electronic device to save power for that application on a particular day or days, a given time of day, or some other time period.   Lastly, it's worth noting that Apple's engineers are already describing wireless charging within their patent filings as if it's already in place or is about to. Apple notes in patent point #25: "In other embodiments, the portable electronic device may communicatively couple with one or more external power sources without the need of a power cable. For example, the portable electronic device may receive power from an external power source inductively or wirelessly, or may include an integrated plug in lieu of the power cable. In these embodiments, the power cable may be omitted."   Apple patent application 20160242119 was filed in Q1 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Then an independent broker offers a cool $500,000. Is this a sign of a short-lived bubble or will the value of exploits continue to climb? At the Black Hat 2016 security conference in early August, Apple offered select researchers up to $200,000, to find previously unknown ways to compromise the company's iOS operating system or iCloud service. Less than a week later, third-party security firm Exodus Intelligence upped the ante, offering $500,000 for remote exploitation on iOS—10 times more than Apple offered for the same level of compromise. The competing offers for information on exploitable vulnerabilities highlight the evolving battle between software vendors, who increasingly want to bolster the security of their products by tapping researchers, and third-party firms who seek to make money from exclusive vulnerability information. As software companies become more at ease with paying researchers for vulnerabilities and third parties see more opportunity in buying exploits, the market for security researchers' efforts has grown, Brian Gorenc, senior vulnerability researcher for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, told eWEEK. ZDI's program, for example, has grown steadily this year, receiving the most submissions by researchers to date, he said. "Right now, it is a really good time to be a vulnerability researcher," Gorenc said. The environment is a marked departure from even four years ago, when executives at companies such as Microsoft and Apple refused to pay security researchers who found vulnerabilities, and relied instead on altruism and the desire to promote a personal brand to convince researchers to disclose vulnerabilities for free. "I think bug bounty programs are awesome and they have come a long way from where they were initially," Adriel Desautels, managing partner and CEO at penetration firm Netragard, told eWEEK. "When they started, the bounties were almost insults. They were $500 and $3,000. Now, they are much more competitive with what other agencies and brokers are willing to pay." Yet the acquisition of exploitable vulnerabilities by third parties has resulted in significant damage to software firms' customers. When Apple refused earlier this year to help the FBI circumvent the security of the iPhone, an Israeli company reportedly sold the agency the equivalent of a skeleton key to iOS, giving the federal government the ability to decrypt a backlog of digital evidence. Following the incident, and perhaps driven by it, Apple announced its first bug bounty at the Black Hat Security Briefings on Aug. 4. With a $200,000 headline-generating bug bounty, Apple's program appears to be a strong statement that the company is jumping into the paid research market with both proverbial feet. However, the top payout is only for a very small—and at the same time, very hard to exploit—piece of the iOS software, the secure boot firmware. The more general remote execution vulnerabilities, the focus of most attackers, will bring a much smaller sum of $50,000. Yet the program is a good start, Rich Mogull, principal analyst and CEO at security consultancy Securosis, said in a blog post. "Apple didn’t need a program, but can certainly benefit from one," he said. "This won’t motivate the masses or those with ulterior motives, but it will reward researchers interested in putting in the extremely difficult work to discover" some of the most dangerous classes of exploitable vulnerabilities.   Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next »           LATEST SECURITY ARTICLES   How to Protect the Encryption Keys to Your Kingdom Cerber Ransomware Expands Database Encryption Attacks Oracle Acquires DNS Company Dyn Weeks After Massive DDoS Attacks Symantec Buys Identity Protection Company LifeLock for $2.3 Billion Report: Half of Organizations Have Been Hit by Ransomware                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The unconventional release is the latest in a growing list of major artists who are breaking all the rules of how to release an album and even what an album is.  ______________________________________   Two days after releasing a "visual album" called "Endless," Frank Ocean on Saturday debuted his much anticipated album "Blonde" streaming exclusively Apple Music and for sale as a download on iTunes.  Apple's exclusive will last for two weeks. Beats1 radio was also streaming the album on Saturday. In addition to the digital release via Apple, yesterday Ocean opened pop-up shops in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and London handing out free copies of a "Boys Don't Cry" art magazine including a CD of the new album. The cover of the album is "Blond" on iTunes, but the spelling adds an "e" to become "Blonde" in the iTunes listing and on the magazine and physical CD. No explanation for the two spellings has surfaced. "Blonde" is 45 minutes and 17 tracks long, joining a growing list of artists including Kayne West and Drake that have released 15-20 track albums, in part to take advantage of a flaw in Billboard chart rules that combine individual song streams to calculate the chart position of and total sales of an album.  How Frank Ocean, Drake, Kayne West, DJ Khaled, Others Are Using A Loophole To Game The Charts In Manhattan, the line to get into Mulberry Iconic Magazines was more than a block long just after 7 p.m. "Inside the store, the essence of a standard New York bodega remained - chips, soda, detergent and so on were still for sale," according to the New York Times, "but the shelves had also been stocked with copies of “Boys Don’t Cry” in a sealed reflective wrapping."   the album is called "Blonde" btw pic.twitter.com/9sP18Lfcd2 — Joe Coscarelli (@joecoscarelli) August 20, 2016   Inside "Blonde" The album includes an impressive list of contributors according to the liner notes, including Andre 3000, James Blake, Beyoncé, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell, Kanye West and many more.   "I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y'all," Ocean wrote on his official Tumblr blog.  Ocean's release joins a growing list of windowed exclusives for Apple including Drake, Chance the Rapper,Eminem and Pharrell.

Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Google has rolled out its person-to-person video calling app — Duo — in the UAE app stores, but many people think it is only a matter of days before it is blocked. “As per the policy in UAE, video calling over mobile network is blocked. So, any new app is likely to get blocked eventually,” Sukhdev Singh, vice-president at market research and analysis services provider AMRB, told Gulf News. The UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) has already blocked video and voice calling features from BlackBerry, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype and Snapchat. Apple’s FaceTime is not installed by default on the company’s smartphones shipped into the Middle East, but FaceTime works in the UAE with devices bought from Europe or in the US. The Duo app, which works on Android and Apple operating systems, was released in the US last week. The app comes with end-to-end encryption and also has a feature called “Knock Knock” which lets the caller know who is calling. Like FaceTime, Duo only requires a person’s phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have accounts to use the video calling options. Many residents have told Gulf News they were using overseas accounts to download Duo, which was launched on Tuesday, assuming it was going to be blocked by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). According to TRA rules, only licensed telecom operators can offer VoIP (voice over internet protocol) in the UAE. Permission Even though VoIP calls by anyone other than a local telecom are officially banned, the use of VoIP to make cheap voice calls over the internet is rampant in the Gulf. Some residents are speculating that Google would not have released Duo without seeking permission from the TRA. If the TRA is now allowing these apps, players such as Apple and Facebook may also seek to unblock their own FaceTime and WhatsApp calling apps respectively. Neither the TRA nor Google could be reach for comment before deadline. “This is obviously something that consumers, in particular the expat residents, would love to have as it will bring down their international calling expense substantially,” Singh said. “It is high time for TRA to look into this when rest of the world is open to video and voice calling apps. One good option is to offer residents a monthly fee to access these apps and, at the same time, telecom operators can also benefit from the data usage,” he said.

'RIP Trayvon, that n**** look just like me,' he sings in 'Nikes,' the album's first track. Ocean chose to release the 17-track album through Apple's music streaming service, instead of Tidal – owned by his mentor Jay Z.  After months of suspense and weeks of cryptic online teasing, the wait for Frank Ocean's (pictured right) long-awaited second album Blond is finally over When Kanye West, another of Ocean's collaborators, released his latest album - the Life of Pablo – he chose to do it exclusively through Tidal at first.  But Ocean's second studio album – called 'Blonde' on Apple Music but 'Blond' on its cover - was also available at pop-up stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and London.

Share this article Share Fans have been anxiously awaiting Ocean's new album, which many expected would be released two weeks ago amid teases by the singer. In Manhattan, they lined up for more than a block at Mulberry Iconic Magazines -- a convenience store that sells beer and sandwiches as well as magazines -- for a chance to get hold of it, The New York Times reported. Ocean released his album on Apple, instead of Tidal - the music streaming service owned by his mentor Jay Z (above, after presenting Ocean with a Grammy Award for his debut album in February 2013) The album, which carries a 'Parental Advisory -- Explicit Content' warning label comes after the widely acclaimed 'Channel Orange' in 2012. Ocean pays tribute to Trayvon Martin (above) in one song. The teenager was shot dead in February 2012 It defied easy classification by bringing together R&B, jazz and funk with the singer's gentle, often-falsetto voice. Ocean had earlier suggested on his website that the new album would be called 'Boys Don't Cry.' 'I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all,' Ocean wrote on his Tumblr social media account. 'Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y'all.' The release comes after the unpredictable Ocean released a 45-minute 'visual album' through Apple Music on Thursday night. Called 'Endless' that featured unreleased tracks along with black and white footage of the singer engaged in a construction project. Much of Ocean's first album 'Channel Orange' revolved around feelings of first and unrequited love. Ocean's first track 'Nikes' (above, a still from the video) features a tribute to Trayvon Martin Fans have been anxiously awaiting Ocean's new album, which many expected would be released two weeks ago amid teases by the singer. Above, a still from the 'Nikes' video He later revealed that his first love was a man, a rare openness in the often macho world of hip-hop that led stars including Jay Z to applaud him for coming out. The album, which featured the hit song 'Thinkin Bout You,' earned Ocean two Grammy Awards, including best urban contemporary album. Before the release of that album, Ocean's 2011 mixtape 'Nostalgia, Ultra' led to collaborations with Jay Z and Kanye West, including working on their collaborative album Watch The Throne.

Just a few days ago, the 28-year-old singer released his visual album, Endless. But he had even more in store for his fans. On Saturday, Aug. 20, Frank Ocean surprised his fans when he dropped his second new album, Blonde. Fans have been freaking out over the news of Ocean’s visual album and his new digital album because they know they have a lot of catching up to do. Just two days after Ocean made his official return to music, he released Endless, four years after his debut album, Channel Orange. #BLONDE from Frank Ocean.

It also features the track “Nikes,” which Ocean dropped as a music video on Saturday morning, along with a feature with Andre 3000 on “Solo (Reprise),” notes Mic.com.

Now on Apple Music. #ENDLESShttps://t.co/IKMm2PNsUH pic.twitter.com/nlLxXoQ296 — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) August 19, 2016 In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ocean opened up about the creation of his long-awaited new LP, in a series of Tumblr posts. “I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera. My memories are in these pages, places close by and long a**-numbing flights away. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BaseGod in conversation.” The album also comes with a special publication of the project that fans have been waiting to read: Boys Don’t Cry. It’s currently being sold in pop-up shops in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. While Ocean didn’t go into depth of the tracks on Endless and Blonde, he did touch upon how “Godspeed” stems from his “boyhood” and how it ties in with his other project. “Boys do cry, but I don’t think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It’s surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid. Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror it’s getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. And really though… It’s still all good.” On Saturday, after dropping his new album Blonde, the R&B singer took to Tumblr to write a sweet note to his fans to thank them for sticking around all these long four years, according to another Mic.com report. “I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of ya’ll. Haha. Love you.” Now, with two full-length albums and a 360-page Boys Don’t Cry magazine finally out, fans have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to Frank Ocean. Ocean didn’t work totally alone on his new album for Blonde. It includes a long list of “album contributors,” according to his section from Boys Don’t Cry magazine. According to the publication, he credits André 3000, Beyoncé, David Bowie, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Jamie xx, the Beatles, Brian Eno, Elliott Smith, Pharrell, among many others. For example, André 3000’s verse can be heard on the track “Solo (Reprise)” and Beyoncé’s voice can be heard at the end at the track, “Pink + White.” Kanye West is featured in Frank Ocean’s magazine “Boys Don’t Cry” available soon (pic via @PigsAndPlans) pic.twitter.com/EbtAyyjANe — Yeezy Central (@YeezyCentral) August 20, 2016 Frank Ocean announces pop-up shops where you can get free copy of Boys Don’t Cry mag https://t.co/oWv97C0A3H pic.twitter.com/PQWe1mJGXU — XXL Magazine (@XXL) August 20, 2016 Frank Ocean announces Boys Don’t Cry magazine pop ups. https://t.co/dzraH1nMnv pic.twitter.com/oyCTvgcSLm — The FADER (@thefader) August 20, 2016 What are your thoughts on Frank Ocean’s visual album, Endless, and his new digital album, Blonde?

But beneath the subtlety lie indelible hooks Frank Ocean … An album that lodges in the memory. Photograph: John Shearer/Invision/AP Joe Muggs Sunday 21 August 2016 11.22 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Frank Ocean seems to like to look chaotic, even slapdash. This long-teased album’s eventual release as an Apple Music stream was announced on his Tumblr with a post that read: “FUCK, SORRY.. I TOOK A NAP, BUT IT’S PLAYING ON APPLE RADIO RN.” It’s titled Blonde online and in his Boys Don’t Cry magazine, which accompanies the release, but Blond on the album CD artwork – which also manages to misspell “Elliot [sic] Smith” (Ocean borrows the entire chorus of Smith’s Fond Farewell for his track Siegfried). Sonically, there’s no dramatic shift from Endless, the “visual album” that appeared just two days ago: indeed it could be a continuation of that album. It’s a very subdued record: the melodies meander, more often than not without drums, and snatches of dialogue and weird electronic glitches interrupt conventional-seeming parts. Seven of the 17 tracks are under the three-minute mark. There’s a rap verse in Japanese at the end of Nikes. One might be tempted on first hearing to think that the tangled and overlong creative process has got the better of Ocean, and that he’s just released a hodge-podge of more or less finished ideas. Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review – brilliantly confounding Read more It only takes a couple of plays to put paid to that suspicion. Another of Ocean’s Tumblr posts reads “THANK YOU ALL. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO NEVER LET ME FORGET I HAD TO FINISH. WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERY ONE OF YA’LL.” Once you’re immersed in it, it becomes abundantly clear he’s taken this seriously, and this very much is a finished album. It’s a carefully structured album to boot: the segue from Be Yourself, constructed from a concerned phone message from Ocean’s mother, into Solo, an intensely affecting song about drugged paralysis, is just the most obvious example. Elsewhere it flows in subtle ways from one track to the next, an inexorable sense of a narrative being spun out but never spelled out. It’s a complicated, indulgent, moody record, though, one that deals in textures and impressions more than in pop hooks and instant thrills. Its superstar guest spots are woven into the textures, not signposted: Beyoncé, for example, just adds wordless harmonising to the adolescent memories of Pink + White, and Kendrick Lamar’s contribution to Skyline To is as a writer and producer, with his voice only appearing as a few cryptic, barked ad-libs. Guitars ripple throughout, some of which are certainly Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood; any that are not are certainly beholden to him. James Blake appears on the credits, where he is on the record it’s impossible to tell, though his influence is everywhere. The only person who really leaps out is Outkast’s André 3000, verbally somersaulting over a minute of bleeps and jazz piano on Solo (Reprise), but even he doesn’t break the mood. It’s precisely that consistency of mood that brings together all the seeming weirdness into something extraordinarily listenable as a complete piece. When detuned guitar arpeggios suddenly take over the track then collapse into electronic glitch, in the episodic Nights, or when robot voices intrude on the otherwise Bill Withers-like guitar-and-vocal ballad Self Control, they’re not gimmicks or attempts to be modern: once you’re in Frank Ocean world, they seem completely natural. We’re seeing the maturation of a few trends of the last few years. The indiefication of hip-hop culture, which had its most mainstream expression with the bromance between Jay-Z and Chris Martin, and saw every other mainstream rap/R&B tune have a moaning white guy chorus for a while, is here expressed in infinitely more musically and emotionally sophisticated form. Likewise the weird electronic side of “alt-R&B” – the dialogue between black American culture and British bedroom experimentalists like Blake and the xx – is subsumed elegantly into Ocean’s writing and recording process. Under all the subtlety and still surfaces, there are actually hooks here – just not the needy, salesmanlike kind that wave at you, shouting; “Here I am, remember this song!” The melodies– not only on the swaying soul waltz of ‘Pink + White’, or the tick-tock melody of the conventional R&B sections of Night, but in the outer-space balladry of Siegfried and the future gospel crawl of the heartbreaking Godspeed – lodge very quickly in the memory and stay there. And there are single moments like the way Ocean hollers “I’m not brave!” in Siegfried that can stop you in your tracks. Once these musical elements are in your subconscious, a complicated set of ideas starts to unfold. Among all the immediate autobiographical and introspective themes of weed, cars, women, men, consumerism, growing up and responsibility, are all kinds of complex wordplay, and references to Shakespeare and Teutonic myth, but as with everything these are subtly done. They don’t clang into the songs as signals of bourgeois erudition, but slide in, signposting more and deeper themes which will only become apparent as we live with the album. And yes, it’s true: this is going to be an album worth living with.

Apple and Gilead are among the most undervalued companies to buy right now. Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 21, 2016 at 9:50AM Image source: Getty Images. Buying strong companies at conveniently low prices can be a powerful strategy for superior returns over the long term. The concept is quite simple, but implementation is the key, since finding undervalued stocks is much easier said than done. In that spirit, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) look like promising candidates for investors hunting for the best bargains in the current market environment. Apple stock is undervalued Apple stock is trading at aggressively low valuation levels. Shares of the iPhone maker trade at a price to earnings ratio around 12.7, while the average company in the S&P 500 index carries much higher price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 20. On a price to cash free flow basis, Apple is in the neighborhood of 9.6 versus 12.5 for companies in the S&P 500.  One of the main reasons for such a bargain-cheap valuation is that investors are concerned about the company's ability to sustain growth in the future. Apple reported a 14.5% decline in revenue during the quarter ended in June, which was due in most part to a tremendously challenging comparison versus booming revenue growth in the same quarter last year.  Apple revenue. Data in thousands of dollars. Data source: SEC filings.  On the other hand, the iPhone SE is attracting new customers to the Apple ecosystem, and year-over-year sales comparisons will get much easier in 2017. With this in mind, it doesn't sound unreasonable at all to expect the iPhone segment to stabilize and start growing again over the coming quarters.  Besides, the services division, which includes revenue from the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Pay, and other services, is now the second largest segment for Apple behind the iPhone, and it's firing on all cylinders. Apple produced nearly $6 billion in sales from this business last quarter, a vigorous increase of 19% versus the same period last year. According to CEO Tim Cook, the services division is on track to become "the size of a Fortune 100 company" next year. In a nutshell, Apple is dirt-cheap thanks to concerns about declining revenue, but the iPhone segment could easily improve in the coming quarters, and the services division is looking like a powerful growth driver going forward. At these prices, Apple stock looks like a huge bargain for investors. A healthy opportunity in biotech Gilead Sciences is a market leader among biotech companies dedicated to curing infectious diseases. The company has an enormously valuable portfolio of drugs focused on treatments for HIV, hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. Gilead has made a series of acquisitions over the last several years, including names such as Corus Pharma, Myogen, CV Therapeutics, Arresto Biosciences, and Calistoga, and these moves have expanded the company's presence in areas such as pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancer. The lion's share of revenue comes from Hepatitis C treatments, and Gilead is facing declining sales in this division thanks to increasing competition from lower-cost drugs, which is hurting pricing power across the board. In this context, the company reported a 4.9% decline in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, to $7.65 billion. On the other hand, sales of HIV products are still moving in the right direction. Gilead produced $3.1 billion in revenue from this segment last quarter, a vigorous increase of 15% year over year. Antiviral product sales were $7.1 billion during the period, so HIV products accounted for a much-relevant 44% of the total. Total revenue could remain under pressure in the coming quarters, but Gilead has a promising pipeline of developments in areas such as HIV, oncology, rheumatoid arthritis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, among others. Not only that, but Gilead is sitting on $24.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet, and the business produced almost $17 billion in free cash flow during the trailing-12-month period ended in June. This means Gilead has abundant financial resources with which to buy smaller industry players and find new growth opportunities via acquisitions over the coming years. The company is aggressively repurchasing stock, and it has reduced the amount of shares outstanding by 19% of the total since January of 2014. A shrinking share count increases earnings per share by reducing the denominator in the earnings per share calculation, so Gilead is flexing its financial muscle to increase earnings per share, even when net income is stagnant or declining. GILD Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Importantly, Gilead Sciences is trading at ridiculously cheap valuation levels. The stock carries a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1, while the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is roughly 6.5. This is not only a massive discount versus other stocks in the market, but also by Gilead's own historical standards. As a reference, the average price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios for Gilead over the last five years are 21 and 24, respectively, according to data from Morningstar. The bottom line Apple and Gilead are facing declining revenue, and this is an important uncertainty factor to keep in mind. Nevertheless, both companies remain fundamentally solid from a long-term perspective, and they are trading at compellingly cheap prices. Buying undervalued companies can be remarkably profitable, but it also requires an independent mindset to find opportunities where most investors only see risks.

The world's leading consumer-electronics company has a big month with new iPhones presumably hitting the market. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Aug 21, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: The Motley Fool. It's that time of the year again. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is highly likely to introduce the iPhone 7 next month. Reports of a media event in early September, followed by actual retail availability on Sep. 23, have been circulating since the Apple-centric bloggers at 9to5Mac reported on a leaked merchandise reset at AT&T (NYSE:T) stores last week. It could be anything, but once we get this late into the summer, the chatter starts to become more credible. There's also no shortage of reports on the rumored features of the new smartphone. The removal of the headphone jack -- owners will have to use either Bluetooth headsets or earbuds that plug directly into the charging port -- could make the device more water resistant. The processor, battery, and camera should all be improved, with chatter suggesting that the larger iPhone 7 Plus will come with dual lenses for crisper snapshots. Some are suggesting that the iconic home button will be replaced by haptic feedback sensors. There's also talk about more storage capacity, but the consensus for quite some time has been that Apple is waiting until next year for the next major reset of the iPhone product line. Even a permabull like Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster seems to be conceding that there's just a "small chance" that next month's smartphone proves to be a needle-moving surprise in a new analyst note issued on Friday. His bullish thesis -- and his aggressive $151 price target -- rests more on expectations that next year's update will be the real game changer.  Justifying the recent pop Shares of Apple have been quietly bouncing back lately. The stock has rallied 22% since bottoming out in May. The bullish sentiment may seem misplaced. Apple went on to post a top-line decline for its recent fiscal third quarter, something that it hasn't done since the June quarter of 2002 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. Wall Street pros see a repeat performance for the current quarter with an even sharper decline on the bottom line. The market may be looking ahead to next year's iPhone 7S or iPhone 8. If it's timed to coincide with the device's 2007 debut -- something that would result in a late June rollout next summer -- it could make the next 12 months pretty special for Apple's financial performance with two smartphone rollouts. Next year should be special. Some of the chatter involves an entirely new form factor with an all-glass design and a battery life-preserving OLED screen. However, what if the features being introduced in next month's model are enough to spur folks to trade up now.  Crashing the party AT&T and its wireless-carrier rivals have moved away from two-year contracts on subsidized smartphones. AT&T got tired of discounting new iPhones by as much as $400, making that back in the form of chunky monthly data-plan charges. AT&T and its peers now simply finance the devices over varying lengths of time, but because monthly plans get cheaper after they are paid off, there's less of an incentive to trade up every two years. It's probably not a coincidence that iPhone sales growth has been sluggish since the country's two largest wireless carriers made this tactical shift last summer. It will take a head-turning iPhone to trigger a massive upgrade; but what if next month's platform is cooler than we think? The rumored dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a big differentiator from all other smartphones on the market. So many people have lost iPhones to water that a more water-resistant device could spur an upgrade wave, much to the dismay of the uncooked rice industry. The growing popularity of iCloud as a file-hosting platform may seem to make internal storage less important, but super-sizing capacity without an uptick in price will always be an incentive to folks with maxed-out storage. The argument will be that folks will wait if they know that an even cooler iPhone is coming next year, but isn't that always the case? People still even upgrade during the spring and summer, knowing full well that an update is coming in a few months that will make the device better and the one that they're buying cheaper. Folks who are discounting next month's debut is what makes its potential so intriguing. The current generation may be a letdown after the bar-raising iPhone 6 hit the market two years ago. That was a hard act to follow, but that won't be the case next month. No one is expecting much of a bump out of next year's rollout, but that's also every reason to be a contrarian, and expect that to be exactly what will happen. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

Best instant messenger apps for Android Google Duo review Before we present the advantages and disadvantages of each of these applications, it is important to clarify several things. The quality of the video and fluidity depends on many factors, ranging from internet connection to the front camera quality. The worse the connection, the more the call sputters and the image quality gets distorted. By the same logic, if the picture quality of your front camera is bad, it is obvious that you shouldn't expect miracles, especially when your lighting is poor. The phone's performance may also be a factor, but flagships are not really a problem, just low-end devices and some mid-range. Below are some popular applications to communicate directly in real time with video. Jump to a section Skype FaceTime Viber Messenger Duo Summary Skype Skype is probably the most popular application of this list, and it's not for nothing. This was primarily the big star on computers (Windows, Mac and Linux) and, faced with such popularity, a mobile version was obviously necessary. Unlike other instant messaging applications, Skype does not use your phone number to identify you. You must create an account using an email address, allowing a bit more anonymity. You don't have to provide your main email address or real name. Skype allows you to do more or less everything possible from a normal video chat app: text, audio and video. The number of emojis and animated images has increased significantly in recent years, making the application a little less pure. Sending files is of course possible, as well as taking photos and videos directly from the application. Regarding audio and video calls, I can say from experience that the quality is very satisfactory. Again, it all depends on the device used and the quality of the connection, but overall it's very fluid on the audio front, slightly less with video but it also depends on the camera quality. What may appeal to some is that you can make group video calls. The quality of a Skype call depends on the device and connection. / © AndroidPIT What's not good about Skype The fact that Microsoft owns Skype may bother some. The Redmond, Washington company has appropriated Skype and obviously uses it in its own way. So confidentiality and management of your privacy may be questionable, like all of the huge multinationals. The application has been greatly simplified since a while ago when it was rather slow. Today it is a little too simplistic for my taste, even childish. Also, I do not really like the light blue (which also reminds me of the old version of TouchWiz). Well, that's a matter of taste. Another negative: the complexity of the contacts. Some courier directly analyzes the directory to find out whether the contacts on Skype could be added to your list (and if your contact accepts you). This is not a big effort for most, but for some it can be a little more difficult. FaceTime FaceTime is an application designed exclusively for Apple products. It is present by default on all MacBooks, iPads and any iPhone. Unlike other applications of this list, FaceTime has a clear, clean and precise objective: audio and video communication. Clearly, this application offers no superfluous functions: no smileys, text, gifs, etc. Its interface is uncluttered – to our delight. Having a minimalist interface and functions is a good idea and through this Apple is able to keep the quality high. It is impossible to say which application on this list is the best because too many factors come into account, but several of my colleagues consider this application as the best in the field (and these are Android fans!). FaceTime is the star of Apple. / © AndroidPIT What's not good about FaceTime If you are looking 'Swiss Army knife' app that allows you to chat and immortalize moments in pictures, you do not want FaceTime. You can install WhatsApp Messenger, Viber or Skype, but FaceTime will not meet your needs. Keep in mind that this is an application from Apple, it is designed for Apple users. If you want to make video calls with contacts that do not have an iPhone or Mac, it will go through another application. Viber Viber is an alternative to the giants of communication. In practice, it allows for more or less the same as its competitors: texting, sending pictures, emoji, possibility taking a picture or video and sending files saved on the phone. The advantage of this application is that it can be used on multiple platforms, including PC (even Linux). So you can make video calls your smartphone when you're outside, and from your computer or tablet when you are home. In addition to this, it scans your Viber contacts (like with WhatsApp). This is very convenient because you do not have to add contacts manually. Regarding video calls, there is nothing special to report since the application does what is expected. Again, do not expect to see great results if you do not have a quality camera and a good internet connection. But from what I could see (and what you can see for yourself even in the picture below), the picture is clear and the video relatively smooth. In terms of quality, Viber is pretty good, but unfortunately underused. / © AndroidPIT What's not good about Viber Viber requires a lot of permissions, which can cause problems for the most cautious of us. But the real problem is not security but rather the number of application users: many have installed and then quickly uninstalled because their contacts do not use the app. Viber is a typical example of a good application that cannot win against the competition. (Facebook) Messenger The biggest advantage to Messenger is that everyone uses it. And since everyone uses Facebook, many people use Messenger. In summary, if you use Facebook, it is very likely that you'll find all your contacts directly within the application. You can also use the app without your Facebook account, which then necessitates a phone number. Messenger offers text messaging, emojis and a large number of moving images to convey emotion easily. It is possible you to make audio and video calls for free, as long as you are connected to the internet, of course. With texts as well as voice communications, you can go through the groups and talk with several people at once, which is a handy feature. Regarding sending files, of course you can access all your files and transfer them to your contacts. You can also share your location or take a photo or video directly from the application. As explained in the introduction, image and sound quality depends on several factors but overall quality on Messenger is good (not particularly great though). You get decent quality images and resolution. From what I can tell, this is not comparable to Duo and FaceTime, the quality seems much better on these two applications.  Messenger is the most popular but not the best. / © AndroidPIT What's not good about Messenger As often with Facebook (and Google, for that matter), confidentiality and management of private data is often questionable. You either give your number or use Facebook, not to mention the necessary authorizations, data management, etc. Facebook has improved the safety of its application (and that of WhatsApp) improving data encryption (end-to-end). This certainly protects possible external problems to the network but not ownership and resale of private data. Another negative point, it's not possible to configure notifications by category (message, call, etc.). So you must choose: either you receive all notifications or receive none. The size of this application has often been criticized in the past but Messenger is not much bigger than other instant messaging applications. Google Duo The application has only been out a day so it is best to avoid going too far in saying that it is excellent and/or better than another video chat app. What is certain is that it is considered the FaceTime of Android, the only difference is that calls are only on video while FaceTime allows audio calls. Google, however, said it also plans to implement a voice call function. Anyway, you can find it on the Play Store. Like FaceTime, the interface is very simple, if not even simpler since Duo has a single large button that allows you to choose the contact to call. A Swipe up allows you to see your recent calls and a menu which can be handy if you plan to use it frequently. My colleagues told me that video quality is good but I want to clarify again that this depends highly on your connection. As noted by my colleague Hans-Georg in his review, it may be just an attempt to see if such a market is promising to decide whether the application merits further consideration or not. This would explain the simplicity of the application. From what I could see, Duo offers excellent image quality. © AndroidPIT What's not good about Duo This simplicity is both a blessing and a curse. Users can easily understand how it works, but why use an application that you can only video chat while competing apps do the same and more? While Apple reserves FaceTime for its own customers, Google offers Duo to everyone. Unfortunately, unlike its competitor, Apple, Duo can only be installed / used on a single device. Regrettably, not everyone wants to use their smartphone to communicate, many of us would like to use it from our computer or our tablet. Maybe this will change in the future.

But I just keep in mind that each of my contact has its own preferences. If one tell me he/she is a viber-addict, I'll stick to viber with him/her. On the other hand, it's pretty cool the way you can transparently switch from pc to smartphone, on another network, with the same app on each device. Follow my eyes going to Skype. Skype is also very popular. 0 Reply 10 Madars G 3 months ago Link to comment i know tha skype webchat and sound quality is better than messenger 0 Reply 2 Eliezer Martinez 1 month ago Link to comment That all depends on your internet connection and how fast it can be I tested both Skype and Facebook Messenger video calling on 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi and both of them have excellent sound quality and video quality if you are using 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi you're not really going to get the best sound and video quality unless you are using carrier service such as 4G LTE network outside you will definitely get good sound and video quality. 0 Reply 1 Sam andrew 3 months ago Link to comment All the above mention app are Good.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Banks Not Supported. Author Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) has denied four of Australia’s banks an interim authorisation to act collectively against Apple and other third party wallet providers (Samsung and Google) in Australia. In essence, the banks asked the ACCC to allow them to collectively negotiate with Apple over the terms of its electronic payment system Apple Pay. They have argued that Apple is stifling competition by not allowing banks direct access to the NFC wireless functionality in the iPhone so that they can create their own “digital wallets”. The ACCC has decided not to grant their request, instead it has stated that it needs more time and more consultation before it makes a decision. Only six parties had responded to the request despite over 80 different parties being requested to do so. This was principally because the banks were pushing for a response within 28 days which didn’t give anyone time to respond properly. Ultimately, for the ACCC to grant the banks their request to act collectively, they will need to decide whether this is going to be in the best interests of consumers. The fact that it is not immediately obvious that this is clearly not in the interest of consumers reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the nature of the technology that is being discussed. Apple Pay provides secure access to your credit card not using the details of the card itself, but as an encrypted representation of the card provided by the issuing banks along with a token that is supplied by the card networks Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The encrypted data and tokens are stored in a piece of hardware called the Secure Element, an industry standard, certified chip. This communicates directly with the NFC wireless that in turn communicates with the payment terminals. The main points about this is that the banks are always in control over the transactions that happen and over which cards are added to the phone and how they are validated. This means that from a user perspective, there is absolutely nothing that can be gained from a consumer perspective by having the cards added separately in another digital wallet provided by the banks. For the benefit of the ACCC, it is worth emphasising this point. The functionality of the physical transaction between a card and terminal should absolutely not vary between card providers. What can vary is the functionality that is provided by banks via their own apps for consumers to track payments, pay off card balances, transfer money, etc. Apple Pay does not interfere with this aspect of functionality and so banks can, and do already, provide apps to do this. In fact, there are a large number of disadvantages that consumers would face by having the banks use their own digital wallets to actually load cards and carry out the payments: Each bank would use a different process for loading cards and different security mechanisms to access them to pay with. This would contrast with the ability to pay from the lock screen using the fingerprint scanner using Apple Pay. Customers would have multiple apps to store cards from different providers adding to the burden of updating them in order to make sure they had the latest security updates. There would be no guarantee that banks would have apps updated for new versions of the iPhone operating system with each release, especially for beta versions of the operating system. This would mean that customers could be left without a payment mechanism until some time after new versions of the operating system are released. This was indeed the case with the Commonwealth Bank’s payment system on Samsung phones. Apple Pay will be available through integration with Safari in the next version of iOS. Not having cards in Apple Pay would mean that this functionality would also not be available to customers using digital wallets provided by banks. The banks have basically prohibited the Australian consumer from using their phones for payment in the way that millions of other users are able to. Indeed, the banks are wanting to actually charge customers for that privilege. As I have argued before, there is no chance that Apple will completely overhaul the architecture of its hardware and operating system to accommodate four banks in Australia when 3,000 banks worldwide have decided to adopt it. This is not an argument about stifled innovation or enhancing security, in fact, it is the opposite. What is being suggested will diminish both of these. What it is is an attempt for banks to maintain their dominant market power and continue to pass on unnecessary charges to customers. However, what the ACCC will achieve by allowing the banks the ability to collectively bargain against Apple is that it will delay other banks and organisations from signing up. Again it is worth stressing that this is not just a fight against Apple, Australian consumers will be prevented from using equivalent systems on Android and Samsung.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive TARGET: People aren't buying Apple products (TGT, AAPL) Sunday Aug 21, 2016 at 9:03 AM Akin Oyedele Jim Young/Reuters Target struggled to sell electronics in the second quarter, especially Apple products. The retailer on Wednesday reported earnings that were stronger than expected. But it lowered its outlook for the rest of the year as it plans for a "challenging environment," according to CEO Brian Cornell. There was "meaningful pressure in electronics" during the second quarter, and a decline erased 70 basis points from overall sales at stores open for at least one year, he said. "Notably, about a third of this pressure was driven by Apple products which were down more than 20% in the quarter," Cornell said. He added that the weakness was not confined to one particular Apple product, and the company is working with Apple and vendor partners to grow sales. But iPhone sales have taken an unusual turn lower everywhere. Earlier this year, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales fell for the first time in the device's nine-year history. The company is expected to announce a new iPhone in September. According to reports and leaks, it will look very similar to the iPhone 6S. The notable changes will likely be an upgraded camera and the removal of the headphone jack. A more drastic redesign is expected in 2017, a decade after the iPhone first launched. Meanwhile, people may not find convincing reasons to upgrade in the fall. But Target is hoping that the new phones, an overhauled MacBook Pro, and other products will also lift sales. "Our guests come to us looking for those products," Cornell said. "They're looking for the newness and the innovation, and we're putting together plans with Apple and our merchandising teams to make sure we're ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year."

The rare Apple 1 computer on auction includes the original manuals, a cassette tape with BASIC programming language, and other accessories and docs. Cohen added that the early machines were hand finished by Dan Kottke or the late Steve Jobs and that there is a great chance that this particular Apple 1 had been assembled by Jobs.   Cohen says he talked with Kottke, adding that "Dan doesn't remember assembling this one". Kottke did make the BASIC cassette and has the words "Good Luck" written in his handwriting, on it. Cohen said that the original Apple 1 owner isn't known, but the current owner purchased it for $18,000 back in 2000. Other Apple 1 computers have been purchased for as much as $900,000 - so there's no guessing where the ceiling is on this one, especially if Steve Jobs really did assemble it by hand.   A portion of the proceeds will be going to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Arizona.

Schmeiss' erst mal den Virenscanner runter. Dann dürfte es besser aussehen.. Growl Flash Silverlight.. Ne hübsche Sammlung.. Growl mach auch mal gerne Probleme und flash und Silverlight sind Einfallstore für die Probleme, die Du mit avast bekämpfen willst.. Und dann wird auch etwas Ram frei. Das ist aufgrund Deiner Programmsammeleidenschaft auch etwas knapp.. bestbernie21.08.1615:43 Nebenbei solltest du auch überprüfen, warum so viele Programme abstürzen, normal ist das auch nicht. Und avast ist wirklich eher Schadsoftware, als das es einen Nutzen bringt, das ist für jedes Problem gut. sffan21.08.1620:09 Lockenheld OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25) Warum nicht auf 10.10.5 upgedated ?

Technobilder24.08.1601:42 Leider werden Dir hier die wenigsten Nutzer helfen. Für den Grossteil der hier kommentierenden (hast Du ja auch schon gelesen) gibt es nur eine Lösung - sobald die einen Virenscanner sehen, oder Startobjekte raten sie Dir am besten alles zu löschen - oder einen Clean Install - ach was kauf dir gleich einen neuen Rechner... Ich hab dasselbe Problem wie Du - komischerweise ist es zeitweise garnicht vorhanden, dann wieder einige Wochen extrem verstärkt. Ich hab dann auch alle möglichen Startobjekte gelöscht - nur meinen Virenscanner (Bitdefender) nicht denn der ist nicht die Ursache. Nachdem ich das Problemeinige Monate habe und beobachte kann ich für mich feststellen das es vermutlich mit Dateizugriffen zusammenhängt. Bei mir ist die Auslastung hoch wenn Programme die Disk indexieren (zB mein Backupprogramm) oder ich mit Lightroom arbeite und dabei auf die SSD zugegriffen wird. Im normalen Alltag habe ich seit Wochen keine Probleme - ich habe aber vor 2 Monaten mein MacBook Retina zur Reinigung gegeben damit es drinnen mal sauber gemacht wird. Vermutlich ist bei Deinem MacBook inzwischen auch Staub im inneren der natürlich die Wärmeabfuhr behindert und dann drehen die Lüfter höher. Ich habe mir deswegen auch iStatsMenu gekauft um mir die Lüfteraktivität anzeigen lassen zu können. Allerdings bisher ohne sichtbares Ergebnis - vermutlich dauert es einige Monate bis genug Staub im Inneren ist das es sich auswirkt (lach) sffan24.08.1603:33 Lockenheld Woran siehst du, dass tm backups vorhanden sind? Ich nutze kein tm? Wann ja, wo und wie kann ich sie löschen.korrekt tm lief nur kurz 2013. Ich hatte das Datum überlesen. Falls Du nix zum löschen findest, ist vielleichr die disk inzwischen einfach zu klein? Von der MTN-App gesendet. sffan24.08.1603:36 Technobilder Puhh. Der nick kommt mir irgendwie bekannt vor.. Ich bin dann mal weg.. Von der MTN-App gesendet. john24.08.1605:35 @technobilder dass du dich überhaupt noch traust hier zu schreiben. wolltest du nicht nicht fernhalten von - deiner meinung nach - all den idioten hier und dir ein forum suchen, was deiner grosskotzigkeit eher entspricht? wie undankbar kann man eigentlich sein? erst im eigenen thread mit der zugemülltesten maschine, die dieses forum wohl je gesehen hat, jeden (guten!) rat von erfahrenen menschen, die wissen wovon sie reden, ausschlagen und alles besser wissen und jetzt auch noch in anderen threads für stunk sorgen. an deiner stelle hätte ich mich schon alleine aus scham lange still verabschiedet. „biete support. kostenlos, kompetent und freundlich. wähle zwei.“ Lockenheld24.08.1609:22 Um die "Hardwarekomponente Staub" auszuschließen. Ich kann ja selbst das Macbook aufschrauben und Staub entfernen. Oder geht es um Stellen, die nur ein Techniker erreichen kann? adiga24.08.1610:06 john @technobilder erst im eigenen thread mit der zugemülltesten maschine, die dieses forum wohl je gesehen hat, Danke. Und ich dachte schon diesen Titel wäre meiner Maschine zugewiesen worden Dann war es damals doch nur "eine der zugemülltesten Maschine.." @Lockenheld: Ich kann Dich verstehen, habe damals ähnlich reagiert bei meinem ähnlichen Problem, als John (und andere) mir die gleichen Tipps gegeben haben. Habe ein bisschen ungehalten reagiert, glücklicherweise hat dies John nicht abgehalten mir zu helfen. Und so sehr ich davon zurückgescheut bin, habe ich (dank TM) den Clean Install durchgeführt, die Programme (oder neudeutsch Apps?) neu installiert und vom TM die Daten zurück geholt. Seitdem läuft das Ding perfekt. Bei der Musik würde ich mir überlegen, diese auf eine externe Festplatte auszulagern und dann diese zum Auflegen mitzunehmen. Mittlerweile gibt es 2TB Platten, welche kaum grösser wie ein Smartphone sind. Was die Adobe Produkte (host datei) betrifft, würde ich die löschen, wenn Du professionell auflegst. Und Avast und Little Snitch würde ich nicht mehr installieren. Letzteres nur wenn Du wirklich weisst, was Du damit tust. Und bevor Du die Kiste platt machst, natürlich zuerst ein Backup (mit TM) machen. Und was die Seriösität der Tipps betrifft, würde ich mich zu 100% auf John festlegen. Seine Tipps mögen manchmal hart tönen, sind aber korrekt. MikeMuc24.08.1610:10 Ale allerwichtigstes wird sein das du deine Platte aufräumst und Daten auslagerst. 7 GB freier Speicher sind des Systems Tod. Dann schau das du den Avast und die restlichen oben empfohlene Software deinstallierst. Das mit CS4 und den Kosteinträgen läßt tief blicken, ist aber dein Bier und schadet hier nicht. Aber wenn du die Software nicht wirklich brauchst dann deinstallieren die, das gibt auch ein wenig Speicher auf der Platte frei. Erst dann schraub das Ding auch wenn du unbedingt willst. Beim Staub "ausblasen" klemme den Lüfter ab oder blockiere ihn damit er nicht hoch dreht. Den jeder Motor ist im "Umkehrbetrieb" ein Dynamo und erzeugt Strom. Zuviel davon mögen die Bauteile auf der Platine gar nicht gern. Lockenheld24.08.1610:15 Also die Musik bleibt definitiv auf meiner internen Festplatte. Ich habe mich gestern noch von ein paar alten Sachen getrennt, somit sind jetzt 24 GB frei. Avast habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Selbst während ich nur diese Zeilen hier tippe, läuft "launchd" wieder mit 70% mit und bringt die Lüfter zum Glühen. Jeronimo24.08.1610:19 Technobilder Leider werden Dir hier die wenigsten Nutzer helfen. Ach. Aber ellenlanges Geschwafel hilft? Und das dann resultierend im hirnlosesten Lösungsansatz ever – sich mit iStat Menus die Lüfteraktivität anzeigen lassen? Ich hab hier gar nicht so viel Wände, gegen die ich jetzt meinen Kopp hauen möchte. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ Lockenheld24.08.1610:37 Also ich hatte das Macbook auch gerade auf. Da war so gut wie keinerlei Staub im Bereich der Lüfter. StefanE24.08.1610:42 Lockenheld Wie hast du denn Avast entfernt? Ist meines Wissens gar nicht so leicht, den komplett zu entfernen. daneben noch der erste Post von sffan. Ich persönlich würde die Liste noch um Java erweitern. Prüfe mal, was du davon unbedingt brauchst. Und Flash für den Browser ist mittlerweile meist überflüssig. Außer einige Seiten, die noch darauf bestehen. Achtung: Hier gibt es aber einen Deinstaller von Adobe(!) - nur mit dem wird der komplett entfernt. Dann checke noch all deine Launch Daemons und Agents sowie Login-Items. Alles was nicht unbedingt notwendig ist sollte hier am besten raus. Zu guter letzt: Neustart des Macs. Behebt auch manche Probleme. Wie immer gilt aber: Bevor du groß was änderst - mach ein Backup! „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ adiga24.08.1610:48 Wenn Du Flash wirklich benötigst, dann installiere doch Chrome. Da laufen Flashfilme. Ich würde kein Add-In für Safari laden extra für Flash. Lockenheld24.08.1612:58 Silverlight habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Also wenn ich zurückblicke habe ich in Firefox viele Seiten, die den Flash Player benötigen. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? dom_beta24.08.1613:02 Lockenheld Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Nein. „..“ Jeronimo24.08.1613:05 Lockenheld Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Nein, nicht mehr. Hier mal eine vermutlich eher unpopuläre Idee. Dein System ist ja immer noch auf (einer frühen Version von) Yosemite. Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Und zwar frisch. Sprich: Komplettes Backup machen, Volume löschen, El Capitan neu installieren. Dann die Programme, die Du wirklich brauchst (gute Gelegenheit zum Ausmisten) von Grund auf neu installieren. Vor allen Dingen nicht mit dem Migrationsassistent die Daten vom Backup zurückholen, so fängst Du Dir den ganzen Schrott wieder ein, der Dir vorher das Leben schwer gemacht hat. Dauert das? Ja, tut es. Aber überleg mal, wieviel Zeit Du schon in das Troubleshooting (inkl. Postings hier) gesteckt hast, und wieviel Zeit Dir durch ein suboptimales System flöten geht. Wenn dann Sierra kommt und Du upgraden willst, geht das von einem frischen EC-Install wesentlich stressfreier als von einer jahrelang durch "Programme" (wie Du es nennst ) zugemüllten Installation. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ StefanE24.08.1613:06 Lockenheld Silverlight habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Also wenn ich zurückblicke habe ich in Firefox viele Seiten, die den Flash Player benötigen. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? Youtube braucht schon lange keinen FlashPlayer mehr. Es nutzt diesen nur noch, wenn er auf dem System vorhanden ist. Ansonsten HTML5. Entferne den Flashplayer doch einmal und dann gehe deine wichtigen und meistgenutzten Seiten (samt Funktionen) durch und schau, ob der Flashplayer unbedingt notwendig ist. Evtl. gibt es Alternative Seiten oder auch Apps dafür . Ansonsten nutze die Seiten wie bereits vorgeschlagen einfach im Chrome Browser. Falls du auch Amazon Video verwendest: Dieses greift nur in bestimmten Browsern auf den HTML5 Player zurück. ob Firefox dabei ist weiß ich nicht, Safari ist nicht dabei. Ich selbst nutze dafür den Opera Browser. zu deiner zweiten Frage: Ja gibt es: In den Systeminformationen Programme (oder so ähnlich) „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ dom_beta24.08.1613:18 Jeronimo Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Es gibt meines Erachtens nach keinen Grund, nicht auf "El Capitan" umzusteigen. „..“ matt.ludwig24.08.1614:54 dom_beta Jeronimo Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Es gibt meines Erachtens nach keinen Grund, nicht auf "El Capitan" umzusteigen. Es gibt Leute die es einfach nicht möchten. Wann geht das endlich mal in deinen Kopf? Jeronimo hat schon recht, damit wirst du definitiv alle Altlasten los. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? Ja im Terminal per: grep 'Installed' /private/var/log/install.log Lockenheld24.08.1615:32 Also Growl und Flash habe ich gerade per Deinstaller runtergeschmissen ... Ich update noch nicht, weil ich nicht weiß, wie es mit meiner DJ Software (Traktor) aussieht - ob sie problemlos läuft. Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... StefanE24.08.1615:41 Lockenheld Ich update noch nicht, weil ich nicht weiß, wie es mit meiner DJ Software (Traktor) aussieht - ob sie problemlos läuft. Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Also ich kenne die Software nicht, habe aber mal schnell geschaut: Traktor Pro/LE 2 von Native-Instruments soll in der Version 2.10 kompatibel sein. Danach sollte einem Update doch nichts im Wege stehen. Aber immer ein Backup machen Du könntest El Capitan auch erst auf einer externen Platte installieren und es testen bevor du dich für das Update entscheidest. „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ sierkb24.08.1615:45 Lockenheld: Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Du hast Dich hier gemeldet, weil Dein system eben nicht mehr so runnt... Weil es total bis Oberkante Unterlippe zugemüllt ist. Kein Wunder, dass das System stockt und Atemnot hat bzw. bekommt und nicht so rund läuft wie es soll. Also solltest Du die Tipps hier beherzigen und es mal gründlich aufräumen und ausmisten oder vielleicht mal ganz frisch neu aufsetzen und dann nur das installieren und am Laufen haben, das Du zum Auflegen unbedingt brauchst, alles andere gehört auf so ein Arbeitsgerät dann nicht drauf, kann weggelassen werden, sollte zugunsten Luft und Raum für die eigentlich zu verrichtenden Tätigkeiten weggelassen werden, bläht und bremst nur unnötig auf. Zum Auflegen brauchst Du sicher nur die Hälfte von dem, was Du da alles installiet hast, wenn überhaupt. Mache das System mal rank und schlank, bringe es auf einen aktuellen Stand, und dann hast Du auch mit dem obersten und wichtigsten Prozess des Systems (launchd), der alle anderen Prozesse startet, steuert und in Gang hält, auch kein Problem mehr. Und bzgl. Backup: das sowieso haben und vorhalten und aktuell halten. Jeronimo24.08.1616:02 Lockenheld Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Na Du bist mir ja ein Herzchen. Dann verschwende hier auch bitte nicht anderer Leute Zeit, wenn Dein system so super runnt und Du es never changen willst. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ Lockenheld24.08.1616:21 Nein, nein ... nicht falsch verstehen Bis vor ein paar Wochen lief ja auch alles gut. Da hatte ich keine Probleme. Erst seitdem der Lüfter durchdreht und "launchd" mir die CPU wegfrisst. Seitdem habe ich hier Probleme. Das bedeutet ja, dass es davor auch zugemüllt war - aber irgendetwas hat ihm den letzten Rest gegeben. Ich habe erst letzte Woche ein Backup mit "superduper" gemacht. Momentan fahre ich bei Traktor noch 2.0.1. Deswegen ziere ich mich so, das update aufzuspielen. sffan24.08.1618:28 Lockenheld Also die Musik bleibt definitiv auf meiner internen Festplatte. Ich habe mich gestern noch von ein paar alten Sachen getrennt, somit sind jetzt 24 GB frei. Tipp: Nicht neu, aber nützlich: Damit kann man graphisch aufbereitet nach Platzfresser suchen und so vielleicht noch Platz schaffen. 24 GB sind immer noch zu wenig. Lockenheld Selbst während ich nur diese Zeilen hier tippe, läuft "launchd" wieder mit 70% mit und bringt die Lüfter zum Glühen.Das ist nicht normal. evtl. sollte die "Datenbank", auf die lauchd aufsetzt, mal neu aufgebaut werden. sffan24.08.1618:45 Ein Schuss ins Blaue: Waren nicht unter Yosemite noch die Wifi-Probleme durch den neuen Netzwerkdienst präsent? Durch den Rollback auf den "alten Dienst" durch apple wurde es m.E. ab 10.10.4 zumindest wieder besser.. Lockenheld: Kanns sein, daß Du über WiFi ins Internet gehst, während launchd cpu zeit frisst? Ist das besser, wenn Du wifi ausschaltest und testweise mit einen guten alten Lan-Kabel am Router ins I-Net gehst? Wenn ja: wäre es ein gutes Argument noch mal aufzuräumen (Platz für update) und zumindest auf 10.10.5 zu gehen. Ein post eines neuen etrechk-logs könnte auch was bringen. Dann sieht man was inzwischen weg ist und ob sich nun neue Macken zeigen. Ein Blick in die Konsole-app könnte auch was bringen. Probleme mit launchd führen oft zu Einträgen in den logs ,die die Konsole aufbereitet darstellt. sierkb24.08.1619:54 Lockenheld: Was sagt die Aktivitätsanzeige sortiert nach %CPU? Welcher Prozess, welche App steht, wenn bei Dir die Lüfter auf Volllast drehen, ganz oben und verbraucht dann am Meisten? Lockenheld24.08.1621:35 Zum Aufäumen der Festplatte hatte ich "Omnidisksweeper" benutzt. Mit dem WLAN hat es nichts zu tun. Wenn ich auflege habe ich das WLAN aus und der Luft hat 8 Stunden Vollgas gegeben. Wenn die Lüfter durchdrehen und die CPU auf 100 steht, dann ist es launchd, der so viel frisst. @elias24.08.1621:54 @Lockenheld Lauchd ist das Management Framework das für das Starten, beenden und Verwalten von Prozessen zuständig ist. Es ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Systems und läuft so wie es soll. Die Last liegt bei dir an anderer Stelle und zwar hast du sehr viele Programme die in den LaunchDaemons und LauchAgents mit dem System gestartet werden und ständig im Hintergrund laufen. Firefox z.B. beansprucht sehr viel Speicher (weit über 1 GB) Avast und Adobe sind weitere Speicherfresser und darüber hinaus parentelcontrol (brauchst du das?) was die Prozesse überwacht. Speicher musst du frei machen 5 GB freier Speicher sind zu wenig. Wie du vorgehen musst da kann ich dir helfen aber wenn ich mir dein System so ansehe würde ich vorschlagen das du alle deine persönlichen Daten sicherst und das System neu aufsetzt. Wenn du das möchtest (oder Bereinigen) dann schreib kurz und ich werde dich Anleiten. sierkb24.08.1621:54 Lockenheld Wenn die Lüfter durchdrehen und die CPU auf 100 steht, dann ist es launchd, der so viel frisst. launchd ist Prozess Nummer 1 des Systems (PID 1), er startet das gesamte System nach dem Einschalten und mit dem Hochfahren, er hält das gesamte System am Laufen. Alle Prozesse, alle Programme, Daemons und Dienstprogramme, die das System am Laufen halten, werden von ihm durch nachgeordnete Kindprozesse gestartet und verwaltet. Oder andersherum ausgedrückt: jedes gestartete Programm, jede App, hat den launchd-Prozess mit der Prozess-ID 1 oder einen Fork davon zur Grundlage, der dann jene App, jenen Dienst, jenes Programm gestartet hat und steuert. Wenn also DIESER wichtigste und oberste Prozess, der alles am Laufen hält und steuert, bei Dir sowas zur Folge hat, dann scheint da irgendwas SEHR im Argen zu sein. Versuche mal rauszubekommen, welcher Folgeprozess, welche gestartete Applikation oder welcher Dienst via LaunchDaemon oder LaunchAgent launchd so auf Trab hält und beschäftigt. Was sagt ein Blick in /var/log/system.log? Entweder durch Blick in die Konsole (Konsole.app) oder zum Beispiel mit sudo tail -f /var/log/system.log oder sudo tail -n 200 -f /var/log/system.log (der Schalter -n 200 zeigt die letzten 200 Einträge an)? Zudem: brauchst Du wirklich ALLE Internet-Plugins, die da installiert sind? Das ist ja ein ganzer Zoo, und eines fragwürdiger als das andere. Brauchst Du das Java-Plufgin zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du Teamviewer zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du Office zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du meilenstein zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du die ganze Adobe Scheiße zum Auflegen? Etc. pp. Du hast 8GB RAM-Speicher. Knalle den mal nicht so voll mit unzähligen Hintergrundprogrammen (Daemons) und Plugins, die geladen werden. @elias24.08.1621:58 Wenn also DIESER wichtigste und oberste Prozess, der alles am Laufen hält und steuert, bei Dir sowas zur Folge hat, dann scheint da irgendwas SEHR im Argen zu sein. Blödsinn schau bitte hier sierkb24.08.1622:02 @elias: Ist schon richtig und kein Blödsinn, was ich da geschrieben habe. launchd , ersetzt seit Tiger vollständig den init-Prozess (PID 1) klassischer Unix-Systeme und tut noch Einiges mehr. Darüber müssen wir jetzt aber nicht streiten. Hier geht's um was anderes. @elias24.08.1622:07 Das ist doch richtig ist aber NICHT DER Prozess (wenn überhaupt) der für den Speicherhunger verantwortlich ist. Wenn du in die Lauch* Programme einfügst dann macht launchd genau das - es startet die Programme - sonst nichts. Ich habe zumindest noch nicht erlebt das launchd eine Meldung anzeigt das Programm xy sehr viel Speicher verbraucht. sierkb24.08.1622:19 @elias: Das ist doch richtig ist aber NICHT DER Prozess (wenn überhaupt) der für den Speicherhunger verantwortlich ist. Bitte lies mal von oben nach unten nochmal, was ich geschrieben habe. Weil ich das genauso sehe wie Du, frage ich da so gezielt nach und hab's erklärt. Weil es da irgendwas Anderes gibt, das diesen launchd-Prozess so auf Trab hält, der ist sicher NICHT die Ursache für das alles und nicht für die Prozessorlast, dieser launchd-Prozess, der da angeblich 100% zeigt, ist sicher nur Opfer und Folge eines anderen amoklaufenden Prozesses bzw. einer anderen Auslastung aber sicher nicht die Ursache. Deswegen mal ins Syslog reinschauen, was da drinsteht. Sehe ich doch eigentlich ganz genauso wie Du. Ich fühle mich von Dir grad' total missverstanden. Lockenheld24.08.1622:21 Aber "parentelcontrol" also die Kindersicherung habe ich doch gar nicht aktiviert?? Oder? Ich hatte oben doch geschrieben, dass ich vor kurzem ein Programm installiert hatte und dass es seitdem sehr viel schlimmer wurde. Das ganze war bartender. Ich hatte es manuell von der Platte geschmissen und habe jetzt gesehen, dass in den "launchdaemons" noch ein Eintrag dazu war. Die beiden launch Ordner kannte ich gar nicht, gescheigedenn deren Funktion. Habe dort jetzt auch mal aufgeräumt. Ich denke das wird man in der nächsten Auswertung sehen.

Du musst also damit beginnen einige Programme die du nicht mehr benötigst zu entfernen. Beginne mit Avast: ist zwar die 2015er aber der Prozess für die Deinstallation ist gleich. Leere die Caches von Safari und Firefox. Schau nach anderen Programmen die du nicht mehr benötigst - entferne diese. Starte in den gesicherten Modus und leere die Systemcaches.

Das Plugin wird von Google eh nicht mehr gepflegt und wurde von Google abgeschossen. Weg damit. Verbraucht nur unnötig RAM-Speicher, wenn Du den Browser laufen hast. Wozu brauchst Du ein SharePointBrowser-Plugin im Web-Browser? Zum Auflegen von Musik? Weg damit, verbraucht nur unnötig RAM-Speicher, wenn Du den Browser laufen hast. Gleiches zu sagen zum NP_2020Player_IKEA Plugin. Adobes PDF Viewer ebenso. Der Mac hat einen eingebauten PDF-Viewer (Preview/Vorschau), Safari nutzt diesen. Firefox hat einen eigenen eingebauten PDF-Viewer (PDF.js, Opera findet den übrigens so gut, dass sie ihn übernommen haben und ebenso nutzen), auch da brauchst Du keine Adobe Viewer Plugin. Das Adobe-Geraffel brauchst Du dazu nicht. Verbrät nur unnötig RAM-Speicher und ist eine zusätzliche Problem- und Fehlerquelle, erst recht, wenn veraltet. Und, und, und.

 How Microsoft built a computer so good, even Apple wanted to copy it Matt Weinberger Aug. 21, 2016, 8:30 AM 110,946 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Corporate VP of Devices Panos Panay.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider On May 20, 2014, Satya Nadella — the recently appointed CEO of Microsoft — sat down next to Microsoft Surface boss Panos Panay in a packed New York City auditorium. They were there to launch the Surface Pro 3, the newest version of Microsoft's tablet. "This is a big day," Nadella told Panay. "Let's get it right." The pressure was on: The first generation of Surface tablets had performed so badly in the market, Microsoft had to take a $900 million write-down for unsold inventory in 2013. The second Surface hadn't fared much better. Nadella had told Panay that the third version had to be right: "We need to make hardware that gives us permission to be in hardware."  'We need to make hardware that gives us permission to be in hardware.' — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  Panay knew what he was up against, but he was confident they were going to get it right on the third try. "You have a vision. You have a whole vision. It's never one generation that's going to get you there," Panay tells Business Insider. Now Microsoft has won a reputation as the trendsetter in tablets, with companies like Dell and HP following suit. And when Apple announced the iPad Pro in late 2015, the whole world couldn't help but notice that, with its keyboard cover and big screen, it looked a lot like the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Last year also saw the launch of the Microsoft Surface Book, the company's very first actual laptop, to positive reviews, with Wired calling it "the most exciting Windows laptop in years."  Microsoft? A hardware company? Indeed, there's a little bit of a hardware renaissance going on in Redmond, with a brand-new and gorgeous Xbox One S, the Surface Hub mega-tablet, and the Microsoft HoloLens all showing promise. There are even positive signs that the category of computers created by the Surface and Surface Book are helping turn around the overall shrinkage of the PC market. But it almost didn't work out that way. Here's how the Microsoft Surface was created — and how it's dragging Microsoft itself into the next phase of computing. The first generation Surface was also sold as "Surface with Windows RT."Wikimedia Commons A showcase for Windows 8 Around 2009, Microsoft's Windows division, then led by Steven Sinofsky, had started work on Windows 8.  The Apple iPhone, released in 2007, had ushered in a new era of touchscreen-friendly computing, and Sinofsky's team was planning to push Windows into the future. The new operating system would forgo classic elements of the operating system, including the iconic Start menu that had been around since Windows 95 in 1995, in favor of a new so-called Metro interface, with big, colorful "tiles" that were easy to push with your finger.  The problem was, PC manufacturers of the day were pretty happy making the traditional laptop and desktop computers that they always had and were focused on building "netbooks," super-cheap Windows computers that offered a crummy user experience. Microsoft worried that nobody in the Windows PC world was going to make the perfect touchscreen Windows computer that would "usher us in to that new era in computing." Panay says. "We needed to ensure it would happen right." Steven Sinofsky and Panos Panay at the 2012 launch of the original Microsoft Surface.AP Images/Jason DeCrow At the time, Panay was in charge of Microsoft's hardware business, which at that point mostly meant computer mice and keyboards. But his team had more experience with ergonomics and manufacturing than most of the others at Microsoft, so in early 2010, Microsoft leadership told Panay to "go create something." The iPad had just come out. Tablets were a hot commodity. If consumers wanted tablets, Panay's team decided, Microsoft would make the best and most productive tablet in the world.  "How are people going to do what people wanted to do?" Panay says. "'Tablet' was the easy word at the time." Torturing the team to get the details right Panay is known as a guy who sweats the details: When the Surface launched in 2012, he bragged that the company had 200 parts custom-designed and manufactured specifically for the tablet.  Coming up with the Surface's unique form factor, with the kickstand in the back and the Type Cover keyboard case in the front, took a lot of work, including prototyping the tablet with cardboard and tape until they got the weight and feel just right.  "I tortured [my team] the whole way," Panay says. "We needed something iconic. You can't create an icon; an icon creates itself." Prototype parts for the original Microsoft Surface tablet, created just to give a sense for the aesthetics before it was packed full of electronics.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider The design of the Surface was supposed to make it disappear in your hands — the point of the Surface was to highlight Windows, after all, not to bring attention to itself. From the get-go all the way through today, the Surface project was designed to highlight "the best of Microsoft," he says. "I think people separate hardware and software too quickly," says Panay.  It also had to show PC manufacturers like HP and Dell that the world was ready for something that combined the best of the PC and the best of the tablet. Surface tension Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer revealed the Surface to the world at an event in Los Angeles on June 18, 2012. That announcement also explained that the first Surface would run Windows RT — an offshoot of Windows 8 designed to run on the ARM-based processors used in most smartphones and tablets, including the iPhone and iPad at the time. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at the launch of Windows 8. It eschewed traditional Windows elements like the Start button in favor of big, touch-friendly buttons.Wikimedia Commons Because Windows RT ran on ARM processors, the first Surface would offer longer battery life than a regular PC, more along the lines of an iPad. But there was a huge trade-off: It couldn't run traditional Windows software at all. It could only run preloaded Microsoft software like the special version of Office Microsoft created for RT and a very few apps available from the new Windows Store app market. When the first Surface launched to the public in October 2012 alongside Windows 8, Microsoft commemorated it with a webcast launch event that featured then-Windows chief Sinofsky riding a custom version of the Surface like a skateboard. (Sinofsky left Microsoft in November 2012.) Couldn't resist taking it out for a spin... #surface pic.twitter.com/Nzj2xj6T — Steven Sinofsky (@stevesi) October 16, 2012 In February 2013, Microsoft followed the first Surface up with the Surface Pro.  Where the Surface was more like a tablet with an optional keyboard, the Pro had the guts of a laptop. It looked a lot like the regular Surface, but sported a higher-resolution screen, a Surface Pen stylus for touch input, and, most importantly, a full version of Windows 8.  Steve Kovach/Business Insider Despite some early excitement and some positive reviews, the first-generation Surface devices would turn out to be a huge disappointment for Microsoft.  The ARM-based Surface compared favorably with the iPad on battery life but got slammed because Windows RT couldn't run the apps that people actually wanted. The Surface Pro fared better with its full Windows 8 installation but offered lousier battery life and performance than a regular laptop. Plus, both devices were only originally offered at Microsoft's retail stores, limiting availability. In March 2013, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had sold only around 1.5 million Surface devices, 400,000 of which were Surface Pros. That was well short of the company's expectation that it would sell 2 million Surfaces in the last quarter of 2012 alone. In July 2013, Microsoft took a $900 million write-down on the Surface business, mostly related to unsold inventory of the original ARM-based Surface devices. Despite the warning signs, Microsoft stayed the course. In late 2013, Microsoft announced a Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, with better battery life and performance. But sales didn't improve much, perhaps because Windows 8 itself wasn't much liked.  "We needed better battery life. We needed better performance for people," Panay now reflects. That's the Surface situation that Satya Nadella inherited when he took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014.  All one team Behind the scenes, one of the first things Nadella did was start to upgrade Microsoft's culture. Microsoft in the 2000s functioned like a group of warring fiefdoms — loosely related product groups fighting for supremacy. Previous CEO Steve Ballmer had started unifying the company under one banner, as one team, but left Microsoft before those changes fully took hold. Nadella made it one of his top priorities to continue that transition. So while the Surface business had been floundering, Nadella saw opportunity. When Nadella took over Microsoft, they had already started working on Windows 10, the successor to Windows 8, designed to better toe the line between the desktop Windows of old and the touchscreen future. To prepare for that future, Microsoft still needed a computer that showed off its best features, the combination of touch screen and traditional Windows laptop. "It's part of the growth story for Windows and for Microsoft," Panay says.Left to right: Microsoft CVP Panos Panay, former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the 2014 launch of the Surface Pro 3.AP Photo/Mark Lennihan So Nadella and Panay started bringing the rest of the company into the process of designing the Surface Pro 3 — a process that continued into the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. The Skype team now advises the Surface on the camera and speakers, Panay says, and the OneNote team advises on the stylus features. Panay says that Microsoft doesn't even talk in terms of "software" or "hardware" anymore, just the products that they make. "Everybody's on the same boat — grab an oar, let's move forward," Panay says. Finding a focus: power users The Surface Pro 3 launched in June 2014 and looked similar to its forebearers. But in practice, it was thinner, lighter, and more responsive. Reviewers like Yahoo's David Pogue found it to be "an actual, fast, luxury laptop" in addition to a worthwhile tablet.  "It wasn't until [Surface] Pro 3 that we had crossed the chasm," Panay says. "We learned enough from our failures." While Microsoft doesn't report sales numbers, the Surface division posted its first profitable quarter in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, with revenue exceeding $1 billion just a quarter later.   Screenshot In the summer of 2015, Microsoft introduced a smaller Surface 3. But there was a big change: Instead of the now discontinued Windows RT, it ran full Windows 8.1, meaning it could run old apps and new. As Panay has said in interviews, that change came directly from customer frustration with Windows RT — the Surface was always pitched as a tablet that can replace your laptop, but Windows RT was way too limited for that. People wanted full Windows on Intel, so that's what they got. Plus, they got a better and more flexible kickstand and better battery life. Microsoft was finally delivering on the promise to deliver a tablet that could replace your laptop. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4, launched October 2015, still doesn't have a non-Pro counterpart Surface 4, with no indication that it's coming. To Panay, that's a natural evolution. Instead of supporting two operating systems, the whole Surface line is now on the most recent Windows 10. Instead of trying to serve consumers and businesses simultaneously, Microsoft is focusing on productivity — which includes the Surface Book's groundbreaking detachable tablet features. Melia Robinson/Business Insider "We've gone from complexity to opportunity," Panay says. The key, he says, is to never compromise on the people-pleasing aesthetics or features of the device to satisfy enterprises, because, "enterprises are made of people."  In July 2015, following the success of the Surface Pro 3 and the turnaround in the overall Surface business, Panay was placed in charge of Microsoft's overall hardware business. Every new Microsoft device, including the Xbox One S console, the Microsoft HoloLens, and the rumored next-generation Windows phone, have to pass through Panay's team. Meanwhile, the effects of the Surface's effect on the market are hard to miss. Microsoft is partnering with the likes of Dell and HP to sell more Surfaces, even as they build their own Surface-esque devices. IBM partnered up with Microsoft to push Surface in the workplace, too.  The Microsoft Surface Pro 4, left, with the Apple iPad Pro, right.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider It's not all sunshine and roses for Surface, though: Despite the fact that Surface was a $4.1 billion business last quarter, and despite the fact that the Microsoft Surface basically invented the market that Apple is now carving out for itself with the iPad Pro, Microsoft is still lagging behind Apple in so-called hybrid-tablet sales overall. "Do I get frustrated now and then? Sure," Panay says of seeing competitors like Apple copy Microsoft's inventions. But still, he says he's focused on the future, with more to come from Surface. Reports hold that Microsoft will be announcing updates to the Surface Book and a new Surface all-in-one desktop PC later this year.  "Want to light me up? Let me give people something new," Panay says.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business updated: 8/22/2016 6:15 AM Experts compare Trump's, Clinton's cybersecurity policies Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   How seriously should voters take high-tech hiccups? And what will a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump victory mean for the United States' ability to fend off the rising tide of digital attacks?   Andrea Peterson Washington Post     Cybersecurity is now a top national security problem -- some officials even call it a bigger threat than terrorism. But both major presidential candidates have hit hurdles on the campaign trail that raised questions about how they would try to keep U.S. computers safe if elected. Just last month, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton escaped criminal prosecution for using a private email server for work as secretary of state -- but got a tongue-lashing from the director of the FBI for being "extremely careless" by using it. Then emails from the Democratic National Committee were released by WikiLeaks, exposing politically embarrassing information. As that scandal unfolded, GOP candidate Donald Trump seemed to urge Russian government hackers to hack Clinton. Although he played down his comments as sarcastic, the idea of a presidential candidate inviting a foreign power to hack a U.S. citizen raised flags for some. Trump's remarks also put a microscope on his apparently cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- whose government many say was behind the Democratic National Committee hack. How seriously should voters take those high-tech hiccups? And what will a Clinton or Trump victory mean for the United States' ability to fend off the rising tide of digital attacks? To answer those questions, The Washington Post reached out to cybersecurity policy experts, including academics, think-tankers and officials from previous Republican and Democratic administrations and asked them to evaluate both candidates' cybersecurity policy strategies and whether they were more concerned about Clinton's private email server or Trump's hacking comments. --- Here's what they said: Gen. Michael Hayden Former CIA and NSA director who worked in high-level posts during the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. Now a principal at the Chertoff Group. Hayden said he found Clinton's "email faux pas" and Trump's comments about Russian hackers "equally off-putting." However, he hadn't seen enough from either campaign to evaluate their overall cybersecurity strategies. One area he wanted to hear more about was how the candidates would act on the encryption debate if elected. During the debate between Apple and the FBI over the San Bernardino, Calif., phone, Clinton largely sidestepped the issue while Trump called for a boycott of Apple. "For the record, I shade toward Apple because I believe the private sector will be the main effort when it comes to cyberdefense," Hayden said. "The Trump answer was vintage ... bold, clear and wrong," he said. Stewart Baker Former NSA general council and Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for policy during the George W. Bush administration. Currently a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson. "Hillary Clinton's use of a home-brew email server with laughably bad security was appalling and irresponsible," Baker said. "It looks as though she was more afraid of Republicans and prosecutors than of Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies." He thought Trump was joking when he made the Russian hacker comment, "but it was a joke with a sharp point for Clinton because in fact the Russians probably had better access to those emails than the FBI; after all, Clinton's lawyers had aggressively wiped the servers by the time the FBI got there." The claim that he was asking Russia to commit cyberespionage "is a symptom of the press's Trump Derangement Syndrome," he said. Baker said the candidate's positions on cybersecurity mirror over campaign strategies: "Clinton's position is cautious, incremental, sober and boring: a cybersecurity third term for President Obama. She is proposing nothing that President Obama hasn't already proposed," he said. Trump's position, on the other hand is "impressionistic and focused on American decline," according to Baker. "He doesn't like our current posture and might do something dramatic to change it. Whether he will, and what that might be, who knows?" On encryption, the two parties' official stances are "indistinguishable," he said -- with both party platforms calling for a "balanced" solution. However, "Trump's actual unfiltered statements are quite different from the massaged language of the GOP platform; on the whole he is more friendly to government and law and order and crime victims than to West Coast billionaires," Baker said. Susan Landau Former senior staff privacy adviser at Google and current professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Landau declined to weigh in on whether she was more concerned about Clinton's use of a private email server or Trump's Russian hackers comment. But she had plenty of thoughts about how to evaluate what we know about the candidates' cybersecurity strategies. "There are three different aspects to consider: the two candidates' views on cybersecurity initiatives, the party platforms and the issue of cryptography policy," she said. "Cyber is a hard problem," involving economic, technical and policy issues, she said, and "on this count, Clinton certainly has the advantage: she understands complex negotiations with many moving parts." But Trump's response to David Sanger in a New York Times interview earlier this year -- in which he claimed that the United States was way behind on cybersecurity -- seemed to show Trump was unaware of things like the Stuxnet attack, a cyberattack on Iranian nuclear facilities thought to be the work of the United States and Israel, she said. Neither candidate has laid out too much of a cybersecurity plan so far, she said, nor did party platforms weigh in on the encryption debate. But Trump's response to the Apple-FBI legal battle -- calling for a boycott of Apple -- wasn't a good sign, according to Landau. "By providing a more secure system for online access, Apple's secured phone is an excellent step in the right direction for cybersecurity, something that candidate Trump does not seem to grasp," she said. "I would say that the Clinton/Democratic proposals are a B/B-plus at present, while the Trump/Republican direction is a D/D-minus at best," Landau concluded. Peter Swire Former chief counselor for privacy in Office of Management and Budget during the Bill Clinton administration. Now a law professor at Georgia Tech. Swire's response focused more on Trump's comments than Clinton's email server situation. "Urging a Russian attack is directly contrary to his party's platform, which says 'an attack will not be tolerated,'" he said. Although neither Trump nor Clinton are tech experts themselves, Clinton helped greatly expand the State Department's cybersecurity portfolio when she was secretary of state "and that continues today," he said. "There is no magical solution for cybersecurity, no matter who is president," Swire added. "Instead, it takes funding, persistence and building a large team that can defend against a world full of threats. Based on the conventions if nothing else, Clinton builds and leads that sort of team far more than Trump." Paul Rosenzweig DHS assistant secretary for policy during the George W. Bush administration. Current Principal at Red Branch Consulting. "Secretary Clinton is really offering us more of the same -- it's the Obama policy continued forward and improved," Rosenzweig said. "I would say that I would not expect Secretary Clinton to have any grand new initiatives, although circumstances might drive something new. To some degree that's a little disappointing because I think we've reached a bit of a stasis point: We're playing a lot of defense and we don't have too much offensive strategy," he continued. But when it comes to Trump, Rosenzweig said he has "no real idea what he would do." When it came to the Clinton email scandal vs. Trump's Russian hacker comments, he seemed more focused on the comments. "[Trump] says we have to get more aggressive, but then he perhaps jokingly invites information operations against his own country. I don't know what to make of it," Rosenzweig said. "I suspect his policy would come with a blind spot to Russian adventurism that would be disadvantageous to American interests," he added. "My hope would be that [cybersecurity] would be one of the areas where [Trump] wouldn't be paying too much attention" and instead bring in experts to guide policy, he said. "That would probably be more of the same as well, although there might be some evolution because he'd be willing to let people break more china -- the dishes, not actual China," Rosenzweig said. But Rosenzweig also said there wasn't a lot to go on to judge Trump's strategy. "There's no information out there or theory that underlies his foreign policy. If I had a sense of what he was doing in the physical world, I could probably extrapolate to the digital world, but there's really nothing there," he said. Julian Sanchez Senior fellow focused on technology and civil liberties at the Cato Institute. Sanchez said both Clinton's email server situation and Trump's Russian hacker comments were "pretty bad, but probably somewhat overblown." "Even on the charitable premise that Trump was attempting to make a joke, it's obviously irresponsible for a major party presidential candidate to signal winking approval of foreign cyberattacks on the opposing party, because even the act of joking about it suggests you're not terribly serious about imposing costs on Russia if it continues its current conduct," he said. On Clinton's email, Sanchez was more concerned about transparency than national security implications. "I don't think anyone buys the idea that she set up a private server for 'convenience' rather than to retain control over correspondence legally subject to Freedom of Information requests," he said. When it comes to overall cybersecurity strategy, Sanchez says it's hard to judge Trump "because he doesn't appear to have one, unless welcoming Russian hacks counts. "Clinton, on the other hand, has made it "fairly clear that her approach to cyber would represent a continuation of the Obama administration's Cybersecurity National Action Plan, with a focus on information sharing with the private sector and an integrated approach across federal networks under the stewardship of a federal chief information security officer," he said. "As far as a comparison of the two goes, I suppose 'having a plan' beats 'not having one,'" Sanchez concluded.

By Jennifer Van Grove, The San Diego Union-Tribune Published: August 21, 2016, 5:00 AM A   A SAN DIEGO — A seemingly simple quest to find a way to track jogs without lugging around an iPhone morphed into a complex realization. For years now, wearables have been touted as the next big thing in tech, yet even the trend-defining Apple has struggled to produce a device that resonates with the masses. This industry, with all the promise in the world to make us healthier, more informed human beings, still seems to be nothing more than a sleepy tech segment, one that certainly hasn’t lived up to its initial hype. After all, the runaway leader in the category, Fitbit, sold a modest 4.8 million connected devices during the first three months of the year. The company’s stock has been on the struggle bus this year, and Fitbit’s market capitalization is well shy of its value after its initial public offering last June. “We are after square one,” Ramon Llamas said of the wearables space. Llamas is the wearables research manager at International Data Corp. “But we’re still in the initial stages.” The firm estimates that vendors shipped nearly 20 million wearables in the first quarter of 2016. Though that’s a 67 percent increase over a year ago, it is a meager number compared with the more than 334 million smartphones vendors shipped during the same period. The comparison is, of course, unfair. In this day and age, almost everyone requires a smartphone — if only to participate in the “Pokemon Go” craze. On the other hand, no one truly needs a smartwatch or fitness band, especially since many of us long ago ditched our more traditional wristwatches. And phones do an acceptable job of counting steps. Still, there seems to be a gradual, growing acceptance of at least the most basic of fitness trackers. Though they have a singular purpose, to track your fitness, and they offer the same features on day 100 as they do on day one, they are approachable to regular folks. “Fitness trackers are more popular than smartwatches,” said Llamas. “They are things that people really get. You can wrap your brain around how many steps you’ve taken, how many calories you’ve burned. And the price point is reasonable to most. Whereas with a smartwatch, people sometimes don’t get it.” Apple shipped 55 percent fewer watches in the second quarter than it did a year ago, according to the firm. The electronics retailer was also the only smartphone vendor among the top five to experience an annual decline in shipments. With 47 percent market share, Apple is the leader in the smartwatch sector. And some people really swear by their Apple Watches. Basics vs. buzzy Take Rob Marlbrough, a 45-year-old and self-described early adopter, who purchased his Apple Watch Sport soon after it was released in April 2015. He continues to wear it everyday, albeit with an upgraded Milanese Loop band. He likes the watch’s basic features, primarily the calendar function, which reminds him of his upcoming meetings. “It’s nice not to pull my phone out every couple of minutes,” he added. “I turned off all the annoying stuff, Instagram notifications and Facebook notifications, because it was just too buzzy all the time.” On the other hand, there is another category of first-movers, often techies, who really wanted to want wearables. They were first to embrace what’s sometimes also called the quantified self movement, attaching bands to their wrists to optimize daily routines. But, for one reason or another, many have since stashed their bands and watches in drawers, never again to see the light of day. “I got one of the very first Fitbits. I used it obsessively,” said Samir Bhavnani, 39. “But I took it off one day. I went to charge it. Two weeks later, it still was sitting there on the charger.” That was a year and a half ago. In the interim, he tried the Apple Watch Sport, which was an anniversary present from his wife. It ultimately ended up on her wrist instead. “I didn’t like that I needed to charge another thing,” Bhavnani said. “There was not one compelling feature that made it worth that nightly charge.” Erica OGrady, 37, of Boulder, Colo., similarly gave up on her Jawbone Up, a fitness and sleep tracker with an accompanying mobile app that debuted at the end of 2011. OGrady got her first Up in 2012 and loved the sleep-tracking features and the app, but ended up going through five devices over a seven-month period and gave up. She has since considered trying a Fitbit and turned down a free Garmin band. She doesn’t want to have to deal with the hassle of replacing malfunctioning gadgets. “It got really frustrating,” she said of her Jawbone Up return-and-exchange experience. “If the hardware worked as well as the apps work, I’d be all in.” In theory, OGrady may not have to wait too much longer for more impressive hardware. “By the time we reach 2020, we will look back at devices we have today and say to ourselves, ‘My, my, my, they were state of the art, but by today’s standards, they are rather quaint,’” IDC’s Llamas said. Quaint and maybe just a little bit silly. Bhavnani’s two 6-year-olds wear the Misfit Flash, a $30 waterproof band that tracks steps and calories but doesn’t need to be charged. The young girl and boy now treat exercise like a game. They run around the park, with one of their parent’s iPhones in tow, playing “Pokemon Go” in the hopes of reaching their daily activity goal. Perhaps, then, we shouldn’t rule out “Pokemon Go’s” potential to raise the profile of fitness trackers and other wearables. Apparently, Jawbone Up wearers who played the augmented reality smartphone game over the weekend of July 9 logged 62.5 more steps on average than the prior weekend. After all, if you’re going to spend your life chasing fictional characters, you might as well have data to prove you did something worthwhile with your time.

The second-largest ride hailing firm in the U.S. held talks with or contacted Apple, Amazon, General Motors, Uber, Google, and Didi Chuxing over a potential sale, but was unable to find a buyer, said the newspaper's sources. G.M., one of the San Francisco-based company's largest investors with a $500 million stake in Lyft, was reportedly the most interested suitor, but ultimately failed to make a written offer. The good news for Lyft is that it has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion and is not in danger of closing down, said the sources, despite the company not yet being profitable. Earlier this month, Uber agreed to sell its Chinese arm to Didi Chuxing, which Apple recently invested $1 billion in. The sale put a spanner in the works of Lyft's partnership with Didi, which allowed Didi customers to use their app to hail Lyft drivers, and vice versa. Lyft's so-called anti-Uber alliance with Didi is now in doubt and the U.S. based firm has said it is re-evaluating the agreement. Tag: Lyft 30 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Mac Fly (film) 13 weeks ago No news is bad news. Now more people have heard of Lyft. I hope Lyft succeed for the singular reason of how much I dislike the CEO of Uber. Such aggression and greed like he demonstrates is exactly what's wrong with society today and the kinds of reasons Wall St. is the way it is. People are dirt under his shoes on his pathway to success—no values. Rating: 4 Votes smacrumon 13 weeks ago Assuming ride sharing might tie into their car project, why can't Apple design their own version of Lyft or Uber if this is the road they are travelling down? Apple has the resources to do so, so why the need to look to, or invest, in another company? Rating: 3 Votes DTphonehome 13 weeks ago It would be a shame if Lyft ceased to exist. There MUST be competition to Uber if we want a fair marketplace. Can't have one company being the only ride sharing service. They'll raise prices, reduce payments to drivers, etc. I use Lyft whenever possible just to bolster them against Uber.

Possibly building a car and a ride sharing project would involve huge cost and take profit margins from the 30's that Apple enjoys to the mid to lower teens... which everyone else enjoys.

General Motors Co. Lear Corp. Automotive Law Legal Issues Technology Information technology Mobility Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto Thus far, the tech and auto industries have played nice, largely because of the use of joint development agreements. Other stories from this special report U.S. patent surge: 1994-2014 Dustin Walsh: Pro bono IP work a growing service Oakland County company settles eye care formula lawsuits with Bausch & Lomb As the West Coast's largest technology companies jump deeper into the automotive landscape, fears of increased litigation are bubbling in Southeast Michigan. In May, FCA US LLC and California's Google Inc. signed an agreement to jointly develop 100 autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Apple, and its Birmingham office, work to extend its Beats by Dre audio brand in FCA products. Ford Motor Co. and Google were rumored to be signing an agreement, but the deal fell through. Greg DeGrazia, partner and intellectual property attorney at law firm Warner Norcross and Judd LLP in Southfield, said that as the tech and auto industries continue to merge, a clash is on the horizon. "We're running toward a major issue, frankly," DeGrazia said. "While suppliers are scared to sue someone like General Motors because they could go out of business without the orders, companies like Google and Apple are not intimidated by GM, Ford or anyone else." Historically, automakers have always been the biggest player in the room in any negotiation. Not anymore. Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., has a market value near $550 billion, and Apple's market value is more than $585 billion, compared to Ford and GM at less than $50 billion and FCA at less than $9 billion. Apple generated revenue of $233.7 billion in 2015, more than $80 billion more than Detroit's biggest automaker, GM, which reported revenue of $152.4 billion last year. Google, for instance, has enough cash on hand — more than $9 billion in the second quarter — to buy FCA outright. Plus, the major U.S. tech players, including Google, Apple and Microsoft Inc., are litigious in protecting intellectual property. The trio has been involved in more than 1,100 patent lawsuits in the past 10 years, compared to the Detroit 3's 204, DeGrazia said. "Look at the judgments coming out of the cellphone wars," DeGrazia said. "Imagine what the damages could be for 10 million cars." In recent years, Apple has won more than $1 billion in damages in patent infringement cases against Korean cellphone maker Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., which uses Google's Android operating system, though many of those cases have been appealed and some overturned. "What if Google or Apple gets boxed out of the industry? Then they go on the offensive," DeGrazia said. "I fully anticipate patent infringement lawsuits in the pipeline." Thus far, the two industries have played nice, largely because of the use of joint development agreements (JDAs), said Martin Sultana, partner and IP attorney at Brooks Kushman PC in Southfield. Agreements with partners within the traditional auto supply chain can save time and smooth development, especially where patents exist. Advantages are magnified when auto companies dive into areas in which engineers have little experience — such as new software. "The perception is always that the auto companies better be on the lookout because of Apple and Google," Sultana said. "What they fail to realize is that Silicon Valley needs the auto industry just as much as the auto industry needs Silicon Valley. Working together, nicely, provides a significant advantage to getting autonomous vehicles out in the marketplace." Sultana said the JDAs are being driven by business decisions, and the auto companies realize Apple and Google are the enablers to get auto customers what they want and it behooves both industries to work toward fair deals. But those deals can be complicated, said Claudia Rast, partner at Butzel Long PC in Ann Arbor. Dealing with huge tech companies presents a different dynamic for auto companies, which are used to dictating most of the terms of an agreement to their suppliers. "It's very dynamic right now," Rast said. "The typical (automaker) model of buying tech and owning it doesn't work in this space. The big players out of California carry the big stick, so there's a lot of negotiating going on." Sultana said the biggest hurdle in the negotiation process is determining the value of the IP. "Not knowing the value, or future value, of the technology creates the biggest pitfalls," Sultana said. "But there's nothing in the legal framework that can't be overcome. If you've got two parties that want to engage in a joint development, they can make it happen." In some cases, auto companies are choosing to acquire outright advanced technologies instead of creating JDAs with the tech world's most powerful players. In May, GM closed on a $1 billion acquisition of San Francisco startup Cruise Automation. Cruise manufactures an aftermarket, roof-mounted autonomous-driving kit. For GM the deal provides access to Cruise's "deep software talent and rapid development capability to further accelerate" GM's development of autonomous vehicles. The acquisition is likely to represent one of the largest automotive M&A deals of the year and a deal that shows auto companies' escalating approach to buy technology. The total value of automotive supplier deals in 2015 and 2016 was $74.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with each of those years far exceeding the $17.7 billion annual average in the previous 10 years. The number of transactions valued at $500 million or more also skyrocketed to 18 last year, triple the level of the previous decade. "Automotive bankers are definitely spending more time in places like Silicon Valley," Christian Kames, Citigroup Inc.'s head of investment banking for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the global co-head of automotive, told Automotive News earlier this month. "The focus areas are electronics, communications and software. In the past, most suppliers didn't really have that kind of technology, but they now know they need to have it to set the industry standards for the future." Suppliers are also joining the fold of acquiring tech in lieu of signing JDAs. Last year, Southfield-based Lear Corp. acquired the intellectual property and technology of Santa Rosa, Calif.-based Autonet Mobile Inc., an internet-based telematics and app service provider for the automotive market, and Troy-based Arada Systems Inc., which is bringing to market a completely integrated modular unit that connects vehicles to infrastructure, other vehicles and the cloud. Connecting vehicles to infrastructure and other vehicles is designed to increase safety by enabling the ability to monitor traffic, push safety warnings or allow better traffic flow. The unit will be modular enough to upgrade the hardware easily, focused on security and software capable of over-the-air updates. Lear has since renamed its electrical business segment E-Systems to better reflect the complexity of its automotive electrical systems. "There's still plenty of room for the smaller tech companies to get into automotive," Rast said. "It's very disruptive. We're seeing medical device makers and companies designing 'wearables' technology looking to incorporate that tech in the car." Sultana said, though, as more and more tech comes online, the winning formulas will result in more JDA agreements and less acquisition activity. "Once the tech starts to mature, the concrete starts to dry, you may see more action down the road," Sultana said. "We'll see JDAs from either coast getting more action." DeGrazia, however, warns that when the tech does mature, the problems escalate. "It's a storm on the horizon," he said. "Google and the others are going to make money on their patent portfolio. There's no walking it back. Auto patent infringement lawsuits start rising as soon as autonomous vehicles hit the road."

By Amber Murakami-Fester, NerdWallet August 21, 2016 Save for later Saved A wallet containing cash and a Visa card in Surfside, Florida (Feb. 2, 2011). Wilfredo Lee/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of In snow-swept Sweden, the rise of mobile payments is making cash so sparse that some bank robbers have been left with  nothing to steal. But in the U.S., that day probably won’t come anytime soon. People have been predicting the demise of cash for nearly 50 years, says David Stearns, professor of money and technology at the University of Washington. As banks began adopting computers and credit cards made their appearance half a century ago, many predicted the elimination of paper currency. “We read in the mid-’60s about how cash [was] going to go away in a decade,” he said.

Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Not sold yet on mobile payments It’s true that more people are trying mobile payments. According to a study by research firms PYMNTS and InfoScout, 24% of respondents had  used Apple Pay in June 2016, up from 13% a year earlier. But during that same period, the number of people who “rarely consider using Apple Pay” jumped from 23% to 34%. In other words, Apple Pay attracts first-timers but has a hard time convincing them to stay. What’s more, cash remains widely popular. A 2014 study by the Federal Reserve showed that  cash is used to complete 40% of transactions, most of them less than $20. And a solid 30% of consumers also listed cash as their preferred way of paying. If anything, it seems mobile payments will become just one more way to pay. Plenty of places take only cash Odds are that in your town there are a few cash-only restaurants or shops. Indeed, 55% of small businesses in the U.S.  don’t accept plastic, according to a survey by financial software company Intuit. Accepting  credit cards can cost a business up to 4% per transaction, says Mallory Duncan, general counsel at the National Retail Federation, and mobile payments like  Apple Pay can be just as expensive for merchants. “If [mobile payments are] done in a way that simply replicates what credit cards do, they’re going to suffer from the same sort of disfavoring from merchants as credit cards,” Duncan says. Currency’s other value It’s not just necessity that binds us to cash. From the tooth fairy’s quarters to bills received on birthdays, cash can also be sentimental. It can even convey a nation’s values. Just look at the attention paid to the recent  decision to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. Barbara Howard, founder of Women on 20s, a group that advocated the change, says that placing perhaps the most famous of American abolitionists on our currency reveals “a transition in our consciousness.” Cash is more than a way to pay for stuff, she says. “[It’s] how we project ourselves to the rest of the world.” Amber Murakami-Fester is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Frank Ocean Perfects Avant-Garde Soul on Poetic, Stripped-Down 'Blonde' Our first impression of singer-songwriter's long-awaited new full-length Frank Ocean Perfects Avant-Garde Soul on Poetic, Stripped-Down 'Blonde' By Mosi Reeves August 21, 2016 More News Frank Ocean Releases Long-Awaited New Album 'Blonde' at Pop-Up Shops Watch Frank Ocean's Astounding 'Nikes' Video Frank Ocean's 'Endless' Film Offers Cryptic Prelude to Long-Awaited LP All Stories We all knew that Frank Ocean's highly anticipated follow-up to Channel Orange would be a surprise affair. The unannounced album is the lingua franca of pop in 2016, if not this decade. Still, the singer-songwriter formerly known as Christopher Breaux managed to wring some twists out of what has become a familiar marketing strategy. Early Friday morning, August 19th, he unveiled a 45-minute short film, Endless, on Apple Music with no prior warning, and with the promise of more music to come. Then on Saturday morning, he presented a video clip for "Nikes," a weird mélange of neon visuals and beautiful naked bodies. That evening, he delivered the main course – or two, if you happened to make it to one of four pop-up shops where he distributed free copies of his Boys Don't Cry lookbook. Those magazines contained a CD version of his new album, Blonde, that has a different track sequence than the one that appeared on Apple Music at the same time. Related Visiting Frank Ocean's Surprise NYC Pop-Up "You know he's gonna give you nothing short of greatness," says fan at downtown outpost offering singer's new magazine, LP The result is two new albums (and a half?) for the Frank Ocean fan to digest. However, the soundtrack to the Endless film seems like an impressionistic collage of demos, with tracks that fade out too quickly and a few sustained highlights. Meanwhile, Blonde sounds like the real deal. Sonically, it has the same contemplative and poetic tone as Ocean's lionized 2012 debut. In fact, it is so meditative that there are few beats at all; most of the Apple Music version is just gauzy laptop washes, pianos, laconically strummed guitars and his voice. He seems to have stripped himself to his bare thoughts, some of which he expresses inchoately. On "Close to You," he manipulates his vocals with odd effects so that they sound like a blur. Other times, he sings in cryptic verse. "Bad luck to talk on these rides/Mind on the road/Yet dilated eyes/Watch the clouds float/White Ferrari/Had a good time," he says on "White Ferrari." R&B fans may grouse that, much like its predecessor, Apple Music labeled Blonde as "Pop." But unlike Channel Orange and its Seventies singer-songwriter stoned-soul tones, this truly sounds like a post-millennial pop record, from its computerized ambience to a diverse list of contributors that include French electro-house producer Sebastian (who tells a silly little tale on "Facebook Story") and a lyrical reference to Elliot Smith's "A Fond Farewell" on "Seigfried." The presence of Kim Burrell's gospel testimonial near the end of "Godless" feeds into the minor narrative of urban pop heroes like Chance the Rapper, Kanye West and others re-engaging with spirituality. More News Frank Ocean Releases Long-Awaited New Album 'Blonde' at Pop-Up Shops Watch Frank Ocean's Astounding 'Nikes' Video Frank Ocean's 'Endless' Film Offers Cryptic Prelude to Long-Awaited LP All Stories When his words are clear, Frank Ocean sings about youth and sensuality. "We're not kids no more," he sings over the Twin Peaks–like glow of "Ivy." He sounds brazenly erotic when he asserts on "Solo," "I'll be your boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight." But on one of the album's highlights, "Seigfried," he sings plaintively, "I couldn't gauge your fears/I can't relate to my peers/I'd rather live outside/I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here." He offers only fleeting hints of what that sense otherness might mean, as on "Good Guy," a spare keyboard-and-voice interlude where he says to a date, "Here's to the gay bar you took me to." As an hour-long drift into Ocean's consciousness, Blonde blooms with lush, beautiful moments like "Pink + White," which features a maternal, wordless backing vocal from Beyoncé. (Other high-profile guests on the LP include Andre 3000, who lays down dazzling rapid-fire rhymes on "Solo (Reprise)," and Kendrick Lamar, who echoes the singer with brief interjections on "Skyline To.") The album's melodic haze often threatens to blur into aimlessness. Yet Ocean convinces us to trust his vision of modern youth in a time where the world may lie at your fingertips, yet you can still be murdered if, as he sings on "Nikes," you look just like Trayvon Martin. And when he sings, "Maybe I'm a fool" on "Seigfried," his deep husk can't be interpreted as anything other than the sound of soul. Frank Ocean's new visual album, 'Endless,' features stark, cryptic imagery and music both new and old. Don’t Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Rumors are swirling about the next iPhone event, which is likely to be held on September 7, and it’s reportedly going to see the introduction of the Apple Watch 2. I’ve been wearing the Apple Watch for over a year now, and it’s one of few devices I make sure to never leave the house without. It’s changed my life in meaningful ways, including losing a lot of weight, encouraging an active lifestyle and just making me more aware of myself. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat I considered moving away from the iPhone in the last year, but the Watch was one reason that kept me there and made me realize the ecosystem is fantastic. As with any first generation Apple product, there’s plenty of room for improvement, but I’m all in on Apple Watch. After a year of wearing the Apple Watch, here are my hopes and dreams for the next generation version. 1 – GPS This one is so obvious it hurts, and it’s clear that Apple is likely to add it in the next revision. I feel like a total idiot going for a run with my wrist computer, but having to carry my iPhone as well to track it properly with Runkeeper or Strava. I want to be able to track activities like hikes, running and cycling without needing my iPhone to get meaningful data. The apps on the Watch would be far more useful with GPS, and I’d be able to get far more useful exercise information. I’m aware GPS will be worse for battery life, but there’s plenty of ways around it. Since the Watch charges so fast, throwing it on the charger when I’m in the shower isn’t a big deal, since it’ll get a lot of juice in that time. 2 – Better straps The range of straps for Apple Watch is pretty impressive so far, but many of them are at the higher end. I’d love to see more options at the lower end to go along with the Sport strap, and a wider range of Nylon straps – I’m pining for something like the ‘James Bond’ strap I’ve had on other watches. More than this, however, I want to see official watchband accessories. Give me a GPS strap, or a extended battery strap, or a bonus sensor strap – there’s so much potential here, especially given there’s a hidden port just waiting to be used for accessories. Unfortunately, neither Apple nor any third manufacturer has cared to join the party. It might be for the best, to reduce complexity, but it feels like there’s an opportunity for a whole ecosystem here. 3 – A better charger Oh my god. Anyone with an Apple Watch will tell you that god-awful charger that comes in the box will burn you multiple times over; be it by not charging because it’s not perfectly on the base or you bump it off in the night. It’s ridiculous. A cradle, stronger magnet, watch mount or anything else would be much better, but they’re not included in the box. Apple actually makes a proper resting charging pad for the Watch, but it’s a bunch more money when it really should just come for free, given how frustrating it is. I’d love to see a better charger in the box, so I don’t have to leave my Watch at home when I bump it off charge overnight. 4 – Waterproofing The current Apple Watch is ‘water resistant’ which is pretty useful, but Apple’s cautious tip-toeing around what that means has meant I’m far too scared to get it near anything other than the shower. I’d love the next-gen Apple Watch to be waterproof so I can truly wear it all day, particularly on a swim – how cool would it be to track your lane lengths – or even just not have to worry if I get thrown in a lake. 5 –More sensors Before the Apple Watch was even released there were hundreds of rumors that it would have a number of advanced sensors that would make it best in class for wearables. A report in The Wall Street Journal said that the Apple Watch would have at least 10 sensors, but that turned out to be far from the truth. The current generation Apple Watch can track heart rate and motion, and even has a deactivated blood oxygenation sensor that inexplicably hasn’t ever been turned on – presumably because any FCC certification to be a medical device would’ve taken far too long. This time around, I’m hopeful Apple will turn that sensor on, and add a bunch more to the next-generation Watch. There’s plenty of room for interesting sensors, like blood glucose, that would make the device infinitely more useful. According to recent rumors, Apple planned to have many more sensors, but those efforts were hampered by the industrial design team. I’m hoping they’re able to find a way to compromise, and get far, far more in there. Bonus: More Watch faces One more thing: the Apple Watch sorely needs deeper customization for Watch faces. We’ve gotten some fantastic improvements through third-party complications, but it doesn’t explain why the company has been so slow to add entire new Watch faces. With WatchOS 3 we got a new Mickey Mouse watch face, but since its introduction in 2014 we’ve only had a handful of new faces appear outside of the original set that shipped with Apple Watch. It’s possible Apple is planning some sort of Watch Face store in the near future – WatchOS 3 certainly hints at it with the new Watch Face gallery, but it’s hard to say how long we’ll be waiting. The wait continues… I’m genuinely excited for whatever features the new Apple Watch adds, and the rumors certainly sound promising – but I’m hopeful some of these areas are addressed, since they’re pain points for existing owners like me who love wearing it.

Apple Music lists the new Frank Ocean album, which was released exclusively on that service this evening, as the former. But a picture of its cover has the latter spelling. While some wondered if that might just be a mistake, others speculated instead that the confusion was intentional, just the first of many dualities and double entendres on an album that confounds perceived binaries of gender, sexuality, and race. Regardless of whether it's Blonde or Blond (I'm inclined to say it's both), Ocean's long-awaited 17-track followup to 2012's Channel Orange defies expectations, most notably its anticipated name — previously, Boys Don't Cry was the widely circulated title of the album — and its many expected release dates, which it missed one after another. Ocean's complex album rollout began with the release of a brief, surprise visual album called Endless on Thursday at boysdontcry.co and then on Apple Music. The process continued on Friday with the release of a rich and super sexual music video for the single "Nikes," also on Apple music (and on boysdontcry.co.) Meanwhile, pop-up shops in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and London today were carrying the anticipated print magazine accompaniment to Ocean's music. That item, which was indeed called Boys Don't Cry, is 360-page volume including stories interviews Rolling Stone reports. inside the Frank Ocean pop up in Nolita 💕✨ you get a magazine with the album inside! I'm dying 😩😩😩 pic.twitter.com/Y84Mba3thH— Ashley Outrageous (@aoutrageous) August 20, 2016 The magazine includes a copy of Blond(e) and seems to carry with it a list of contributors to the album, a group including Pharrell, Kanye, Beyoncé, and André 3000. Album contributors pic.twitter.com/XLNOXTZEIS— steven j. horowitz (@speriod) August 20, 2016 While André 3000, for example, is unmistakable on the album, the "contribution" of other artists isn't as clear. David Bowie and Elliott Smith are cited, too, perhaps for samples, lyrics, or inspiration. Finally, Ocean included a message to fans, many of whom were outwardly frustrated by their long wait. In a play on the meme that somebody should "wake up Frank Ocean," the artists wrote on Tumblr. "FUCK, SORRY," in his typical caps lock. "TOOK A NAP, BUT IT’S PLAYING ON APPLE RADIO RN." Later, he added, "I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE MAKING ALL OF THIS. THANK YOU ALL. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO NEVER LET ME FORGET I HAD TO FINISH. WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERY ONE OF YA’LL. HAHA. LOVE YOU."

The ACCC added, however, that at this early stage in the process it is “continuing to assess” the applications for authorisation by the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. On 26 July, the banks entered a request for authorisation to form a group – what Apple called a “cartel” in a recent letter to the ACCC – via which they would be allowed to engage in collective negotiation and boycott activities with Apple and with other third-party wallet providers in Australia. The ACCC said it has considered interim authorisation within a “short timeframe” at the request of the applicants. “However, given the complexity of the issues and the limited time available, the ACCC has decided not to grant interim authorisation at this time,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. “The ACCC requires more time to consult and consider the views of industry, consumers, and other interested parties.” In deciding not to grant interim authorisation, the ACCC said it took into account the potential for the decision to affect competition in the market, the level of urgency for the request, any possible harm to the applicants or other parties if the authorisation is granted or denied, and possible public “benefits and detriments”. “The entire ACCC authorisation process usually takes up to six months, including the release of a draft decision for consultation before making a final decision,” said Sims. “We expect to release a draft decision in October 2016.” The ACCC’s decision not to grant interim authorisation now is not an indication of the ACCC’s likely final decision, he added. The banks, along with other participating card issuers, are seeking authorisation to collectively negotiate and boycott on a range of issues. One of these issues – one that Apple made objection to in its letter – relates to the banks’ ability to use Near Field Communication (NFC) hardware on Apple devices to allow contactless payments to be made through the banks’ own digital wallet products. Other issues include appropriate industry standards for digital wallets and the banks’ ability to pass on any fees charged by a third-party digital wallet provider. In its letter to the ACCC, Apple strongly urged the ACCC to reject the request for interim authorisation. If granted, it said, the request would “harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent”. The banks’ application for permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group is aimed to “force Apple and other third party providers” to accept their terms, and allow them to charge consumers choosing to use Apple Pay, the firm said.

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: August 22, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Although the Nexus brand has always been identified with Google, there are a good number of smartphone and tablet manufacturers that also come out with Nexus devices including Motorola, Asus, Huawei, HTC, among others. But the American tech company wants to change all of that with the upcoming Google Nexus 7 2016, which according to reports shall come out in two models – the Sailfish and the Marlin. Apart from the remarkable features of the two Nexus 7 2016 smartphone variants now making the rounds online, the upcoming Android smartphones from Google shall reportedly do away with the Nexus brand and will just sport the G logo, alluding to Google as a brand, reports the University Herald. As has been reported previously, the Google Nexus 7 2016 smartphones shall come out with Android 7.0 Nougat already onboard. They would be, in fact, the first devices that shall come out with the latest Android mobile operating system. Reports also have it that the Google Nexus 7 2016 devices shall boast of exclusive Nougat features including a unique launcher, a user interface, and a never-before-seen animated home button. Locking horns with Apple’s latest iPhones With the launching of the next iPhones from Apple just around the corner, there are also speculations saying that the two variants of the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall lock horns or go head-to-head with the latest iPhones. It is possible that the iPhone 7 shall go up with the Sailfish while the Marlin will be pitted against the bigger iPhone 7 Plus. Based on previous reports, the 5-inch Sailfish could have up to 32GB of internal storage while the 5.5-inch Marlin shall have a massive 128GB of internal memory, both with options for further expansion through a microSD card slot, which the iPhones simply do not have. From a previous August launching date, latest reports or rumors are now saying that the Google Nexus 7 2016 devices could come out before Thanksgiving, which means late in November, notes the Christian Today. It may be a good strategy on the part of Google in order to capitalize on the holiday shopping spree but the Android 7.0 Nougat would come out rather late in the process. Latest Android mobile operating system normally comes out before October so a November release date for the Nougat seems strange. That being said, everything remains speculation at this time pending the confirmation from Google. Best Stock Android devices ever The Google Nexus 7 2016 shall reportedly come out via two premium handsets, which according to the hype shall be the best Stock Android devices ever to come out. Firing up the new Stock Android smartphones is the latest and greatest chipset from Qualcomm. It shall also include Vulkan graphics support and OpenGL 3.0 support. It has also been reported that the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall have significant shooting refinement and enhancements with the reported inclusion of the Sony IMX179 camera sensor. What seems consistent with the rumors for the device is that it shall come out with two variants, which are going to be called as the Marlin and the Sailfish. There have been reports that the two variants of the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall be made in collaboration with HTC or Huawei or both, which means that one could focus on the manufacture of the other while the other shall focus on the development of the other. The consensus is that HTC may be tasked to manufacture the high-end Marlin while Huawei can be tapped to develop the Sailfish. However, these remain as speculations at this time pending the confirmation from Google. Interestingly, there are now reports saying that the Nexus 7 2016 could also be refreshed by Taiwanese tech firm Asus. Apparently, Asus is the original maker of the Nexus 7 and the company even came out with at least two generations of the phablet previously.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Apple Ambassador takes big bites out of life Sunday Aug 21, 2016 at 2:00 AM Aug 25, 2016 at 2:06 PM By Stephen Kindland Times-News Correspondent Savanna Prince Roper, a 17-year-old Hendersonville High School senior and this year’s Apple Ambassador for Henderson County, out-achieves most overachievers her age. The 5-foot-10-inch outside hitter on Hendersonville's 12-time state champion volleyball team works as hard as she plays — so much so that she studies for exams standing up to keep from falling asleep. “I’m still working on my time management skills,” Roper said with a laugh as she sat in the living room of her family’s home off Laurel Park Drive. “I’m finding out there’s little room for error.” Managing last year’s school schedule — which included advanced placement classes, daily volleyball practice and more than two dozen home and away games, Keywanette civic club activities, lengthy homework assignments, college entrance exam study sessions and, lest we forget, keeping up with social media posts and text messages — would have been a challenge for anyone. But now, after a spending a “relaxing” summer traveling to Florida and Indianapolis to compete in volleyball tournaments with her Xcel club team, cruising to the Bahamas with her best friend’s family and taking a 10-mile hike during a camping trip with her family before reconnecting with her high school teammates for early morning volleyball practice, Roper’s high-voltage battery has been recharged. Roper says she’s ready for another school year that mirrors last year’s schedule — plus public appearances and other obligations that go with being Apple Ambassador for the 70th annual North Carolina Apple Festival on Labor Day weekend. “I have no doubt in my mind that I’ll be ready to handle whatever comes at me and juggle everything,” Roper said. “I’m not one to lounge around on the couch and watch the world go by.” Colby Creasman Buchanan, a former Apple Ambassador who co-chairs the ambassador program, said Roper was “pretty outstanding” throughout an intense competition that included a dozen “very high-performing” entrants, all of whom are passionate about the county’s apple industry. “I know Savanna’s going to be great,” Buchanan said. “She has a wholesome spirit, and she’s not afraid to speak in public. She’s very poised.” You won’t get any arguments about that from Hendersonville volleyball coach Erica Cantrell. “Savanna is one of the most spirited girls I’ve ever coached,” Cantrell said. “She genuinely loves life. “She’s always positive, and that makes her a very good leader on the volleyball court. She knows how to bring out the best in her teammates.” Apparently the coaching staff at Centre College agree. Roper, who led her Bearcat team in kills last season with 219, has verbally committed to play at the private school in Danville, Kentucky, next year. How the Bearcats finish the upcoming season remains to be seen, but win or lose, and with wisdom beyond her years, Roper will handle defeat the same way she handles victory. “There’s something about having grace either way,” she said. “Until you’re alone. Then you let it out.” Savanna’s sister, Meghan, a four-year soccer standout at HHS who also played basketball and ran track, loves her kid sister’s animated nature — even if it tests her patience. “She’s always going a mile a minute,” said Meghan, a nursing student at Carolinas College of Health Sciences in Charlotte. “We’re polar opposites, but we’re extremely close. I can’t go a day without texting her half a billion times." Meghan also said that as Apple Ambassador, Savanna will set an excellent example for young girls. “Being role models is something both our parents instilled in us,” the older sibling said. “You could be changing someone’s life and never know it. She’ll help make the world a better place. It needs to be.” The sisters come by their character — and their athleticism — honestly. Their father, Jeffrey, played football at HHS, and was a linebacker and defensive end at Mars Hill University. He also has spent the past 28 years working in the Henderson County public school system, including 17 years as a teacher and football coach, and eight years as assistant principal at Flat Rock Middle. Roper is now entering his fourth year as the school’s principal. “We’ve always fostered a ‘go for it’ mentality in Meghan and Savanna,” he said of the way he and his wife, Lauren, have brought up their daughters. “We give them unconditional love, and we’ve never compared them to each other. “They’re able to celebrate each other’s accomplishments. I think that’s why they’re so close.” Always grateful, always smiling, Savanna takes it all in stride. “This is all such a blessing to me,” she said. “I’m excited about getting to meet so many new people and hearing about their journeys. “You have to carry yourself the way you want people to see you. My parents taught me that.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Contact Us About Us Subscribe Help Privacy Policy Terms of Service Submissions Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Photos Submit a Letter Advertising Advertising Advertise With Us Classified Ads Online Services Newsletters Mobile Apps RSS Feeds Twitter Facebook Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Registered developers can download the iOS beta 7, but it’s basically the counterpart of the sixth beta available for the public testers. The latest iOS 10 beta versions arrived just four days before the previous release. MacWorld reported that the iOS 10 public beta 6/developer beta 7 weighs in at 60MB, and this update most likely contain bug fixes and optimizations. If you are interested in getting the iOS 10 beta 6 but not quite certain if your Apple mobile device can have it, below is a list of all the compatible iPhone, iPad and iPod models, according to Venture Beat. iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s iPhone 5c iPhone 5 iPad Pro (12.9-inch) iPad Pro (9.7-inch) iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad (fourth generation) iPad mini 4 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 2 iPod Touch (sixth generation) To download the iOS 10 beta 6 as a public tester, you first need to join Apple’s official beta program. If you are not a member yet, enroll your device at Apple Beta Sotware Program. This platform is an opportunity for Apple users to have access and try out pre-release software. A valid Apple ID email address and password are required to sign up for the program, iMore noted. [Photo by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images]Upon signing up and signing in, it is time to proceed with the download and installation process of the latest iOS 10 beta available via Over-The-Air or OTA process. Navigate to your device’s “Settings” menu and look for the “Software Update” option. Finally, tap “Download and Install.” Meanwhile, those who are on the Apple Developer Program can download their iOS 10 beta 7 by going to the official developer page and installing the beta profile. iOS 10 is Apple’s next major update, first introduced during the tech giant’s WWDC event in June. The first iOS 10 beta was made available last month. As for the mobile software’s public release, iOS 10 is expected to arrive at some point this fall. 9to5Mac came up with a feasible iOS 10 release date. Based on the Cupertino-based tech company’s launch history, their new iOS versions usually arrive days before the official release of new iPhones. With rumors circulating that the upcoming iPhone 7 may have a September 16 release date, the publication speculated that the iOS 10’s official launch could happen as early as September 14. [Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images]As a preview of what tech fans can expect from the iOS 10, Apple’s description reads as follows. “Everything you love is now even better with iOS 10, our biggest release yet. Express yourself in bold new ways in Messages. Find your route with beautifully redesigned Maps. Relive memories like never before in Photos. And use the power of Siri in more apps than ever. There’s so much to say about iOS 10 — here are just a few of our favorite things.” The iOS 10 version of Messages brings in a lot of new features. For instance, the application now offers support for handwritten messages. A previous Inquisitr report also noted that fresh functionalities to expect from Messages include sending your heartbeat, use of rich links as well as making messages appear in “invisible ink.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PERPpFWHnDM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> “Apple has also unveiled a completely redesigned lock screen with rich notifications that can display tiny live widgets and a huge Photos app update with face recognition, deep learning categorization and intelligent photo albums,” Tech Crunch noted, talking about the iOS 10. Apple fans can also expect updates to HomeKit and the Phone app. Still deciding whether to get the iOS 10 beta 6? Since beta versions are likely to contain bugs during testing stages, Romain Dillet of Tech Crunch simply recommended not to install it on the primary Apple device you are using to avoid potential risks. The Inquisitr will continue to keep you updated for more iOS 10 news.

She noted that this could be due to robust inventories rather than weak demand, and that the numbers in the note were a ‘worst-case’ scenario. Huberty emphasized that she remains upbeat on Apple, citing a strong brand, loyal customers, R&D investment and other revenue streams compensating for weaker predicted iPhone sales. [tweet https://twitter.com/philiped/status/676410189852078080 align=’center’] The brand is strong. Customers are loyal. Gross margins are stable. R&D is going full tilt. And revenue streams from new products (Watch, Apple TV), apps, and media could start to make up for slowing iPhone growth. An investment note by Morgan Stanley Katy Huberty predicts that Apple will see its iPhone sales fall by 5.7% in Apple’s 2016 financial year, reports Business Insider. The prediction is significant for two reasons: if realised, it would be the first time since the launch of the iPhone that sales have fallen year-on-year – and the forecast is made by a noted Apple bull. Morgan Stanley thinks that Financial Year 2016 iPhones sales will be 218 million – a 5.7% drop — while Calendar Year 2016 sales will be 224,000 — a 2.9% drop. These predictions are significantly below Huberty’s previous estimates, of 247 million for FY2016 and 252 CY2016. One of the reasons given isn’t new – high smartphone penetration in developed markets – but Huberty says there is a second reason … Huberty notes “higher prices in international markets,” citing China as a specific example. KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that Apple could see slowing iPhone sales early in 2016, but said that this was due to the usual seasonal effect following the holidays, and that the expected 4-inch model could reduce the scale of the slowdown. Huberty does, though, expect Apple’s total revenue to grow by 2% next year thanks to the Apple Watch and other new services. Guides iPhone View THe Guide AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

See, I live in a third world country outside the USA, and I can tell you this is a real problem. The average American salary for a Receptionist is $23,000 per annum. In our country, with our really poor exchange rate, it is $5,000 per annum. Now consider that electronics carry with them a hefty import tax, and it becomes even more expensive. That’s why the cheap Android phones like Xiaomi is making a killing. Now, it’s not that Apple won’t sell here, they are still liked by many, but people tend to either buy it for four years, or pass them on to other family members, which means less sales down the line. So I actually understand why Morgan Stanley is saying what they do, and in a weird twist of irony I hope it becomes the truth, as Apple will then be forced to come up with a different strategy for developing markets. LikeLike Bruno Fernandes (@Linkb8) - 12 months ago People making $5000 per year have never driven growth in any high end market for Apple nor anyone else. This is like saying that Apple won’t be able to sell phones in a country composed of mostly vegetarians – it’s irrelevant. LikeLiked by 4 people lkrupp215 - 12 months ago It’s not the number of units sold that matters. It’s the profit made on each unit. You say Xiaomi making a killing? Doubtful from a profit perspective.

LikeLike uniszuurmond - 12 months ago @lkrupp. Selling 1M units with $10 profit is better than selling 10k units with $100 profit. You don’t seem to understand how lucrative this market really is. More people own smartphones than landlines here by a factor of over 10. Apple is scratching the surface in India with their latest price reduction on the 5s, but there’s a lot more money they can make here. And the real win is getting people into their ecosystem rather than Android’s. LikeLiked by 1 person lkrupp215 - 12 months ago “ Selling 1M units with $10 profit is better than selling 10k units with $100 profit.” We’ve heard this tune played over and over and it’s simply not true. If it were then all those billions of cheap Android phones out there would be putting Apple out of business and there would be some really wealthy smartphone companies… but that’s not happening. And by the way, your argument was made by the same analysts who said China would be Apple’s downfall. The Chinese market, it was said, would not support premium prices for premium phones. Apple was advised it simply had to go cheap to succeed in China. Lather, rinse, repeat. Same old, same old and Apple doesn’t play by those rules. LikeLike taoprophet420 - 12 months ago How. I have is the monthly tarif for phone calls and data service? The US has some of the worlds highest cost plans. Total cost of ownship has to be factored instead of I ital cost of the phone. Also many providers across the globe are moving to installment payments or loansto purchase high end smartphones. LikeLike uniszuurmond - 12 months ago @lkrupp. I was always the one who supported Apple being a premium product at a premium price, even in China, so we agree on that. However, when your total market is only 40M people, you have to question why Apple is here, investing heavily in their presence, but at a price point that will continue to lose them money here rather than make money. We simply don’t have a large enough population and therefore large enough wealthy class to continue supporting this strange economics, hence my comment on lower prices.

In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple’s market share will drop a little bit. May also make them stop dreaming and start doing something really useful, like optimizing iOS and making Siri available everywhere.

LikeLiked by 1 person bb1111116 - 12 months ago uniszuurmond; “So why then did Apple discounted the 5s almost 50% in India compared to elsewhere?” Good question; about the 1/2 price for the 5S in India that is an older device which has less memory (probably 8 GB). But a $350 iPhone still cannot compete against $100 to $200 Android phones. But Apple knows that India has a huge, fast growing economy. It knows that the middle class in India soon will be very large. Apple wants more customers in India knowing that in a few years there will be a large middle classs able to afford many regularly priced Apple products. Apple has offered discounts on the iPhone 4 and 4S in the past (though about $100 more than this 5S deal in India). If an economy is growing fast, Apple may try having more of a presence there with one discounted product. But overall keep in mind that Apple’s worldwide smartphone marketshare is only 15%. In many parts of the world the iPhone’s share of the market might be 1 or 2%. Apple will never get the marketshare of Android. Apple will always be looking for customers with higher incomes. That again is its business model. LikeLike uniszuurmond - 12 months ago @Joe. I am not in a European country. We have a population of 60M with 40M buying smartphones.

Apple could be finding other ways to increase revenue apart from only trying to increase iPhone sales. Apple can certainly afford to invest in other businesses like rival companies do. A company can’t just sit back on its laurels and expect potential investors to get excited. Sometimes a company needs to try to generate excitement or just make the expected revenue increases. Either way, these analyst reports are certainly scaring people into tossing their Apple shares. There’s no real commitment to owning Apple stock for recent buyers.

They have said this happens a lot for a lot of different reasons. They are trying to analyze things to deeply and second guessing everything as negative. I never see this happening with any other company to this level. So if smartphone sales are saturated then why aren’t all those android companies dropping even more because they are barely making money as it is.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive World Trade Center mall reopens, shows progress since 9/11 Sunday Aug 21, 2016 at 2:01 AM The Associated Press NEW YORK — The reopening — and reinvention — of the World Trade Center mall Tuesday reflects how much lower Manhattan has changed since the 9/11 attacks. Once a scene of massive destruction, the area is now a vibrant one of office towers and upscale hotels, with three times the number of residents as before the attacks, weekday employees in industries beyond Wall Street, and millions of tourists visiting every year. Shops from Apple to Forever 21 to H&M to John Varvatos will serve the increasingly diverse area where real estate experts say people have been eager for new stores and restaurants. The new spaces also let customers tap into technology, as some retailers use the space for their latest ideas. The location is a "symbol of hope, opportunity, progress and perseverance," said Bill Hecht, chief operating officer of Westfield Corp.'s U.S. division. Westfield manages the retail properties, while the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the real estate. More than 100 stores will occupy the 365,000-square-foot center, with about 60 opening Tuesday and the rest by the winter holiday season. Ford Motor Co. is set to open this fall the first FordHub, a showroom for innovations that's not a dealership. Shoe purveyor Aldo Group Inc. is using the opening to launch an app feature for its store, which will be rolled out to other locations. Digital billboards include a 280-foot-long one. Food options include Eataly's second Manhattan location, which features foods from Italy and coffee and gelato bars. It stretches along a four-block underground network that spans the bases of three office towers. While mostly below street level, light beams in through the windows of the winged Oculus, designed by Santiago Calatrava, that top the transportation hub of 13 subway trains and river ferries. More than 300,000 commuters use it on a daily basis, many for jobs beyond finance in advertising and media. "When you look at how many people now live in the neighborhood, how many commuters work in the neighborhood and how many tourists now are coming to the memorial, emotionally it was a no-brainer and financially it was a no-brainer," Angela Ahrendts, Apple's retailing chief, said at the store's opening Tuesday. More than 60,000 residents live within blocks of the World Trade Center area, about three times the number from right before 9/11. The former shopping mall in the World Trade Center was one of the most successful properties in the world, but catered to daytime weekday shopping, said Robin Abrams, vice chairman of The Lansco Corp., a real estate advisory firm. The new mall is expected to have a vibrant night and weekend atmosphere, and Hecht noted a deliberate move to include shops with necessities like drugstore Duane Reade. Westfield says 15 million travelers are expected to visit the areas from the U.S. and around the world next year to see the National September 11 Memorial & Museum and other nearby places of interest. There is no signage on the side of the mall that faces the 9/11 memorial. "We have huge respect for this site," Hecht said. On the anniversary of the attacks, the skylight of the Oculus — meant to symbolize the image of a dove released from a child's hand — will open to bring in a slice of the open New York sky. Westfield said ensuring safety and security at the mall is the highest priority for it and the Port Authority. Uniformed police and private security will be present at the mall, Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said, but declined to give specifics about any other measures. "As with any high-profile public location and transit center, there are extensive security measures that have been put in place with law enforcement and others," Westfield said. The lower downtown area has about $6.5 billion in annual buying potential, said Jessica Lappin, head of the Downtown Alliance, which manages the downtown-lower Manhattan business improvement district. Hecht expects the mall will eventually generate about $1 billion in retail sales annually, making it one of the most productive of the company's sites. Smythson of Bond Street, a British maker of luxury stationery and leather goods, has a store in midtown Manhattan but is "really excited to be downtown," said Ruby Victor, the head of marketing. Given all the foot traffic, she hopes being there will raise awareness of the company. "We're still a niche brand," she said. Real estate experts believe the mall will complement the nearby Brookfield Place, which opened in 2015 and features high-end shops like Gucci and Hermes. It will also be different from the Seaport Mall, which is being reopened next year and is focusing on catering to local residents. In addition to retail, a Beekman Hotel and Four Seasons Hotel as well as a performing arts center are coming, part of the $30 billion poured into the downtown area from public and private investment since 9/11. "Our sense is that there has been demand for a long time that wasn't met," said Lappin. "There may be some bumps along the way. This is an area that needs places to shop and eat."

According to a MacRumors report, Apple has informed all its retail staff with confirmation that ‘store’ will disappear from both online and in retail stores. Apple’s online store listing refers to stores by names like “Apple Union Square” or “Apple Valley Fair” or “Apple The Grove,” instead of “Apple Store, Valley Fair” or “Apple Store, The Grove.” The re-branding is already reflected on every website for Apple’s various stores. Image: Reuters “Apple stores, with fancy headphone setups and avenue displays will now change on a seasonal basis to showcase different products,” the report stated. According to the memo that was given out to employees, the change from Apple Store to Apple will be a gradual one. The changes would begin with the recently opened Apple Stores and then move on to the older and more popular ones. Apple was yet to officially comment on the report. Out here in India, it seems like Tim Cook’s tour of India did not turn out to as fruitful as many perceived it to be. Mint reported that the Apple CEO failed to be impress the finance ministry, hinting that its glass-laden Apple Stores may have to wait, once again.

Home News Galleries Interviews Sessions Noise Pro Frank Ocean Frank Ocean Blonde Released And You Can Hear It Now by Music-News.com on August 21, 2016 in New Music,News Frank Ocean’s much talked about second album ‘Blonde’ is now available and streaming at Apple Music. The mysterious musician has kept fans waiting for a follow-up to his Grammy-winning 2012 debut album Channel Orange/ He then surprised fans with the sudden release on ‘Blonde’ on the weekend. Ocean’s second album ‘Blonde’ is a 17-track LP that also contains his fresh single ‘Nikes’, became available to buy via streaming app Apple Music on Saturday (20Aug16), two days after the release of his surprise visual album Endless. While many have reported that Endless is Ocean’s long-awaited new record, it is, in fact, a separate project to his follow-up LP Blonde. It was initially believed to be called Boys Don’t Cry. Instead, the name Boys Don’t Cry applies to a print publication that customers received when they purchased his album Blonde at pop-up shop locations. The shops were installed in London, Los Angeles, New York and Chicago this weekend. Frank has kept the surprises coming for fans over the summer. He has been teasing listeners about the release of his second album since last year. Earlier this month he hit headlines after posting a cryptic live video stream on his website. The video showed an Apple Music-sponsored black and white video feed of a warehouse. Ocean updated his live stream on Thursday with footage of him building a staircase in the same warehouse, which is the basis for the visuals seen in Endless. Ocean’s 18-track visual album Endless features collaborations with musicians such as James Blake, Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood and Jazmine Sullivan. The London Contemporary Orchestra provides much of the beautiful background tunes thanks to its cello, violin, double bass and viola players.

Jones 08.17.16 3 months ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL Getty Image Birdman, and his label Cash Money Records, have officially joined the roster of artists signing exclusive deals with Apple Music. Although details are a little murky at this time, sources told Music Business Worldwide that the rapper and the music streaming service are teaming up for a documentary about Birdman and Cash Money Records, which will air exclusively on Apple Music. Over the weekend, Birdman and Apple Music Head of Content Larry Jackson confirmed a deal had been signed between the two parties by sharing posts on their Instagram pages. Neither released many details on the deal in their posts, but after Birdman’s original post was deleted, he shared a new one that featured a link with more information on what was in the works on Music Business Worldwide. http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT This deal will be Apple Music’s first with a full record label. Billboard says the one-time documentary deal will not affect Lil’ Wayne and Nicki Minaj’s deals with competing music streaming service TIDAL or Drake’s reportedly $19 million deal with Apple Music. There’s been no word yet on how or if this deal will alter Cash Money Records’ distribution deal with UMG/Republic Records, who reportedly signed a $30 million distribution deal with the record label in 1998, but however the details may fall, Birdman seems to come out on top again with this latest deal.

Thanksgiving Eve parties: Highlights at Lehigh Valley clubs Features Books Top 3 Moravian Book Shop best-sellers: Cookbooks Best-selling cookbook CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / MORAVIAN BOOK SHOP 'Canning for a New Generation' by Liana Krissoff 'Canning for a New Generation' by Liana Krissoff (CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / MORAVIAN BOOK SHOP) What are the best-selling cookbooks at Moravian Book Shop? 'CANNING FOR A NEW GENERATION' By Liana Krissoff (Abrams, $27.50) Organized by season, Krissoff's recipes illustrate fresh ways to preserve the harvest throughout the year, employing techniques like water-bath canning that are safe and easy to follow. The recipes are all created with small-batch yields in mind, which will appeal to beginner canners and expert homesteaders alike. Krissoff addresses special diet concerns with recipes for low-sugar or sugar-free preserves, as well as methods for canning jams and preserves without pectin. There are also old-style fermenting recipes, new freezing techniques and recipes on how to use your canned goods to make delicious meals. 'THE APPLE COOKBOOK' By Olwen Woodier (Storey, $14.95) From sweet to savory and from breakfast to bedtime, apples take center stage in this fun volume. With recipes ranging from traditional apple pies and crisps to unexpected surprises like ground lamb kebabs with apple mint raita, this new edition of the best-selling classic has been revised and redesigned to feature more than 30 new apple-themed goodies. It also includes plenty of vegan and gluten-free options. 'COOKING SOLO' By Klancy Miller (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $19.99) Klancy Miller shows that cooking for one is something to embrace. While making single servings from other cookbooks means scaling down ingredients, adjusting cooking times or being stuck with leftovers, "Cooking Solo" gives readers just what they need to make a delicious meal — all for themselves. Klancy's enthusiasm for cooking for herself comes through in the 100 recipes like handmade granola, smoked duck breast salad, spicy pork burger with coconut, and mackerel with lemon and capers. Klancy also includes a chapter on entertaining at home, because being single still means having fun with friends. Moravian Book Shop in Bethlehem is America's oldest bookstore.

Called Blond, it was released as an exclusive to Apple Music. Fans in New York, Chicago, London and Los Angeles meanwhile, could pick up physical copies of the record at pop-up stores. Queues snaked around the block in New York where there were reports of free copies being handed out. At the stores, the album came packaged with a Frank Ocean-edited, 360-page glossy magazine called Boys Don’t Cry, long expected to be the title of the record itself. The magazine features photographs taken by Ocean, an interview with his mother, horoscopes and the lyrics of a rap called The MacDonalds Man written by Kanye West. steven j. horowitz (@speriod) pic.twitter.com/hai4RMSNME August 20, 2016 The album itself has 17 tracks; some reported that the physical copy has a slightly different tracklisting to the version streaming on Apple Music. There is also some ambiguity about the album’s title. Listed as Blonde on Apple Music, the sleeve artwork spells it Blond. The sleeve features a picture of Ocean with green hair, photographed last year by the Turner prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans. Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) Frank Ocean on 'Blonde': "I had the time of my life making all of this." Read his message: https://t.co/6ARMzJnrCM pic.twitter.com/QlivDhXCBh August 21, 2016 On first listen, Blond is boundary-pushing and introspective soul on which Ocean’s voice is often distorted; long stretches of songs don’t have drums and obvious hits are far from immediately apparent. A list of collaborators includes Andre 3000, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams, Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Arca, Fish, Gang of Four and even David Bowie and the Beatles. steven j. horowitz (@speriod) Album contributors pic.twitter.com/XLNOXTZEIS August 20, 2016 The album’s long-awaited release was first heralded at the start of this month, when Ocean posted online a video of himself cutting up wood in a studio to snippets of music. On Friday, Ocean released another longform piece of music called Endless, a 45-minute, 18-track “visual album” which takes a freeform approach to songwriting, and which the Guardian described as “brilliantly confounding.” On Saturday morning, Ocean debuted the first single from Blonde, Nikes. The song pays tribute to Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old shot by George Zimmerman. His voice eerily speeded up, Ocean sings that Martin “looked just like me”. The video, meanwhile, is a torrent of surreal imagery including a rapping chihuahua, a man clambering over theatre seats while dressed as Satan, naked backsides covered in glitter and Ocean rolling around a stage dressed in white. Ocean’s reputation as a fearless and agenda-setting artist has not diminished in his years away from the limelight; Blond is sure to be endlessly dissected over the coming days. On his Tumblr, Ocean posted a piece of writing about an experience of riding in a car while high on magic mushrooms, and also a note which was more straightforward: “I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y’all. Haha. Love you.” More news Topics Frank Ocean Wolfgang Tillmans Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The legendary singer was promoting her tour and new album of duets when she told NPR that Apple's computerized assistant pronounces her last name 'Strei-zand' instead of the proper 'Strei-sand' with a soft 's,' reports NPR. Babs wasted no time calling Apple Support, but instead went straight to the top. 'I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook,' she confessed. Don't you know who I am, Siri? Barbra Streisand complained on NPR that Siri mispronounces her name Streisand is on tour promoted an album of duets with actors, such as Jamie Foxx, above Cook did the only thing one can do when Babs calls - he said he would fix things.  'He delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30,' the singer revealed on NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday.  'So let's see if that happens because I'll be thrilled.'  The unusual topic came about when host Scott Simon asked, 'May I ask a question of my iPhone while you're with us?' to which a somewhat perplexed Streisand replied, 'Sure.' The iconic singer said she called Tim Cook (left) directly about Siri mutilating her famous moniker 'Siri, who is the only female vocalist who has had hit records for six straight decades?' asked Simon of the phone. 'Barbra Streizzzand,' Siri replied, oblivious that she was saying it in front of the singer herself.  Streisand laughed, then said, 'She pronounces my name wrong. [It's] Streisand with a soft 's' like sand on the beach, I've been saying this my whole career.' But the star already had it covered. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The romance is still hot!

Fans will have to wait for the updated IOS to get Streisand's proper pronunciation. Some listeners were not overly impressed with Streisand's attention to detail. 'That phone was pronouncing my name wrong, so I used my money and power to accomplish something petty and meaningless,' wrote one listener on the site. The singer and Broadway star is currently on tour with an album of duets with other actors called Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway.  Duet partners include Anne Hathaway, Daisey Ridley, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jamie Foxx, Melissa McCarthy, Antonio Banderas, Hugh Jackman and others - but not Siri.   Read more: Barbra Streisand On Broadway, Hollywood — And Siri : NPR Share or comment on this article e-mail 388 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC Frank Ocean releases new album 'Blonde' and gives away copies at pop-up shops Frank Ocean Andrew Chin / FilmMagic Frank Ocean performs during Day 3 of Pemberton Music and Arts Festival on July 20, 2014, in Pemberton, Canada. Frank Ocean performs during Day 3 of Pemberton Music and Arts Festival on July 20, 2014, in Pemberton, Canada. (Andrew Chin / FilmMagic) Gerrick D. Kennedy Frank Ocean has released “Blonde,” his second album in as many days, turning the enigmatic R&B crooner’s comeback into both a test of endurance and an ambitious reworking of the album release. After weeks of rumors, the singer on Saturday released “Blonde,” the official follow-up to his heralded, Grammy-winning 2012 major-label debut, “Channel Orange.”  The 17-track LP is available exclusively to Apple Music streaming subscribers, with one exception: Copies of the work accompanied a free print publication titled “Boys Don’t Cry” at pop-up shops in cities including New York, Chicago, London and Los Angeles (on Fairfax Avenue).  See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour » Dozens of pop music heavyweights are credited on the album including Andre 3000, Beyoncé, James Blake, Jamie XX, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Malay, Om’Mas Keith, Tyler the Creator, Rick Rubin and Pharrell Williams.  David Bowie, Elliott Smith and the Beatles are also credited as contributors, though it is unclear if Ocean is crediting samples or if he got his hands on unreleased recordings. “Blonde” arrives shortly after Ocean issued an 18-track, 45-minute visual album titled “Endless,” also directly to Apple Music.  Fans have spent four years pining for Ocean’s return, which was signaled by a mysterious video earlier this month that didn’t include any full tracks. Instead, the singer could be seen working in a mostly empty warehouse, tackling a carpentry project, as instrumental tracks gave way to construction noises. Fans speculated that the album’s release was imminent, considering the video — titled “Endless” — contained the Apple Music logo in the corner.  Frank Ocean's minimalism sets 'Blonde' apart from recent releases by Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kanye West Mikael Wood So much about Frank Ocean’s gripping new album, “Blonde,” seems to put it in line with recent high-profile records by Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kanye West, from its short-notice release to its limited availability to its expansive roster of collaborators. Push beyond the branding strategy, though, and... So much about Frank Ocean’s gripping new album, “Blonde,” seems to put it in line with recent high-profile records by Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kanye West, from its short-notice release to its limited availability to its expansive roster of collaborators. Push beyond the branding strategy, though, and... (Mikael Wood) Upon the debut of that livestream, major news outlets reported that the album would be issued Aug. 5 alongside a video through an exclusive deal with Apple Music. But that release date came and went. On Thursday the livestream returned to life. Ocean reappeared, continuing work on the structure he began building weeks ago.  This time, however, there was music — a full album, in fact.   Shot by Francisco Soriano and directed by the singer, the black-and-white art film depicts Ocean (actually, multiple versions of himself) building a spiral staircase in the middle of a room. Ocean is also credited as executive producer and creative director of the film.  “Endless” unfolds as three Oceans work to complete the project. At one point in the film, two are cutting wood while the third aimlessly looks at his cellphone.   As for the music, it’s an experimental trip inside Ocean’s mind. Contemplative and free-flowing, some tracks sound like avant-garde demos while others feel like fully fleshed-out records. There are ambient interludes and jam sessions that don’t even last a minute.  The singer collaborated with Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Arca, Alex G, Troy Noka and Sampha on “Endless” and many of those collaborators appear on “Blonde,” though it’s unclear if he recorded the two projects in tandem.

Hours before the release of “Blonde,” Ocean debuted the album’s first track and its accompanying visual, “Nikes,” directly to Apple Music.  “I got two versions. I got twoooo versions,” the song opens, in both a nod to his own cryptic announcement a year ago about his new music and possibly a clue about the singer’s intentions with this dual offering of music. Featuring a kaleidoscope of tantalizing images and a wealth of symbolism to unpack, the nearly five-minute NSFW clip for “Nikes” (with glittery nudity and cursing) is visually arresting. Directed by Tyrone Lebon, the video combines shots of men and women nude and covered in cash, a dancing devil, a rapping Chihuahua, bodies covered in glitter, a drunken party, self-immolation. It also has tributes to ASAP Yams, Trayvon Martin and Pimp C and a sly reference to the Heaven’s Gate cult, with a person, presumably Ocean, lying on a bed in the middle of a room wearing black pants, black and white Nikes and a purple cloth over his body and surrounded by partygoers. For some, the wait for Ocean’s return has felt endless. In April 2015, Ocean announced that he had completed an album, to be called “Boys Don't Cry,” and his reps confirmed that the album and an accompanying publication would arrive in July 2015. A year later, the singer updated his website with an image of a library due-date card stamped with a number of dates — including July 2016.   Fans rush to West Hollywood pop-up shop for Frank Ocean's new album, 'Blonde' Randall Roberts When Frank Ocean fan Cornelius Wells heard news of a surprise, promotional pop-up shop opened by the R&B singer on Saturday afternoon, Wells was in the midst of driving to the Inland Empire to drop off a friend.  Wells saw that Ocean,  who hadn’t released a new record since the Grammy-winning album...

(Randall Roberts) The approach for “Blonde” further helps Ocean redefine the album release process, which has seen unconventional strategies from Beyoncé, Drake, Rihanna and Kanye West. Beyoncé first debuted her latest visual album, “Lemonade,” through an HBO special before releasing it exclusively to Tidal. Rihanna gave away 1 million copies of “Anti” via a deal with Samsung and Tidal, while Drake premiered “Views” via a “global listening party” on Apple Music Beats 1.   And West, in typical fashion for the polarizing rapper, rolled out his latest album, “The Life of Pablo,” with a chaotic listening party and fashion show for a sold-out Madison Square Garden that also served as the debut for his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. He sold tickets to the event, and 20 million people tuned into the livestream before he released the album for free on Tidal. He later lifted that exclusivity and has since been tinkering with "Pablo" in real time.  Ocean might have taken four years to resurface, but fans may think he has delivered the most generous comeback in recent pop history.  For more music news follow me on Twitter: @GerrickKennedy ALSO Stagecoach Spotlight Tour takes festival's rising acts on the road Frank Ocean releases visually arresting 'Nikes' ahead of new album Review: Coldplay goes big — well, bigger — at the Rose Bowl Copyright © 2016, Los Angeles Times Coldplay Kanye West's doctor called 911 during breakdown, report says; Kim Kardashian skips public return It's not a good time to be Mariah Carey — even she's ready to 'move on,' report says '#Ham4Bey' is the 'Hamilton' and Beyoncé mashup you didn't know you wanted Most Popular Local Sports Entertainment Politics Opinion Place An Ad 63°

The Cupertino consumer tech giant has quietly rebranded all of its US retail locations. They are now to be known simple as "Apple" rather than the old (and sensible) Apple Store moniker. Under the rebranding, shops that had previously been called "Apple Store" will now just be "Apple" followed by the location. For example, the "Apple Store Stonestown" in San Francisco is now simply "Apple Stonestown". The move, which was reported by MacRumors after it saw an employee memo, has already begun rolling out. No word on whether this policy will extend to other parts of the company.

The release, Ocean’s second studio album after the incredibly well-reviewed Channel ORANGE of 2012, was initially expected to be named Boys Don’t Cry. Anticipation for the album was high, after Ocean released a so-called visual album late last week. Called Endless, the live stream was described as separate to the studio album, and was also released as an Apple Music exclusive. In it, Ocean spends 45 minutes building a spiral staircase. Today’s release is another success for Apple’s team, which reportedly has a two week period as the sole place Ocean’s album will be available. It’s the latest in a bidding war between Apple, Tidal, Spotify, and other providers, all aiming to be the first pick for streaming music subscribers. It follows Tidal’s score with rapper Kanye West, whose album The Life of Pablo was initially only available through the service. Spotify and Apple Music streaming followed on from the start of April. In Blonde‘s case, the seventeen track album features collaboration with Beyoncé and André 3000 among others, opening with the first single, “Nikes”. 1. “Nikes” 2. “Ivy” 3. “Pink + White” 4. “Be Yourself” 5. “Solo” 6. “Skyline To” 7. “Self Control” 8. “Good Guy” 9. “Nights” 10. “Solo (Reprise)” 11. “Pretty Sweet” 12. “Facebook Story” 13. “Close To You” 14. “White Ferrari” 15. “Seigfried” 16. “Godspeed” 17. “Future Free” Ocean made headlines in 2012 when Channel ORANGE was named one of the best albums of the year by several publications, launched itself as an iTunes exclusive initially. Like Blonde, it was released earlier than expected, with Ocean hoping to avoid leaks by going live before his previously-stated launch date. The singer/songwriter’s mixture of rap, falsetto, electro, and jazz, as well as various songs’ content including unexpectedly personal details of Ocean’s former relationships made it an instant classic, and set expectations high for his sophomore release. Whether those expectations will be satisfied – or, indeed, can be satisfied – remains to be seen, now that the long-awaited (and several times delayed) album has finally gone on sale. You can find it streaming through Apple Music if you have a subscription with the service, or as a $9.99 download from iTunes if you don’t.

The information used to confirm the iPhone 7 release dates come from leaked store planning information 9 to 5 Mac obtained from sources connected to AT&T. “Specifically, the guidance calls out September 9 and September 23 as dates for merchandising resets. This could suggest that advertising for pre-orders could be planned for September 9 as expected and new iPhone models could hit the floor on September 23, a week later than previously expected.” The Apple blog also reported that an official announcement regarding the new iPhone 7 release is expected a few days before pre-orders, coming on September 7 at an event hosted by Apple. The iPhone 7 release is expected to be September 23, with a pre-order date of September 9, reports say. [Photo by Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images]With the iPhone 7 release all but confirmed for next month, many Apple fans are curious to know what will be in the latest iteration of the iPhone product line. Forbes reported on the iPhone 7 release date and said the biggest change will be the lack of a headphone jack. “That said I would argue it is crucial Apple ‘sells’ the loss of the headphone jack as a gain overall by arguing it allows the iPhone 7 to take new, appealing steps forward,” Forbes‘ Gordon Kelly said. “These include higher quality sound through the Lightning port, more space for a bigger battery, waterproofing and yes, stereo speakers and (in absence of a design overhaul) the compensation of an upgraded home button and internals.” While there has been talk of no headphone jack on the latest iPhone model, there has also been talk of a top-of-the-line iPhone model coming to market upon the iPhone 7 release next month. But according to a different report by Kelly, there appears to be no iPhone 7 Pro in the pipeline. Sourcing reports out of Japan, the Forbes writer said the iPhone 7 release will just focus on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, its larger sibling. The iPhone 7 release comes just less than a year before an expected release of the iPhone 8. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]He went on to explain that the biggest problem with designing a higher-end iPhone 7 Pro was the fact that quantities could have been limited for the high-end model with most production focusing on both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. “This would have seen the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus share the same single lens camera while the iPhone 7 Pro sat above them in limited quantities with the upgraded optics. “Now Apple believes manufacturing constraints around the dual lens camera have been resolved so it can be fitted into every iPhone 7 Plus and there is no need to expand the range. Such a scenario would also explain why we have repeatedly seen photos of three iPhone 7 models.” With the lack of a third high-end device upon the iPhone 7 release next month, it remains to be seen how many Apple enthusiasts will invest in the new iPhone 7 models or hold out for the iPhone 8 expected to be released in the United States sometime in Spring or Summer 2017. As for the iPhone 7 release in September, with AT&T and other stores prepping their stores to stock the unit, it appears Apple is moving forward with plans to roll out a mid-level iPhone that will neither thrill the masses nor make major advances in the smartphone market. What it will do is move the company forward with its eventual rollout of the iPhone 8 and the excitement expected upon the release of a new smartphone 10 years after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and his team shook up the mobile phone world, bringing the world to your fingertips and forever changing the world of computing, dialing, and so much more.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady The real reason Apple dumbed-down the iPhone 7 camera Posted by: Jason O'Grady Date: Thursday, August 18th, 2016, 08:00 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Opinion Tweet I agree 100 percent with Chris Smith’s post on BGR about how the iPhone 7 is about to become inferior to the larger iPhone 7 Plus in a very significant way. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-camera vs the single camera in the 7. (Photo: BGR.com) I greatly prefer the 4.7-inch form factor iPhone and won’t buy the larger “Plus size” iPhone because it’s too bulky and it can’t be used with one hand. Plus, my iPad Pro and MacBook usually aren’t far away for when I need a larger screen. In his article Smith lists several possible excuses Apple might trot out for omitting the dual-lens camera from the iPhone 7, but the real reason is after the jump. Here’s Smith’s excuse list: It’s too bulky If Apple removes the headphone jack, shouldn’t this have created some additional room inside the device? It will impact battery life Apple could add a setting to turn off one of the cameras to save battery (which almost no one would use). Supply concerns Bullocks. Apple could use its significant influence to get the camera parts from suppliers, and if not, I have concerns about Cook’s reputation as “operational genius” and “master of the supply chain.” It’s more expensive Most likely true, but how much more expensive? The rear camera module in the iPhone 6s is estimate to cost $22.50. Does the dual-camera module cost 10, 50, 100 percent more? Apple could either, a) eat the increase, or b) increase the cost. Altough I think that Apple should eat the extra cost, I’d definitely pay as much as $50 more for the better camera). This is where Smith nails it: …Apple likes its high iPhone prices and its high iPhone margins. Apple isn’t willing to absorb the additional cost of the better, dual-camera module in order to keep the base $549 price of the 4.7-inch iPhone. And by extension it is willing to punish its iPhone 7 customers with an inferior camera to protect its margins. iPhone sales dropped 16 percent last quarter and the 4.7-inch iPhone outsells the 5.5-inch iPhone (by as much as by seven to one). What better way to jump start slumping revenue and profit? Nudge millions of (reluctant) iPhone 7 customers to buy the pricier iPhone 7 Plus for its better camera. Bummer. Update 2016-0808: If you share my concern about your next iPhone including a dumbed-down rear camera, take solace, it’ll probably include Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).

Home / News / Apple analyst claims BMW/Apple Joint-Venture… Apple analyst claims BMW/Apple Joint-Venture Apple Car News | August 20th, 2016 by Nico DeMattia 2 Tweet According to Apple analyst Gene Munster, the Silicon Valley-based giant will partner with BMW to develop its much rumored Apple Car. It’s been long rumored … According to Apple analyst Gene Munster, the Silicon Valley-based giant will partner with BMW to develop its much rumored Apple Car. It’s been long rumored that, if Apple even ends up developing a car, it would joint forces with an existing automaker to help manufacture it. However, this has largely been conjecture, it seems that Munster, an analyst for Piper Jaffray investment company, believes Apple will end up partnering with BMW. Admittedly, this isn’t the first the Apple/BMW rumor we’ve heard, as its been long rumored that the two companies could work together. However, there’s been no evidence to back up any of these claims. In fact, BMW squashed claims of such a venture between it and Apple to build a car. Also, Munster doesn’t have the best track record of predicting products for Apple. But he is adamant about the Apple/BMW venture for a future car. The thinking here, along with the thinking of other Apple/BMW rumors, is that Apple will develop the software and technology behind the Apple Car, while BMW would handle the manufacturing of it. Munster isn’t the only person to believe Apple will search for an outside manufacturer, as it has no previous experience with such a business. In fact, even the long time automotive executive, Bob Lutz, felt that would be the best direction for Apple. The venture between Apple and BMW also makes some sort of sense, as BMW is already heavily invested in electric and autonomous car technology. So having Apple help with the software side of things could be quite beneficial for both Apple and the Bavarian brand. We must remember, though, that there is no real merit to any of these claims, as it’s all speculation. The ideas are sound and make sense, but there’s no evidence to prove such a venture between the two giants. It is an interesting thought, though, and could be very helpful for both brands.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 20, 2016 at 3:41PM If you're looking for new investment ideas, look no further. Why not follow famed investor Warren Buffett into some stocks? After all, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock has more than doubled the S&P 500's annualized return since 1965. And Buffett and his two lieutenants haven't lost their touch. The stock has nearly doubled the S&P 500's return in the last 10 years, and its 114% return in the past five years is well ahead of the S&P 500's 91% gain during this same period. Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. Looking to Buffett's Berkshire for some ideas, here are two stocks that the Oracle of Omaha's company has positions in that are looking tasty this month. Apple... again I already praised Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a buying opportunity in July, but this bargain stock is worth taking a look at again. Why not? Apparently, Berkshire is pretty bullish on the company. It was revealed earlier this month that Berkshire upped its stake in Apple by 55% during Q2, bringing the total value of its Apple stock to about $1.7 billion at the time of this writing. With a position this large, Berkshire's Apple position is now worth more than its $1.6 billion position in General Motors. Given Berkshire's tendency to avoid technology stocks, Buffett or his investing lieutenants must be confident the stock is undervalued in order to build a position worth nearly $2 billion in such a short period of time. Of course, it doesn't take a genius to realize Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of under 13 does look a bit like a buying opportunity; it's not very often market leaders trade with valuations this conservative. Coca-Cola Another Berkshire holding worth looking at this month is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Sure, Berkshire didn't add to its position in the beverage company in Q2. But Berkshire doesn't need to add to this position to express its confidence in this investment. The company owns $17.6 billion worth of Coca-Cola, making it Berkshire's third-largest holding after Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 25, the stock certainly doesn't look as cheap as Apple. But when it comes to a sustainable business, Coca-Cola is one of the best examples there is. So investors shouldn't expect Coca-Cola to trade at a cheap-looking valuation any time soon. Combining its powerful beverage brands with the company's unparalleled global distribution, Coca-Cola boasts both pricing power and economies of scale -- a formidable combination, making up a strong competitive advantage. As Buffett says, "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." Coca-Cola is one of these castles. Thanks to Coca-Cola's consistent ability to drive decades of healthy profits for shareholders, it has a nice dividend, too. Investors who buy today get a dividend yield of 3.2% (this easily beats Apple's dividend yield of 2.1%) and the comfort of knowing future increases are likely: Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 53 years straight. Apple and Coca-Cola are both great long-term, low-risk investments for investors -- typical characteristics of Buffett investments. If not worth buying, they're at least worthy of a spot on your watch list. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

August 20, 2016 Cristina Lee Contrarian investor and Dohmen Capital Research Group founder Bert Dohmen appeared on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” to discuss whether or not it’s a good idea to invest in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to which, Dohmen bluntly said, “You’d have to be ‘deaf, dumb and blind” to buy the name. Although Apple has been performing poorly in the past 52 weeks, the Cupertino tech giant is steadily rebounding, gaining 3.92% year-to-date vs. the S&P 500’s 6.5% gain for the same period. Last month, Apple shares jumped to more than 10%. Ticker has advanced nearly 18% in the past three months. Despite the rebound after its last earnings report, the investor said he wouldn’t touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole, adding, “The deterioration is accelerating.” Since 2014, the tech firm’s revenue has been disappointing every quarter, “worse than the one before” Dohmen added. Last Monday, Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it increases its stake in the tech giant by 55% and now owns a little more than 15 million shares. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster appeared alongside Dohmen on the show. He said that although he remains bullish on Apple’s prospects, the near term of the iPhone cycle is likely to boost shares. Munster also placed a $151 price target on the stock. He predicts that Apple’s revenue will be up 10% next year as users upgrade to the new iPhone. “They’ve had a difficult period. I think it has nothing to do with their core strength of coming out with great devices, and I think they’re going to continue on that path for the next five years,” Munster told “Closing Bell.” “That gives some optimism for investors that this isn’t just a one-year trade. There’s some groundwork that could help it get into big growth markets in the future.” Dohmen noted that iPhone sales have been down 15% in the last quarter and the profits are also down by 27%. He added that despite entering the Chinese market – a supposed big money maker – Apple sales were down 33%. Although investors are focused on Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone and the potential for a supercycle in 2017, Munster believes that the rumored entry to augmented reality and automotive sometime in 2018 will do wonders for the tech giant’s performance on the market. “That would be constructive if we bought stocks based on things that happened in the past, but I think investors tend to look at what goes on in the future,” he explained. But Dohmen thinks otherwise. He said Apple hasn’t been betting big on innovation for some time and this is one of the reasons for the company’s plummeting stock price. Instead, the firm has been investing its own money and borrowed money into “paying dividends and buying back its stock.” “This is not innovation. It’s financial engineering,” he said. AAPL closed Tuesday’s regular trading at $109.39, down $0.09, or 0.08 percent. However, in pre-market hours, the shares gained $0.26, or 0.24 percent.

Last we heard from him was when he called for an S-upgrade to the Apple Watch in February 2016 (he may have gotten that one right; the timing, not so much). He’s back now with some interesting thoughts (via AppleWorldToday) on Apple’s rumored electric vehicle and assumed virtual reality headset hardware. More advanced CarPlay Commenting on The Information’s recent report on Project Titan’s tentative 2019-2020 launch target internally postponed until 2021 amid technical issues and leadership problems, he said he believed we’d see some results out of the project before 2021. We think Apple could unveil some of its learnings before 2021 as it continues to develop its own car. For example, autonomous driving software could come out earlier via an automotive partner or more advanced CarPlay features. According to Bloomberg, Project Titan has shifted gear and is now about autonomous driving systems rather than actual vehicles. “The initiative is now prioritizing the development of an autonomous driving system, though it’s not abandoning efforts to design its own vehicle,” sources told the news organization. The analyst went on to explain why Apple’s potential market opportunity in the automobile space could be “a true needle mover”: In terms of the market, BMW might be the best comp for what Apple could do with the car in a wildly successful long-term scenario. For context, BMW sold 1.9 million vehicles last year at an average selling price of $75,000, which works out to approximately $142.5 billion in average revenue. Project Titan “a gigantic money pit” While we’re at BMW, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported in April 2015 that Apple and BMW had been running a secret vehicle research and development lab in the heart of Berlin. Two days later, unnamed sources shot down the report, saying that the German car maker wasn’t interested in collaborating with Apple on Project Titan in the first place. “Apple wants the car to be closely built into its own cloud software, while the German carmakers have made customer data protection a key element of their future strategy,” one of the sources reportedly said. Here’s GM’s former vice chairman calling Project Titan “a gigantic money pit”. Apple VR headset For one, Munster does not buy the idea of an Apple-branded virtual-reality headset due to high computing requirements for standalone VR headsets. “It’s hard to see Apple developing a computer-powered high-end headset in the current market,” he said. He’s adamant that the firm will instead open up the iPhone for third-parties to make authorized headsets by 2018, effectively creating a brand new virtual reality software platform from scratch. A report by The Financial Times from January 2016 contradicts Munster’s thinking. According to the financial newspaper, Apple assembled a large team of virtual and augmented reality experts for a top secret virtual-reality headset project and had been building prototypes of possible configurations “for several months” at the time. Apple’s boss Tim Cook in the past called virtual reality “really cool” and said cryptically that the technology, in his view, “has some interesting applications.” Intel unveiled Project Alloy, its merged reality system, at IDF 2016. Cook went on to confirm in a recent interview with The Washington Post that his company has been doing “a lot of things” in terms of augmented and virtual reality. “I think augmented reality is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain,” he said. What do you guys make of Munster’s latest predictions? Top photo: AirVR by Metatecture, a Kickstarter project that leverages iOS Retina hardware already in millions of people’s hands.

The Apple robot mispronounces the singer’s surname “Strei-zand,” not the correct “Strei-sand,” with a soft “s.” This is a big problem, so Babs leapt into action to rectify it. “I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30,” Streisand said during a “Weekend Edition Saturday” NPR interview. “So, let’s see if that happens, because I’ll be thrilled.” *Also Read:* Kanye West Wants Apple to Buy Tidal From Jay Z 'Now' Streisand is currently on tour in a select number of cities across North America and is out-and-about promoting her new album of duets called “Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway.” Among the famous names involved in the collaboration are Anne Hathaway, Daisy Ridley, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jamie Foxx, Melissa McCarthy and Antonio Banderas. In 2014, the EGOT winner — a nickname for the exclusive group of only 12 people who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award — appeared on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon. “I was afraid that you were going to be more of a nightmare,” he told her candidly, marveling at how charming and down-to-earth she was. According to Fallon, if there was one person on the planet who’d earned the right to be a diva, it was Streisand. *Also Read:* STX Entertainment Drops Barbra Streisand's 'Gypsy' Remake (Exclusive) She said that she’s “quite ordinary,” and that she and her husband James Brolin live a simple life. “We don’t really like the big time stardom thing, so we stay home most of the time,” she explained. “That’s why I’m gonna write a book,” Streisand said. “Because I swear to God these myths are so far-fetched.” Siri will be happy to hear that.

By my count, we have approximately seventeen million leaked photos and renders of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Some are good, some are bad, most are blurry. But they’re all here, in all their glory, ready for inspection. DON’T MISS: 7 awesome iOS 10 features you didn’t know existed The first iPhone 7 image we saw was a concept from Martin Hajek. His render looks very similar to the iPhoen 6s, so it’s probably right on the money. The big differences are a Force Touch home button, and slim top bezel that reduces the size taken by the front-facing camera and speaker. It’s a great render, and not technologically impossible for Apple. There’s a good chance we’ll see some of those features on the 2017 iPhone, from what we’ve been hearing.   Next up was another concept, this time from YouTube. It was published by ConceptsiPhone, and while it vaguely followed Apple’s design language, it looks way off with hindsight. Doesn’t mean it’s bad though — I love the small bezel and rounded back, reminiscent of the Moto X. Edge-to-edge glass is a nightmare, though, so I’m happy Apple doesn’t seem to be pursuing that too hard. A very different concept came from GdgtCompare, which took a lot of design liberties from the iPhone 4 and 5 series. It’s a trip back to the flat-edged design that the iPhone SE still sports, but with upgrades like curved glass to make it truly modern. Personally, I hate the glass back on the 4-series iPhones — or at least, how easily they crack. Most concepts and renderings stuck with traditional Apple designs to make a realistic guess at what the iPhone 7 will look like. But some of the designs are a lot more radical, showing the kind of radical rethinking of the iPhone that we’re expecting to see for the 10th anniversary iPhone next year. Curved edges, thin design and zero bezel make this phone almost impossibly good to look at, but the practicalities make me wince. There’s definitely no space for a headphone jack on this phone, that’s for sure. December saw us get one of the most realistic iPhone concepts yet. German website Handy Abovergleich posted an image thinking about what the iPhone would look like without a headphone jack. The concept isn’t very original — it’s really just an iPhone 6 with no headphone jack and thinner antenna lines — but as a result, it’s probably pretty bang-on what the iPhone 7 will look like. As soon as the clocks turned to 2016, we got our first actual leaked image. Nowhereelse sourced a photo of the iPhone 7’s backlight — not the most important internal component, but one that provided some clues at what kind of device we’ll be looking at come September. It’s about the same size as the iPhone 6s backlight. It wasn’t a surprise that Apple was planning on sticking with the 4.7-inch screen size, but welcome nonetheless. My favorite concept was made by graphic designer Arthur Reis, and it’s realistic and beautiful all at once. It takes inspiration from the old square-edged iPhones, but rounds off the 90-degree corners to make it a little easier to hold. It looks like the perfect mashup of the iPhone 5 and 6, which means Apple will almost certainly never make it. Our next leak of a physical thing wasn’t another iPhone 7 part, but instead a dive into the murky world of leaked iPhone cases. The first purported iPhone 7 case hints at a design familiar to the iPhone 6, but with no room for a headphone jack. Harbinger of things to come! The first real look at the outside of the iPhone 7 came in true leaked-photo style: a blurry photo of a render on a computer monitor. Not exactly definitive, but in hindsight, this leak looks pretty accurate. The back is similar to the iPhone 6, but with no antenna lines and a more integrated camera design. All our most recent reports point to this leak — from early March! — being right on the money. That case leak was just the tip of an iceberg. The next day, we got a peek at the dual-camera module that will likely be in the iPhone 7 Plus. This is the earliest photo confirmation I can find of the dual-camera rumor, which is one of the most persistent (and realistic) rumors about big changes to the upcoming iPhones. By the middle of March, iPhone 7 leaks had become so passe that the iPhone 7 Plus (or Pro?!) leaks started coming out of the woodwork. The first iPhone 7 Plus leak, complete with the dual-camera system that has become so familiar, was published by Chinese site Bastille Post. This image included a Smart Connector interface along the bottom, a rumor that’s been up and down in popularity for the last few months. We’re still not entirely clear how a Smart Connector interface or accessories would work with the big iPhone. The back case has been one of the most heavily-leaked components of the iPhone 7, and we got another look at the antenna lines in March. Nowhereelse showed off a case with a single-antenna line. The lines have been one of the most complained-about features on the iPhone 6, and speculation is rampant as to how Apple will get rid of them while avoiding another Antennagate. While all the plausible leaks were going on in March, a few more outlandish images continued to trickle out. One of the most suspect was this purported photo of an iPhone 7 without TouchID sensor or button. Those were supposedly integrated into the display, something we’re not expecting to see until the 2017 iPhone. With enough leaked photos in the open that we had a good idea of what it would look like, designer Martin Hajek put together his usual set of renders of the iPhone 7. The redesigned antenna lines stand out, as does the camera sitting flush with the body, and the lack of 3.5mm jack. As the rumors about the iPhone 7 losing that headphone jack picked up speed, we saw our first image of what would replace the classic Apple EarPods. It made sense that they’d just look like regular EarPods with a Lightning connector on the end, so that’s exactly what photo leaked to the wild. We have no idea if this is a real image or just a DIY job that someone with a spare pair of EarPods made, but it’s likely a good match with the real thing. One of the justifications for killing the 3.5mm jack is that it would allow a slightly bigger battery, fixing one of the iPhone’s longest-standing problems. So, as you’d expect, we got a look at that bigger battery in late March. It’s exactly what you’d expect: looks like an iPhone battery, but with  7.04 Whr rather than 6.61 in the iPhone 6s. After all the blurry leaks of the back case of the iPhone 7, it’s about time that we had some clarity and engineering precision. Cue the ever-reliable @Onleaks, who came up with a technical drawing of the back case, including precise measurements. From technical drawings, we go straight to dummy units. Macrumors found this silver iPhone 7 dummy. It’s mostly similar to the designs posted before, although the camera is clearly smaller and in a different place to most other leaks. USwitch then got its hands on supposed drawings of the iPhone 7, via an Apple sub-contractor. They look like exactly what we’re expecting the iPhone 7 to look like, minus a change to the edge that could be due to a case. No headphone jack, bigger camera — sound familiar? A more unusual leak was this version of an iPhone 7 case from OnLeaks at the end of May. It shows off a purple color that would be a big change to the lineup if launched, but more importantly, speaker grilles alongside the top of the phone. There’s a good chance that this was an early prototype with more speakers for better sound, since we haven’t seen much of this design since this leaked photo. With all of the leaked components and drawings doing the rounds, it was only a matter of time until we got our first look at a working iPhone 7. Turns out, we didn’t have to wait long. Towards the end of May, a photo was published on Chinese social media site Weibo, showing off a working iPhone 7 alongside two internal components, meaning there’s a good chance that this is the real deal. It’s very close to other leaked photos, and at the least, I suspect this is an early prototype of the 7 that might change a little by launch. As we started to see rumors of a dark blue iPhone 7 do the rounds, Martin Hajek came to the rescue again with this stunningly good render. People have talked a lot about the iPhoen 7 being a boring, incremental upgrade, which is partially true. But I will also say: just look at that color. As we got into June, the iPhone 7 leak machine kicked into overdrive. The camera details were getting nailed down, as a pair of photos of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’s cameras show. The 7 is getting a bigger camera sensor, while the 7 Plus gets a dual-camera system that should be better in low-light and at focusing. Which design would you prefer? #Apple #iPhone #iPhone5 #iPhone5s #iPhoneSE #iPhone6 #iPhone6Plus #iPhone6s #iPhone6sPlus #iPhone7 #iPhone7Plus #iPhone7Pro #iPhone8 #iPhone2017 #Glass #Aluminum #SpaceGrey #BlackAndSlate #Black #Design #AppleDesign @appleidesigner A photo posted by Apple® iDesigner (@appleidesigner) on Jun 24, 2016 at 1:20am PDT Another common rumor is the Space Grey color making way for a new, all-black color dubbed Space Black. Instagram user appleidesigner helped us out by releasing a slew of images that imagine the black iPhone 7. Martin Hajek again took things a step further by making photorealistic mockups of a Space Black iPhone 7. Accessory leaks also continued to trickle out, with the Lightning EarPods get some more love. Again, it’s difficult to know if these are the real deal or just a DIY mockup, since the two things would be so familiar. While Space Black leaks were taking center stage, TechTastic got its hands on photos of an iPhone 7 assembled from genuine Apple components. It’s not a fully-functional iPhone 7, but hopefully should be an accurate model of what the outside of the phone will look like. Big camera, no headphone jack, just like we know and love. To round things out, we also got a look at the case for a Rose Gold iPhone 7. The color seems a little more muted than the Rose Gold iPhone 6s, and may appeal to people who think the more pink Rose Gold is a little girly. NowhereElse also got photos of an assembled Rose Gold model, and the lighting in this photo shows it as being the same pinkiness we all remember. In July, we got some new photos that actually told us something new for a change. Images found on Weibo show an iPhone 7 without a mute button, which would constitute a major hardware change. The iPhone doesn’t have many physical ports or buttons to begin with, so removing both the headphone jack and the mute button is a big change. As we get closer to launch day, a leaked photo of just one iPhone doesn’t cut it. Instead, we need a full family portrait. This Weibo image claims to show off three different new iPhones, the 7, 7 Plus, and 7 Pro. Whether we’ll see two or three new phones in September is one of the enduring mysteries that the rumormill hasn’t quite sorted out yet. By mid-July, we entered Stage 4 of the iPhone leaking process: comparison videos. Here, we have an iPhone 7 being compared side-by-side with a 6s. Notable differences include the much better camera and slightly changed antenna lines. One video hasn’t convinced you, I hear? Well, thankfully, YouTube has a fix for that. This second video is so quick that we’re loathe to call it authentic, but the important details (headphone jack, antenna lines) do line up with previous leaks. With most of the hardware details confirmed, one of the remaining questions is colors. Assuming the classic iPhone colors stay alongside the extremely popular Rose Gold, we’re left wondering if Space Grey or dark blue iPhone 7 is really going to happen. The shot above would say no, since it’s supposedly laying out all the different colors of the iPhone 7, and there’s a distinct lack of black and blue. Those color options were later seemingly confirmed by a leak of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, with the colors being white, space grey, rose gold and gold. It makes sense that both the 7 and 7 Plus would be the same color, and two photos from two different sources is an encouraging amount of consistency. Two photos not enough? Well, since you asked, an anonymous Weibo user posted a photo of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, along with a video of the rose gold iPhone 7 next to the 4.7-inch iPhone from last year. As we got into August, the leaked video scene really started to take off. As ever, it’s difficult to know if these are good mockups or the actual devices, especially since they’re non-functional dummies. We take a break from the regularly scheduled programming to look at this photo, which addresses the iPhone 7’s most controversial “feature.” If the iPhone 7 ships without a 3.5mm jack, something that seems near-certain by this point, Apple will probably be shipping this Lightning-to-headphone adapter in the box. Prepare to lose it at once, and spend $19 every day for the rest of your life replacing it. This is the future. The question about the iPhone 7’s color was made even more puzzling by a leak from China Unicom, one of Apple’s biggest partners in China. It posted a picture to social media that seemingly confirmed that the phone will be called the iPhone 7, and that it will come in four colors, including a blue. Either that, or Unicom is a master of trolling. With all the iPhone 7 models floating around, one of the big missing pieces was a picture of a powered-on iPhone. That came a few weeks ago via Geekbar, a team specializing in iPhone repairs. The device is clearly running internal testing software, so it’s a less reliable leak than, say, a video of an iPhone 7 running regular iOS. After the photo, Geekbar also published a video of the device in question. It definitely seems to be an iPhone running some kind of software, although it could also be an elaborate Android mockup. #Apple #iPhone7 SPACE BLACK variant 1st act >>> Mute button 2nd act >>> SIM-tray FINAL ACT >>> Real Machine pic.twitter.com/AYnypb2RzM — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 7, 2016 My favorite rumor — the black iPhone 7 — was given more credence when a Twitter user published more photos of a rear casing and a SIM tray. In a follow-up tweet, the user also said that the iPhone 7 won’t have Corning’s new Gorilla Glass 5. While we’ve seen leaks of pretty much every external component, it took until last week to start seeing the guts. A logic board and an A10 processor both leaked in quick succession, helping confirm some rumors. Based on those images, it looks like the home button will be here to stay, but the 3.5mm jack is indeed going. One model we hadn’t seen much of was the gold iPhone 7. That all changed with a leaked image that showed off the gold iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. All the familiar leaked details are there, but the high-quality photos really show off the gold casing for the first time. Geekbar also came through with another component leak, this time of the display assembly. It’s not overly different to the assembly seen on the iPhone 6s, but with a slightly different internal connector system. Most importantly, there’s still room for a physical home button. Noted iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson has been quiet for most of the iPhone 7 season, but a couple days ago he finally entered the arena with a full five-minute hands-on video with mockups of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. #Apple #iPhone7Pro first look to a BLUE WORKING prototype (source PCOnline.cn) pic.twitter.com/Z7oQzr6l4s — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 16, 2016 #Apple By (great) request some nice photos of BLACK #iPhone7 PRO for you.@the_malignant & @KK低调, a nice pair! pic.twitter.com/92smawKVQa — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 15, 2016 The rumor about a blue iPhone 7 has been consistently floating around, but most leaks had it as a dark blue. Twitter user The Malignant thew a spanner in the works by posting the photo above, which clearly shows an iPhone 7 in a lighter, more powder blue color. Everything else is as we’ve come to expect, so either this is the real deal, or a fantastic bit of CGI. So what should we expect? If you’ve scrolled down through all those photos, you probably have a very good idea of which rumors are solid by this point. The removal of the 3.5mm jack and the changed antenna lines seem like a lock, as do the bigger camera for the 7 and dual-lens camera for at least one phablet. But there’s still a lot of details up in the air. Will we get a space black color, or some kind of blue? Probably most interestingly, will there be two or three new iPhones? The smart money is probably on two devices, with Apple have had plans for some kind of Pro as a step-up device at some point.   Tags: Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Photos, iPhone 7 Release Date Older StoryPrevious Newer StoryNext Trending How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more Leak: iPhone 8’s major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature Related Articles This futuristic iPhone 7 clear case heals itself from scratches Leak: iPhone 8's major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America BGR Store Pocket Tripod PRO Striiv Touch Activity Tracking & Notification-Enabled Smartwatch Bluetooth 3.0 Smartwatch with Camera & Pedometer PureVPN: Lifetime Subscription View Comments Hubs Apple Leak: iPhone 8's major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America Android Buying microSD cards for your phone just got a lot easier You can now catch Ditto in Pokemon Go Mobile Sprint's Black Friday deals are great, if you like Sprint New leak shows how efficient Samsung has gotten at copying Apple Retail These are all the early Black Friday deals that are available right now Amazon's 13 best deals: 55" 4K Roku TV, Kindle Paperwhite, gigabit router, Bluetooth earbuds, more FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn BGR ON TWITTER Jonathan S.

The feature is set to debut as part of iOS 10, giving listeners the ability to find out what a singer is really saying in just seconds.” Hein reports, “Apple Music’s new lyrics feature comes right after Spotify turned off its lyrics due to the expiration of its deal with Musixmatch.” Read more in the full article here.

Loading... Comment Feed 11 Comments Herself Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 9:31 pm · Reply Yeah, right. Putting the “lyrics” to gangsta-rap “songs” is a great feature addition to Apple Music and iTunes—? I can hardly wait to find out if what these petulant rappers are “singing” is what my virgin ears are hearing. Apple had best consider extending their parental controls to these exploitive, misogynist, cynical messages. Hip-hop as a social phenomenon is vital human expression at its most basic level. But thugs invaded it. Thugs invade a lot of things and spoil the party for everyone else. That’s why bars have bouncers. ScreenPhiles Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 9:19 am · Reply You may not like rap, though enough people do to make such a venture worthwhile. You have your opinion, and while valid, it’s exactly the same thing a lot of people said about rock music at the time. If you don’t like the songs, don’t listen to them. Danox Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:25 pm · Reply Listening to Howlin Wolf, AC/DC, Tricky, or Portishead is not for most people either. If you want easy stick with Rascal Flatts. ScreenPhiles Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 10:09 am · Reply Exactly. It always interests me that just because people don’t like something–be it rap, rock or country–they somehow think that they can extrapolate that dislike to everyone. technicalconclusions Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 1:19 pm · Reply The point of her post was that these parental controls should extend to the lyrics content for these songs. That seems pretty reasonable to me and hardly worthy of the response you provided. I didn’t see where she categorically stated that she didn’t like rap for that matter. ScreenPhiles Saturday, August 20, 2016 - 1:40 pm · Reply That was not her point at all. If it were, you’d think she’d once have mentioned, I don’t know, parental controls. She was attacking rap for the purpose of attacking rap. That’s her right to do, but to treat it as if it weren’t anything more than a attack on the medium itself is wrong (and I am not even a huge fan of it). And by they way, how do can you claim that the the case when she said nothing of the sort? Either you’re psychic–because as I said, she didn’t say that at all–or you’re full it it. Take your pick. Herself Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 8:56 pm · Reply Excuse me, I believe I stated “Apple had best consider extending their parental controls to these exploitive, misogynist, cynical messages.” Psychic powers not required. ScreenPhiles Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 9:02 pm · Reply Correct me if I’m wrong, but you didn’t once mention parental controls. If you had we wouldn’t be having this discussion. So, based upon what you actually wrote, if that what you were referring to then being psychic would have indeed saved a bit of trouble because what you wrote wouldn’t have been quite so open to interpretation. Herself Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 9:46 pm · Reply It is right there in the leadoff comment: parental controls. Please read it more carefully. Dang Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:35 pm · Reply “Thugs invaded it”?? Wow. Some racist sh*t going on up here. Cool down, friend, or keep out of it. technicalconclusions Thursday, August 18, 2016 - 1:22 pm · Reply What part of the word “thugs” seems racist to you? Even suggesting so on your part is in itself, racist. Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple Can Unlock IPhones, But Won't Says Tim Cook Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:40am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     To commemorate Tim Cook’s fifth year as CEO of Apple as well as the fact that the company has produced a billion iPhones, Tim Cook gave an interview to the Washington Post. The interview takes the shape of a goodwill piece with a few snippets about Apple and himself that Cook decided to dish out. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Cook revealed that in the case of the San Bernardino iPhone the company decided to not unlock the phone despite spending a significant time figuring out a way to do just that because Cook felt that the technique would be exploited and it would be difficult to handle the backlash. He used the following words to justify his stance “the risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety." Cook revealed that the company did not acquire for revenue but to gain access to talent or intellectual property and therefore the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics was done not for the healthy stream of profits it generated but in fact for its streaming platform. Cook told the Washington Post that this acquisition enabled Apple to get its own music service out sooner than it would have been possible otherwise. The decision to make more original audio and video shows such as the planet of the Apps depends upon whether they would become the catalysts for pushing apps as the future of television. He wasn’t very keen to discuss the company’s tax status in Europe and claimed that Apple received no preferential treatment in Ireland which is in contrast to the EU’s view on the matter. The EU has opened up an investigation against Apple and the deal it made with the government when Apple Ireland was set up in 1991. But there is surely something going on considering the fact that Apple chose to direct two thirds of the profits it earned in 2014 to Ireland. Cook statement that where you "create value is the place where you are taxed," makes us wonder if he thinks whether US taxes are the only ones worth paying. Cook has denied the murmurs which claimed that Apple wasn’t as up to speed as Facebook, Google and Amazon when it came to Artificial intelligence. Cook also revealed that Apple was busy making a lot of headway when it came to developing technology focused on augmented reality.

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Give Songs Star Ratings on Your iPhone Justin Meyers 2 months ago Give Songs Star Ratings on Your iPhone Back in iOS 8.4, Apple introduce a new "heart" icon in their Music app, which works in direct correlation with their Apple Music service that was released at the same time. By hearting a song, you're telling Apple that you love that song, and they can make better suggestions for you (in the "For You'" tab) based on it. But if you don't subscribe to Apple Music—and don't think you ever will—that heart is virtually useless. And if you have a HUGE personal library of music and have been using the star-based rating system that's been around on iTunes since before the iPhone was even invented, you probably still want to star songs. Problem is, rating songs in iOS 9.3 to 9.3.5 is different, and the feature is completely absent from iOS 10. Previously, you would tap on the song name in the Now Playing view to bring up the rating system. If you try to do that now, you'll just open up the Album that the song appears on. Don't Miss: The 10 Most Annoying Things About iOS 10 for iPhone Right Now (1) Tapping on the song title... (2) Takes you to the Album page in iOS 9.3.x. (3) And the same happens in iOS 10. To rate songs in iOS 9.3 to 9.3.5, just tap on the Album artwork in the Now Playing view. The album with blur, and you'll see the dots and/or stars that you're used to seeing right in the middle. If you're using iOS 10, you'll only see Love/Dislike ratings. The only option you have for stars is using iTunes, and the only way you can see stars on your iPhone is by creating a smart playlist in iTunes based on each of the individual star ratings, then sync them with your device. (1) Tap on the album artwork in 9.3.x... (2) To see the star rating system. If the song has lyrics, it will show them as well, pushing the rating system up top near your status bar. In iOS 10, you have to pull up the Now Playing window to see lyrics, but there are no stars. (1) Tap on the album artwork in 9.3.x... (2) To also see lyrics, if any. (3) In iOS 10, you can still see lyrics, but no stars. If you've been tapping the song title since iOS 7, the iOS 9.3 change is not very intuitive, and the iOS 10 one even more so. Plus, these updates killed the previous ability of tapping on the song name to rate it from the Control Center or on the lock screen. So if you're at the gym, you have unlock your iPhone first before you can rate anything; If you're on iOS 10, you can't even Like a song from the lock screen. Even if you disable Apple Music to get rid of the "For You" and "New" tabs, it won't change the way any of this works. Thanks, Apple. And the star rating feature will likely never return to future versions of iOS 10, so start saying your goodbyes now.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 20, 2016 at 11:46AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has undoubtedly made more than a few millionaires. Sure, for more than two decades, it was largely a disappointment. But when the tech company's stock took off... it took off. Here's a look at the stock's interesting history. Apple stock history Since Apple went public on December 12, 1980 at $22, or a split-adjusted $0.39, it has appreciated more than 21,000%, handily beating the S&P 500's approximate 1,600% return during the same period. AAPL is up about 1,000% in the last 10 years. This chart shows the complete AAPL history. AAPL data by YCharts. Impressively, Apple stock's outperformance during its long history has largely been driven by less than 10 major achievements and innovations -- all of which proceeded to drive significant long-term success for the company. Key Events Behind AAPL Stock History Date Steve Jobs returns from NeXT Computer to be interim CEO 1997 Apple announces the colorful iMac 1998 Steve Jobs drops "interim" designation, becomes CEO 2000 Apple launches iPod 2001 Apple launches iTunes Store 2003 Apple launches iPhone 2007 Apple introduces iPad 2010 Data retrieved from Apple press releases. Chart source: author. Three products, in particular, were absolutely crucial in Apple stock's incredible track record. The first was Apple's colorful iMac, which was Steve Jobs' first consumer-facing product after his return to Apple. The second was iPod, along with more affordable models to follow, including iPod mini, shuffle, and nano. And Apple's most game-changing product ever was arguably iPhone. Along with its annual refreshes that followed the first version, iPhone can be largely credited as the key driver behind the bulk of Apple stock's market-crushing performance. Before these products began meaningfully impacting Apple's bottom line, the company struggled. Indeed, between its IPO in 1980 and the end of 2004, the stock actually underperformed the S&P 500. After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, the tech giant struggled from a lack of product focus and faced major headwinds from competition, namely the game-changing release of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. 10-year Apple stock history AAPL data by YCharts. The last 10 years have been particularly lucrative for Apple shareholders, with the stock outperforming the S&P about 15 times over. Investors can thank the iPhone for much of this period's return. iPhone sales have soared since the device's introduction. In the trailing 12 months alone, Apple has sold a whopping 215 million iPhones. This compares to about 6 million iPhone sales during the device's first year. Stock split history With a stock history as impressive as Apple's, you can bet the company has split its shares. Here's a look at the stock's four splits (a more complete look at Apple's stock splits can be found here). Apple Stock Split Date* 7-for-1 June 9, 2014 2-for-1 February 28, 2005 2-for-1 June 21, 2000 2-for-1 June 16, 1987 Asterisk indicates the first date shares traded on a split-adjusted basis. Table source: author. Importantly, all the returns discussed in this article were adjusted for splits. With Apple delivering such impressive returns for shareholders in the past, it's tempting to conclude investors should expect similar results in the future. But investors should note that Apple is a much larger company today. In the trailing 12 months alone, the tech giant has earned a whopping $220 billion in revenue. Gains in intrinsic value per share are simply harder to come by at this size. But investors shouldn't write off AAPL stock, either, as it would be a mistake to not give any weight to the company's excellent history of launching entirely new products in new categories, and capitalizing on growth opportunities.

According to a report from the New York Times, Lyft has recently held discussions with handful of companies to discuss a possible acquisition, with Apple being one of them. Other companies Lyft discussed a possible acquisition with include General Motors, Google, Amazon, Uber, and Didi Chuxing. In some instances, it was the other company that approached Lyft with interest in the purchase, though it’s unclear which companies Lyft first approached and which companies approached Lyft. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity. The biggest factor working against Lyft during the acquisition talks was apparently its asking price. The company, following an investment round by GM and others in January, is valued at $5.5 billion and has a cash pile of $1.4 billion. More than likely, Lyft was considering an acquisition as a way to better compete with Uber. In the past, Lyft has partnered with Didi Chuxing to work to defeat Uber. Despite those efforts, Uber still has a strong hold on the ride-hailing app market. Earlier this year, Apple announced a $1 billion investment in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, with Tim Cook explaining the partnership will allow for Apple to learn more about certain segments of the Chinese market in addition to delivering a strong fiscal return. During the company’s Q3 earnings call last month, Cook noted that while it’s uncommon for Apple to make cash investments in companies, it’s something he would consider to do again in the future. Apple’s interest in the ride-hailing market come as it is rumored to be developing its own electric car under Project Titan. Apple’s electric car is said to have a target release date of 2021, slightly later than the initial 2020 rumored release date.

None of the mentioned companies commented on the story. The nation’s second-largest ride-hailing firm also attempted a sale to China’s leading ride-sharing service, Didi Chuxing, into which Apple invested $1 billion, and to General Motors, one of its largest investors that refused to make a written offer to buy it. According to the article: Lyft has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties. The firm allegedly struggled to find a buyer because of cost, the fact that it’s not profitable and the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Lyft typically keeps 20 to 25 percent of the cost of each ride to itself. The article explains: With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft’s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company’s financials. That $400 million shrinks when you factor in costs like marketing, server infrastructure, software, licensing, research and development and so forth. They even provide drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road. If anything, the unsuccessful sale highlights a capital-intensive model of growth for ride-hailing services that typically spend billions of dollars in marketing and employee costs just to spread to new cities and recruit more drivers. The article states that “tensions have escalated” in the industry after Uber agreed to sell its Chinese subsidiary to Didi Chixung, which has disrupted a global alliance that Lyft had struck with Didi and others to fight Uber. Lyft has not said whether it will continue working with Didi. Based in San Francisco, Lyft was founded four years ago. The company was valued at $5.5 billion after an investment round by General Motors and others in January.

The company's online pages for all former Apple Stores now simply refer to places such as 'Apple Regent Street' or in the case of San Francisco's relatively new outlet, 'Apple Union Square'. The Cupertino firm has always referred to the latter as Apple Union Square, and has rebranded all its other stores to match this naming convention in the past few days. Related: iPhone 8 As MacRumours points out, an archived page for the Fifth Avenue Apple Store seems to show the shop itself still had the old 'Store' branding as recently as August 12. The site also notes that a memo was previously sent out to Apple retail staff to inform them of the change to both brick and mortar stores and online stores. Apple's latest branding move seems to point to an effort to convince customers that the shops are much more than just retail locations. The San Francisco outlet features an outdoor plaza called The Forum, which includes seating and a 6K video wall and hosts numerous events throughout the year. That doesn't mean all stores will be getting upgraded with such facilities of course, but it could hint at some sort of future upgrades to make Apple retail outlets into more interesting locations.

By doing so, the company showed its commitment to delivering a polished official version of its mobile OS in September.  ( William Iven | Pixabay ) Advertisement Apple fans are on their toes for September, when the OEM will finally roll out the rounded up variant of iOS 10, alongside a new iPhone model. Meanwhile, the company keeps machine gunning new iOS 10 betas in an attempt to polish all the rough edges of the software before the official unveil. This is the seventh beta the developer rolls out to both public testers and developers. Keep in mind that when looking at the version number of the public beta, it always stays one digit behind the developer version, making the latest iOS 10 beta the sixth public beta to come out. Apple did not say anything about updates for other OS, such as watchOS, tvOS or macOS. To check out if the over-the-air beta is available for your device, go to the Settings section, Software Update on your iPhone or iPad and update manually if necessary. Some experts urge caution from users, as some bugs can still be expected at this stage. To put it bluntly, users should install the public beta on their main phone at their own risk, as there is a small chance to render the device useless. So, what's new in this iOS 10 everyone is talking about? For one thing, the upcoming OS brings a major revamping of Siri, with third-party integrations to boot. Keep in mind that the integration will not be obvious in the betas, as third-party developers did not roll out iOS 10 apps yet. However, the reshaping of Siri could leave its mark on how users are tapping into their iPhones' capabilities. Apple has redrawn the lock screen so that iPhone owners will find their way easier among the rich notifications that display tiny live widgets. The Photos app will get an update featuring intelligent photo albums and deep learning categorization. Other areas that are getting a boost in capability and/or design are Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone app. Last, but definitely not least, the iPhone manufacturer has announced that the Messages app will come packed with a lot new possibilities, such as an emojify creator, message effects, link previews, third-party extensions and feedback on messages resembling the one on Slack. The official version of the much awaited iOS 10 is expected to hit the large consumer base in September, and until the day comes we must rely on a bit of patience. Which feature from Apple's latest mobile OS appeals to you most? Let us know in the comments section below. TAG iOS 10, iOS 10 Beta, Public Beta © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(Picture: REX/Shutterstock) The Apple Store has just announced it is undergoing a major, unexpected rebrand. It will no longer be called The Apple Store. From now on, it shall simply be known as (drum roll please)…… ‘Apple’! The absolutely groundbreaking change is apparently part of an attempt to make them sound less like places where you buy things, and more like community gathering areas (where you also buy things). MacRumors reported that the tech giant sent out an email telling its retail employees about the name change. Its newest stores will be the first to be rebranded, and the rest will gradually follow suit. Make sure you don’t go into the wrong building out of confusion (Picture: REX/Shutterstock) And some of them have already made the switch.

In fact, he’s remained pretty involved in tech, and his latest product, the Obi Worldphone MV1, has just launched in the U.K. after first being announced six months ago at Mobile World Congress. The new phone is powered by Android, has a 5-inch display, and is designed to compete with other low-cost smartphones out there, especially considering its 99 pound price tag (about $129). In other words, the Worldphone MV1 is not an iPhone-killer designed to go up against Sculley’s old employer. Related: Former Apple CEO John Sculley launches two low-cost Android smartphones Apart from the display, the phone features a 1.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, 16GB of storage with a MicroSD card slot to expand upon that storage, 2GB of RAM, an 8MP rear-facing camera, and a 2MP front-facing camera. It also offers a 2,500mAh battery. The best thing about this phone, however, isn’t the specs — it’s the price. At a tiny 99 pounds, this is one of the better deals out there. It boasts specs comparable to the super low-cost Moto E, even beating out the Moto E in some areas, such as in the processor — the Moto E’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, and is coupled with 1GB of RAM, compared to the Worldphone’s 2GB. Of course, it’s important to note that the phone has been available in Asia, the Middle East, and South America for some time now, and it will likely be available in other parts of Europe in the near future. There’s no word yet on the phone’s availability in the U.S. though. If you’re interested in getting the super low-cost Obi Worldphone MV1 for yourself and you live in an area where the device is available, you can buy it from the company’s website.

As Apple adds more features to the iPhone 7 next month and beyond, the battery life issue will be front and center even if it's not as sexy as a dual lens 3D camera. While tech companies like Apple are exploring the possible use of fuel cells for mobile devices down the road, it's safe to say that it's not likely to be on Apple's short-term road map. Apple's various engineering teams are intelligently working on both smarter CPU based solutions as well as battery improvement solutions to squeeze more life out of batteries as humanly possible. They're also working on ways, such as found in this invention, to ensure that batteries that are working harder in smaller spaces are designed with safety in mind.   Look at the great improvement that Apple made with their latest iPhone 6s 1715mAh battery versus the previous iPhone 6's larger 1810mAH battery illustrated below in a chart prepared by PhoneArena.   With a smarter battery, Apple's iPhone battery life went from the bottom of the pack with 5 hours 22 minutes of life to number three with 8 hours and 15 minutes … all with a slightly smaller battery.   On Thursday we posted a patent report titled "Apple Invents an Energy Harvesting Component to Augment Battery Power for iOS Devices." This is another area that Apple is exploring to expand battery life for mobile devices I the future.   Other revelations surfaced this week at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office focused on extending the run time for mobile devices. The second patent covers battery technology and specifically designing a "Dendrite-Resistant Battery." So what is Dendrite to begin with?   Apple's patent background explains what dendrite is and the problems that it causes in robbing battery life. Apple notes that as mobile devices "become increasingly smaller and more powerful, the batteries that are used to power these devices need to store more energy in a smaller volume.   A commonly used type of rechargeable battery is a lithium battery, which can include a lithium-ion battery or a lithium-polymer battery. Some lithium batteries may be thin-film batteries with a solid electrolyte. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries typically contain one or more cells that include a cathode current collector; a cathode comprised of an active material, a separator, an anode current collector; and an anode comprised of an active material. The cathode can comprise a cathode coating, and the anode can comprise an anode coating.   Lithium batteries conventionally include an anode that is comprised of a graphite material and a cathode that is comprised of a lithium salt material. One technique for increasing the energy capacity (mAh) of a lithium-ion or a lithium-polymer battery involves comprising the anode of a lithium metal material. A lithium battery that includes a lithium metal anode can be configured to have substantially increased energy capacity, relative to a lithium battery of similar size that includes a graphite anode.   However, charging and discharging such a lithium battery, in some cases, results in the formation of lithium metal structures on the surfaces of the anode. Such structures, referred to herein as lithium dendrites, can "grow" outward from the anode due to repeated charging and discharging cycles of the lithium battery.   Some of the lithium dendrites can grow between the anode and the cathode, including growing through various portions of the battery, including one or more battery separators, electrolyte layers, etc. Over time, some lithium dendrites can "grow" in a direction that results in the lithium dendrites approaching the cathode.   When a lithium dendrite reaches the cathode, an electrical short circuit (also "short" herein) can be established between the electrodes via the lithium metal comprising the lithium dendrite. Such an electrical short can result in failure of the battery and can further impose a safety risk due to overheating of the battery due to the short circuit, which can further lead to a fire."   Apple's invention addresses the build-up issue lithium metal structures or "dendrite. Apple notes that devices and methods presented in their patent application may be applied to resist, impede, suppress, and/or prevent one or more dendrites from causing a short circuit between the electrodes of the cell.   Some embodiments include a method that includes at least partially fabricating a battery including one or more cells that can resist dendrite growth between electrodes of a cell of the battery. For example, the battery may be a lithium battery that includes one or more lithium cells, each lithium cell having electrodes including an anode that includes lithium metal.   The method includes providing an electrochemically-neutral porous layer between the electrodes. For a lithium battery that includes at least one lithium cell, the electrochemically-neutral porous layer is configured to permit lithium ion transport across the porous layer and to resist lithium dendrite growth from the lithium anode across the porous layer. The electrochemically-neutral porous layer can include a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) layer that comprises a plurality of pores that are configured to permit lithium ion transport across the AAO layer and suppress lithium dendrite growth across the AAO layer.   Apple's patent FIG. 1A illustrates a lithium battery that includes dendrites growing between electrodes in the respective batteries; FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of an electrochemically-neutral porous layer that is configured to permit lithium ion transport and suppress lithium dendrite growth.   Apple's patent FIG. 4D illustrates a perspective view of a lithium battery which includes an electrochemically-neutral porous layer and at least one battery separator; FIG. 5 illustrates an exploded view of a lithium battery, which includes multiple layers arranged in a cylindrical coil configuration; and FIG. 9 illustrates a process for fabricating a lithium battery incorporating a porous layer.   For more details and examples, review Apple's patent application 20160240831 here. Apple filed their patent application on February 12, 2016.   Two of the four inventors listed on this patent filing are engineers that Apple hired from a company called A123 Systems that sued Apple back in February 2015 for employee raiding and misappropriation of trade secrets. Apple moved quickly to resolve the matter starting in March and then finalized a deal in May.   The first hire listed on the patent application is Shouwei Hao who is now an Apple Manager of a global team responsible for Battery Cell development for all of Apple's mobile devices. The second hire is Jie Guan, Technical Program Manager at Apple. Guan Led A123's materials R&D for high power and high energy cells. Interestingly Guan worked on fuel cells at both GE and Honeywell, an area of battery development that Apple has shown to be interested in as we noted at the top of this report.   Whether today's revealed technology and methods are in use today or are yet to be applied is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Apple users recommend increasing the new iPhone sizes to make way for a stronger and more powerful battery however this is not going to happen any time soon, says reports. However, a spinoff company from MIT has figured out how to improve battery life of an iPhone without changing its slim design. While users simply take this kind of discovery off hand, this new battery is not just a concept because it is going to be mass produced anytime soon. Anode-free lithium metal battery Startup SolidEnergy Systems has developed a new kind of battery that is denser than lithium – ion batteries. This is safe, long-lasting and will not affect battery size and thickness. In fact according to the creators of the new battery, with the improved density, they can create a battery that is half the size but will last the same time as an ordinary lithium battery. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit SolidEnergy has demonstrated their battery prototype using an iPhone 6. The battery was indeed half the size of the battery of the iPhone and it was able to provide 2.0 amp hours of use. This was more than what the usual iPhone battery can offer. Drone battery first, smartphones and electric cars next Come November, SolidEnergy plans to use their new battery on drones and then in 2017 on wearables and on smartphones. In 2018, this battery will be in electric cars. What makes this battery work is its very thin lithium metal foil as the battery anode. This very thin material is just one-fifth of what regular batteries have. This material is also thinner and lighter than graphite, silicon and carbon anodes. With these new improvements, SolidEnergy was able to reduce the size of the battery without affecting its life. The company has also developed a new solid and liquid electrolyte solution that will allow the battery to operate safely in room temperatures. The only thing that needs to be fixed, according to iPhone users is the pesky camera bump. Hopefully Apple techs could come up with a solution before their anticipated phone is released late September this year. Pre-orders for the iPhone 7 start on September 9, 2016.

Arts & Entertainment Music Expect more music to come after Frank Ocean releases visual album 'Endless' 2014 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival - Day 3 Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images Frank Ocean performs at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tenn., on June 14, 2014.

Kennedy After weeks of rumors, new Frank Ocean music has arrived.  Late Thursday night the enigmatic R&B crooner released “Endless,” an 18-track visual album streaming exclusively on Apple Music. “Endless” adds to the growing trend of upending the traditional album release model that has buoyed recent releases from Kanye West, Beyoncé, Drake and Rihanna.  The 45-minute visual album — it’s an extended version of the video that originally debuted as a livestream event — is reportedly a precursor to “Boys Don't Cry,” the singer’s much-speculated-about follow-up to his Grammy-winning 2012 debut, “Channel Orange.” “Boys Don’t Cry” is expected to be released later this weekend on Apple, according to a New York Times report.  A representative for Apple didn’t return request for comment, and reps for Ocean declined to provide additional information about the singer’s plans.  Earlier this month, without warning, Ocean rolled out a mysterious livestream video. But the Internet tease didn’t give away much of anything. Caption 'The Zookeeper’s Wife' trailer Jessica Chastain and Daniel Brühl star in "The Zookeeper’s Wife."

See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >> » For instance, viewers didn’t hear any full tracks. Instead, Ocean could be seen working in a mostly empty warehouse, tackling a carpentry project, as instrumental tracks gave way to construction noises. Fans speculated that the album’s release was imminent, considering the video — which was titled “Endless” — contained the Apple Music logo watermarked in the corner of the video.  Upon the debut of the livestream, it was reported by major news outlets that the album would be issued on Aug. 5 alongside a video through an exclusive deal with Apple Music. A printed publication called “Boys Don’t Cry” was also said to be distributed at Apple stores.  The reported release date came and went — as did Ocean, until Thursday.  After being dormant, the livestream returned to life. Ocean reappeared, continuing work on the structure he began building weeks ago.  This time, however, there was music — a full album, in fact.   Shot by Francisco Soriano and directed by the singer, the black-and-white art film depicts Ocean (actually multiple versions of himself) working to build a spiral staircase in the middle of a room. Ocean is also credited as executive producer and creative director of the film.  “Endless” begins with a flickering electronic number, “Device Control,” pulled from German visual artist Wolfgang Tillmans. Tillmans, whose voice opens and closes the album, revealed on his Instagram account that the track will appear on his own EP, also titled “Device Control,” and that he shared the track with Ocean just three weeks ago.  “Endless,” the visual, unfolds as three Oceans work to complete the project. At one point in the film two are cutting wood while the third aimlessly looks at his cellphone.   As for the music, it’s an experimental trip inside Ocean’s mind. Contemplative and free-flowing, some tracks feel like avant-garde demos while others feel like fully fleshed out records. There are ambient interludes and jam sessions that don’t even last a minute.  Fans recognized his cover of the Isley Brothers’ “At Your Best (You Are Love)” that appears early on the album. It was released early last year to tease the album and was then titled “You Are Luhh.” Ocean raps on “U-N-I-T-Y,” while R&B songstress Jazmine Sullivan brings warmth to a number of tracks, including “Hublots,” where she takes the lead. There are flashes of acoustic-driven soul, techno, trap and icy electronics. A number of the songs on the album were first heard in instrumental form on the livestream. Other tracks on the album include “Alabama,” “Commes Des Garcons,” “Wither,” “In Here Somewhere,” “Sideways,” “Mine,” “Hublots,” “Slide on Me,” “Florida,” “Deathwish (ASR),” “Rushes,” “Rushes to” and “Higgs.”  For the album, the singer collaborated with Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Arca, Alex G, Troy Noka and Sampha. Ocean played piano and guitar on a number of tracks, and violins, double basses, violas and cellos from London Contemporary Orchestra accompanied others.  Before it was released on Thursday, the wait for “Endless” had seemingly felt as such. In April 2015, Ocean announced that he’d completed the album, to be called “Boys Don't Cry,” and his reps confirmed that the album and an accompanying publication would arrive in July 2015. A year later, the singer updated his website with an image of a library due-date card stamped with a number of dates — including July 2016. Ocean’s unconventional release — there’s still no way to purchase the album or listen to it outside of streaming the visual — adds to a year of artists eschewing traditional releases in favor of turning their album release into a major event. Beyoncé first debuted her latest visual album, “Lemonade,” through an HBO special before releasing it exclusively to Tidal. Rihanna gave away 1 million copies of “Anti” via a deal with Samsung and Tidal, while Drake premiered “Views” via a “global listening party” on Apple Music Beats 1.   And West, in typical fashion for the polarizing rapper, rolled out his latest album, “The Life of Pablo,” with a chaotic listening party/fashion show for a sold-out Madison Square Garden that also served as the debut for his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. He sold tickets to the event and 20 million people tuned into the livestream before he released the album for free on Tidal. He later lifted that exclusivity and has since been tinkering with "Pablo" in real time.    For more music news follow me on Twitter:@GerrickKennedy ALSO Prepare to get your groove on: Vaud & the Villains return to Ford Amphitheatre on Aug. 19 Rap 'feud' between Drake and Eminem shut down by joint Detroit appearance Fantasia is in control, and finally happy: 'I’m the definition of strength' UPDATES: 1:45 p.m. Aug. 19: This article has been updated with new details throughout.

Apple has recently announced the release of iOS 10 developer beta 7 and iOS 10 public beta 6. The announcement emerged yesterday as the part of the company’s plan to ignite excitement among the users. The launch of latest version of iOS 10 comes four days after the company released its fifth public beta. It also marks the shortest gap until now between public beta updates of iOS 10. However, it has led to several speculations about a big bug that Apple may have found in iOS beta 5, which forced it to release the next version of its upcoming operating system (OS). The latest public beta update is currently available to download on almost all iOS devices. Also, iOS 10 developer beta update is available to all the users with developers account. To install the update, users are required to open Settings, Software Update, and hit the Download button. It is highly recommended to plug the device to a power source while downloading the update. Otherwise, there must be at least 50% battery life left. Users would need to sign in to the Apple Beta Software Program; those who are not members can create an account for free. The final version of Apple’s upcoming iOS 10 is expected to come out this fall along with iPhone 7, Apple Watch, and hopefully a refreshed MacBook Pro. The tech giant claims that the final version of iOS 10 will pack many new features and prominent changes such as redesigned News and Music apps. Multiple reports and rumors suggest that Apple has planned to introduce the iPhone 7 at its September 7 event, ahead of pre-orders. The device may officially be launched on September 16. It’s pretty obvious that Apple will release final version iOS 10 few days before iPhone 7 starts shipping, around September 14. That latest public beta update is of about 60MB, which makes several experts believe that Apple probably fixed a small security or bug patch and didn’t include any new features and major fixes. It is unclear how many beta updates will be released before the final version comes out. The company released the last beta update of its existing OS, iOS 9, last year. Hence, if the current public beta is the final update, we may be getting close to the final version of iOS 10.

First introduced in 2006 and now a signature design element for all of Apple’s notebooks, the magnetic connector isn’t just beneficial for Apple’s iconic design elements, but lasts longer than using cable and port combinations with male and female connectors that can wear down with time. According to the article, Apple is working on new ways to use MagSafe connectors across several of its products, including the iPad and more. An example of one new patent by Apple reveals that the connector might replace their 30-pin dock connector. Connections would be made as they are now, but the magnets would be coded with info that would be transmitted when the magnets are connected with one another, allowing different accessories to use a single connector port on a variety of Apple products. So the new cables would act as a universal port that would detect the coded magnet and its info then reconfigure itself accordingly. But that’s not all since Apple’s patent also involves a new stylus technology for the iPad that would include coded magnets around the tip of the device and allow it to be placed in a doc connected to the iPad (or iPhone, etc) to exchange data. This is all in conjunction to its regular function as a standard stylus pen. All this info on the possibilities and expansion of magnetic MagSafe connectors was first filed in July 2011 and there’s no concrete plans or word from Apple if these ideas will become a reality.

Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review GO Check out one of the most compelling 7-inch tablets Aug 20, 2016 13:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Huawei is no longer just another Chinese device manufacturer, and living proof comes in the form of the company's most recent premium devices that it has launched to compete against more famous manufacturers, such as Samsung and even Apple. DESIGN HARDWARE CONCLUSIONS Furthermore, Huawei is the manufacturer of Google's Nexus 6P, a device that provides the Android experience in its purest form, so it's easy to see how the company has become one of the leading names in both the smartphone and the tablet businesses. And we're not the ones saying it because sales figures pretty much speak for themselves. Data provided by research firm Gartner in May puts Huawei in the third place when it comes to smartphone sales with 28.8 million sold units, after Samsung and Apple with 81 and 51 million sold phones, respectively. Huawei has undoubtedly become the manufacturer of devices that excel in terms of hardware and design, so when we heard about the Honor X2 7.0-inch tablet, we were quite eager to try it out. Available for around $375 at GearBest, the Honor (also known as MediaPad) X2 promises to bring very good quality for the money, without neglecting the user experience, hardware, and reliability that everyone is expecting today. We've received a gold version of the Honor X2, which looks quite exquisite at first glance but also feels great in hand thanks to features that bring it closer to the smartphone market than to the tablet industry. Read on to find out what exactly the Honor X2 is all about when you get to use it for more than a day. Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 has a super quality AMOLED screen DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY When looking at the Huawei Honor X2 for the first time, you almost can’t believe that it’s made by a Chinese company. But truth be told, Huawei has improved so much lately that it really deserves the premium manufacturer moniker, and the Honor X2 is living proof in this regard. The tablet comes with a 7-inch screen and is protected by a metallic case that not only looks excellent in gold but is also durable and can withstand hits and shocks that would otherwise damage the device if plastic were used. Furthermore, this metallic finish gives it a really grippy feel, so you can securely hold it in hand without any risk of dropping it. The X2 is super slim and is just 7.18 mm thin, which is impressive, to say the least, for a tablet of this size. It’s almost as thin as an iPhone, which, for a manufacturer coming from China, is quite an achievement. “Not the typical Chinese tablet.” The tablet measures 18.30 x 10.30 x 0.70 cm / 7.2 x 4.06 x 0.28 inches and weighs in only 249 grams, so it’s feather-light, and the chances are that you’re going to forget about it when carrying it around in a briefcase. Everything on the X2 is where you’d expect it to be, including the volume and the lock buttons, the headphone jack, and available ports - the tablet can be recharged with a micro USB charger but also comes with dual-SIM support, as well as a microSD card slot, and they’re all conveniently placed on its sides. The front side of the tablet features the typical parts, including a front-facing camera and a LED notification light, as is the case with the majority of Android phones, while the rear side houses the other camera, a Flash, as well as a speaker in the lower part of the device. Overall, the Huawei Honor X2 looks good, and the metallic finish is what makes it feel exquisite, especially when holding it hand. It has pretty good grip, and since it’s super light, you can always carry it around with no effort at all. HARDWARE Display 7-inch 1920 x 1200 FHD IPS LTPS touch display 10-point capacitive touch screen 323ppi 450 nits CPU 2.0 GHz Kirin930 64 bit octa-core CPU, 4 x 2.0 GHz+4 x 1.5 GHz GPU Mali-T628+ i3 co-processor RAM 2GB/3GB Storage 16GB/32GB + microSD card support Camera 13-megapixel BSI rear-facing camera 5-megapixel front-facing camera Sensors GPS Ambient Light Sensor Accelerometer Proximity sensor Gyroscope Compass Battery 5000 mAh lithium polymer Connectivity microUSB Dual-SIM support OS Android 5.0 with Huawei EMOUI #CPU, GPU, storage Hardware is where the MediaPad X2 excels, and the spec sheet pretty much speaks for itself. And it all starts with CPU, GPU, and RAM. Huawei has equipped the device with a 2.0 GHz Kirin930 64 bit octa-core CPU (4 cores are running at 2.0 GHz while the other 4 at 1.5 GHz), while the GPU unit is Mali T628. The available RAM on our test unit was 3 GB, but a 2 GB version is also available at a lower price in some specific markets. In terms of performance, this mix is impressive. Everything within the OS, including here apps such as browsers, email clients, and messengers, runs smoothly, and there’s no slowdown if you don’t launch any more demanding title. When playing games, it all depends on its requirements, but during our test, we discovered no title that couldn’t run on the X2. Due to the high processing power of the CPU, there are times when the tablet feels a little bit hot, but otherwise, it remains cold as ice all the time. It makes sense to heat up every once in a while when using it for gaming or similarly demanding tasks, but it cools down as fast as it gets hot. For storage, the Huawei MediaPad X2 comes in two versions, with 16 GB or 32 GB, but both models also include microSD card support to add a maximum of 128 GB of extra storage. #Display, touch, and Android First of all, the display. The X2 comes with a 7-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels that supports up to 10 points and that is protected with Gorilla Glass 3 to make sure that no scratches or hits damage it. The quality of the display is impressive, and you’ll notice that from the second you see the lock screen, as it offers vivid colors, excellent contrast, and adjustable brightness thanks to a dedicated ambient light sensor that’s integrated into the front fascia. Huawei rates the display at 450 nits, which is kind of average, but sunlight readability is generally good, although we found ourselves using the X2 outside on very rare occasions. Touch response is excellent, and it’s very clear that Huawei made no compromises here, with the X2 coming with the same display tech available on the company’s flagship phones. Then, it’s the software that contributes to the generally positive experience that you get with this small tablet. The X2 is powered by Android 5.0 Lollipop but is customized with Huawei’s very own Emotion UI 3.0, which has received a few updates in the meantime. Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 EMOUI 3.0 interface If you’ve never used EMUI before, this is Huawei’s very own Android version that integrates not only an improved look for the operating system but also additional tools that could come in very handy at some point. But if you’re the kind of user who prefers a raw Android experience, you might consider this bloatware and look into ways to remove it. The best way to deal with this is to install a custom ROM, but this involves additional tweaking, and you need to unlock the bootloader first. EMUI was designed not only to be eye candy but also to provide additional functionality, but when coming from the traditional Android to the MediaPad X2, you might find it a bit more difficult to work with. But it’s all just a matter of time, and if you give it a chance, you could end up liking EMUI more than the stock Android. Have a look at the photo gallery to see the UI of the X2, but keep in mind that this is more or less just a restyled version of Android with some extra Huawei tools. The performance of EMUI is similar to stock Android, and it’s hard to spot a difference without benchmarks. And we’re not going to run any because, as always, we focus on the typical experience of an average user who just wants the device for common activities such as browsing, video playback, and light gaming. #Battery life Let us say from the very beginning that there’s no way you’re going to be disappointed with the battery life of the Huawei MediaPad X2. First of all, the official specs. The device comes with a 5,000 mAh lithium-polymer battery, which, according to Huawei, should provide you with 24 days of standby time and 3.5 hours of charging time. In terms of standby time, we couldn’t measure how long it takes for the battery to drain completely, but if you leave it in standby mode during the night, you barely lose 1 percent of battery life until dawn. As far as the recharging process goes, it indeed takes up to 4 hours, but this is only because the device comes with a pretty big battery, and no dedicated fast charge feature is being offered. “Two days of battery life, easily.” As for the typical usage, the Huawei MediaPad X2 went from 100 percent to 0 percent in approximately 3 days with mixed activities, including watching YouTube videos, sending emails, and browsing the web. Gaming dramatically reduces battery life, and so does calling, if you use it with a SIM or two - dual-SIM support is being provided, and this can lead to 1 day of battery life. Overall, if you want to use it as a tablet and mostly on Wi-Fi, then the results are impressive. If you wish to unleash its full potential and also use a SIM card for on-the-go Internet access, but also play games and watch movies continuously, you might need to recharge it daily. #Other features The hardware section is not done yet, as the X2 also comes with plenty of other features that you can read about below and that you’re going to find super helpful at certain times, or even more often, depending on how you plan to use the tablet. There are two cameras available on the X2, and they both provide good quality, although we find it a bit difficult to shoot photos with a tablet. But if you’re the kind of user who travels a lot and wants to take some pics every now and then, the 13-megapixel BSI (back-illuminated sensor) rear-facing camera should come in handy in the majority of lighting conditions while the 5-megapixel front-facing unit is good enough for video calls and conferencing. And since we’re talking about cameras, the 13-megapixel unit’s BSI is there to compensate for the amount of light coming inside the sensor and thus provide you with better pics regardless of the conditions. Of course, this is clearly an overstatement because the X2 is not by any means supposed to provide super high photo quality, but it takes decent shots in good lighting conditions. There’s also video support, including 1080p full HD video recording and video playback, as well as support for the majority of formats, including MPEG-4, 3GP, 3G2, RM, RMVB, ASF, FLAC, APE, MOV. For movie aficionados, the X2 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but also with DTS sound technology that should offer good quality when not using a headset. And truth be told, we’ve found the audio quality to be above the average, but still not iPad-like, for instance. It is somewhere close to the iPad, but improvements in this regard are still needed. The X2 come with several built-in sensors, including the aforementioned ambient light sensor, an accelerometer, proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, and GPS. And last but not least, in addition to Bluetooth 4.0 and a dual-antenna Wi-Fi, the device also features dual-SIM support covering most of the bands, but also offering LTE Cat6 and HSDPA+ speeds (300 Mbps DL / 50 Mbps UL and 42 Mbps DL / 5.76 Mbps UL, respectively). Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 what's in the box THE BOTTOM LINE Overall, the Huawei Honor X2 is one of the best choices in the 7 to 8-inch tablets. It has a pretty premium look, excellent hardware, and impressive battery life that easily tackles the demands of those looking for such a device. In most of the cases, customers of small tablets want one to watch movies, listen to music, or perform simple tasks such as browsing the web or sending emails while on the go. A 7-inch tablet comes to the rescue when a phablet or a bigger phone is not around and certainly appeals to those who still want to stick with a 4-inch phone, such as the iPhone SE. The Huawei Honor X2 is one of these tablets, and given its feature lineup, it’s one of the most compelling products on this side of the market. It’s hard to find a major drawback, especially given how much you have to pay for it, and the only complaint that people might have concerns software. There are users who aren’t necessarily the biggest fans of Huawei EMUI and would always go for the raw Android experience, but with some research, anyone can actually install custom ROMs on the X2 and make their own customizations. In the end, if you’re looking for a super light tablet that doesn’t disappoint in terms of looks, display quality, battery life, and is also reasonably priced, the Huawei Honor X2 is worth a look. And this is why Huawei is becoming one of the top device manufacturers in China and getting closer to Apple and Samsung worldwide.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (25 Images) #Huawei#Honor X2#Huawei tablet#tablet review#Huawei review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 (25 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Huawei Watch Review - A Touch of Class Huawei Honor 4C Review - Good on Paper but Nothing Out of the Ordinary Huawei P8 Review - A Gorgeous Yet Affordable Flagship Huawei Honor 6 Plus Review - Smartphone Photographers Are Going to Love It iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 25 photos    Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 New Apps Spencer: An intuitive and user-friendly software solution that allows you to access all the items that were typically accessible within the Start Menu of XP CopyQ Portable: Install-free clipboard manager that can be used in order to store multiple body texts, images and HTML content, and paste content whenever needed 4D: A fully-featured integrated development environment that allows you to create and deploy a wide range of applications that rely on databases and servers reWASD: Remap your Xbox One controller's buttons to perform keyboard actions with this handy application that comes with a user-friendly interface EMCO Ping Monitor Professional: Monitor connections to network hosts and generate reports about response time, activity status or ping statistics with this accurate application Mullvad: A virtual private network application that conceals your computer's real IP address, hiding your identity while navigating online CopyQ: Advanced clipboard manager to keep track of all recorded text clips, take notes, edit information, and paste clipboard content whenever needed Reader comments Load old comments   Apple Watch Series 2 Review more on: Apple Watch i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

It's been nearly five years since Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects." Photo by Andrew Burton for The Washington Post Video: Tim Cook on asking for advice Video: Cook: Jobs took praise, blame   Jena McGregor Washington Post     On a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook's fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson, a rose-gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone. That celebratory milestone -- Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he'll stop counting, as McDonald's did with its hamburgers -- aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant's chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On Aug. 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects." related advertisement video Tim Cook on asking for advice video Cook: Jobs took praise, blame   It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That's because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple's massive growth during Cook's tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike -- combined. But the iPhone has been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 percent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 percent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple's second consecutive quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth. Just after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of corporate America's most glaring spotlights. In two sprawling and self-reflective interviews -- one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks -- Cook described why the visibility of the job has been "shocking," how he's learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he's turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay). He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he's made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple's retail stores ("that was clearly a screw-up"). He fiercely defended Apple's tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone -- calling Apple's big presence in the smartphone industry "a privilege, not a problem" -- and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs's memory. "I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point," he said, "but I had convinced myself that he would bounce." Cook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favorite phrases -- many things are "deep," and Apple's mission is always its "North Star" -- he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he's quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be "lonely," that "I'm not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don't need any sympathy." That reflects how Cook's imprint on Apple has often been described -- making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI's request to unlock the San Bernardino, California, killer's phone. As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year -- all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost startups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain -- such as a reported car project -- appear to be years away. Some analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook's tenure is viewed. "Investors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture," says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. "I think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years." In the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years -- hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity. -- -- -- Q. Your first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, "I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change." Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view? A. The DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way -- enrich people's lives. And so our reason for being hasn't changed. Other things do change. But that's the thread that ties everyone together. Q. And what has changed? A. The obvious things are we have more employees. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We've broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision and I think a very good one. We've gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. Q. You've said you don't want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that? A. I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs -- they're not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don't think they're all that's important. There's an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. But I've never wanted to be the stereotypical CEO. I don't think I'd be very good at it, honestly. And I don't think for Apple that would in the long run be good for the company. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical. Q. You've got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 percent of the company's sales came from iPhone. Now it's close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that's cooling off? A. This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don't think there is another one. Q. Meaning? A. The global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number's been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I'm convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won't all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on Earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future -- like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't leaving home without it today -- you're really going to be connected to it in the future. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either. I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, "Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent." You know, the global economy's not that great right now. But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. Q. So to those who ask where's the next big, world-changing category for Apple -- it's sitting on this $231.5 billion pile of cash -- are you saying there's nothing like the smartphone? A. Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks -- look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, "Why aren't you making one?" Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those. I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else. I'm saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this "better days are behind us" thing. Q. Some analysts have said that. A. And it doesn't bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 -- this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing? Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can't grow any more from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we're coming down some this year. Every year isn't an up, you know. I've heard all of it before. And I don't subscribe to it because it's traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can't get large because you are large. Q. How do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company? A. In today's products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we've said it's going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products. And then, of course, the markets. We have done fairly well in China. India is fast-growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn't have 4G today. You can't enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer. And so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise -- huge. Geographies? India is one I've talked about, but there are others. Products? We purposely don't talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what's Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that's an "aha" for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we're not in today. There's not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area. Q. You succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes? A. To me, Steve's not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later -- six weeks later, whatever -- Q. Quickly. A. It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just -- I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. Q. What did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong? There's nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don't mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the 'hey, this broke, I'm mad.' Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother's or father's bedside before they died only because of it. Q. But what about in terms of running the company? A. I learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny -- social networking was taking off at that time -- and so a lot of the "love," so to speak, and interest from customers, I think, transfers to media interest as well. And so there's a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere. Q. You and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinized. How do you get used to that? A. You don't. You're both praised and criticized, and the extremes are wide -- very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up -- my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don't mean in a bad way. I don't mean that I'm callous and don't care. I think I'm a bit better today about compartmentalizing things and not taking everything so personally. That was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn't. Q. You've been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change? A. I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though -- for a company that's all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better -- it doesn't sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you're not making sure your carbon footprint isn't poisoning the place. Or that you're not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues. Q. Who were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay? A. I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn't achieve anything. They couldn't do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought -- I've got to do something. Q. And you speaking out would do what? A. I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it's not a limiter. It's okay to be. That it's okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it. It had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do. I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That's what I know, that's who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length -- multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it. Q. There are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It's mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice? A. Whoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn't mean I always do what they say. But I think it's incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you're sort of living in the echo chamber. Q. Who else? A. For the hearing [in 2013 before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple's tax practices], I've never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who's done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he'd be honest with me. He gave me great advice. I called up President [Bill] Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I'd not met him through a political connection. I'd met him through the foundation. And he was great. I went to Laurene, Steve's wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. And so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it's important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say. Q. With the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into? A. We knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on "what is right here?" People who were really key on this decision are folks like [senior vice president of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else. The light bulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too -- deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn't be assured. The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety. We knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy -- security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn't, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren't you unlocking this? Q. Did the FBI fight change how you view the mandate of your job? A. Customers should have an expectation that they shouldn't need a Ph.D. in computer science to protect themselves. So I think they depend on us to do some things on their behalf. So with that responsibility comes an obligation to stand up. And, in this case, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and not something that we wished for, wanted -- we didn't even think it was right. Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this. Q. You've talked about privacy being part of Apple's values. How personal is it for you? You're known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy? A. Undoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view. But in terms of privacy, I wouldn't link the two. There's a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it's really both of those -- not really the growing up in the South. Q. Back in 2009, you said, "We believe in saying no to thousands of projects." Name one product or project in the past five years you have put on the shelf. A. [Laughs]. I don't know if I want to do that, because it gives competition some heads-up about things. But be assured that we have. More than one. Because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things. We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well, and so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out. So more than one big thing has left the page. Q. When you look back, are there mistakes you've made that you've learned something from? A. Maps was a mistake. Today we have a product we're proud of. But we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn't our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That's important. It's the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them. Their pride or ego is so large that they can't say we did something wrong. And I think the faster you do that, the better -- change gears to something else. If you're honest, people will give you the benefit of the doubt. But if you have your head stuck in the sand and you just keep doing it, I think you lose your employees and your customers as well. Q. What else? A. I hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I'm not saying anything bad about him. He didn't fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I'm proud we did that. A lot of companies would have said, "Oh, he hasn't been here very long." But when you're looking at more time with [then] 50,000 people in retail -- that's a lot of people that you're affecting in the wrong way. That was a mistake. I probably have a long list. It's sort of a lonely job. The adage that it's lonely -- the CEO job is lonely -- is accurate in a lot of ways. I'm not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do. Blind spots move, and you want to not just have really bright people around you, but people who will push on you and people to bring out the best in you. People that amplify whatever you're good at. And then also the people who plug the parts that you're not and may never be. Q. What are you reading? A. I have two books going right now: One is the Bobby Kennedy book ["Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon," by Larry Tye] that just came out. The other is quite an old book. It's a Gandhi book ["Mohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth"] that I got interested in because we went to the Gandhi museum when we were in India recently. I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth. Q. When Steve handed you the reins, he said Apple had never had an orderly transition of CEO, and he wanted that to happen. What are you doing now to make sure the next transition, whenever it happens, is orderly? A. At the end of every board meeting, I discuss succession with the board because I might step off the wrong curb or something. We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with -- there's some really just superb talent in the company. Q. You've made more acquisitions at Apple, including the purchase of Beats, which was its largest ever, at $3 billion. At its current size, does Apple need big acquisitions like that to grow? A. Do we need them? No. But we always are looking for companies that have really talented people and great intellectual property, and when we find them we do acquire them. To put that into context, we've acquired 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years. Q. Do you think there will be more at that size going forward? A. I think we'll continue to acquire companies. If you're asking me would we do another one the size of Beats -- Q. Or bigger? You certainly could. A. We clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. But we'd only do it if it were great for Apple strategically. We don't acquire for revenue. So the essential for us is the talent and/or [intellectual property]. Those are the things that we optimize around. Now with Beats, we also got revenue. But it wasn't the purpose of it. The purpose was that we were going into streaming -- we'd already made a decision to do that. And we looked around at people who might be able to help us. I think we got Apple Music out probably a little sooner than we would have otherwise. It's infused some great talent on the team. Q. Sales in greater China were down 33 percent in the most recent quarter. Low-cost competitors like Huawei are getting into building premium phones. Let's talk about China. How much are you worried about competitive and regulatory threats there? A. We make our investment decisions based on long term. We have to report every 90 days because that's the rules, but it's not how we run the company. So as I look in the long term, I think China is an unbelievable market -- not only from a demand point of view and the revenue potential there, but also as a great source of talent. We have over a million and a half developers there. The reach is unbelievable. There are, sort of, speed bumps now with the economy. In a year-ago quarter, we were up 112 percent. So I think you have to back up and put it in perspective. If you look at it over a two-year basis, we were up over 50 percent in the quarter. Q. We were talking about getting advice from people before your first testimony on Capitol Hill. That hearing focused on the corporate taxes Apple pays. Apple is now awaiting a European Union ruling on whether you owe billions in back taxes, and corporate tax reform is a big election-year issue. Does either a Trump or a Clinton campaign give you or the company any hope that there could be corporate tax reform anytime soon? A. I think it's in the best interest of the U.S. to have corporate tax reform, regardless of which political party is in charge of the White House. Because if you look at it, the U.S. rules today are that international companies like us and many others can keep their earnings that they earn overseas overseas, and then when they bring them back it triggers the tax liability. What I've always felt should happen is that every dollar should be taxed immediately with no deferral. But as a consequence of doing that, you should have free flow of capital. What would happen is if a system like that were put in place, it should have more investment going into the United States. We're the only major country in the world that has a system like this. It's not good for the U.S., it's not good for the economy, it's not good for jobs, it's not good for investments. I think there's wide agreement to that in both parties, by the way. There's a difference of view with different people about how to fix it, but I think everybody agrees the current system isn't working. So I'm optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform. The U.S. needs to invest more in infrastructure -- so what would be great is, if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports. Q. What do you say in response to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz's comments on Bloomberg [television], where he called Apple's profit reporting in Ireland a "fraud"? A. I didn't hear it. But if anybody said that, they don't know what they're talking about. Let me explain what goes on with our international taxes. The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back. And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It's not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn't go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are. And so what we've said -- we think it's fine for us to pay more, because right now we're paying nothing on that and we leave it over there. But we -- like many, many other companies do -- wait for the money to come back. In the meantime, it's important to look at what we do pay. Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the U.S. is over 30 percent. We are the largest taxpayer in the United States. And so we're not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some. We don't have these big loopholes that other people talk about. The only kind of major tax credit that we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States. That's important to know. The second thing I would point out is we have money internationally because we have two-thirds of our business there. So we earn money internationally. Q. Do you feel picked on by the EU? A. You know, they haven't ruled yet. I don't know how they will rule. I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it. It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the EU is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody -- it wasn't something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law. And the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren't arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They're arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there's a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits. Q. Let's jump to Apple's future. You made some statements in the earnings call about artificial intelligence that got a lot of attention. Can Apple catch up with the AI efforts from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon? A. Let me take exception to your question. Your question seems to imply that we're behind. Let's take a look at that. We've been shipping Siri since 2011, and Siri is with you all of the time. Which I think most people would want an assistant with them all the time, whether they're at work or at home or in between or on the soccer field. You don't think of your to-do list, so to speak, only when you're in your kitchen. And the breadth of Siri is unbelievable. Increasingly, Siri understands things obviously without having to memorize certain ways to say things. The prediction of Siri is going way up. What we've done with AI is focus on things that will help the customer. And we announced in June that we're opening Siri to third parties, so third-party developers can now use Siri. So a simple example with that, whatever kind of ride-sharing app you might use, Uber or Lyft in the United States, you could just -- using your voice -- order the car. So third-party developers are writing tons of those that will be available to the public in the fall. And that's how we're broadening Siri in a huge way. But there are other things in there, like if you're typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just -- Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. The simple things, like do you drive to the airport? I haven't done that in a little while, but when I did, I always forgot where I put my car. Q. I just take a picture of the sign on the wall. A. But you don't even have to do that anymore because Siri will know where you parked. And so things like this really make a difference to people -- we do all of that while protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that information to the cloud, where we're maintaining it all, we do a lot of it on the device itself. So you're in control of your own data. Q. Do you have a concern about privacy as you push into AI? A. No. I think that talented people can come up with fantastic ways of using AI without violating privacy. There's a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy. Now there are some things that we do look at -- like if you buy songs, it's a reasonable expectation that we know what songs you buy because you buy them from us. And we use that information with machine learning to recommend other songs you might like. Q. What about augmented or virtual reality? A. I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about. [Laughs.] Q. You mentioned earlier about how much more difficult it is to keep things secret. There's been a number of reports about Apple's car project -- the people who are being hired or moved into place to lead it. It gets enough attention that it almost seems like an open secret. Why not say something about it? A. I can't answer a question about something we haven't announced. [Laughs.] Q. But there's just constant attention about it. Is it tempting to share any kind of details? A. We've always viewed that people love surprises. We don't have enough anymore in our lives. Q. Sometimes it seems like Silicon Valley companies are all blending together -- everyone's converging on the same big race. Self-driving cars, AI, Google is reportedly building a smartphone. In a tech industry where companies are trying to be "all things to all people," how does Apple's longtime philosophy of simplicity, and being very focused, move it forward? A. It's as important as it ever was. We're a bit larger today, so we can do a bit more than we could do 10 years ago or even five years ago. But we still have, for our size, an extremely focused product line. You can literally put every product we make on this table. That really is an indication of how focused it is. I think that's a good thing. Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level -- personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking. Q. Apple has really ramped up spending in research and development. One analyst noted your [incremental] R&D is now greater than the 14 largest automakers, combined. What's the most exciting technology out there to you right now? A. That one I don't want to answer, because it would give too much of an insight into the things we're doing. But we have ramped up R&D because we are heavily investing in the future -- both in current product lines and things that aren't visible as well, including in services. In due time, some of those things will be visible. But there will always be other things that will replace those things that are invisible. Q. Any final reflections on your tenure? Moments that stuck out at you? A. I've got the best job in the world. I think about my day and weeks and months and years -- I put them in three buckets: people, strategy and execution. I sort of move between those on a daily basis as to where I put my time. I always think the most important one of those is people. If you don't get that one right, it doesn't matter what kind of energy you have in the other two -- it's not enough.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, 2016)   Hayley Tsukayama Washington Post     All tech companies face a constant demand to innovate while also producing huge profits and sales growth. That means that Apple, the world's largest company, is also one of the few that can post a $13.6 billion profit and still miss expectations because the product it's sold a billion of isn't selling quite as well as it once did. Those sounding the alarm bells over Apple point to a few factors, chief among them that the smartphone market is slowing down and growing "saturated" -- a term analysts use when they want to say that most people interested in buying a new smartphone probably have one already. For Apple, which makes nearly two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, it looks like that could be a big problem. Of course, Apple chief executive Tim Cook is aware of this. It doesn't really bother him. "This is actually a privilege, not a problem," Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post. Talk about turning lemons into lemonade and bugs into features. Cook's optimism -- some might say denial -- is not particularly popular, even among devoted Apple watchers. Some are even saying that Apple's crested the peak and is on its way back down. The bears continued to roar after the company reported that its revenue had dropped from the previous year for the second quarter in the row. That just doesn't happen at Apple, or at least not at the Apple we've come to know in the past decade. Yet even that doesn't seem to faze Cook. "I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, 'Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent.' You know, the global economy's not that great right now," Cook told my Post colleague Jena McGregor. "But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth." He believes that, over time, "every person in the world will have a smartphone." And he's willing to wait for it. In that way, Cook is an outlier in a go-go-go tech world. His accomplishments are on a long-term scale. They take investment. They're about refinement, about maturity. As chief operating officer, Cook was credited with what some could arguably call Apple's greatest but most boring accomplishment -- the massive manufacturing and distribution chains that made it a household name in Beijing, Baltimore and everywhere in between. So Cook's ears are closed to the criticism Apple gets for not being as flashy or open about its moonshots as its competitors. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, for instance, are all very vocal about the spaghetti they throw at the wall. Sure, Apple may try a wearable here or a cheaper smartphone there, but it's not running headlong into anything. "Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to," Cook told The Post. Further, he said, "Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level -- personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking." There's a touch of (dare we say?) Jobsian hubris in that. But it does speak to Cook's own brand of innovation, which is in setting foundations rather than breaking ground. He cements success. It's no coincidence that, as Apple's hardware divisions see slower growth on the horizon, its services division is seeing more investment. In Cook's mind, the addressable market for the iPhone is 7 billion -- and he knows those people will constantly need things to watch, listen and do on their phones. That's great for a company that's looking for stability. It's great for a firm making sure it has enough money to stoke the future flames in research and development, which has grown under Cook's watch. But the slow innovation philosophy can be hard to jell with a company vocabulary and culture that's steeped in superlative. So much of Apple's appeal has been due to its dramatic history, its deep lows that made its highs all the more breathtaking. The truth is that Tim Cook could probably keep Apple humming along forever. The question is whether the rest of the world can ever accept an Apple that isn't run by one of the crazy ones.

Because Apple's courting the business market. Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a "computer." (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, 2015)   Hayley Tsukayama Washington Post     Apple, it seems, would like to see more tablets in briefcases next year. A new report from MacRumors cites noted Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says there will be three new iPad models in 2017 -- including a brand-new iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a "computer." There's a good reason to sell the iPad Pro as a "computer" rather than a tablet. Tablets aren't selling nearly as well as they used to be. And while computers are also in a sales slump, there is growth in the "detachables" category -- devices that blend the tablet and the traditional laptop and have, well, a detachable keyboard. Casting the iPad Pro this way is important to Apple to catch the eye of businesses and business people, who may want something light but still functional for work. It is a bit of a departure from Apple's past. Steve Jobs, Apple's late co-founder and chief executive, famously disliked courting businesses. Per ZDNet, in 2010, Jobs told then-Wall Street Journal writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher: "What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go 'yes' or 'no,' and if enough of them say 'yes,' we get to come to work tomorrow. That's how it works. It's really simple. With the enterprise market, it's not so simple. The people that use the products don't decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions sometimes are confused." Given that Jobs created Apple to make personal computers -- a counter to the computing grip IBM and Microsoft had on offices -- his disdain for the sector makes sense. But the business market has changed in ways that blunt Jobs's old criticisms. He didn't like that enterprise devices weren't personal; that's no longer the case in a BYOD world. Even when there's a set list of devices approved by a workplace, it almost always includes an iPhone, an iPad, or at least some iOS-friendly apps. And businesses are a great market for the tablet and the "post-PC" vision that Jobs envisioned with the introduction of the iPad. With a more mobile workforce, the iPad and the iPad Pro -- along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and other 2-in-1 devices -- make a lot of sense for moving from hotel room to living room to board room. It must also be said that the enterprise market isn't the only thing that's changed since Jobs vocally dismissed the sector. Apple has, too. Chief executive Tim Cook has made enterprise a key focus for Apple. And while some consumer enthusiasm for Apple's products has ebbed -- Target reported its Apple sales were down 20 percent across the board this quarter -- businesses are still buying enough to make Apple's enterprise play a $25 billion business. In his recent interview with The Post's Jena McGregor, Cook specifically highlighted Apple's enterprise market saying: "We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products." This is an area, of course, that could fire up old rivalries -- in fact, Microsoft has already released a commercial calling Apple's "computer" claim into question and comparing the iPad Pro unfavorably to its own Surface Pro 4. The commercial raises some good points. The iPad Pro is still functionally a mobile device and lacks features such as multiple ports that traditional "computers" (and, of course the Surface Pro 4) do have. Then again, Apple has a line of laptops that only have one port, so there's really no hard and fast definition of "computer"- and Apple's clearly working hard to stretch the definition enough to fit the iPad Pro under the umbrella. --- Videos: Apple ad Microsoft ad Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Andrew Kelly/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you're thinking of buying a new iPhone right now, don't do it! You could save yourself a small fortune by delaying that purchase until September, when  Apple is set to unveil the next models of its world-conquering smartphones. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will almost certainly be unveiled in early September. The rumor mill has been grinding for months already, suggesting the new  iPhones might be water-resistant, have Touch ID built into the screen, feature an updated home button, and  come without a headphone jack. There's little doubt they'll sport improved cameras and faster performance, but it's best to take the rest of the rumors with a healthy pinch of salt. You always pay a premium to get the latest tech. But whatever Apple unveils this fall, last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are still going to be great smartphones, and we're expecting to see a healthy discount for both. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Saying that any new device gets cheaper the longer you wait to buy it may sound like stating the obvious, but we've also been digging into our research. We'll tell you when and how far the iPhone prices will fall, so you can get an idea of whether it's really worth waiting. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 After the Apple Announcement, It's Cheaper to Buy Last Year's iPhones When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. It has a tier pricing system, so the latest phone is $649 to buy outright or $199 on a two-year contract, and you can buy last year's iPhone for a one-time payment of $549 or $99 on contract. The iPhone Plus models work exactly the same way, but start at $749 to buy outright and $299 on a two-year contract. When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. If you want to buy a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, whether you buy on contract or pay the full price up front, it will be $100 cheaper as soon as the next iPhone is announced. T-Mobile has disrupted the standard two-year contract model by offering any iPhone model without any money down — by simply splitting the cost of the handset across 24 months. So, you'll pay a higher monthly fee, but it will cover service and the iPhone's price tag. The other carriers have followed suit, but be careful to calculate the full price you'll pay on any deal before you pull the trigger. Older iPhones Are Cheaper Still In the past, Apple has also dropped an extra $100 off the next model down, so when the iPhone 6s was announced, the iPhone 5s was made available for no upfront fee and monthly installments totaling $450. However, the release of the iPhone SE has muddied the waters a little here. It effectively replaced the iPhone 5s and is being offered for a one-time payment of $399, or for nothing up front with an installment plan. We don't expect to see any further price drops on the iPhone SE. The question is whether the iPhone 6 will drop to $449 and be made available for nothing up front with installments, which is a definite possibility. Retailers and Carriers Offer Deeper Discounts Retailers and carriers sometimes offer aggressive discounts to try and draw in customers, but iPhones tend to hold their value very well, so you have to watch out for them. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s at Boost Mobile and $50 off the 64GB model from  eBay sellers in February, five months after release. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s five months after release. It was a similar story with the iPhone 6, which dropped about $40 after seven months and then fell by as much as $150 in September 2015, when the iPhone 6s was unveiled. In February of this year — 17 months after release — the iPhone 6 dropped to $380 at Boost Mobile, and by May this year it was $399 at  Walmart. Plus-Sized Deals Are Harder to Find The iPhone 6 Plus was Apple's first larger smartphone, and it took a long while before we saw any discounting. It was eight months before we saw an eBay seller offering a $90 discount, but it dropped by over $200 after around 19 months. And by May this year, it was $499 at Walmart. We haven't seen any discounts of note for the iPhone 6s Plus yet. Some eBay vendors have dropped $50 and $150 off the price of the higher-capacity 64GB and 128GB models respectively, but that's it so far. (The 128GB 6s Plus still costs a whopping $800 even at $150 off.) These discounts might be slightly bested when the iPhone 7 debuts, but we probably won't see much deeper discounts than that for quite some time. Carriers Entice Consumers With Buy One, Get One Free Deals One eye-catching iPhone 6s deal that was available just three months after release was  AT&T's buy one, get one free offer. It wasn't advertised for the iPhone 6s, though that was eligible. You had to add a second line and commit to 30 months, but it was possible to claim bill credits for the full price back after three months. (This deal is no longer available at AT&T.)  Sprint is still offering a deal like this on the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus, if you're willing to sign up for a second line with the carrier. Deals on the iPhone 7 If you're already an iPhone owner, then you'll find some attractive deals on the new iPhone if you're willing to trade in your old handset. It's also worth seeing what you can get in the secondhand market, because iPhones hold their value better than any other smartphone. You will generally make more by selling your iPhone directly than you will for trading it in, and you can put that extra money toward the new one. It's likely to be at least six months before we see any significant discounting on the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But if you and your partner both want a new iPhone, then it's worth watching out for buy one, get one free offers. This article first appeared in DealNews.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update Apple iOS 10 Beta 7 Now Available For Developers And Public Testers Adie Pie First Posted: Aug 20, 2016 03:30 AM EDT Apple introduces several useful features in its new iOS 10. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Apple is putting everything on high gear to ensure that the upcoming iOS will arrive without a hitch. The Cupertino-based company is doing so by speeding up the releases between the beta testings. How To Get iOS 10? According to BGR , Beta 7 is available for anyone with a developer account, or anyone that is already registered in the beta testing program. In order to download the new testing, those capable need only to go to Settings → Software Update. The entire thing is only 60MB to acquire, which only means that the update is a small one. On the other hand, if without iOS Beta 6 or lower, developers need to go directly to the Apple Developer site in order to get the update. The same thing is applicable for users that are only enrolled on the public beta testing - however, can only acquire until the 6th beta testing. What Is New In The iOS 10? Reportedly, Apple has a new lock screen coming with iOS 10, as Tech Crunch reports. The new lock screen is expected to have a new notification feature, complete with live widgets. In addition, the Photo app will receive an overhaul, allowing it to use facial recognition, deep learning categorization and automated album-creation. The other application that is receiving a major renovation is the Messaging app. Users will able to place effects on messages, view link previews and third-party extensions, as well as get creative with an emoji feature. Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone application are also expected to receive their own respective face lifts. Unless Apple strays away from its regular schedule, iOS will be made publicly available in the next few weeks, or at least before the year ends. But if the speed results of beta tests are anything to by, added to the fact that the recent test likely only has small fixes, it is possible that the iOS 10 will be made available soon.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science  • Technology •  Computer Industry Internet Automotive One News Page > Technology > The iPhone 7: What We Know The iPhone 7: What We Know Saturday, 20 August 2016 by Graham Pierrepoint While Apple have always courted media attention with the release of their new handsets and tablets, they have courted similar controversy over the years based upon a number of choices they have made to the design of their flagship iPhone. With the iPhone 7 allegedly due for release this September – earlier than many will have predicted – some sources are claiming that the latest model of Apple’s smartphone may not be as game-changing as it would have you believe. While iPhone 7 will hopefully be more efficient than its predecessor, a handful of design changes to the smartphone may not be enough to convince some buyers – apart from die-hard Apple fans, of course. Rumored design changes include the incorporation of a waterproof shell – which may well come in handy – alongside a sleeker design and alleged removal of the traditional headphone port. This alone will supposedly make the new model considerably slimmer than the iPhone 6S – but will it be enough to convince the average smartphone user to make a purchase? The handset is also said to monopolize on a 1080p display, edge-to-edge, meaning that it may well be the sharpest and most user-friendly model on the market to date. With higher RAM and greater efficiency also on the table, Apple appears to be doing enough to entice current iPhone 6 users to make the change to the latest model – but with rumors on the backburner that an all-glass iPhone 8 could be on the cards in future, will Apple users hold out for the next one? It’s not entirely certain. For one, the iPhone 6S suffered from battery issues which many users are hoping will be picked up on with the launch of the iPhone 7. While the battery in the iPhone 7 is said to be larger in size, will it necessarily offer greater efficiency? The phone is also said to offer easier home screen access and wireless charging – making for a somewhat feature-intensive model that could well benefit from a smarter charger to allow for smarter features. In any case, if you are a follower of Apple it is highly likely that you will be excited for the launch of the iPhone 7 – particularly if you are interested in seeing what changes have been made upon the previous generation. While we may not know all the facts just yet, some sources are claiming that the iPhone 7 just isn’t ‘different enough’ – but we will only know the true score upon its release next month.

to Gallery Apple co-founder Mike Markkula and his wife, Linda, first purchased 8,000 acres in the bucolic Carmel Valley in 1982. Over the years, Markkula grew Rana Creek Ranch to 14,000 acres, creating the largest landholding among the golden, rolling region just 15 miles inland from the dramatic beachscapes of Carmel-by-the-Sea. Now, this Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who funded Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the early days of Apple and went onto become the company's second CEO, is selling this stunningly beautiful ranch for $45 million. The real estate offering comes nearly three years after the property was listed for $59.95 million, but never sold. The ranch is massive, its land largely untouched and pristine. To get an idea of the size consider that at 22 square miles, it's only a little under half the size of the city of San Francisco. Among its grassy, oak-studded hills and meadows, you'll find an airstrip, a private lake, two barns, a riding arena and a 300-head cattle operation — everything a modern-day cowboy could ever need.  At the heart of the property is a luxurious 5,000-sqaure-foot, ranch-style home with a "cowboy" bar where Markkula likes to play cribbage, according to the Wall Street Journal Street. Guests can stay in a separate wing or in the two-bedroom guest cottage.  ALSO Incredible views, a theater and 18-foot sliding wall equal modern luxury in Sausalito Nearly 90 percent of San Franciscans cannot afford a median-priced home in the city Rent increases slow dramatically as increased construction catches up with demand The Markkulas' permanent residence is in Woodside and the couple originally planned to retire in Carmel Valley but have found they spend more time in the Bay Area and are ready to pass on the property to its next owner. Who will the next owner of this swath of the Golden State be? A family looking for a quiet getaway, someone with agriculture dreams? A developer who will build homes on its 12 legal parcels? Listing agent Bill Mitchell of Carmel Realty Company says there are endless opportunities here, but Markkula would especially love for a conservation group to purchase the property to preserve the land and its natural beauty.  Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Apple Stores will no longer be called Apple Stores. Instead, these “community hubs” will simply go by Apple *insert store’s location*. For example, the newly opened Apple store in World Trade Center is now just Apple World Trade Center. The tech company is looking to reframe the idea of its stores just being a place to purchase Apple products and accessories. There will be things like 6K video screens, greenery, and even the dismantling of Genius Bar setups in some stores to put in more seats. This change is spearheaded by Apple’s Senior VP for retail Angela Ahrendts. She was quoted saying at the unveiling of Apple Union Square, “The store becomes one with the community.” Some of the other changes you can expect in Apple’s stores will include a more boutique feel to them with seasonal displays that will showcase various products. This time, they’re showing off iPhone photography accessory. It goes to show Apple is looking to sell you a lifestyle instead of just products.

Overall sales of mobile phones contracted by 0.5 percent with only five vendors from the top 10 showing growth. Among them were four Chinese manufacturers (Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK Communication Equipment) and South Korea’s Samsung. Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year. All mature markets except Japan saw slowing demand for smartphones leading to a decline in sales of 4.9 percent. In contrast, all emerging regions except Latin America saw growth, which led to smartphone sales growing by 9.9 percent. Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Company 2Q16 Units 2Q16 Market Share (%) 2Q15 Units 2Q15 Market Share (%) Samsung 76,743.5 22.3 72,072.5 21.8 Apple 44,395.0 12.9 48,085.5 14.6 Huawei 30,670.7 8.9 26,454.4 8.0 Oppo 18,489.6 5.4 8,073.8 2.4 Xiaomi 15,530.7 4.5 15,464.5 4.7 Others 158,530.3 46.0 160,162.1 48.5 Total 344,359.7 100.0 330,312.9 100.0 In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung had nearly 10 percent more market share than Apple. Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets. Apple continued its downward trend with a decline of 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Apple sales declined in North America (its biggest market) as well as in Western Europe. However, it witnessed its worst sales decline in Greater China and mature Asia/Pacific regions, where sales declined 26 percent. Apple had its best performance in Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe regions in the second quarter of 2016, where iPhone sales grew more than 95 percent year on year. Among the top five smartphone vendors, Oppo exhibited the highest growth in the second quarter of 2016 at 129 percent. This is due to strong sales of its R9 handset in China and overseas. Features such as an anti-shake camera optimized for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditized smartphone market. In terms of the smartphone operating system (OS) market, Android regained share over iOS to achieve an 86 percent share in the second quarter of 2016. Android’s performance continued to come from demand for mid- to lower-end smartphones from emerging markets, but also from premium smartphones, which recorded a 6.5 percent increase in the second quarter of 2016. A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with the Galaxy S7, introduced their new high-end devices, but Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium smartphone ranges with more affordable devices. “Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology,” said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. “Facing a highly commoditized smartphone market, Google’s focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV.” Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Operating System 2Q16 Units 2Q16 Market Share (%) 2Q15 Units 2Q15 Market Share (%) Android 296,912.8 86.2 271,647.0 82.2 iOS 44,395.0 12.9 48,085.5 14.6 Windows 1,971.0 0.6 8,198.2 2.5 Blackberry 400.4 0.1 1,153.2 0.3 Others 680.6 0.2 1,229.0 0.4 Total 344,359.7 100.0 330,312.9 100.0 Editor LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Where Will Black Friday Shoppers Go?

First, you need to open your phone You can install the Light Kit on the iPhone by turning off the phone and opening it. You can use the provided pentalobe screwdriver from the kit and unscrew the screws at the bottom of the phone. The screws are found on either sides of the charging port. There is a suction cup in the kit, put it on the lowest part of the screen and pull up on it. A small gap will be created under the screen at the bottom. Place the pry tool into this gap and turn it slowly to separate the screen from the casing. Then, pull the screen back to 90 degrees and not beyond that. Its optional to remove the screen There's no necessity to remove the screen from the casing, but it will make it easier to remove the battery. To do so, you need to unscrew the screws holding down the metal plate over the screen's cables. Then, remove the metal plate and use the pry tool or your fingernail in order to disconnect the cables. The battery and Apple logo have to be removed You need to remove the screws that hold the metal plate near the bottom right of the device over the cable connecting the battery. Then, remove the metal plate. It is pretty hard to disconnect the battery. Use a butterknife or another small and flat metal object. Wedge it under the battery slowly to separate the battery from the glue. Place the battery aside and use the pick or your fingernail to remove the pieces of tape holding down the metal Apple logo. Installing the Light Kit Insert the light kit that the LED is placed into the new Apple shaped hole in the place of the logo. Put the tape that was removed earlier and just hold it down. Place the battery. There is a tiny cable coming from the top left of the earpiece. You need to scrape away the tape on top of it till the three metal connectors are exposed. Place the screen back Reconnect the cables that connect the screen and the motherboard, if you had opted to remove the screen from the iPhone's motherboard. Attaching the Light Kit Use a small sticky sponges from the light kit and place it at the top of the flimsy part of the light kit cable and form a T shape. Then, connect that part of the cable to the exposed connectors that are seen at the back of the screen. Use another sponge in the kit and stick it to the right of the cable vertically. Then, stick the electrical tape in the kit over all in such a way that there are no exposed connectors. The final touch Now, you need to reconnect the battery to the motherboard and replace the metal plate on top. Then, screw the metal plate and tape down the lower part of the LED cable. Place the screen back down and press on the sides slowly to snap it back. Make sure you don't crack the screen. Put the two screws back and turn on the phone. You can see the Apple logo lighting up and also adjust the brightness of the screen to change the LED brightness as well. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Would You Spend $249 on a Levitating Apple Watch Charger? August 20, 2016 Christine Torralba 1 Comment There’s a new Kickstarter project for a levitating Apple Watch charger currently making the rounds online. But if you’re curious to know about its price, the charger will be sold at $249. If you think that’s a lot of money for a charger, you can pledge as a backer on the Kickstarter campaign so you can get one for as low as $159. Since the Apple Watch is built to charge itself inductively, the LIFT charger was designed to take things to a different level; literally. Instead of typical chargers, the LIFT charger suspends the charger from the ground with the help of magnets. As a result, the Apple Watch appears to be floating freely in mid-air as it charges itself on the dock. According to the designer, Levitation Works, the design of the LIFT charger was patterned after Porsche. Built with an aluminum and ceramic body, perhaps the only thing missing on the LIFT charger was a Porsche logo. The materials used were specifically chosen for suitability and non-conductivity. On the side of the unit is a practical touch along with a built-in battery. When the charger is not being used to charge an Apple Watch, it can be used as an optional levitating light. Even though the unit costs a pretty sum, there has already been a number of people who have pledged to the Kickstarter campaign. And with 34 days left, the LIFT charger has already hit its $44,000 goal and has gone over by up to four times. Would you be interested in the charger?   Source: 9to5Mac   Tags: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Charger, charger, LIFT, LIFT Charger About Christine Torralba View all posts by Christine Torralba → ← Apple seeds iOS 10 beta 7 to developers, sixth public beta Apple may have been talking to Lyft about potential acquisition → Aaron Britt Interested in the charger: absolutely. Interested in the price: absolutely not. I’d take the $249 and just buy another watch. Or I’d buy a different style charge buy at a cheaper price. Though I must say, the levitating charger is pretty damn cool.

By Rida - 20 Aug '16 02:23AM Leaked images of cases and renders of the phone show the device could gain acceptance if dual-camera, smart camera, additional RAM, storage, new chipset and iOS 10 are considered   Apple -"The ruler of International smart phone market" has disappointed some users with the battery life and camera bump. Though, the back camera bump is not a big concern for the users who are more concerned with the battery life. Users who are addicted to social networking sites needs a high battery backup mobile phones and Apple being the top brand in smart phones has disappointed the high end online users. Will Apple increase the thickness of its upcoming new smart phone? The answer is "No". The thickness of the new iPhone is much similar to the current one and size of battery will remain the same. The chances of battery life of the new upcoming iPhone may be inclined or remain the same. Users !!!  Do not be disappointed. Apple has come up with the new battery technology which will allow users stick to their smart phone more than twenty four hours in a day. There is a MIT spin off company who is currently working to enhance the best battery life in Apple phones and other devices. Unlike, the other promising battery technologies, this new system is heading towards mass production. So called SolidEnergy systems, started experimenting on anode-free lithium metal batteries, which emerged to be a success. These batteries are twice dense than lithium-ion batteries, safe and long lasting. According to bgr, " With two-times the energy density, we can make a battery half the size, but that still lasts the same amount of time, as a lithium-ion battery", said CEO of SolidEnergy and inventor Qichao Hu. "Or we can make a battery the same size a s lithium-ion battery, but now it will last twice as long" SolidEnergy systems has already demonstrated their battery in comparison with iPhone 6s lithium-ion battery and the results were quite happening. The company is planning to bring the same system of battery in drones in November, to smart phones and wearables in coming twenty seventeen and cars in future. For the batteries to operate safely at room temperature, SolidEnergy systems has come up with solid and liquid hybrid electrolyte solution. Will this success be incorporated in upcoming devices of Apple? The answer comes only with its release.     Share ( 0 ) Tweet ( 0 ) TAGSiphone, battery life Copyright © 2016 News Everyday Fun Stuff See More << Sailor Moon Takes Part On Preventing Sexually Transmitted Disease Through Custom-Made Condoms 'One Piece' Chapter 847 Spoilers, News and Update: Straw Hat Pirates Will Suffer, Sanji Escapes Wedding Capcom's Monster Hunter is in the Works!

Yarn Harlot Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Post navigation ← Previous Next → Away with me Posted on August 19, 2016 by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee Ah, Friday, where the heck did you come from? This week sped by, as I tried to get caught up, and was thwarted at a few turns. Most notably, I smashed the everloving daylights out of my phone on Wednesday evening. (A stumble in the dark, and I prevented a fall with an outstretched phone, which in retrospect was pretty stupid. I heal and have health care. My phone, not so much.) The day dissolved into a journey to the Apple Store, which turned into a wait at the Apple Store while they repaired the phone, and a period of three hours in which I had no phone, which was odder than I’d imagined. It reminded me of my mother in a power outage. She’s the smartest person I know, but outages are her kryptonite. She goes from activity to activity – “Balls, the power is out and I can’t put the TV on. Never mind, I’ll listen to the radio. Dammit, the power is out, the radio doesn’t work. I’ll do a little ironing. Son of a gun, that won’t work either. Never mind pets, let’s plug in the kettle and have tea….” You see how it goes, and that was me with no phone. I decided I’d listen to podcasts while I waited, remembered I had no phone, decided to listen to an audiobook, remembered I had no phone, decided to check my email instead…. I was the living embodiment of my mother in the dark. At one point I realized that without a phone I didn’t even have a clock, and approached a stranger. “Excuse me, do you have the time?” She was holding her phone, and looked at me like I’d just asked her if she could help me shear an alpaca, right there in the Eaton’s Centre. “The time?” She goggled, and I had to tell her that Apple was holding my phone hostage, and I don’t wear a watch because, you know. I use my phone for that. She checked her phone, told me the time, and then asked me when I was getting my phone back. Her response was a bizarre mix of incredulity and sympathy, and I could tell, as she clutched her phone a little more tightly, that she was imagining what it would be like. “Wow” she said, when I told her it would be a few more hours. “I know” I sighed. “It’s a difficult time.” A cleverer knitter would have seen the phone thing coming, and perhaps taken a sock or  printed out a nice reliable paper pattern to take with her, but as it stood, I’d handed the PDF version of my pattern over to the Apple people, and couldn’t even knit. I did try for a while, using previous repeats as a guide, but it was slow and silly. In the end I bought a dress with birds on it, and then a book – since I’d given my current book to the Apple people in the form of my phone.  It all ended well (except that I sat in something yucky on the subway, then I stepped in gum, and a bird crapped on me and some dude with a questionable grasp on reality yelled at me on the sidewalk) and I got home, and decided to essentially end it all nicely with a glass of wine (2) and a nice long knit. That knit (now that I had my pattern/phone) back again, finished the Ghazal Cowl - Well, it’s almost finished, I’ve pulled out the provisional cast-on I did at the beginning, and I just have to graft the two halves together, but I yesterday must have been some sort of sacrifice to whatever force of destiny decides how my days go, because when I’d done all the repeats I could, and ended on the right row, this is how much yarn I had left. That there is a winning game of Yarn Chicken, and a perfect ending to a knit using handspun. When I’m done the graft I bet there will be less than 10cm of remaining, and that was worth stepping in gum for. (I am less sure about the phone.)  Tonight I’ll graft, and then block, and then I guess I have to make another decision. I’m off on Sunday with the indomitable Jen and her two girls, to whom I am an honourary Auntie, and we’re headed far, far up north for some Canadian fun and games. Tents, canoes, camping and hunting for fireflies. A Thelma and Louise roadtrip – if you add in two little kids. There should be tons of knitting time (the drive is 8 hours, for starters) and I’ll be packing along lots of wool. We are going far enough North that summer is already gasping her last there, so it will be all fires, and sweaters, and hunts for fairy houses through the woods. Now, a few Karmic Balancing gifts, just to make sure my luck holds? You bet. (PS. I’ve added a teaching gig in Calgary at Pudding Yarn the weekend of September 18th to the roster. There’s spots, if you’d like to join us.) First up, Terri Major (friend of the show, lovely lady) has free patterns for three of you. Any three patterns for three knitters, your choice from her shop. Pictured is the lovely Rose Arbour Baby Blanket, and I’d get that for sure, but Krystal L, Kristin and Lee T will somehow choose. Next, a trio of beautiful cases from Grace at the aptly named “Grace’s Cases“.  I love her stuff, and these cases are so pretty – of the first, Grace says “This new Basic “Anything Goes” Spillproof Needle Case has just two pages and is perfect as an expansion case or a starter case.  It is Multi-purpose in that you can store a wide variety of items.  Page 1 has 7 snap pockets that can hold either fixed circulars or lots and lots of cables Page 2 has 13 graduated slots that can hold dpns sizes 0-9, regular or interchangeable hooks up to 6″ in length, or interchangeable tips sizes 2-15. Generous notions pocket included in cover.”  Better than that, it’s bike themed.  I hope that Kelly M loves it. Second “The Petite Lovely Tote. A great size to use as a project bag / bucket, or perfect for shopping at your local yarn store.  We kept it simple and clean on the inside and out. No pockets, no padding, nothing to catch on things – the space is all yours!  Measures 10” tall, 10” wide, 5” deep at base – Perfect for knit night projects!!” and also bike themed! I bet Ruth D has somewhere to take it. Last, but certainly not least “Cupcake Bags are divided project bags specifically designed for color work or TAAT projects. The lower portion of the bag is divided into two sections to keep your cakes from tangling and the upper portion has room for project storage.  Roll the top down to form a divided yarn bowl! Or attach a carabiner or clip to the included loop to hang it anywhere. Dual drawstring top closure.” and that’s going to Sarah E. If you’d like your own, Grace’s shop is here.  From The Mountain would like to donate 1 skein of worsted weight yarn in a natural colour, and several one-skein pattern options.  Their yarn is 100% cashmere and is hand spun in Afghanistan by women who are earning a fair wage for their work.  After over a decade of conflict, many women in Afghanistan have been left as heads of household, but with very few safe income opportunities.  Spinning for From the Mountain offers them a way to earn income and be home with their families at the same time.  I hope that Chris A loves it, and where it comes from. Amy has a pretty gift, bless her generous heart, a kit for Mrs. Beaton’s Wrist Warmers. She’ll happily mail that sweet little package off to Emily W. Brenda, another pretty awesome knitter, went into her stash and came up with two skeins of IndigoDragonfly merino-silk 4-ply sock in “Partying is Hafla Fun.” She’ll be mailing that off to Julie B, and I know they’ll love it. Jan has an adorable bag that she’ll be sending off to Muriel T.  It’s a “Tour de Forest” bag (how appropriate!) If you can’t live without one of your own, her shop is here. (I might not be able to live without one.) Phew! I’ve emailed all the lucky knitters concerned, and I’ll try to get another batch up tomorrow. While I decide what knitting comes camping. Maybe something brown. That’s always a good camping colour. Save This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee.

Reply ↓ Rams on August 19, 2016 at 8:55 pm said: Yarn chicken. A phrase so perfect you will never get credit for having synthesized it. Like that law that states that no principle is ever named after the person who identified it… Genius, though.

Reply ↓ Elaine on August 19, 2016 at 9:08 pm said: Hmmm, what to knit, what to know — I know! Aren’t you going to need a new sweater for a trip to some festival in New York in, oh, about — 55 days? Of course, that is a very long time and it isn’t like you are going to need to do anything else between now and then. . . . Reply ↓ Cara on August 19, 2016 at 9:27 pm said: Joe’s Gansey! It’s the perfect time to put a real dent in it. Reply ↓ Joni on August 19, 2016 at 9:36 pm said: When I was a kid there was a huge storm where many trees fell and there was power out all over town, including our house. After several days, late one evening the guys from the power company, who had been working pretty much 24/7 made it to our house to take care of the neighbor’s tree that fell on the power lines between our backyards. It was dark, the driveways were narrow and they were having trouble getting the trucks set up so that the lights were in the right place. Without thinking, my Mom offered to turn on our back spotlights, which were used when my brother & friends wanted to play basketball in the back yard. The head of the work crew looked at my Mom and said “Lady, if you can do that, I’m going home” and then chuckled. Sounds like our Mom’s would have gotten along Reply ↓ Diana on August 19, 2016 at 9:43 pm said: Can you share the pattern for the cowl, or is it elsewhere on your blog? I took to following your blog a few months ago, and I’m, hooked! Started out with the one row handspun scarf, which of course I did NOT spin, and I have made at least 50 of these scarves. Super easy and a no brainer when I am running on fumes. Love your stories and your life so far removed from mine in Iowa. Thanks Stephanie! Reply ↓ HeleninBoise on August 19, 2016 at 10:27 pm said: Ghazal – its on Ravelry. Reply ↓ AlisonH on August 19, 2016 at 9:59 pm said: Phones can be fixed or replaced and sometimes healing doesn’t come so easily. I think you made the right choice in that tumble. Awesome on that Yarn Chicken win! And I love all the Karmic Balancing Gifts. Reply ↓ Jo-Anne on August 19, 2016 at 10:17 pm said: I think the campfires are going to depend on whether there’s still a fire ban in whichever northern community you are headed for, but add in the endless sky of stars, and orange harvest moons, and you’ll have an amazing adventure. Reply ↓ christine m east of toronto on August 20, 2016 at 12:50 am said: 8 hours…. EIGHT HOURS NORTH OF THE CITY?! I get nervous travelling anywhere beyond Muskoka! Courage to you, brave women. I know it will be beautiful and wild and wonderful, the type of memories the children will cherish a lifetime. Godspeed, friend! Reply ↓ Renee Anne on August 20, 2016 at 12:52 am said: I know how you feel about the phone. Toward the end of last school year, I pulled my phone out of my pocket on my way to pick up Little Man from school, and my phone slipped right out of my hand, landed flat onto the road, and shattered the screen. ::sigh:: It took a couple hours to get it fixed, I was a bit at a loss…I could still *use* my phone but it had to be in a plastic bag so I didn’t wind up with glass shards in my fingers. Luckily, I was able to get it fixed within a reasonable timeframe. They wanted me to come in three days later for an appointment. I took my chances and did a walk-in, wherein it was fixed that day. It still sucked. Reply ↓ Lani on August 20, 2016 at 2:10 am said: I’ve seen photos of you with a tablet (iPad?) at airports and on planes, so you needn’t have been sans clock, pattern or reading material while your phone was at Apple’s hospital. Batteries save the day during power outages. Perhaps your mum could get a transistor radio (yes, they do still exist) to help her through the next one, and reading a hardcopy book can be done using a flashlight/torch. Live like a pioneer! I bet you’ll survive just fine without an internet connection on your Thelma and Louise trip up north. It’s good to disconnect now and then.

It meant no knitting for a long time and even now I can only knit for short periods. The Apple repair is much quicker and easier on the spirit! Glad you’re okay! Reply ↓ Daisy on August 22, 2016 at 12:02 am said: Yep — that’s how I fractured my scaphoid three years ago. It was 18 months before I could knit for more than 10 minutes at a time. Reply ↓ juujika on August 22, 2016 at 2:17 pm said: Ouch. Yeah, scaphoid breaks are always a bit dicey. Reply ↓ AlisoninOz on August 23, 2016 at 11:09 pm said: My mum broke her wrist three times like that. Eventually she learnt not to try and save herself and to use her walking frame all the time. Not that I’m suggesting you need a walking frame dearest Ms YarnHarlot, but I have learnt from my own experience not to try use my hands to stop a fall. I get vertigo and have the odd fall myself Reply ↓ Kath on August 20, 2016 at 6:58 am said: I live in Sault Ste Marie ( which is about 8 hours from Toronto, depending on how you drive!) I hope you’re in the area for Monday, not just Saturday and Sunday, cause I don’t think you’ll like the weather we’re having right now. But it will definitely be cooler than Toronto.

About two weeks ago, I spilled my tea on my laptop (both horrible for the laptop and a horrible waste of my tea). I was without a computer for a week. When you have most of your life on your computer, you feel like you’re missing a limb without it. I suppose your incident is a good reason why a knitter should never be without yarn and needles for a pair of vanilla socks!

That cupcake bag is brilliant since I do socks two at a time on two circulars. I am glad you won yarn chicken! I just lost on Saturday. Three very short rows and a bind off left. Expensive yarn. Lace pattern so I had to do the full repeat or it would look seriously odd. Heavy sigh. I am now doing a sheep toy with a plentiful supply of super cheap worsted. Sometimes you need to not worry about running out, like right after you lose the yarn chicken game! Reply ↓ Lani on August 22, 2016 at 3:52 am said: Go to Ravelry and search for that yarn in people’s stashes. I lost at yarn chicken last month; a Raveler had it listed in her stash and happened to have, in addition to some full skeins, just enough left from an earlier project so that I could finish my shawl. I hope you have such luck. Reply ↓ Daphne on August 22, 2016 at 1:18 pm said: Envy is here – one of the joys of heading north at this time of year is picking wild blueberries beside the highway. Yum!

I haven’t had a chance to read in a few months because, well, Life and stuff. All I could think was “Meg can’t get married! She is still a young teenager.” (Or maybe not but in my mind? Yes. She is.) Then I read Hank is a teenager. I am sure you have mentioned it before but after reading Meg got married, this particular piece of information FLOORED ME! How dare he be a teenager! He is only 5! (Again, only in my mind, I know.) I cried while reading, as I occasionally do. When I read about Erin, my heart bled a little. It hits close to home in a multitude of ways. I can’t imagine taking the ride that you do for a worthy cause. It is amazing and heartfelt. Thank you for sharing your life and talent. I love the humor that you add. I mean, who hasn’t played yarn chicken and lost? Who hasn’t talked themselves out of a knitting issue, KNOWING it really wasn’t going to work out but yet, still somehow managing to convince themselves it would? I appreciate how human you are. You are an experienced knitter (to say the least) and teach those of us that are just trying to figure it out how to do it and you mess up. It makes me feel more confident in my knitting. Thank you for being you; for blessing us with your talent and humor and giving us a glimpse of your life. Some days it gives us a reason to remember no one has a perfect life. We are all human.

My phone, not so much.) Are you crazy?!? Ok, so it’s inconvenient going without a phone. At least you can wipe yourself in the bathroom, and get a cup of tea. These things might not be a given if you fall on your hand. Even … you might have a functioning phone but be unable to use it because you broke your hand/wrist/elbow/whatever. Ugh. I hope you change your priorities and favour your hand over your phone again next time. And one of the other commenters brought up something I had not thought of, but would be dangerous for your family and neighbours: you might not be able to knit. For … months … even over a year. If unlucky, maybe … for ever. (Dangerous for family and neighbours because … Steph … not able to knit == dangerous beast.) Stay well. Reply ↓ Brenda J.

Yes, I have that hand-cranked radio … it’s all right. Try to get an easier to operate one … maybe one that cranks by a pedal or something. Maybe I should get my friend to add an attachment to my treadle sewing machine that can keep my xxx-cranked radio operating : -) I read a while ago about a better generator for third-world countries, it doesn’t require two hands and is very power-efficient. Those ones that you turn in a circle with one hand while holding the radio with the other hand 1) require two hands and 2) are not that power-efficient.

Rare Apple 1 is up for auction, and bids are topping $270,000 Re/code 20/08/2016 Ina Fried © Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns    A rare Apple 1 computer, possibly even a prototype, is up for auction on Charitybuzz; bids have already topped $270,000 with six days remaining. The computer differs from many of the production units in ways experts say make it likely the unit is one of the earliest of the Apple machines. “It’s the rookie card, for lack of a better word,” Apple expert Corey Cohen told Recode. The Apple 1 up for auction contains original manuals, a cassette tape with BASIC programming language and other accessories and documentation. Cohen said most of the early machines were hand finished by either Dan Kottke or Steve Jobs, and there’s a good chance this one was put together by Jobs. “Dan doesn’t remember assembling this one,” Cohen said, saying he talked to the early Apple employee about the machine up for auction. The BASIC cassette, which Kottke did create, contains the words “Good Luck” written in his handwriting. Cohen said the original owner of the unit is not known. The present owner bought it back in 2000 for $18,000, then the going rate for such machines. While it’s hard to say how much the machine will fetch now, other Apple 1s have garnered as much as $900,000. A portion of the proceeds from this auction are set to benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Arizona.

A few days ago, the Japanese automaker Nissan announced the arrival of its first vehicle integrated with Apple CarPlay technology. This new technology allows iPhone users to use their smartphone applications through the interface of the vehicle, so they can stay connected without neglecting their driving. Original Image: “Apple CarPlay” bysmoothgroover22, used underCC BY 2.0license, viaFlickr. You will be able to find this technology in the 2017 Maxima, making it the first model of the Japanese brand to adopt Apple CarPlay in Mexico. One advantage of this interface is that it allows users to access their contact list, receive and make calls, listen or send written or voice messages, navigate through the maps and even use third-party applications. Original Image: Still taken From“Apple CarPlay”, bywww.apple.com It is important to note that to use the Apple CarPlay you must have an iPhone; this new platform will be added to the already existing NissanConnect – currently featured in other models like the Nissan March, Altima, Sentra, Maxima, NP300 Frontier, NOTE, Versa – which allows drivers to navigate, make calls and use some applications like Google Places, Facebook and Twitter. According to David Marquez, senior manager of Vehicle Connected Services of Nissan, the integration of the Apple CarPlay to the Nissan Maxima opens a huge window of possibilities that are intended to facilitate the navigation and interaction of people with their smartphone without having to take their hands off the steering wheel, and keep attention on the road. Apple CarPlay is compatible with iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models, and is available in all versions of the 2017 Nissan Maxima.

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US AT&T, Apple, Google to work on ‘robocall’ crackdown Reuters | August 20, 2016 AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. WASHINGTON: More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the US government to crack down on “robocalls,” automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a “scourge.” AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the “Robocall Strike Force” that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a “Do Not Originate” list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. “This scourge must stop,” Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. “The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,” Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue “due in large part to industry inaction.” Stephenson emphasized “the breadth and complexity” of the problem. “This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,” Stephenson said. “Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.” The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. “We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,” Stephenson said. “We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.” Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had “preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.” Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. “We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet,” she said. “Nothing by itself is going to do it.” Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd (BB.TO), British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and US Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign “phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

However, the suppliers have rejected the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant’s request, citing that they could not risk their reasonable profits at this time. DigiTimes published a story earlier today to reveal what had transpired between Apple and its iPhone components suppliers. According to the supply chain monitor, Apple asked its Taiwanese suppliers — save for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Largan Precision — to make some adjustments on their quotes for the parts and components they supply for the iPhone 7 handsets.  Apple reportedly sought to have the price points lowered to as much as 20 percent, since mainland China-based parts suppliers offer the same products at lower price points. Unfortunately, Apple’s request was met with resistance by Taiwanese downstream parts suppliers Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and other companies under the Foxconn Group, citing that their reasonable profits will be compromised.  Related Stories Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 7 As iPhone 7 Launch Date Looms Why Apple Ditched ‘Store’ Moniker From Its Retail Outlets DigiTimes pointed out that Apple’s request did not make sense because Taiwan-manufactured and China-manufactured components are on different levels in terms of quality. Furthermore, it was also revealed that Apple asked for lower quotes though its order volumes dropped by 30 percent compared to last year’s volumes when it was manufacturing its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices. Meanwhile, Apple excluded TSMC and Largan Precision from its request because there are no alternative sources to the products they make. Apple Insider reported that TSMC is the manufacturer of the A10 chip, while Largan Precision is the supplier of the iPhone camera modules.  The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are slated to debut on Sept. 7. Both devices will not have headphone jacks, but they will come with fast charging capability and enhanced features. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to sport a dual-lens camera system.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Adelanto man arrested on suspicion of reckless driving and child endangerment Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 5:38 PM Aug 19, 2016 at 5:38 PM By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A 43-year-old man was arrested Thursday evening on suspicion of reckless driving and child endangerment, officials said. At approximately 4:29 p.m., Deputy Verral from the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station was in the area of State 18 Highway and Rancherias Road when he observed Chester Farris, 43, of Adelanto, driving a black motorcycle at speeds over 100 miles per hour. Additional deputies and Sheriff’s Aviation responded to the area and a traffic stop was attempted, but Farris continued driving at a high rate of speed, officials said. Farris failed to stop for red lights, violated other traffic laws and entered a residential neighborhood where a pursuit was not initiated for the safety of the public, according to officials. Deputies located Farris traveling north on Apple Valley Road later as he failed to stop for a red light and did not yield to children in the crosswalk. He then traveled west on Hwy 18 from Apple Valley Road, officials said. Shortly after, Farris pulled into the KOA Campground off of Stoddard Wells Road just north of Hwy 18, where deputies arrived on scene and took him into custody. Farris was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment and failure to yield and his motorcycle was impounded due to his arrest and reckless operation, officials said. Farris has a bail of $100,000 and is scheduled to appear in court Monday afternoon at 12:30 p.m., court records show. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station at 760-240-7400. Callers wishing to remain anonymous may call the WeTip hotline at 800-782-7436 or visit www.wetip.com.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley animal shelter takes in hundreds Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 4:45 PM Aug 19, 2016 at 4:55 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Amid evacuation orders issued to some 82,000 residents affected by the still-raging Bluecut Fire, staff and volunteers at the town’s animal shelter helped keep nearly 450 displaced animals out of harm’s way. Within 48 hours of the start of the fire in the Cajon Pass, which had scorched 37,002 acres as of noon Friday, the Apple Valley Municipal Animal Shelter became an around-the-clock hub of security and generosity, as locals and people as far away as Orange County answered the call for donations of food, bowls, cat litter and cleaning supplies. Animal Services Director Gina Whiteside said the shelter’s primary purpose is to care for the community’s animals, which she described as the most vulnerable of residents. “We’ve taken in 302 dogs, 111 cats and 25 other animals such as lizards and guinea pigs that were evacuated due to the fire,” Whiteside said. “These displaced pets will be loved and cared for until they are reunited with their families.” Staff and volunteers worked tirelessly to construct emergency holding pens in the staff parking lot and along the interior courtyard of the shelter to accommodate the influx of animals. Teams are now working in shifts to feed and water all of the animals, sanitize surfaces, change litter boxes and walk dogs. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press on Friday that one dog taken in by the shelter ran from a burning home in the Phelan area and into the arms of Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mike Mohler. The family that owns the dog was separated from the animal when they were evacuated from the home, according to a CBS LA report. The dog was treated for minor burns and is being cared for at AVAS, Martin said. “We don’t have a name on the dog, but he is here,” Martin said, adding that the shelter has only addresses for a large number of the evacuated animals. “We need to start putting owners’ names to the animals so that we know who to give them to when it's time to send them home.” Martin also addressed a Facebook post that led some to fear for the safety of animals that were in the shelter’s care prior to the the displaced animals being taken in. The post called for fosters to take in animals or the shelter would have no choice but to euthanize, according to Martin. “We contacted that poster,” Martin said. “She eventually took the post down and the town responded to a number of comments related to the post.” In addition, fellow Town spokeswoman Charlene Engeron said AVAS’ goal is to provide love, attention, food and water to all the animals in the shelter’s care. “No animals of any kind are being euthanized to make room for the evacuated pets,” Engeron said. Whiteside added that the community is encouraged to adopt animals during normal business hours to give the shelter more space for evacuated animals. The shelter is accepting monetary donations only for the continued care of the animals at this time. Financial contributions can be made in person, or by credit card by phone at 760-240-7000 ext. 7555, or via PayPal at animalservices@applevalley.org. Additionally, adult volunteers will be needed for the next week or longer, especially for the late shift from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m, according to the town. Contact 760-240-7000 ext. 7555 to offer availability. The same number may be used by owners looking to reunite with pets that were displaced by the fire. The shelter will be open this weekend from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Injustice Edition coming soon? Posted: 22 Aug 2016, 00:27, by Cosmin V. Share Tweet Share Tags : Samsung-Samsung+ Android-Android+ The Galaxy Note 7 seems to be the flagship of the moment, at least until Apple or another major company comes out with another great piece of technology. Naturally, Samsung is well aware that it must take advantage of the hype created by the Galaxy Note 7's launch, so it should surprise anyone that the South Korean company plans to release a customized version of the phablet. Just like it did with the Galaxy S7 edge a while ago, Samsung is reportedly readying a similar Injustice Edition model. Several pictures of the said device have just emerged in China, so the smartphone does seem to be real. It remains to be seen when exactly the Galaxy Note 7 Injustice Edition will be introduced by Samsung, although there's a chance we're going to see this one in the next couple of weeks. Aside from the obvious visual changes on the outside, there will be some improvements under the hood as well. Rumor has it, the unannounced Galaxy Note 7 Injustice Edition will pack 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage. Dual-SIM support is another nice feature the smartphone will offer, as seen in the screenshots leaked. Some of you might already be aware of the fact that this particular version of the Galaxy Note 7 with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage is expected to go on pre-order in China on August 26. However, if the Injustice Edition will be made available worldwide, that hardware configuration won't remain exclusive to the Mainland for too long. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Injustice Edition will be available in black color, but a gold-flavored Bat-Signal will be etched on the back side. Price-wise, it will probably be slightly more expensive than the regular version of the phablet, but we won't know for sure until Samsung makes it official.   Popular galleries Careful: this video link will crash your iPhone!

The amount of background apps touchwiz runs consume too much battery, RAM and CPU. If you allow the CPU to run at full speed, battery life will halve or worse. To anyone who thinks it doesn't impact real life performance, see this : https://youtu.be/3-61FFoJFy0 posted on 22 Aug 2016, 12:53 0 Reply 21. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10550; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) How do you know? Do you own a Note 7? Because I own one. So this is what I have noticed. I have notice that it consumes slightly more battery vs the Note. So I checked the battery settings. So the display is using 36% of the battery on the Note 7 vs using 29% on my Note 5. based on my display setting. So the display is using more power. Could it be because of the fact the display supports HDR content? Iris Scanner uses power. For now I turned it off. Depending on carrier, your modem may use more power. While on T-Mobile with my Note 5, the network is ore congested and everything is slower. being slower, the phone works harder to do things over LTE. So that mans more drain. I have the Exynos Note 7 and my wife has the VZW 820 versions. I did my own battery rundown test using a 2560x1600 video I copied from my Tab S and played it until they both died. The Exynos version last me 75 mins longer vs the SD. But I don't see any issue. What is your gripe? Because its a Galaxy? For it feature set I expect the Note will have a higher drain v a phone that has no features whatsoever. I've been playing with ti a lot so I can't judge battery-life. Right now I see I will have to charge it at night. Once I get use to everything and trun off what I don need and finish completely making my changes, I can see then. But I did check out the new app power mode and when I reduced the resolution to FHD, I gain 3+hours of usage. what other phone has this? None I am aware of. You guys are just jealous your expensive phone won't even 1/2 as good. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 13:02 0 in response to #21 in response to #21 Hide Reply 24. sarcastic_nerd (unregistered) The article clearly states that even after closing all running apps, the note was running double the processes as a oneplus 3. That's enough to conclude. And I'm not going to waste my money on a note 7 just to test this. There are resources on internet that can do that for me. "So the display is using more power. Could it be because of the fact the display supports HDR content?" What drug are you on? Or you're this stupid normally? P.S. : I moved from an S6 edge to a oneplus 3. It's a much better software experience. Samsung has the greatest hardware on the planet and gimps it with the worst software ever to get really terrible experience. Anandtech and now XDA are just proving that right. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 13:40 0 in response to #21 in response to #21 Hide Reply 27.

Some people will only use the phone with what it came with on the phone. For anyone who installs apps, their performance with vary because we aren't going to install the same apps.

And it's not my claim since I didn't make the video. Anandtech did cold runs with common apps and the note 7 was really slow compared to other phones, much slower than the S7 too. You can live in denial and justify your purchase all you want, the truth is that note 7 is slow AF. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 01:43 0 Reply 15.

I think you're just mad because you don't have a Note 7. Its the phone that needs to be beat and the fact is, no phone is gonna beat it this year. But I'm curious, I see other flagships that do lag. So that means they shouldn't be called flagships. Right? Or are you going to be a hypocrite?! Wait - Here is a laggy "flagship". So that means this shouldn't be a flagship based on YOUR terms. Right? If not then you're a hypocrite. It also seems you're saying, is a phone is not a flagship; its ok for it to lag? Wait. All computers experience lag of some type. No matter how many processors or cores. How is that even a point? Oh I know. You cant find anything really bad to say about the Note 7, you just resurrecting some old bullshiiiit! I'm enjoying my new toy. Maybe you should get a job so you can afford to buy one since you mommy can't buy one for you. Because that si how you sound. "I want a knew phone but mommy can't buy me one.

(Image: Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) According to figures from Gartner, 344.3 million Android smartphones were sold worldwide in Q2 2016. This makes for a 4.3% increase in sales year on year. Samsung is still the undisputed market leader, selling no less than 76.7 million handsets in Q2 with a 22.3% market share. This puts the South Korean tech giant way ahead of Apple (44.3 million, 12.9%). Samsung is followed by three Chinese manufacturers: Huawei (30.6 million, 8.9%), Oppo (18.4 million, 5.4%) and Xiaomi (15.5 million, 4.5%). Note that Apple is the only one of the top five phone makers to see a fall in sales, dropping 3.7 million and 1.7 percentage points of market share in the space of a year. As for operating systems, Android and iOS alone account for 99.1% of smartphone sales. Google's Android is still storming ahead of Apple's mobile OS, shipping with 86.2% of smartphones sold worldwide, compared with 12.9% for iOS.

The 'Robocall Strike Force' group is a coalition of more than 30 tech firms and telecom companies, including bigwig US wireless carriers AT&T and Verizon. The coalition is chiefly focused on cracking down on automated phone calls -- the so-called 'robocalls' -- which include unsolicited prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers as well as automated text messages. The official announcement of the coalition of companies that have joined the 'Robocall Strike Force' group was made on Friday by AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson -- who is also the Chairman of the coalition -- at the first 'Robocall Strike Force' meeting at the FCC, in Washington DC. According to the Reuters report, the companies that have joined the 'Robocall Strike Force' are expected to provide the FCC with "concrete plans" to crack down on automated phone calls by October 19, 2016. The plans which the coalition will provide to the FCC will detail how to "accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions" for combating robocalls.
