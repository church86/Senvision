The S&P 500 also posted a record close. Technology stocks bounced back from their biggest back-to-back decline since December. Wall Street also braced itself for the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy announcement. Fred Imbert | @foimbert Tuesday, 13 Jun 2017 | 4:13 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Market opens higher amid 'Fed drift'    Tuesday, 13 Jun 2017 | 9:40 AM ET | 03:57 U.S. equities closed higher on Tuesday as large-cap technology stocks came back from their biggest two-day decline since December. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced about 90 points to hit intraday and closing records, with 3M and Goldman Sachs the most gains. Apple also contributed gains to the 30-stock index. The S&P 500 gained about half a percent on its way to a record close, with information technology and materials leading advancers. Shares of Apple, Google-Parent Alphabet and Tesla all rose, pushing the Nasdaq composite 0.7 percent higher. "We don't want to dramatically overweight the [tech] sector, but we still want to participate in it," said John Traynor, CIO at People's United Bank. "You're seeing some good top-line growth in these names." Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said the Nasdaq 100 futures had taken a respite Tuesday before the bell "from the pullback that has characterized the technology sector in the last two days." "There is room to short-term oversold territory, so we would assume the pullback still has a hold, although it is likely to mature in the next few days," Stockton said. Technology stocks have easily outperformed this year, with the S&P information technology sector advancing 17.6 percent. By comparison, health care — the second-best performer in the S&P — had risen 12.1 for 2017 entering Tuesday's session. The Nasdaq completed a 2.31 percent two-day pullback on Monday as valuation concerns around the sector escalated. Brendan McDermid | Reuters A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York. A survey of fund managers released Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed the Nasdaq at the top of the most-crowded trade list. The survey also showed that 84 percent of fund managers believe the U.S. is the most overvalued equity market. Still, it's "important to note that the last two days have shown little to no real signs of weakness with pullback attempts in S&P, DJIA holding and rallying back to unchanged," said Mark Newton, managing partner at Newton Advisors, in a note. "The Tech selloff looks nearly complete in the short run with XLK ... down to weekly support near trendlines from last November," he said. Investors also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve as the central bank kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Investors largely expect the central bank to raise interest rates by a quarter point. Market expectations for a June rate hike were 99.6 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Investors will also look for clues about how the Fed plans to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed opened that can of worms a few meetings ago," said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. "At this point, there could be a dual-policy approach with raising rates on one hand and reducing the balance sheet on the other." In economic news, the National Federation of Independent Business' (NFIB) small business optimism index came in unchanged at 104.5 for May. Meanwhile, U.S. producer prices remained unchanged last month as energy costs recorded their biggest decline in more than a year, suggesting inflation pressures were easing after rising at the start of the year. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average rose9 2.80 points, or 0.44 percent, to close at 21,328.47, with DuPont leading advancers and General Electric lagging.

The Nasdaq advanced 44.90 points, or 0.73 percent, to close at 6,220.37. About three stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 825.52 million and a composite volume of 3.252 billion at the close.

 Here are the top 100 companies' revenue and profit visualized Jeff Desjardins, Visual Capitalist Jun. 13, 2017, 7:33 PM 3,079 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook Getty Images/Andrew Burton Just over a month ago, we published a very tidy data visualization that summed up the top 50 companies in the world by revenue, based on data from Forbes. But, just looking at revenue numbers doesn’t give a full picture on how these companies compare – and many investors care much more about a different performance metric: profit. Thankfully, today’s data visualization from Ishtyaq Habib shows the top 100 biggest companies by market value, but uses circles to represent both the revenue and profit for each company. There’s also an interactive version of the same chart here as well, which highlights the specific numbers for each company highlighted. APPLE = A MONEY-MAKING MACHINE The first noticeable difference in this version? It’s that Apple is unparalleled in its ability to make money. In fact, Apple’s 2016 profit of $45 billion is far bigger than any other company, including Berkshire Hathaway ($24 billion), JPMorgan Chase ($24 billion), Wells Fargo ($22 billion), Alphabet ($19 billion), Samsung ($19 billion), Toyota ($17 billion), Johnson & Johnson ($16 billion), or Walmart ($14 billion). The only companies that can compare with Apple were Chinese banks like ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, or China Construction Bank, but in many ways these state-owned enterprises are on an entirely different playing field, anyways. Also impressive: Apple’s profits are bigger than the revenues of massive companies like Coca-Cola ($41.5 billion) or Facebook ($27.6 billion). MARGINS, SCHMARGINS Unfortunately, not every company can make a 21% profit margin on $217 billion of revenue like Apple. Other organizations need to rely on razor-thin margins and volume to make things work. Walmart only brought in $14 billion of profit off of a whopping $485 billion of revenue – a margin of just 2.8%. Meanwhile, fast-growing Amazon was in a similar boat with margins of 1.7%, largely provided by its wildly successful AWS service. Lastly, it is also worth noting that some on the list did not make a margin at all. These are mostly companies that are suffering from the challenges of down cycles in natural resources. Chevron and mining giant Glencore, for example, were two of the Top 100 Companies that both lost money in 2016, while BP essentially broke even.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple 17 iOS 11 features you can get on your iPhone right now if you jailbreak Chris Smith @chris_writes June 13th, 2017 at 6:32 PM Share Tweet Apple released iOS 11 into the wild more than a week ago, and you can try the first beta on compatible iPhones and iPads right now. The update brings over a variety of features, including new tricks that will make the iPad look more like a computer than ever before. But some of these iOS 11 features were already available on jailbroken iOS devices or on Android long before Apple unveiled them. Don't Miss: Tim Cook finally confirms Apple is working on self-driving cars Every time a new mobile operating system launches, the inevitable comparisons with existing apps and rival platforms start to appear. That’s right, everybody in this business is inspired by competing products, among other things, so everybody copies everybody. With that in mind, don’t be surprised to see some things on iOS 11 that will seem familiar. They were already available in jailbreak apps — the kind of apps that Apple doesn’t allow in the App Store — or on Android. So it’s likely that Apple saw them and came up with its own solutions. A more stable iOS 11 beta version should arrive next month, which should be released to the public looking to test it out, not just developers. YouTube channel EverythingApplePro looked at 20 features that Apple swiped from jailbreaks or Android. In iOS 11, you can customize the Control Center, browse files with the help of a brand new app, record all the screen action, move multiple apps at a time, take screenshots and edit them immediately after that, read QR codes, assign different gestures to AirPods, and translate languages. These are some of the features inspired by jailbroken apps or Android. Check out the video below to see the original apps and their iOS 11 correspondents. As it is now, iOS 11 beta 1 is rather buggy, but there is a way to experience some of these jailbreak-inspired iOS 11 features on your iPhone right now. You just have to jailbreak the handset and install these unofficial iOS apps. We would advise caution when jailbreaking and installing apps from unverified sources. The video proves that Apple should encourage developers to create challenging apps that will never be allowed in the App Store, and support jailbreaks, at least in some unofficially capacity. As for an iOS 11 jailbreak, don’t get too excited just yet. It’s unlikely we’ll see one until the first final iOS 11 version rolls out.

Cook said Apple was ploughing resources into developing technology to control driverless vehicles , although he refused to rule out the Silicon Valley firm building its own car at some point. The Apple boss spoke as shares in his company and other US tech firms came under pressure this week amid investor concerns that a sector-wide boom is losing steam. Cook attempted to restore faith in Apple’s ability to strike out into new territory by giving his most detailed comments yet about a car venture that has been shrouded in secrecy. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” said Cook in an interview with Bloomberg TV . “Clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars. There are others. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects.” He added: “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.” When reports of Apple’s interest in cars started to emerge in the media, it was initially thought that the company was going to challenge the automotive giants of Detroit, which are racing to build their own self-driving cars . But the spectrum of Apple’s ambitions narrowed last year after Apple veteran Bob Mansfield was put in charge of the programme, dubbed Project Titan. While Cook was cagey about how Project Titan will evolve, his comments suggest that Apple’s primary focus is on AI technology that could be sold or adapted for use in other industries. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do, but we are being straightforward that it’s a core technology that we view as very important,” said Cook. David Bailey, a motor industry expert at Aston University in Birmingham, said Apple’s ability to come up with user-friendly products, such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod, could give it an edge over rivals. “They can offer a number of things such as the software systems that enable the tech to function but also making that extremely friendly for a passenger in a way that other tech companies haven’t been able to do.” He added: “Autonomous systems can open up mobility to people who don’t use cars but it needs to be accessible and user-friendly. Apple’s expertise is in that area, they have a knack of making something intuitively very easy to use.” Dr Nick Reed, academy director at transport research group TRL, said Apple was smart to focus on technology rather than going head-to-head with car manufacturers. “It would be difficult for them to revolutionise the production of cars but in use and operations, there’s a great opportunity. Their strength is in integration with digital lifestyle – a seamless experience, whether it’s at home, on your desktop, or your smartphone or now in your car.” One analyst said Apple may have abandoned plans to build a car after realising it was lagging behind Detroit-based rivals. “They were slow to begin testing autonomous systems, and they now have a considerable innovation gap to close,” said James Hodgson of tech consultancy ABI Research. “Previous attempts by Apple to address personal mobility and automation have been marred by high turnover in specialist staff.” Referring to reports that Apple had attempted to form alliances with two German carmakers, Hodgson added: “In addition, previous talks with BMW and Daimler allegedly broke down over data protection and control. It seems Apple has decided that developing their own autonomous system is preferable to partnering.” Silicon Valley’s other behemoth, Google parent company Alphabet, has also shifted the focus of its driverless vehicle plans towards technology for installation in cars built by established automotive firms. The company’s Waymo division confirmed on Monday it is phasing out its “Firefly” bubble car and has instead sought to highlight its partnership on the Chrysler Pacifica minivan. YooJung Ahn, lead industrial designer and Jaime Waydo, lead systems engineer for Waymo, said in a blogpost : “Now that we’ve moved to our next phase – letting members of the public use our self-driving cars in their daily lives – we’re ready to retire our fleet of Fireflies and focus on integrating our latest technology into vehicles like our new self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan.” Tech Wrap Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Apple imposes 30 per cent tax on China’s digital content creators 2 Alibaba is Asia’s No. 1 company as value soars to US$360 billion 3 Think WeChat can’t get any bigger in China?

Panel images have recently surfaced on the web that boast an edge-to-edge screen, a glass back and a vertically-aligned, dual-lens rear camera. Included in the same report is a line-up of panels that claim to be of the iPhone 7 upgrade handsets – the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus.   If the rumors surrounding Apple’s iPhone 8 are true, then the latest leak could provide users with the first look of smartphone's design. Panel images have recently surfaced on the web that boast an edge-to-edge screen, a glass back and a vertically-aligned, dual-lens rear camera IPHONE 8 RUMORS  Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing  - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging  - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'   - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition  -Premium model will cost $1,000 Apple’s iPhone 8 has been the talk of the web since launching its iPhone 7 model last September – a handset that was deemed far from a home run. Many iOS users had seen the smartphone as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6. The disappointment has put an immense amount of pressure on Apple to impress them with its 10th-anniversary smartphone. And users have come to demand a slew of technology, specifically the edge-to-edge screen. Also shown in the image of the 'iPhone 8' is an area at the top that appears to house the front-facing camera, microphone and senors - a longstanding speculation.  The latest images do seem to coincide with all of the major rumors other leakers and Apple experts have suggested, but the image highlights one aspect that could deem it a fake, AppleInsider reported. There appear to be extra markings on the back panel that have never been seen on any iPhone such as CE, which is the ‘Conformite Europeene’ safety logo. But the components were said to have been on there way to Chinese manufactures, so it is hard to say if they are reputable or not. Included in the same report, is a line-up of panels that claim to be of the iPhone 7 upgrade handsets – the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Apple users beware!

Share this article Share 1k shares However, the panels are wrapped in what appears to be shipping packaging, so it is difficult to make out the details. The latest leak may highlight the outer design of the iPhone 8, but separate set of images had surfaced last week that highlight what Apple’s iOS 11 will look on the new smartphone – showcasing Apple Pay, Apple and Lock screen. The components were said to have been on there way to Chinese manufactures, so it is hard to say if they are reputable or not. Included in the same report, is a line-up of panels that claim to be of the iPhone 7 upgrade handsets (pictured) – the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Also includes in the report was information that had suggested Apple had started mass producing components for three iPhone models.  The news was uncovered by DigiTimes (via MacRumors), which spoke to sources about Apple’s 2017 smartphones. The anonymous Apple connections told the paper that the firm is set to launch two iPhone updates– one will be 7.4 inches and the other 5.5 inches – alongside the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. The updated variants have been speculated to boast a reinforced glass chassis and an aluminum metal frame. And the iPhone 8 is believed to have the same chassis and an unspecific ‘metal frame’. The latest leak may highlight the outer design of the iPhone 8, but separate set of images had surfaced last week that highlight what Apple’s iOS 11 (pictured) will look on the new smartphone – showcasing Apple Pay, Apple and Lock screen  It was rumored in April that Apple had put in a massive order of 70 million OLED panels from Samsung, so the latest report that the firm is gearing up to begin production may not be too far from the truth. DigiTimes also released a set of renders that provides a stunning look at what it could look like. The renders do paint a picture of many the smartphone's design rumors, but the main focus is on the look of iOS 11, which is set to be released sometime this fall. The concept drawings also stick to the most talked about change in the handset, the Touch ID, which is shown embedded underneath the display, and not on the back like previous renders have shown. However, a leak from last month showed a PowerPoint slide show that stated the sensors was on the back of the smartphone – so it is difficult to determine which source is right. The latest renders highlight what the new control center will look like on and edge to edge screen (left), and other features such as Apple's new HomeKit (right) and the Do Not Disturb (middle) function DigiTimes has also noted that wireless charging is a possibility, as the ‘schematics show a large ‘pad’ on the inside of the upcoming device.’ And facial and iris biometric security could also be added to the handset, allowing for ‘additional layers of security’. Another speculation shown in the renders, and revealed in previous months, is the addition of a sensor bar that sits at the top of the handset. Wireless charging is also a possibility, as the ‘schematics show a large ‘pad’ on the inside of the upcoming device.’ And facial and iris biometric security could also be added to the handset, allowing for ‘additional layers of security’ This area will be home to the dual front-facing cameras, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor and earpiece.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

SAN FRANCISCO: Apple views autonomous driving systems as a “core technology” for the future, chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview aired Tuesday. Cook told Bloomberg television that Apple wants to move into the automotive sector because “there is a major disruption looming” from new technologies. The auto sector, Cook said, is being transformed by artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology as well as by the development of better electric cars and the growth of ridesharing. “We are focusing on autonomous systems,” he told Bloomberg. He said Apple sees this as “the mother of all AI projects” and that this is “a core technology that we view as very important.” While Apple has given no indication of specific projects for autonomous vehicles, it has joined the list of companies with permits to test self-driving cars in California, according to state records. The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple CEO Tim Cook Finally Publicly Acknowledges Autonomous Car Ambitions The executive mostly validates prior rumors with a few vague statements. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jun 13, 2017 at 7:03PM Surprising no one, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has officially confirmed the company's autonomous car ambitions in a recent interview with Bloomberg. The interview took place last week at Apple's WWDC developer conference, but was published earlier today. While Apple's automotive efforts have effectively been an open secret for years, this is one of Cook's first public acknowledgements. Contrast the admission with how Cook coyly shrugged and grinned when asked point blank on 60 Minutes if Apple was building a car. About six months ago, Apple did confirm in a letter to NHTSA that it was investing in autonomous vehicle technology, but didn't provide much detail beyond that. In April, Apple obtained a permit from the California DMV to begin testing autonomous cars. With that context in mind, what new information did Cook reveal? Image source: Apple. A few vague statements that mostly validate prior rumors Cook corroborated prior reports that Apple was pivoting its automotive strategy away from actually designing and manufacturing a car (presumably via contract manufacturers, which only play a small role in the automotive industry), and was instead concentrating on self-driving software. He said that Apple is "focusing on autonomous systems" and considers self-driving software "a core technology." Cook characterized the project as "the mother of all [artificial intelligence] projects," adding that it's "probably one of the most difficult." (Separately, Apple is reportedly developing its own dedicated AI processor as its silicon strategy becomes increasingly sophisticated.) Cook also touched on "a major disruption" on the horizon: the culmination of autonomous cars, electric vehicles (EVs), and ride-sharing. These are "kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame." Regarding EVs, the executive noted, "It's a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station." (Does he drive an EV?) Of course, Cook declined to provide any details regarding actual products, or even what overarching strategy the company may take with the autonomous technology that it's developing. To partner, or not to partner? That is the question. Apple faces a fundamental dilemma that shakes some of its core values in its attempts to approach the automotive market. The company has only dabbled with hardware partners a handful of times over the past four decades (the Mac clones of the late '90s, the doomed Motorola ROKR, etc.) with no notable success stories. It always prefers to make products with deeply integrated hardware and software, but there's a dearth of vertically integrated automakers; the automotive value chain has continued to fragment over the past century after decades of outsourcing and increased component modularity. The prospect of getting into automotive manufacturing would essentially ruin Apple's capital efficiency metrics, since the industry is known as "a destroyer of capital." Apple can either do something it hates doing (partner with someone else), or it can pursue the financially unappealing alternative (enter auto manufacturing). Meanwhile, the industry continues to push autonomous driving forward on its own, with manufacturers developing in-house technology while suppliers like Delphi Automotive work on turnkey solutions. There are no easy answers here, but investors will find out -- eventually. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Apple Issues $1 Billion Green Bond After Trump's Paris Climate Exit VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory June 14, 2017 08:01 Apple offered a $1 billion bond dedicated to financing clean energy and environmental projects on Tuesday, the first corporate green bond offered since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement. The offering comes over a year after Apple issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion -- the largest issued by a U.S. corporation -- as a response to the 2015 Paris agreement. Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives. The logo of Apple is seen in Los Angeles, California on April 22, 2016. /Reuters Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products. The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials. Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten -- an attempt to address criticism that Apple's products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart. Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius.

According to Variety, Google has hired Manu Gulati, an Apple micro-architect. He worked at Apple on chip development for about eight years, but his LinkedIn profile shows he just joined Google. With the title of lead SoC architect, he's obviously overseeing some type of system-on-a-chip development at Google. It's a bold move for a company that uses third-party chips in all its products. Google's current Pixel phones rely on Qualcomm chips, but the company may be planning to ditch them going forward, considering it has over a dozen new SoC-related job listings live right now that are all specific to mobile. A few of the postings include a mobile SoC architect, mobile SoC CPU architect, mobile SoC memory architect, and so on. Their descriptions also offer up clues.

LG Watch Urbane vs Apple Watch Original: Who Really Won the Game? June 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) If you had to pick a smartwatch in 2015, there were many options and two of them are LG Watch Urbane and the Apple Watch. Judging both of them and finding the best wearable is pretty tough. Undoubtedly Apple is a very big brand and has its unique identity in terms of smart gadgets, but with Android Wear support, LG is also not far behind. Now when both the watches are more than a year old, let’s take a quick look at the competition and decide who really won the smartwatch battle. Design It’s a battle between a square-faced watch and a round shaped one. With the LG Watch Urbane, you get a 45.5 x 52.2 x 10.9mm shaped watch in stylish stainless steel build. The watch is made to look suitable for both men and women, as the design is thin. The Urbane fits perfectly on wrist and is comfortable too. On the other hand, you will find the stainless steel body and ceramic back in the Apple Watch. The only difference in the design is their size, which makes them look very different and if you don’t like square-shaped watches, LG’s Urbane is the one that wins here. The Apple Watch comes in two different sizes including a 38mm and 42mm model. So, here you have got a choice depending on the size of your wrist. Apple allows users to get more customization for their watch, as the original watch lets you choose from different color options and straps. The Urbane doesn’t give you this much ability to customize your watch. But you can still change the 22mm strap, which is the only physical customization you can think of with the watch. So, the design, size and screen are a mixed bag. User Experience Specifications and features are the backbones of user experience, but sometimes, small things make a huge difference and can easily alter someone’s buying decision. One of the biggest advantages LG Watch Urbane users have is the ability to keep the watch face on all the time. And that too without getting the battery drained so fast. With Apple Watch, you need to move your wrist or tap the screen to check the time or to simply turn on the display. And there’s no specific setting available in the watch to keep the display on all the time. But with the Urbane, you don’t need to make any effort to check the time or to turn on the display, as it remains on as long as your battery lasts. Simplicity You don’t need to carry a user manual everywhere with any of these watches, but it is true that Google’s Android Wear is simple and easy to use. Even a child can use it. The Apple’s iOS is also not complicated and especially in the Apple Watch, you won’t have to spend time on learning how to operate it as everything is easy, but if we compare them, Google wins the game with its simplicity. Now when the LG Watch Urbane supports Android Wear 2.0, the watch has become more appealing when compared with the Apple Watch. Bottom Line So which smartwatch won the game? Well, both the watches were available below the price range of US$400 at the time of launch, and now there are many deals available on both the watches. The new editions have also arrived, so if your decision is influenced by the price tag, LG Urbane is cheaper. But even if you dump the price tag idea, there is so much with the Urbane that makes it worth choosing over the Apple Watch. Those who really look for “value for money” products, Urbane is not going to disappoint them. However, the meaning of value varies from user to user, but still buying the LG Watch Urbane is a smart and wise decision. But if the customization abilities and square shape watches attract you, Apple Watch is better. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News? Hit up our Tech Guru at; CoreyS@ThyBlackMan.com.

June 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) The last year’s Apple iPhone SE will probably get a successor this year. There are chances that Apple could be bringing iPhone SE 2 if the leaked images and reports are something to go by. Another small-screened phone by Apple is expected to arrive sometime before the holiday season this year. A few days back, several images surfaced, and everyone started speculating on the release of SE 2. Some of the reports suggest that the phone will be named iPhone SE 2 or iPhone SE Series 2. The design doesn’t reveal too much about the rumored iPhone, and Apple has not even confirmed whether any such phone is in production or not, but the images show that the phone will adopt some of the design aspects from iPhone 7 and will sport a single camera on the backside. At this point, it is impossible to say anything about this release, but if the mobile phone is scheduled to come out this year, there are chances that the company would want to keep the release date after August. The reason because keeping the phone’s launch in third or fourth quarter will give more time to Apple to maintain the life of the original SE phone on store shelves for longer. The company introduced SE with double internal storage capacity this year and it has also started producing the SE in India, possibly to test the market. When the leaked images appeared online, we were expecting Apple to unveil the phone at WWDC 2017. But the company didn’t do so. Now when this year’s event is a history, we expect that the company will probably introduce a new phone sometime during its September keynote. Since the reports about the arrival of the iPhone 8 are at peak, there are chances that Apple will bring both the phones on stage. We look forward that Apple will keep the SE series alive. If the rumors are something to go by, the phone will surely come this year. We expect that Apple will go for an improved design on the old one. There are chances that the phone’s build will see a complete makeover because last time, the company did nothing more than just improving the internal storage capacity. Some of the reports claim that the SE 2 will look completely different than its predecessor. The original phone adopts its design and style from the company’s iPhone 5S, this time, it is being expected that the new design will be a reflection of iPhone 7 or probably the company will go for a more innovative approach. The complete glass back is already a topic for discussions in tech world. The Apple’s original SE phone features a 3.5mm audio jack and it is unlikely that Apple would want to consider removing it from the new SE phone, unless the company makes some drastic changes in the design. Regarding the phone’s battery, there are almost zero complaints about the performance. So, what Apple can do with the new SE 2 is just improving the battery life or optimizing the performance to embrace less battery consumption. Apple is apparently working on a new operating system, so there are high chances that the battery life of the new phone will be significantly improved. Price tag is something that can make this potential release way more attractive than other phones in the market. Apple attracted many new iPhone adopters with the release of SE, so it is possible that the company will keep the price bar fair. The only drawbacks we observed in the original SE phone are the old design, not-so-good screen and influence of the previous generation phones. If Apple changes the way it looks at the iPhone SE this year, there are chances that the company will address these problems as well. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

Alphabet’s Waymo unit has signed partnerships with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Lyft to develop the technology. And carmakers from BMW to General Motors have opened sizable Silicon Valley offices and dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire autonomous vehicle startups. Apple had initially been seeking to build its own car, before recalibrating those ambitions last year to focus on the underlying technology for autonomous driving. The iPhone maker had hired more than 1,000 engineers to work on Project Titan, as the car team is known internally, after it started in 2014. Latest business videos Ballooning costs and a growing workforce led to Apple veteran Bob Mansfield being given the reins of the team in 2016. Cook had never before openly outlined Apple’s plans, though public filings have surfaced in recent months that provided snapshots of Apple’s efforts. Apple secured a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in April to test three self-driving sport utility vehicles, photos of which emerged several weeks later. A half-dozen vehicles had been surreptitiously testing the autonomous technology on public roads in and around the Bay Area for at least a year, according to someone familiar with Project Titan. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment on how long the company has been conducting road tests. In December, Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealing the company’s interest in automotive technology. It became public when it was published on a federal website. In the letter, Kenner wrote about the company’s excitement surrounding the potential for automated systems in fields like transportation. “There is a major disruption looming there,” Cook said on Bloomberg Television, citing self-driving technology, electric vehicles and ride-hailing. “You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame.” Cook was also bullish about the prospects for electric vehicles, a market which last week helped Tesla become the world’s fourth-biggest carmaker by market capitalization, even as it ranks well outside the top 10 by sales. “It’s a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station,” Cook said. Last year, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, the biggest Chinese ride-hailing service. The announcement came soon after Mansfield took over Project Titan and set about cutting hundreds of engineers. Whereas Apple had initially been building its own car, Mansfield scrapped those plans in favor of building an autonomous driving system. The company will reportedly make a decision this year on whether to proceed with the push. “Apple has long been the wild card in the autonomous car game,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader. “Now we know Apple is all in, and, judging by its track record in other areas, it will be a force.” In the interview on Bloomberg Television, Cook was hesitant to disclose whether Apple will ultimately manufacture its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Alex Webb and Emily Chang are Bloomberg writers.

Getting rid of the home button has obvious benefits, but a rear-mounted Touch ID scanner is ergonomically questionable, while integrating it into the Retina display is technologically tricky. Now, another way for Apple to slim the new iPhone’s bezels and maximize screen real-estate without sacrificing Touch ID has emerged, an alternative to baking the sensor into the display itself. That’s been the expected route for the iPhone maker to take, doing away with the dedicated home button and extending the display down to the bottom edge of the phone. The technology certainly exists to integrate a biometric sensor into a screen; indeed, Apple was granted a patent for such a system earlier this year. However, by all rights it’s also technologically tricky. Indeed Samsung is believed to have wanted to use such a system in the Galaxy S8, but have been foiled by its complexities. The rumor mill is still divided on whether the South Korean firm will have refined such a system in time for the Galaxy Note 8 later this year. Most recent reports suggest that it’s still beyond them, at least at the sort of scale that would be required for a mass-market smartphone. Now, a new patent awarded to Apple suggests another possible location for Touch ID. Rather than in the display, or on the rear of the phone, it might see the sensor relocated to the power button. The patent – titled “Finger biometric sensor assembly including direct bonding interface and related methods” and granted on June 13, almost exactly two years after it was filed – describes a new, much smaller fingerprint sensor. That decrease in size opens up fresh possibilities for where it could be positioned. By doing away with things like the glue layer, for instance, “the finger biometric sensor assembly may have a reduced overall thickness (e.g., in some embodiments, 150-200 microns for the cover layer and the finger biometric sensor IC die combined), relative to prior art finger biometric sensor assemblies” Apple writes. Not only could that reduce size, but also improve accuracy: uneven glue layers could leave the sensor tilted, and thus less effective. “Because the finger biometric sensor assembly 30 is smaller than prior art finger biometric sensor assemblies,” Apple continues, “the finger biometric sensor assembly may located in where real-estate has been limited, for example, along a thin side of the housing.” The power button location, and ensuing advantages, are specifically called out, in fact. “In particular,” Apple says, “the finger biometric sensor assembly may be carried by an input device, e.g., power button, along the relative thin edge of the housing. This may allow for the display to be larger, for example.” In short, by pressing the power button to wake your new iPhone, you’d also be unlocking it. Perhaps not as geekily-gratifying as a hidden biometric system integrated into the display, but probably a lot more practical to manufacture. One possibility, of course, is that Apple might use both of the systems. According to expectations, the company is set to announce three new iPhones later this year, both upgrades to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus – widely predicted to be known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus – in addition to a third, more advanced (and expensive) device, variously referred to as the “iPhone 8“, “iPhone X”, and “iPhone Anniversary Edition” to mark the ten year anniversary of the range. Apple could well mix up both fingerprint systems. So, the more affordable iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus could have a fingerprint power button, while the more expensive iPhone 8 flagship might opt for a display fingerprint system. Of course, we won’t know for sure until later in 2017, when the devices themselves are made official. That is, assuming nothing else leaks before then.

What stands out if you take it all in is that unlike what many seem to think - and unlike the romanticised image Apple tries to maintain - Apple didn't take some singular, targeted, focused stride to "invent" the iPhone. For example, Phil Schiller wanted a hardware keyboard, and remained stubborn in his conviction: The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which project to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple's head of marketing, had an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons. The BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an email client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else, including Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way forward, Schiller became the lone holdout. He "just sat there with his sword out every time, going, 'No, we've got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.' And he wouldn't listen to reason as all of us were like, 'No, this works now, Phil.' And he'd say, 'You gotta have a hard keyboard!'" Fadell says. In fact, Jobs was incredibly insecure about whether Apple should even pursue a phone at all. Privately, Jobs had other reservations. One former Apple executive who had daily meetings with Jobs told me that the carrier issue wasn't his biggest hang-up. He was concerned with a lack of focus in the company, and he "wasn't convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the 'pocket protector crowd,' as we used to call them." The iPhone that would eventually change the industry wasn't a clear vision in Steve Jobs' mind's eye - no, it was the result of hundreds of incredibly smart engineers trying out thousands of different ideas and solutions, and endless arguing with other engineers and management - up to and including Jobs himself - to try and convince them their particular idea was the best one. The iPhone is the result of thousands of little and big arguments, small and huge decisions, eventually leading to one of the most transformative devices in computing history. Jobs did not invent the iPhone. Apple's management didn't invent the iPhone. The iPhone was invented by hundreds of relatively nameless engineers, who poured years of their lives into it. And a hundred years from now, nobody will remember their names.

This year's event, held in San Jose, California, last week, was an exception. While there were no hardware announcements in the past three WWDCs, Apple this year came up with a slew of new hardware, on top of its software announcements, as if to make up for lost time. "Very different WWDC than what I expected," tweeted Miss Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at research firm Creative Strategies. "Way more hardware than I thought or (have) seen over past years." Apple announced refreshed MacBook Air, MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac computers. An all-new 27-inch iMac Pro (from US$4,999, or S$6,910) - with mammoth specifications that professional and power users have been yearning for - was also introduced and will be available at the end of the year. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up In addition, Apple launched a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. This model replaces the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Thus, the "pro" versions of iPad have bigger displays than the 9.7-inch iPad (2017) and 7.9-inch iPad mini 4. The icing on the cake is the new smart speaker HomePod. With Apple's virtual voice assistant Siri built into it, this product for homes is in direct competition with voice-activated speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home. "Apple is late to the game, behind Amazon and Google, at least in 2017," said Mr Clement Teo, principal analyst at Ovum. "But it is a piece of the home connectivity puzzle for Apple." The HomePod will not be available until December, and only initially in the United States, Britain and Australia. But Apple's WWDC announcements were focused on reassuring developers that it is still in the game of providing tools to reach consumers, according to principal analyst Frank Gillett of research firm Forrester Research. At the same time, Apple unveiled new operating systems, with iOS 11 for the iPhone and iPad, macOS High Sierra for Mac, watchOS 4 for Apple Watch and tvOS 11 for Apple TV. Other announcements that might not get much airtime in the media but are equally important were the introduction of virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) development kits. "The AR tools give developers a path to bring practical, accessible AR to iPhones with iOS 11," said Mr Gillett. For example, Niantic, developer of the popular mobile game Pokemon Go (PoGo), has already pledged its support for the use of AR in PoGo on iOS 11. This means PoGo players can walk around the virtual critter and see it in its true 3D form, rather than its current 2D form. Overall, Mr Gillett felt that Apple has provided developers an upgraded set of tools to keep consumers interested in buying and using Apple products.

Around the world, people generate some 50 million tons of e-waste every year, much of which ends up improperly disposed of in landfills where toxins common in electronics like lead, mercury and cadmium can leach out and contaminate surrounding soils and groundwater. Much of the remaining e-waste gets shipped off to developing countries happy to profit from taking others’ trash despite the environmental consequences, or even worse, just dumped illegally into the ocean. But thanks to consumer pressure to do the right thing, most major electronics manufacturers have started to pay attention to the problem and take action to reduce the flow of e-waste. Apple, for instance, long targeted by Greenpeace and others for lack of concern about the environmental and health impacts of its sourcing and production processes, has made great strides in the last five years in recovering customers’ old products and reusing the constituent parts in new products. Solar-powered Fairphone 2. Photo courtesy of FairphoneIn 2015 alone, the company collected some 90 million pounds of Apple-branded e-waste, recovering upwards of 61 million pounds of material, including steel, plastics, glass, aluminum, copper, cobalt, zinc, lead, nickel, silver, tin and gold, to re-incorporate into new products. Environmental advocates who love their iPhones can sleep easier knowing that lead, mercury, beryllium, arsenic, PVC, phthalates and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are no longer welcome in or will soon be phased out of Apple’s supply chain. But most of us upgrade our smartphones every two years, so that means that even today’s greener iPhones still contribute to the e-waste problem. That’s where Europe’s Fairphone comes to the rescue. By incorporating long-lasting design and fair-traded materials, ensuring good working conditions and making products that are fully recyclable, easy-to-fix and reusable, Fairphone hopes to revolutionize the smartphone market with its eco-conscious products. As the electronics industry matures and moves toward more sustainable components, that combined with better design can also help reduce the steady stream of e-waste. For instance, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have come up with a way to extend the life and boost the productivity of lithium ion batteries—the standard power source in today’s electronics—by treating their electrodes with hydrogen. Such a development could be huge for preventing e-waste, given that most of us toss our old phones within two years when the battery inside starts to deteriorate and underperform. Choosing carefully when it comes to selecting your next smartphone and recycling your old one for free at BestBuy or through its manufacturer are important first steps in becoming part of the solution to the growing problem of e-waste. Becoming an advocate by encouraging others to do the same is another way to greatly expand your positive impact. The non-profit e-Stewards program is dedicated to teaching people how to deal with used electronics—and individuals can pledge to become one of the program’s Envoys to help spread the word about the importance of reducing e-waste.

One of these is an entirely new form factor for an Apple tablet, an iPad Pro with a 10.5in screen - but is it any good, and is it worth upgrading from the 9.7in Pro that it replaces? In our iPad Pro 9.7in (2016) vs iPad Pro 10.5in (2017) comparison review, we weigh up the design and tech spec upgrades Apple has announced, and help you decide which model is better suited to your needs. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 and Best iPad deals Design & build quality The overall design of the new iPad Pro could scarcely be described as radical, offering essentially the classic iPad look in a slightly different size. The 10.5in model comes in the same four colours as the 9.7in predecessor: silver, gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. (The new 12.9in model, incidentally misses out again on Rose Gold.) The 10.5in Pro is a little wider and longer than the 9.7in model, as you would expect; it's also just over 30g heavier - nothing you'd really notice. Indeed, these are smaller increases than you'd expect, given the extra screen space you're getting. Apple has managed this by slimming down the bezels down the left and right edges of the screen. Dimensions iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): 240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm; 437g/444g (Wi-Fi/cellular models) iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): 250.6mm x 174.1mm x 6.1mm; 469g/477g (Wi-Fi/cellular models) Tech specs The key differences between the iPad Pro 10.5in (2017) and its predecessor can be discovered inside its chassis. Let's do a direct head-to-head comparison of the two devices' specs. Processor iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): A9X with 64bit architecture and M9 motion co-processor iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): A10X Fusion with 64bit architecture and M10 motion co-processor The new iPads come with new processors, as you'd expect. The A10X Fusion is a modified version of the A10 Fusion in the iPhone 7, and features six CPU cores: three high-performance cores and three efficiency cores for improved battery life. It also features a meaty twelve-core GPU. Apple predicts 30 percent faster CPU performance than the A9X chip, and 40 percent faster graphics performance, but we can't vouch for that until we've got one of the 10.5in Pros in our labs for detailed testing. In any case, the Pro 9.7in was already plenty fast enough for even the most demanding apps on the App Store at present (even graphically advanced games like Deus Ex: The Fall, below), so this is a question of future-proofing. RAM This isn't official just yet, but it is understood that Apple has doubled the RAM allocation. The iPad Pro 9.7in had 2GB of RAM; the 10.5in appears to have 4GB. Combined with the more powerful processor, this should result in substantially stronger performance on demanding apps at present, and more widely in the future as software is written with the new hardware in mind. Storage iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): 32GB, 128GB or 256GB iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): 64GB, 256GB or 512GB Apple has doubled the storage tiers, now topping out at a stunning 512GB - half a terabyte of storage in a tablet! Screen iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): 9.7 inches (diagonal), 2048 × 1536, 264ppi, 4:3, 60MHz refresh rate, 511 nits brightness (tested) iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): 10.5 inches (diagonal), 2224 x 1668, 264ppi, 4:3, 120MHz refresh rate, 600 nits brightness (claimed) The new iPad Pro has a bigger screen; it also has a higher resolution such that the pixel density (and effective sharpness) remains the same as its predecessor. You'll note that the refresh rate has doubled, which should result in smoother gameplay and better interaction with the Apple Pencil. There's also a new feature that Apple calls ProMotion, which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate dynamically depending on the requirements in a given app; this may help improve battery life. Finally, Apple points to increased brightness on the new iPad Pro, rated at a claimed 600 nits. In DisplayMate's tests the iPad Pro 9.7in was rated at a Peak Brightness of 511 nits. Cameras iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): 12Mp with f/2.2 aperture and dual-LED flash, 4K video recording (rear-facing); 5Mp with Retina Flash feature, 720p video recording (front-facing) iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): 12Mp with f/1.8 aperture and quad-LED True Tone flash, 4K video recording (rear-facing); 7Mp with Retina Flash feature, 1080p video recording (front-facing) Apple offers relatively minor photographic improvements, largely confined to the front-facing camera: this gets a higher megapixel rating and 1080p video. The 9.7in Pro already had a flash (on the rear); this has now been upgraded to a quad-LED model. Read next: iPad camera tips Touch ID iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): First-gen Touch ID iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): Second-gen Touch ID This is the first time second-gen Touch ID, which is quicker and more reliable than the original tech, has appeared in an iPad. It's previous been used in two generations of iPhones - from the iPhone 6s onwards. Battery life iPad Pro 9.7in (2016): claimed battery life up to 10 hours (Wi?Fi), up to 9 hours (mobile data) iPad Pro 10.5in (2017): claimed battery life up to 10 hours (Wi?Fi), up to 9 hours (mobile data) Apple generally offers battery life estimates that are both broad (the new 12.9in and 10.5in models get the same estimate despite having very different battery capacities) and modest. The average user can probably expect longer life than these numbers, although we find that gaming murders our batteries. We haven't run our battery tests on the 10.5in yet; the Pro 9.7 lasted an impressive average of 11hrs, 2m in GeekBench 3's highly demanding benchmark and should last even longer than that in general use. The Pro 9.7in has a 27.91 watt-hour battery, by the way; the 10.5in comes with a 30.4 watt-hour unit. But remember that larger batteries don't necessarily result in higher battery lives, for the obvious reason that the bigger iPad has more pixels to power. Release date The iPad Pro 10.5in (2017) is available now, having launched at WWDC on 5 June 2017. The iPad Pro 9.7in (2016) isn't available any more - the 10.5in replaces it. You can buy the iPad Pro 10.5in here. UK price The new 10.5in iPad Pro starts at a hefty £619 and tops out at a eye-watering £1,019. Bear in mind, however, that Apple has doubled the storage at each tier, so the entry-level model now comes with 64GB and the top model offers 512GB - an amazing amount of storage for a device of this type. We can't imagine 'normal' users - ones who don't have extensive game libraries, or who need to store large audio and video files - needing more than the base 64GB, although it might be said that 'normal' users would be better served by a more basic iPad altogether - such as the iPad 9.7in (2017). iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, WiFi, 64GB): £619 iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, WiFi, 256GB): £709 iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, WiFi, 512GB): £889 iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, cellular, 64GB): £749 iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, cellular, 256GB): £839 iPad Pro 10.5in (2017, cellular, 512GB): £1,019 You can buy the iPad Pro 10.5in here. Purely for comparison purposes (since this model is no longer available from Apple), here's what the company charged for the 9.7in Pro as recently as April 2017. It started at a more manageable £549, albeit with just 32GB. (Between you and me, 32GB is enough for quite a lot of people, even if 64GB provides a nice bit of wiggle room.) iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, WiFi, 32GB): £549 iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, WiFi, 128GB): £639 iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, WiFi, 256GB): £729 iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, 3G, 328GB): £669 iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, 3G, 128GB): £759 iPad Pro 9.7in (2016, 3G, 256GB): £849 OUR VERDICT The new iPad Pro 10.5in (2017) is a moderate rather than earth-shattering step forward from the iPad Pro 9.7in (2016). The headline enhancement is that you get a bigger screen, with less of an increase in size and weight than you'd expect as a pay-off; for those who find the 12.9in Pro an absurdity this may be the best form factor for work on the go. This screen also offers higher brightness and a doubled refresh rate that may come in handy for gaming and stylus work. The processor is significantly quicker, backed up (we're fairly sure) by a doubled allocation of RAM - but don't expect noticeable speed gains for a while. This is a future-proofing exercise. (Talking of the future, you can also expect free iOS updates for about a year longer than your 9.7in Pro has ahead of it at this point.) The front-facing camera is a bit better (good news for FaceTime addicts) and we're pleased to see the wonderful second-gen Touch ID on an iPad for the first time. But you really do pay for all this. Yes, it's good of Apple to double the storage tiers - even though it's an open industry secret that storage is incredibly cheap these days - but a starting price of £619 excludes all but the most committed buyers. We'd recommend this (and an Apple Pencil) to digital artists, since the new Pro models really are as good as tablets get, but your average consumer may be better advised to get the plain iPad... assuming you can live with its unlaminated screen.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | June 9, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Earlier this week, Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference officially kicked off with its keynote speech, where a variety of different Apple employees (and employees of other companies) took the stage to talk about what's new coming to Apple's software and devices. There was plenty to take in, with Apple rattling it all off at a pretty quick clip, but there were still some elements that didn't even get mentioned. There are a lot of new features in iOS, but one of them saw the light of day only after the keynote wrapped up. It's called "Offload Unused Apps," and it does exactly what the name implies. If you have a few apps on your phone that you might have wanted to use once, or maybe even used them a lot in the past, but have left them to squander on your device, this feature will take care of that for you. It works similarly to an implementation released in iOS 9 in 2015, and very similar to the way the company Nextbit handled cloud storage/on-device-apps for its Robin smartphone. Basically if you have an app (or apps) on your device that don't get used all that often, if ever, then the feature will automatically offload it from the iOS device -- but keep the documents and data on there. It does this so if you want to install that app again, the important bits are still there and ready to go. The apps that have been offloaded will appear grayed out on your device, and if you want to bring them back you just need to give the app icon a tap. iOS 11 users in the future will get to choose which apps they want to offload manually if they want, but the feature will also work automatically in the background depending on how much storage is remaining on your device. So, good news for devices with minimal storage. Storage space is always an important issue, so it's good to see Apple doing a lot with iOS 11 (including iCloud to help with other aspects of the software) to make it easier for people that might not have a phone with a ton of built-in storage. So instead of going the obvious route and asking how much storage you have on your phone, I'm going to go a more app-specific way. This upcoming feature actually made me think about all the apps I have on my phone, and go through what's there and find out what I actually don't use anymore. Unsurprisingly, there were a lot there. I mostly discovered that I've still got a ton of calculator apps on there, for whatever reason, and a lot of writing apps, too. A variety of different weather apps on there, too, because apparently I can never get enough of seeing how sunny it is out there. I deleted all of them, even ones I hesitated with and thought, "Well, maybe I'll use this again..." Because I know I really won't. I've got my favorite apps for those types of things, whether it's a built-in Apple stock app, or, usually, a third-party alternative. I love trying out new options, though, so I download a lot of them, and switch to something new if I can be convinced. Apparently, whatever the result, there's a straggler that gets left behind. What about you? How many apps do you have on your phone, and how many of those do you know you don't use on a regular basis? Do you find yourself deleting unused apps, or do you keep them around for whatever reason? Let me know!

Google hires ex-Apple chipset veteran to help design SoCs for Pixel phones Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/13 11:36am PDTJun 13, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 195 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Google's hardware plans for the future are getting bigger. Variety is reporting that Google has hired Manu Gulati, a hardware architect, away from Apple. Gulati is reported as having previously played a significant role in the development of Apple's SoCs for the last eight years and was hired sometime in the last few weeks. His new title at Google is Lead SOC Architect, and he's expected to work on custom chipsets for future Pixel phones. If Manu Gulati can apply the same black magic to Google's future products as he did on Apple's custom chips, things could be fantastic. Apple's "A" series chips are amazing pieces of hardware. Though Apple does license ARM's tech, unlike other manufacturers, they don't just toss the licensed reference designs on a wafer. Apple has bent over backward to optimize their silicon architecture for iOS, and the resulting performance on Apple devices definitely demonstrates that. Although some Android chipset vendors, such as Qualcomm, do make custom designs like the Kryo, for whatever reason Apple's custom hardware (combined with their software) has held an edge in performance for years. For most of us, any advantage the A series chips have doesn't make any difference without the Android operating system. But if Google is able to bring the same degree of performance enhancements and customization over into their future hardware, the future of Android SoC performance could be bright. After the dark and regressive ages of the Snapdragon 808/810 and Qualcomm's rushed 64bit development cycle, I would like nothing more than to see Google bring a first party chipset in a future Pixel device. And who knows, they might even sell it to other manufacturers, increasing competition in the currently stagnant mobile chipset space. Gulati joining Google finally lends credence to the old stories of Google's interest in SoC designing. And it appears to be full steam ahead, as supplemental job postings for SoC design have appeared on Google Careers. Whether these efforts result in a new custom chipset by Google, or we just see some new specialized hardware for machine learning, either way, things should be interesting.

Now Google just needs to start selling Pixel devices in South America (or specifically in Brazil). Leonardo Loures Quirino Amém! Renan Hehe. I knew more brazilians wanted Google's stuff. Yoshi Everyone here wants it, bro. Look at all the people wishing the good times of Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and 5 selling in almost every good store. Renan I know. I'm one of these people, lol Lucas de Eiroz ™ Google Pixel, Google Store, Android Pay (and Google Wallet), and all Google services! Renan I'm dying for Android Pay! Random! They'd better reduce their prices first by at least 50% Renan That would be a dream, too. Ricardo Ferreira If they are priced like Moto/Lenovo is, it should be a blessing. Take the Moto G5 for example and you'll see that our price isn't that far off. Freek Smulders This could be yuge! Lord Argyris Bigly big league! Duder12 HUGE kabiluddin Guess we'll see the new custom soc in late 2018/9 Honestly can't wait. destinyhud pixel 3 then!!! Godspoken I recall "Google silicon" being referenced last year as a future goal of the Pixel, very exciting. blackice85 Isn't that one of the things holding them back from providing updates for longer periods of time too? Could be a big deal not just for the performance gains. Gregory That Project Treble thing or how do you call it in O is also all about cutting on dependencies from third parties like Qualcomm. blackice85 Oh I hadn't heard about that, I bet this is one aspect of it then. Duder12 Project Treble doesnt improve years of update support. It brings updates faster since Qualcomm and OEMs can work on software updates at the same time. Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. Google doing their own SOC is the only real answer Gregory From my understanding, it eliminates the need for the drivers to be updated in the first place. someone755 You can't expect to not update drivers with new Android versions. Say there's an Android system API that a driver adheres to. As something banal, let's say we have a driver that controls whether the hardware button backlight is on or off, and that the system can control whether it is either on or off. Then a newer Android version appears which supports both the old API but also a newer one, wherein the hardware backlight can be controlled as if it were analog (from 0-255 for example). Then, the third system version comes out that ditches support for the old API and only still supports the newer one. Yes the OEM could hack things up so that values 0-254 would mean the light is off and then 255 would mean it's on, but this further complicates both the user experience and app compatibility as well as future system version compatibility. At this point if you want a stable and future-proof software solution, you absolutely have to update the driver to support the new API. And if the backlight vendor can't provide one, then it's more trouble than it's worth for the OEM to do the hack themselves and they just post a note online saying your device won't get upgraded, leaving you with no choice but to either resort to community hacks or buy a new device. Yes the example is completely idiotic but it serves as an example of why you can't go around updating devices without driver updates. Aside from the functionality aspect there are many security flaws that could affect a driver. And not updating that huge gaping hole in your security while providing monthly 'security patches' that claim to solve security threats is just inane. At that point why even bother with security patches if you can't expect chipset vendors to fix the problems in their closed-source firmware, or hold them accountable for it. Gregory While I completely understand your point, I'd like to extend it to say that there could be such a backlight that can be either on or off, and it's a hardware limitation, so it isn't possible to fully implement the new API on that device. I mean, hardware configurations vary, it's a matter of fact. The point of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is to abstract away the differences across the underlying hardware, and provide a unified API for the system services to interact with said hardware. If the HAL doesn't provide support for some new feature that was added in a system update but the hardware could technically support it, it still means that the system would behave as though that feature isn't supported by the hardware, and that's it. I'd rather have a device that doesn't support that new feature than a device that is no longer updated. And security... How about people ALWAYS check for buffer boundaries before copying memory? What do they do with all that time and disk space they save? Or, at least, if they're that lazy, run a static analyzer on your code and fix whatever it finds. And run it in valgrind to find memory leaks. It's not that hard to write vulnerability-free code from the start. someone755 But a device will never pass certification, either by Google or an FCC-like entity or another office, with broken features. This is exactly why the 8974 line got dropped -- the hardware didn't support a feature that Google wanted so they didn't let any 8974 device pass CTS. How do you think people running Nougat just fine on their hammerheads (via one custom ROM or another) feel about this conundrum when they've been cut short an entire system update because of Google's insane chip requirements? It's easy to know how to prevent bad code but often times projects start simple and private and unoptimized, and then grow into something much larger that's hard to maintain. A classic example is Android itself (look at all the memory leaks that L introduced). Gregory Well... If a device passed certification by Google (CTS) and carriers, that feature was optional from the beginning, right? Android does already support a plethora of different hardware configurations with different capabilities. If a device didn't have some feature at launch, I don't expect it to have that feature enabled with a software update. CTS is about keeping compatibility with apps (it tests public APIs), it has nothing to do with drivers and hardware. There are literally no hardware requirements that make it impossible to update existing devices more than a year or two. Carrier certification is about device interfacing correctly with carrier equipment, it did so well when it was released and certified, so just don't touch the modem firmware because it's already doing its job good enough, as simple as that. There are exactly zero reasons to modify the HAL for system updates provided HAL and the rest of the system are properly separated, which, from my understanding, they are with Project Treble. It also adds CTS-like standardized test suite for these things. What the hell is 8974? someone755 Msm8974. The Snapdragon 800 platform that phones like the N5, Z3, G2, S5, M8 etc were based on. That got blocked from receiving any sort of updates because Google decided that Vulkan or GL 3.1 was necessary for the upgrade. Not that modern low-end phones are capable of performing the task that the requirement was set for anyways. Basically the thing my entire argument is set around but alright... Owais Lone > Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. ... and Project Treble will enable device vendors to still ship updates in this exact case. Project Treble cuts out qualcom and SoC manufacturers out of the update cycle. The device vendors will be bottleneck and decision makers now. someone755 This is incorrect. Please see my reply to Gregory above. Owais Lone Your example exactly illustrates the problem now. Project Treble is supposed to abstract these internal hardware level ABIs/APIs so vendors don't have to re-implement the whole layer again. Only time when SOC vendors will have to update their code is when Project Treble itself comes out with a breaking change and a major version upgrade. Of course, vendors might have to or want to make changes here and there but the abstraction should save them from re-doing all of it on every update and if the vendor does not want to improve/optimize with every update, they shouldn't have to make any changes at all unless Treble itself comes out with an incompatible update. someone755 And say that Android P is the one where the button backlight brightness from my example becomes an analog value and the digital on/off API is dropped. Then the phones that incorporate this function will either have to have the driver updated or will not get updated to the next Android version. This is a problem and always will be, as long as chip vendors are not held responsible and held to a higher standard, and as long as the entities that certify devices for daily use (CTS, FCC etc) have some standards themselves (in the sense of not letting devices with broken/missing core features pass). Owais Lone If such a change happens at the HW level, it'll be abstracted at the treble API level so phones that leverage treble API will not need any change at all. Vendors would need to update their code if the change happened in Treble's apI itself which is extremely unlikely as it'll defeat the purpose of having Treble in the first place. That said, there will be major updates to Treble which might break backward compatibility but it's Google's job to keep those changes at a minimal or the whole idea will be worthless. someone755 This is exactly what I'm saying -- if Treble changes (which it most probably will across Android versions, as the system has changed until now), the chip vendors will *have* to provide updates. And there is no way around this limitation, Treble or not, if Google makes some absurd changes then phones won't get updated. Owais Lone Yes, that is true but why would that happen in the first place? That would completely defeat the purpose. Treble will most likely always be backward compatible. It'll probably only add new features and new APIs but not break existing ones. That's how I would handle the project.

Keith Taylor Yep bout that long. destinyhud yeah 2 years. they started this in 2015 so i would guess maybe pixel 3 could have google soc Daniel I've always been a Snapdragon all the way kind of guy, but this would definitely fix updates, give better performance, and bunches of other stuff. I'm a convert. Ditch you Snapdragon. Renan I'm with you. As long as this brings longer support for Google's devices, I'm in. psy spy Always Snapdragon? What choices did you have? Iwanova Nvidia & Mediatek? (I know, Mediatek have no source code, but still. It's mobile SoC right) jesuguru Exynos? Nomaan There was quite a competition until 2012 when we had Snapdragon, Exynos, Tegra, OMAP, NovaThor in the SoC game. Lateef Alabi-Oki Anything to put Qualcomm, with their shitty inefficient power-hungry proprietary insecure SoC drivers, out of our misery is welcome. h4rr4r Please get the drivers in mainline or at least GPLed and into AOSP. MJ I am not as excited (yet) as most of you are about this. I see two possible scenarios coming out of custom chipset from Google... 1.) The main reason Apple's SoC performs better is because it's optimized for iOS and only iOS. It is not properly documented so no other OS can really run it. I would rather stick with a Qualcomm SoC if Google goes down this road. 2.) Google creates a fully open and documented SoC but it performs no better than Apple's or Qualcomm's chips. I would prefer a fully open and documented chipset that can compete as good or better than anything else out there. Possible? I don't know... Regardless, I suspect Google is looking to make some custom hardware for AI or VR first before we see a custom chipset for a phone.

MadMartigan I'm guessing he's just really proud of his ability to copy and paste and is just showing off. Hey, some folks never even get that far. ;-) Thinker Geekbench is comparable across platforms. Therefore A10x chip (for example) will outperform Qualcomm chip on Android as well. MJ I am sure it may BUT it will perform even better with iOS. Android will never run on a A10x SoC so who cares? My point is I am not interested in a chipset that can only run Android. reggjoo That would be a fair test if you could load a "neutral​" os on both platforms, then run test. It will never happen though.

Phoenix keep on dreaming Thinker Apple A10x: Single thread 3900 Multi thread 9300 ------------------------- MacBook Pro 2016 intel: Single 3900 Multi 7700 No, Qualcomm S835 is far away from coming close to intel. Now, apple A10x is very competitive especially considering that A10x is fan-less design. Enough said. Just_No_Stop Firstly you dont say which Intel chip, the fastest laptop chip is WAY faster than the A10x. Secondly, they run 2 totally different OSes, one is very much single threaded, that can run limited threads when it does run multi-thread, and as such can dedicate the entire CPU to the benchmark. OSX is very multi-threaded, and doesnt do that, it will always run more background threads. Thirdly the A10x isnt a phone chip, its a laptop/tablet chip, and actually eats battery like crazy when full throttle, and gets very hot when it does, and as so doesnt do so for long. Thinker Geekbench 4 is functionally same across all platforms. Thus comparable. Read Geekbench blog. Oh forgot one more thing...A10x has 3 CPU cores while Intel chip above has 4 CPU cores. That only further makes multi-thread score more impressive!! Intel chip above is standard intel in base Macbook PRO in 2016. If you take fan out of Intel devices, then would that equalize things for you?? Lol. Wanna bet which will be better?! Just_No_Stop It might be functionally the same, but the OS is not, and despite claims (by the developer which has a bias to sell its product) its not comparable across platforms. It doesnt even generate the same score on the same CPU between OSX, Linux and Windows, let alone iOS and android. The base Macbook Pro from 2016 has 2 cores, so again.. which chip is it? The A10x cannot run full throttle for long, the Intel can run flat out all the time, doing the same task, if even remotely prolonged, the Intel will win. The Intel is all much more flexible than the A10x. It capable of unoptimised maths that the A10x would simple die a death trying to run. Its is at least an order of magnitude faster than the A10x, which a full desktop class OS needs. Thats why there is no A10x powered Macbook Pro. Thinker Intel has a fan. Take out fan and what happens? Just_No_Stop It would probably not be able to run as long, but it would more than manage the few seconds per test of Geekbench. Thinker Huh?! Wtf?! Please stop talking. Just_No_Stop How is that not true? I have run geekbench multiple times on my laptop and desktop, and the fan doesnt kick in on my laptop and doesnt throttle up on my desktop. Its a very brief, and very poor benchmark. You still fail to understand how the usage scenarios in an iPad Pro and a desktop class PC are completely different, which is why one goes for single core performance, and the other multicore. So i will repeat, its not that Intel cant beat Apple, its that they dont need to. Its made even worse by the fact that most laptops are seriously storage speed limited, even an SSD only helps so much, and the CPU is still waiting. The A10, in a laptop would be awful. One core would be almost always in use for background tasks, and as such would burn through battery. Android is not that dissimilar, it has far more background activity than iOS, and therefore needs less powerful, more numerous cores that use less power. The trick is making all those cores useful when you need to run a single powerful task. This is something that Android has got much better at, but it doesnt really show up well in benchmarks. Thinker The Apple iPad PRO 12.9 from 2015 with merely 2 CPU cores active at any single time (Apple A9X) and 4 GB of RAM. Yet with iOS11, it can run FOUR active windows at once. Yes, 4 windows all active and you can interact with all 4. Now, on the other hand, on Android with those 8-12 cores of CPU, you see apps constantly being kicked out of memory despite 6-8 GB RAM! Background activity you say? BS! BTW, a single powerful task does NOT need 6-8 cores of CPU. Again, please STFU! You’re really embarrassing yourself! Hrishikesh Bisen You are a plan idiot. Thinker Cross-Platform Designed from the ground-up for cross-platform comparisons, Geekbench 4 allows you to compare system performance across devices, processor architectures, and operating systems. Geekbench 4 supports Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Source: Geekbench. Just_No_Stop Source.. the company that makes and wants to sell the benchmark. Unfortunately reality doesnt support that claim. Thinker Lol. Geekbench is universally accepted. Just_No_Stop by plenty of sites that have no idea how it works, which is most of them. Thinker Here's a comparison of interest: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/3042292?baseline=3036382 Just_No_Stop iOS is not comparable to Windows 10. The Intel chip is 18% faster than the A10X in multi-core. geekbench does very badly with hyperthreading, which for applications that make use of it adds a huge performance advantage. Many apps now use it. It should also be noted that the A10x is a SoC, that includes hardware acceleration for some things that the Intel chip isnt designed for, and has little use traditionally on Laptops, this further distorts the score in the A10x favour. Dont get me wrong, its a good CPU, but its not all that. If there was an ARM Windows 10 it wouldnt run as well on the A10x as x64 windows does on Core iX. It should also be noted that there are 3 SoC that beat the standard A10 on Android, which also is more background threaded than iOS, and as such cant dedicate 100% of the CPU to the benchmark. Thinker Remind me...doesn't intel have that TURBO thingy? 3 Android SoC that beat A10?!?! 😂 Dude, you make me laugh!! Hint: single core is far more important. And remember A10 is dual core at any one time unlike Android SoC. Some of those Android are actually firing up all EIGHT cores to beat Apple's two!!! Just_No_Stop Single core is more important on iOS, not Android. Do you really think ARM and Qualcomm and Samsung, who have been at this for years, cant make a CPU as fast as Apple? They can, but the platform doesnt require such Single core performance, and making a CPU like that would hurt performance of Android, not help it. ARM has done extensive testing of such setups, but has rejected them for a reason. If you must know the A10 is very similar in structure to the Intel Core, which is why its fast, but its also why it cant run 4 cores and be power efficient. Its clear you have no idea how a CPU works, or an OS, and you put WAY to much faith in a commercial benchmark. Thinker Let's test your knowledge since you claim to know so much...how many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? No, Samsung and Qualcomm do NOT use custom design cores dumbass. They use generic core design from ARM. In fact I believe S835 CPU core design took a step backward too. But you know all this already. APPLE uses fully custom cores designed upon ARMv8 architecture. What you wrote is pure ignorance. Please stop. Just_No_Stop Qualcomm do use custom designs, Samsung doesnt, and yet the Exynos 8895 is faster than the A10.. It seems you are the ignorant one. Thinker Wrong. Anandtech: "The new Kryo 280, despite the similar name, shares no design DNA with the original Kryo. Its an octa-core, big.LITTLE configuration with four “performance” cores and four lower-power “efficiency” cores. What makes Kryo 280 unique, however, is that it’s the first design to use ARM’s new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" (BoC) license, which allows vendors to customize ARM cores. This new semi-custom option gives vendors the ability to differentiate their products from those using ARM’s stock cores while avoiding the more costly route of creating a fully-custom design from scratch." Again, like I said above, S835 CPU core was a step BACKWARDS. It is basically a generic CPU core with memory controller from Qualcomm. S820 used custom cores but with S835, Qualcomm used generic. Again, you never answered my other question. How many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? STFU dude. You are ignorant. Just_No_Stop You realise that a SoC isnt just the cores right? The memory controller and GPU are what make the 835 custom. If the 835 and the Exynos are generic then why is the Exynos faster despite a lower clock? Again, you lack understanding, all you can do is regurgitate rubbish you have read on a website. Exynos is almost entirely ARM reference, the 835 is not, generic cores maybe, but otherwise completely custom. Sadly all that customisation results in lower performance, not more. Why does it matter how many instructions per cycle it can do? What matters is the total performance. Instructions per cycle is a very old fashioned way of looking at CPU speed, more so than ever now with multicore setups and microcode interpretors. yet again you show a complete lack of understanding about how a modern SoC works. Anyone could design a CPU like the A10, only apple does, because only Apple need one like that, it doesnt show genius, or more advanced design, its just different to similarly performing ARM and Intel CPUs. Frankly I'm just blocking you now, since you arent interested in learning. Thinker Damn you're ignorant. I see that you're backtracking like crazy!! Lol No, S835 CPU core is generic. No one talked about GPU. LOL INSTRUCTIONS PER CYCLE has nothing to do about CPU speed!! Wtf are you talking about?! Typical Android dumbass who thinks he knows tech. Anyone can design like Apple yet everyone is envious of Apple chip design team, including Google!! You're a dumbass. Thinker Even today, i am still laughing at your ignorance!!! Thanks for the laugh!! PhaseBurn Google's been in the hardware field for a very, very long time, originally using Scorpion ARM-based CPUs that predate the SnapDragon, even (https://www.wired.com/2012/09/pluto-switch/). Despite what Variety says about Gulati joining to design SoCs for the Pixel line, I'm guessing that their internal SoC group will end up working on a lot of their platform networking and datacenter fabric next generation designs, in addition to anything they do on a future Pixel phone. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I'm pretty excited to hear about this news. I've always wanna see Google have their own custom chips for their hardware. Google love plot twist #2 roberto.elena I'm personally more interested in a Google SoC for Chromebooks. It's not that I don't find this news interesting for mobiles, but the biggest benefit, even more important than improved performance, is extended OS support. At the current pace of hardware improvement, I'm not interested in owning a phone for more than 1 or 2 years, but a Chromebook is a different story. I would keep it for several years. destinyhud good point. intel is fast but have issues with android apps. other oem are not that fast enough and qualcomm wont come to chromebook at least for now. so this chip used in chromebook pixel would be awesome Midnitte Sort of wish somebody (Intel, AMD,.... Google) would purchase MediaTek and position them to actually compete with Snapdragon, so that we could all benefit from longer/quicker upgrades, not to mention performance. someone755 MediaTek's strategy is much like AMD's was just a few years ago in the desktop space. The money for them is up to where OEMs (who make low-end and midrange phones) are willing to pay for the chips -- any higher and they don't have the knowledge/technology/budget to produce something more powerful. Any lower and, well, this is as low as it can go, and the other competitors (Qualcomm, Intel) have worse-performing chips available for the price that MediaTek offers theirs at. Why that is, I have no clue, but I suspect it could have something to do with Qcom having a monopoly on ARM-based chips, and Intel thinking that their overpriced-desktop-chips-with-no-competitor strategy is going to work here, in a highly competitive environment. The point here being that MediaTek works off tight margins and sells in large quantities. Restructuring this process so that it fits our idea of a Qualcomm competitor would be expensive, and definitely riskier than what the payoff is worth to the investor. reggjoo Maybe he can help bring that single core performance up to apple levels. It won't really make a big difference in the global grand scheme of things, but it would kill all that bragging rights talk. usamaisawake I know we can never know, but I honestly think that the A-chips are, on their own, just really damn good chips. iOS optimization helps, but I think a lot of it is Apple's designers. Marty I'm liking the sound of that. But going by Google's declaration that the Pixel phones are made by Google when in fact they are designed and made by HTC, these SoCs will probably be shelf-bought from the cheapest vendor. destinyhud i am sorry u r wrong at this part. designed by google and made by HTC. same like apples designed by apple claim. Marty Wrong. It's now known the Pixels were designed and made by HTC. http://www.androidauthority.com/google-hidden-htc-involvement-google-pixel-xl-code-723953/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/05/the-pixel-smartphone-is-actually-made-by-htc-not-google/#52ca3eb1e99a https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-htc-will-real-manufacturer-googles-phones-share-glory destinyhud its now knows to just u or what?? because eveyone know its designed by google. but they def have HTC previous device influence. google interview clearly said they tried to design pixel as non iphone design as possible. we are talking about hardware. finding code reference is not equal to HTC made hardware. how does that login even correlate? all the article u posted said it is made by HTC and i didnt disagree on that. it is made by HTC but designed by Google. try harder. https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/google-pixel-how-google-designed-its-first-real-phone/ Marty Read the AA article. It clearly shows HTC footprints in both hardware and software design. destinyhud AA article says nothing about hardware footprint just software foot print. software is not hardware. also there are similar article which said google was building nexus by HTC and finally decided to make their own phone which is why u could find htc code when it was in early development. we are not talking about software here again. Marty The HTC hardware footprint is clearly seen in the design. And it's noteworthy that the software would have any OEM influence at all since Android is a Google creation. You can claim whatever you want, but the evidence is clear and has been clear since the Pixels were released. Talk to the hand... needa But once you open up the phone, you can see that HTC did not design the hardware inside of it. That is always the tell tale sign. matteventu Yes and the htc logo on the battery is there because they just wanted to sign it? needa HTC doesn't have a battery manufacturing plant (assumption). It's part of being the ODM. Designing a PCB and ordering a battery to fit in a specified area are two completely different things. matteventu Dont waste your time with this bunch of G-fanboys... Marty Agreed. One thing, though, they seem to always forget is "Made by Google" when the Pixel isn't made by Google. Apple doesn't even say that about the iPhone, though every aspect of the iPhone is Apple all the way. But Google gets a pass on that lie because, as you said, they're G-fanboys. They always present excuses like..."well, it was designed by Google, that means it's made by Google." The Pixel isn't even designed by Google much less made by Google. But I guess since Google decided to lie, the chose to go all out on the lie... "This lie made by Google" Heh...Google did design and make something...lol...a lie. saf1927 If they do indeed design the SoC in-house, obviously they won't actually manufacture them since they don't own any semiconductor company, just like Apple. They will hand in the specifications to a foundry such as TSMC. Marty You'd think they'd do it that way, but Google did lie about the origin of the Pixels. If Google were to emphatically state that a future SoC is designed and engineered by them, who knows if it would be true? whispy_snippet Fucking awesome. Kimmy Gibbler I don't expect them to succeed Total Insecurity The future of Android is bright anyway :) Jordan L So this means Pixel 3 is going to be an awesome phone! I'm with a lot of people here in hoping for a cheaper Pixel. Like $399. Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel Base. I guess this mimicks Apples plan with iPhone 8, and 7s. someone755 Pixel SE. With a 4" display I wouldn't even be mad. Patel Nisha I really hope this turns out to be a big deal, not just some optimisation stuff for 3rd party components. Apple have a HUGE lead now in terms of silicon. Even Samsung’s own chips can’t compete with Apple’s. It can only really be Google who have a chance to catch up at this stage. xyz Good. Now Google fanboys will have one less excuse when Google still doesn't update phones for more than 2 years. Random! I wonder if a new chip design would help to solve the sound latency issue that makes it so frustrating to use apps such as drum emulators on Android. Or if this is really just a matter of optimizing software. Anyway, shouldn't all SoC manufacturers be designing their SoCs with a dedicated microphone co-processor in order to enable always-on hotword/voice recognition which doesn't kill the battery? Maybe that co-processor could also be the one monitoring the sensors...

Locally, after Tuesday's strong day, shares are set to open moderately higher.  1. FANG rebound: US, European and emerging market equities have found buyers and the notorious FANG basket or FAAMG, or whatever abbreviation of what are effectively market leaders has also rallied. My own basket of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft has gained 1.2%, and this will still get focus in the session ahead, but specifically, a move in Apple through Friday's close of $148.73 would provide more conviction that tech does not roll over and head south from here. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones have broken out to new all-time highs, with reasonable breadth (77% of S&P 500 companies closed higher on the day), with volumes very much in-line with the 30-day average.

(This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets). 2. ASX: As a lead in for Australia, we can see that while tech has found buyers (which won't wholly affect us), however, financials (+0.44%) and materials (+1.3%) have also performed well and that should support the ASX 200 on open. How the market trades for the rest of the day is obviously not yet known but had you told me at the start of the day yesterday that the financial sector was going to put 49 points into the index and REITS 11 points, I wouldn't have believed you. Either way, we will be looking for further flows into this move, while healthcare has been a sector I've been bullish on and the ASX 200 healthcare sector is a mere 1.2% from a new all-time high. This is where we are seeing the outperformance and the momentum trade working well in Australia. 3. Still some headwinds: Aggregating all the overnight news and we are expecting the market to build on yesterday's gains, specifically in the ASX 200. There are some headwinds however, with spot iron ore down 2.8%, while in the Dalian futures exchange iron ore, steel and coking coal futures were sold off 2.3%, 0.9% and 0.7% respectively. US crude has traded in a range of $46.57 to $45.56 and was providing us some hope that energy stocks were going to find buyers on open, but we have seen a fairly bearish read on the weekly API oil inventory report (at 06:30 aest), with US crude and gasoline inventories increasing 2.8 million and 1.8 million barrels respectively. Consider the analysts were looking for a 2.3 million barrels drawdown in crude inventories in the official Department of Energy report (out at 00:30 aest) and the market is now somewhat positioned for a bearish surprise when the DoE release its statistics. Recall, last week's API was actually a terrible pre-cursor so I wouldn't read too much into it. 4. FX: In FX markets the USD index has dropped a touch, with the CAD continuing to be the strong performer, with USD/CAD hitting a low of $1.3211. Keep an eye on the daily chart of USD/CAD as the pair is finding buyers at the April pivot low and may retrace some lost ground here. Saying that, a close below this level and we should see an extension of this bearish trend into $1.3000. USD/JPY is the natural proxy of all things Federal Reserve and that pair has traded in a tight range of ¥110.27 to ¥109.83 on the session. This tight range in USD/JPY is thematic of such limited moves in US fixed income, across the yield curve and again fixed income will be the purest read of the Fed meeting tonight and I would be paying most close attention to the US five-year treasury over the coming 24 hours given its sensitive to the economic projections and potential views of longer term fed funds rate. The 'real' (or inflation adjusted) five-year rate will also be keenly watched, as this seems to be having a strong bearing on overall financial conditions and a sharp drop in real yields post FOMC (at 04:00 aest) and Janet Yellen's testimony shortly after, will likely be a strong catalyst for gold, emerging market assets and the FANG baskets. Of course, if we see real yields pushing higher it would represent a tightening of financial conditions, which is kind of what you would expect when a central bank raises rates. That could weigh on the S&P 500. 5. Fed non-event: That being said, the market isn't even really interested in the fact the Fed will hike the fed funds rate tonight, it's fully baked in. It's really all about the interest rate curve into 2018, 2019 and even 2020. So it's an exercise in understanding what priced in, or what could be said is not priced in. If we take the fed fund future (a tradeable interest rate instrument) we can see the yield here sitting a 1.555% on the January 2019 contract and 1.745% January 2020. This effectively details 64.5 basis points (or 2.5) and 83.5bp (3.3) of hikes priced in through to the end of 2018 and end of 2019. Contrast this to the Fed's so-called 'dot plot' tonight and there will be much focus on the divergence here. Rates traders will also be following narrative around potential normalisation of the Fed's $4.46 billion balance most intently, where I feel this will start of fall around the October meeting. Advertisement 6. US data: I also think it the market will be fairly sensitive to the US May CPI figures released at 22:30 aest, with the market expecting core inflation at 1.9% annualised. Naturally, this will be superseded by the Fed meeting, but the Fed will be not like the dynamic of extremely accommodative financial conditions, amid falling inflation and subdued inflation expectations. 7. Europe: A recovery in tech stocks and fresh optimism over troubled Italians banks lifted European shares from seven-week lows on Tuesday. Capita led the gains after offering a reassuring outlook. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended up 0.6 per cent, almost fully recovering losses from the previous session. Italy's benchmark rose 0.9 per cent. 8. Market watch: SPI futures +0.2%, 10 points, to 5792 points AUD -0.04% to US75.38¢ On Wall St, Dow Jones +0.4%, S&P500 +0.4%, Nasdaq +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 +0.4%, FTSE100 -0.2%, CAC40 +0.4%, DAX +0.6% Spot gold +0.7% to $US1266.72 an ounce Brent crude +1.03% to $US48.79 a barrel Iron ore -2.8% to $US53.36 a tonne   This column was produced in commercial partnership    between Fairfax Media and IG Advertisement Most Popular 'Drenched in 100-degree liquid': Thermomix taken to court Why solar power will kill coal faster than you think Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has so much money he doesn't know what to do with it Families sacrifice meals and GP visits to pay for electricity 'Not a major bank': Macquarie asks to be excluded from levy Follow BusinessDay Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow The Age Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide Business 'Drenched in 100-degree liquid': Thermomix taken to court United staffer videoed pushing 71-year-old to floor Retail facing toughest time in many years, operators warn Activist investors welcome MacKenzie as new BHP chair CBA compensation bill rises to $29 million The Age Losing my religion for equality ABC in damage control after Symons' 'racist' comments When it comes to shared cycling, yellow is the new blue The Melbourne suburbs where burglaries are most violent PM orders inquiry into London tower fire as death toll rises The Sydney Morning Herald Malcolm Turnbull mocks Donald Trump in leaked video 'Everything to lose': Restaurant owner delivers $210 million blow to government PM orders inquiry into London tower fire as death toll rises ABC in damage control after Symons' 'racist' comments 'I had to take a stand': Rebel Wilson set for big payday Brisbane Times Man killed by snapped strap while trying to tow mate on beach Caboolture university campus to switch from QUT to USC Council cracks down on Brisbane's unsightly, unkempt homes 'The fire is here now, goodbye': First London victim identified PM orders inquiry into London tower fire as death toll rises Canberra Times Agency may decide ACT tram route would spoil Commonwealth Bridge vista 'Clearest example of ACT government's stupidity': Canberra farmers making millions Farewell Michael Gordon, a giant of journalism and the most decent of men PM orders inquiry into London tower fire as death toll rises Malcolm Turnbull mocks Donald Trump in leaked video WA Today 'Animal lover' avoids jail for fatal stabbing of Luna the Labrador Paper trail leads to $10k fine for Perth illegal dumper Man killed by snapped strap while trying to tow mate on beach No justice for Luna: owner hits out at conviction handed to dog's killer United staffer videoed pushing 71-year-old to floor Get Started Subscribe today for unlimited access from only 50c a day The Age Share via Email Share on Facebook Share on Google Plus Share on Twitter RSS Feed Products and Services AM Edition PM Edition The AGE for iPad Today's Paper Subscribe Manage My Subscription Subscriber Hub Corporate Subscriptions Digital Subscription FAQs Good Food Guide The Store by Fairfax Newsletters The Age Sitemap About Us Contact Us Subscribers Advertise With Us Text Version Site Accessibility Guide Privacy Policy Conditions of Use Classifieds Place an Ad Cars Dating Jobs Real Estate Commercial Real Estate Oneflare Nabo Tributes Celebrations Our Sites SMH The Age AFR.com Adzuna Domain Drive RSVP Essential Baby Home Price Guide Weatherzone Fairfax Media Account Details News Store Archive Fairfax Syndication Careers Events Press Council Copyright © 2017Fairfax Media Website Feedback Info Save articles for later.

Will Microsoft ever be as 'cool' as Apple? By Cale Hunt Tuesday, Jun 13, 2017 at 10:31 am EDT Will Microsoft ever be able to compete with Apple when it comes to "cool factor?" This can be a controversial question. Microsoft is making great strides in the hardware and software departments, and its new devices, including the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, are constantly compared to Apple hardware. Why? Apple has a certain "cool factor" that many of its loyal fans can't get enough of. Remember those old commercials with Justin Long and John Hodgman, where the stuffy businessman was a PC? Those are partly to blame. Forum member Fahmi Bassem recently started a thread to ask the question of whether or not Microsoft will ever have the same cool factor as Apple, and there are already a bunch of thoughtful replies. FAHMI BASSEM 06-05-2017 02:59 PM “ Twitter if filled with apple stuff before during and after its events, apple related hashtags are at the most popular on twitter (more than 5 #)!!! 136128 Reply Fahmi Bassem points out that Apple-related hashtags are all over Twitter these days, especially during their WWDC 2017 conference. Microsoft hashtags? Not so much. Do you think Microsoft will ever hit the same level of "cool" as Apple? What will it take to reach that level? Head over to our forum now and speak your mind!

Turns out Apple execs were testing new file system on you Craig Federighi explains why Apple forced millions of people to wait ages for their phones to update 13 Jun 2017 at 21:41, Kieren McCarthy It's a recurring pain experienced by all iPhone owners: the huge and very slow software updates that require you to plug your phone in and forget about it for 30 minutes. Many have also wondered why the phone feels the need to shut down, start up again, shut down again and start up again before finally letting you get at it. Well, wonder no more. In an on-stage love fest last week between Apple fanboi John Gruber and senior execs Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi, Federighi – SVP of software engineering – revealed that in the iOS 10.1 and/or 10.2 upgrades to its operating system, it caused every device to upgrade to Apple's new APFS (Apple File System), check it, and then roll back to the current HFS+ system. Asked by Gruber just how Apple managed to be so... so great when it comes to its new file system, Federighi revealed (at around 28 mins into the video): "We actually had this process running for earlier iOS updates. When you updated to 10.1 or 10.2 we were trial-migrating your whole file system, consistency checking it, reporting back to us whether the upgrade was 100 per cent clean and then rolling it back." Trust us That would explain why the 10.1 update (issued in October 2016) had people scratching their heads over its massive size – anything up to 1.6GB for the iPhone 7 Plus. It may also explain the widespread problems that people reported with the updates, including it shutting down unexpectedly while still having a 30 per cent charge with the 10.2 update, issued in December 2016. And it likely explains why Apple had to put out a 10.1.1 update just a week after the massive 10.1 update, because people were continuing to report serious problems. Not that Apple let anyone know about using its entire installed based as guinea pigs – and there is no mention of changing or testing the new file system in Apple's upgrade notes for either 10.1 or 10.2. APFS was finally introduced in iOS update 10.3 at the end of March, three months after the 10.2 updates and five months after Apple first started experimenting on people's phones. Users reported surprise at the fact that it freed up around 10 per cent of the phone storage space as well as increased its overall capacity by around five per cent. Of course, this being Gruber and a theater full of Apple fanbois, Federighi's explanation for why millions of people had to suffer enormous and slow updates as well as phone problems was met with... lots of whooping and a round of applause.

NPR Chief Digital Officer Tom Hjelm also told Variety that the broadcaster is working closely with Apple to bring public radio to the company’s HomePod smart speaker. NPR launched NPR One about three years ago as a way to make its programming available on demand on mobile devices. Since then, NPR has added podcasts and live streams from local NPR stations, and brought the app to additional platforms, including Chromecast, Fire TV, Amazon Echo and Google Home. Related Apple Announces Smart Home Audio Speaker HomePod The new Apple TV app, which was developed by  Bottle Rocket in cooperation with NPR, now makes the same programming available on 4th-generation Apple TV devices. “It’s another weapon in our arsenal,” said Hjelm. Next up will be an integration into Apple’s HomePod, which the computer maker already teased on stage at its WWDC conference earlier this month. “We will be working closely with Apple,” Hjelm said. He went on to argue that voice-activated speakers represent a great opportunity for public radio. “Screen-less experiences — that’s kind of our DNA.” Hjelm said that listening from smart speakers is still dwarfed by the volume that NPR sees from mobile devices, but argued that there is a lot of potential for these kinds of devices. “We are very, very bullish about this space.”   Filed Under: Apple Tv HomePod NPR Want to read more articles like this one?

By Ben Patterson PCWorld | Jun 9, 2017 6:00 AM PT Credit: Ben Patterson / IDG More like this 4 easy ways to keep your iCloud password safe Configuring an old iPad for your child 6 ways to lock down your iPhone’s lock screen Video iOS 11: The top features announced Like it or not, little kids love iPhones and iPads. They love to look at them, they love to tap and swipe the screen, they love playing iPhone games, and most of all, they love watching videos on them. (“Curious George” is my daughter’s favorite—for this week at least.) Giving your little ones a hand-me-down iOS device is an easy way to satisfy their desire for a screen of their own—my kid is the proud owner of an iPhone 3GS and a third-generation iPad. That said, you shouldn’t hand over your old iPhone or iPad without doing some kid-proofing first. Read on for five ways to prep an aging iPhone or iPad for your youngster, from wiping your data and setting up a child’s iCloud account to blocking web access and keeping her from racking up in-app charges on your credit card. Wipe your old data Before you hand over your old iPhone to your kids, you’ll want to make sure any and all of your personal data has been wiped clean. The best way to do so is to perform a “factory” reset, which wipes the iPhone’s storage and returns it to its factory settings. Ben Patterson / IDG Make sure to back up and then wipe your data before handing over your old iPhone to your child. Naturally, you should first make sure you’ve backed up any old iPhone or iPad data you want to preserve. You may already have taken care of this step if you’ve previously upgraded to a new iPhone or iPad and restored your data from iCloud. If not, tap Settings, tap your iCloud profile, then tap iCloud > Backup > Back Up Now. You can also back up your old iPhone or iPad by connecting it to your Mac or PC and syncing it with iTunes. Once you’re satisfied that your data is safe and sound, go ahead and wipe the device. Tap Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Once the reset is complete, your old iPhone or iPad will return to its factory settings, just like the day it came out of the box. Create a child’s iCloud account While it may seem a little soon to, say, create an Apple ID for a toddler, take it from me: it won’t be long before your onesie-clad cutie is walking, talking and pleading for an iPhone upgrade—and when that happens, it’ll be easier to migrate her data and apps if she already has her own iCloud account. Ben Patterson / IDG Just because your child is under 13 doesn’t mean she can’t have her own iCloud account and Apple ID. Even if your kid is younger than 13 years old, she can still have her own iCloud account and Apple ID. All you need to do is create the account under iOS’s “Family Sharing” umbrella. With her iCloud account, your child will be able to sign in to an old iPhone or iPad, download apps, and even purchase items from the App Store—only with your approval, of course. Also, keep in mind that just because she has an iCloud account, your daughter or son won’t be able to start web surfing, tweeting, or posting selfies on Instagram without your say-so. (More on iOS’s parental controls in a moment.) You can create a child’s iCloud account directly on your own iPhone or iPad. Just tap Settings, tap your iCloud username, then tap Family Sharing > Add Family Member > Create an Apple ID for a child. You’ll need to enter your kid’s birthday, agree to some disclosures and legalese, choose a payment method for App Store purchases (which, again, you can control and/or block), then choose an Apple ID username and password. By default, your kid’s new iCloud account won’t let her make App Store purchases without your consent. To double-check the “Ask to Buy” setting, tap Settings, tap your iCloud account name, then tap Family Sharing and your kid’s name. Control what your kid can—and can’t—do on her iPhone or iPad Once you’ve got your old iPhone or iPad set up with your child’s new iCloud account, it’s time to make some decisions on which iOS features will be fair game for your kid, and which will be off-limits. Ben Patterson / IDG Don’t want your child surfing the web or snapping photos on her hand-me-down iPhone? You can block those activities in iOS’s Restrictions settings. Tap Settings > General > Restrictions > Enable Restrictions, then create a Restrictions passcode. Next, scroll down and disable all the iOS features that you’d rather your kid not mess with. You’ll probably want to disable Safari and the iTunes store right away. You may also want to block your child from installing apps, and if you don’t want your little one snapping a million photos of their crib, you might want to nix the Camera app, too. In the “Allowed Content” section, make sure to disable in-app purchases, as well as block music with explicit music and any grown-up movies, TV shows and books. In the Privacy section, you can control which apps can access location services, contacts, the microphone, and more on your kid’s iPhone. At the bottom of the Restrictions screen, you can also disable access to multiplayer games, friend adding, and screen recording for any Game Center-ready games. Hide Settings, Mail, and other Apple apps Even after you’ve thoroughly managed all of iOS’s Restrictions settings, you may still see some home-screen icons on your kid’s iPhone or iPad that you’d rather she not mess with. For example, the Settings icon should probably stay out of her hands, as well as the Mail app, Game Center, and the App Store. Ben Patterson / IDG You can hide the Mail, App Store, and other Apple apps in a folder, preferably on its own home screen in the back. Here’s what I did before I gave my daughter my old iPhone: I hid all those various Apple apps in a “Hidden” folder in the very last iOS home screen. To create a home screen folder, drag one app icon on top of another, name the folder, then start dragging other app icons into the newly created folder. Naturally, older kids who are a bit more iOS savvy may quickly sniff out the “Hidden” folder. My five-year-old, for example, knows exactly where I’ve tucked away the Settings icon, but she doesn’t really care—probably because tapping Settings won’t get her any closer to Curious George. Turn on Airplane mode One way to make sure your little one doesn’t wander into a grown-up corner of the Internet on her iPhone is to cut off Internet access altogether, and the easiest way to do that is to turn on Airplane mode. (Of course, you can kiss Airplane mode goodbye once your children start clamoring for the streaming PBS Kids video app, which they’ll do once they hit about 3 or so.) Just tap Settings, then flip on the Airplane Mode switch. Ben Patterson / IDG Turning on Airplane mode is an easy way to keep tiny iPhone users off the Internet. If your old iPhone or iPad is running on iOS 6 or later, you may also want to disable home-screen and in-app access to Control Center, the flip-up control panel that includes an Airplane Mode button, To do so, tap Settings > Control Center, then switch off the Access on Lock Screen and Access Within Apps settings. That won’t completely disable Control Center, but at least it’ll make it a tad more challenging to find.

Digital Trends Home > Apple > Apple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need… Apple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’ Apple won't build its own car, but its self-driving tech may power your next ride By Ronan Glon — Updated June 13, 2017 9:41 pm Share Why have 1 room when you can have 2? Our favorite transforming homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Apple Car? iCar? Call it what you will: The main question surrounding the Apple Car has switched from “will they, or won’t they?” to “when will it show up?” Official details are sparse and often misleading, but at this point, we’re nearly certain Apple will pry open its war chest to jump head-first into one of the automotive industry’s many pools. Below is everything we know about the Apple car project. The smoking guns Apple isn’t developing a car from scratch; instead, it’s working on fine-tuning autonomous technology. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,”company CEO Tim Cook told Bloomberg. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” He added the company’s research effort is “probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on.” The tech giant wants to get involved in shaping regulation, too. In December, a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was discovered. It offers “comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,” and it contains Apple’s suggestions for how to best “protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation.” “We’ve provided comments to the NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Surprisingly, the Cupertino-based tech giant is becoming increasingly open about its automotive ambitions. It received a permit to test self-driving cars from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in April. Shortly after, a white Lexus RX450h equipped with enough sensors, cameras, and radars to power a nuclear submarine was spotted exiting an Apple facility. Coincidence? We think not. Apple quickly resorted to industrial omertà and chose not to comment on the prototype. In a second letter, however, the company called upon its home state to toughen its policy on testing self-driving cars on public roads. It believes California should require companies to hand over more data to government officials, which could help it catch up with rivals such as Google and Uber that have been developing self-driving cars for much longer. Apple is hardly in a leadership position, unless it’s become very, very good at hiding prototypes. Executives also asked for more details about the use of safety drivers during autonomous testing on public roads. In addition, they believe the requirements that dictate the kinds of cars companies are allowed to test should be loosened. What could the iCar look like? Motorists in the market for Apple’s automobile shouldn’t hold their breath. Realistically, Apple won’t become a full-fledged car manufacturer like General Motors and Ford — at least not in the foreseeable future. However, the company has some of the industry’s top minds — including a few former Tesla employees — developing a modular self-driving platform that it will be able to sell to car and truck manufacturers or to customers. Imagine being able to retrofit your 250,000-mile Toyota Tercel with a full suite of autonomous technology. Apple won’t build a car, but it’s fun to think about what an iCar could look like. Last year, Motor Trend sat down with automotive and industrial designers at the ArtCenter College of Design’s Hillside Campus in California to gather insight on what the iCar could look like, and received mixed responses from both tech and automotive reporters worldwide. Online network ClickMechanic has a few ideas of its own, too, designboom reported. The collective has taken some of Apple’s most iconic products, past and present, and used them as inspiration for the future vehicle. For their iCar Macintosh, for example, ClickMechanic took the “beige, plastic-like feel of the computer as well as its big, square, and angular features to create a true retro automobile.” As for the iCar G3, which is based upon the iMac G3, that rendering boasts “rounded edges and visible motors seen through the back.” Or, there’s the iCar Power, which “lends the same anodized aluminum alloy and delivers a powerful, sturdy, and industrial-looking vehicle — ideal for transporting heavy loads.” Could Apple design powertrains? Apple’s entry into the automotive industry could spawn a few distinct, unusual features. Self-driving technology and streamlined user interfaces are both good bets, but the tech company might also try to latch onto the electric revolution. Sources believe Apple is developing a battery like nothing we’ve seen before. A report claims Apple may be working with a South Korean manufacturer to develop cylindrical lithium-ion batteries with hollow centers. Why hollow? Modern batteries generate a lot of heat due to the chemical reactions taking place; a hollow design increases air flow, which dramatically improves cooling. This reduces the need for additional cooling devices, making the units lighter, simpler, and perhaps even cheaper to build over time. The South Korean firm has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Apple, so at this time its identity is unconfirmed. However, an application filed to the European Patent Office tells us a company called Orange Power is exploring hollow battery technology, and its stable of 33 employees meshes well with Apple’s reticent nature. Could Apple join forces with an established automaker? We’ve heard rumors claiming Daimler, the parent company of both BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is in talks with Apple to co-develop or manufacture the iCar, but German newspaper Handelsblatt claims the negotiations have dried up. Apparently, Apple’s preference for storing vehicle data in the iCloud was a major sticking point for the automakers, both of which have recently put wireless security and data protection at the forefront. The rumors that claimed Apple was on the brink of buying British sports car manufacturer McLaren were also false. “There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,” McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt told Reuters. How else can Apple expand into the automotive industry? In a way, Apple is already a player in the auto industry. Millions of motorists use the company’s CarPlay software, which overrides a manufacturer’s native infotainment system and puts iOS directly in the dashboard of countless new and late-model cars. According to Reuters, the company was also in talks with companies that manufacture electric vehicle charging stations, though detailed information regarding the negotiations hasn’t been made public.
Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Apple boss Tim Cook says self-driving car project… Apple boss Tim Cook says self-driving car project is more of an AI research effort By Bill Roberson — Updated June 13, 2017 2:27 pm Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Why have 1 room when you can have 2? Our favorite transforming homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Siri, take the wheel Apple CEO Tim Cook has finally come clean about Apple’s plans for a self-driving car. Well, sort of. It’d be more accurate to say he’s come clean about a self-driving car system that the company has been working on. In an interview with Bloomberg, Cook said the project – which has been rumored to have the name “Project Titan”– was really more about AI research than actually building and selling a self-driving automobile. Cook called the effort “the mother of all AI projects” and said self-driving tech is a “major disruption” that is looming on the horizon. He said he believes three current technologies – self-driving tech, electric vehicles, and ride-hailing services – will ultimately change the transportation industry. But what will become of Project Titan? It’s not clear, but Apple has filed paperwork to drive around three modified Lexus SUVs to test out their handiwork so stay tuned. Perhaps a child will lead him Some more E3 bits for you: super-hot gaming icon Nintendo gets their time in the spotlight today, but Sony’s reveal of God of War 4 had everyone’s attention yesterday, and for good reason. The game that started out on the Playstation 2 is back, and in a big way. Central character Kratos is off on a perilous journey with his young son, who says “he knows the truth now.” What truth is that? Kratos has some dark secrets in his past, but first, there’s going to be some fighting before there are more father/son heart-to-heart chats. Oh, and there’s a really, really big snake as well – who could be an ally. God of War 4 won’t be released until next year, so to tide you over, hit this link for details and trailers for every game Sony profiled at the big show, and of course, we’ve got full coverage of E3 going on full-time at on our dedicated page. Turns out maybe money can buy more safety We just tested the Tesla Model X electric minivan/SUV, and while we handed back our $162,000 version of Tesla latest people pod without a single scratch on it or French fry in the cup holders, the folks at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, were far, far less kind. They intentionally smacked the thing into a concrete wall at 35 miles an hour, so we hope they have really good insurance. Of course, what they were really doing was testing the crash-worthiness of the car, and Elon Musk and company will be happy to hear their latest creation scored 5-stars on every aspect of the test. They also tested rollover tendency – almost none – and several other safety aspects. The Tesla Model S also received high marks when it was tested a couple of years ago. Tesla claims that since the cars don’t have big heavy engines like gas-powered automobiles, they are able to engineer a much safer vehicle, and so far, both tests and crashes involving the car seem to bear this out. Tesla was stung last year when a driver was killed while their Model S was being driven using Auto-pilot, and it hit a truck. You can watch the videos of the Model X crash test at this link, but it may hurt your wallet to watch it.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Here’s how to check for old 32-bit apps that… Here’s how to check for old 32-bit apps that won’t work with iOS 11 By Carlos Vega — Updated June 13, 2017 1:34 am Subscribe Share Why have 1 room when you can have 2? Our favorite transforming homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Apple unveiled iOS 11 at WWDC, giving us a taste of what’s to come with the latest iteration of iOS. From the new Control Center to various drag-and-drop components, iOS 11 looks to bring a lot of features and enhancements to the company’s popular mobile platform. The bad news, however, is that not all of Apple’s mobile devices — and older apps — will be able to run iOS 11. If you recently downloaded an app and saw a message after you opened it telling you that the app will not work on future versions of iOS, they weren’t joking. Apple will drop support for all 32-bit devices and apps when iOS 11 officially lands in the fall. If you’re running any 32-bit apps, they won’t work once you update to iOS 11. So how do you figure out if your favorite app utilizes 32-bit architecture? Here’s an easy, step-by-step guide on how to check. Checking for 32-bit apps Step 1: Go to Settings > General > About. Step 2: Tap Applications. Step 3: If you have any 32-bit apps, they will show here. If nothing happens when you tap Applications, then that means you have no 32-bit apps installed on your iPhone or iPad. If you see any apps listed here, we suggest you find another app that essentially does the same thing. These 32-bit apps aren’t likely to be updated, and once you update to iOS 11, they will stop working. What about my iPhone or iPad? Just like apps, if you’re holding on to an older iPhone or iPad, you will not be able to run iOS 11. Apple’s upcoming operating system will only support 64-bit devices, which is why 32-bit apps simply won’t work. Before you begin to panic, however, let’s see if your device made the list of supported devices. iOS 11-supported iPhones: iPhone 7 and 7 Plus iPhone 6S and 6S Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5S iOS 11-supported iPads: iPad (5th Generation, 2017 model) iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad Pro (12 , 10.5, and 9.7-inch models) iPad Mini 2 and later iOS 11-supported iPods: If you happen to have a 6th-gen iPod touch, then you’re in luck — you’ve made it to the list as well. If you’re an owner of an older, 32-bit device that didn’t make the cut, 2017 will be an important year for you. If these older iOS devices are not the ones you primarily use on a day-to-day basis, then you can re-purpose them and turn them into a variety of convenient smart home gadgets. But what if you still rely on the old device? Having the latest version of an operating system is not just important for all the nifty features that come along with it, but also for your security. As an operating system gets updated, all the security holes and vulnerabilities get fixed. Such being the case, this may be the year when those of you with older iOS devices have to jump ship and opt for a newer device. Now you just have to choose the platform you want to go with this time around.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Samsung Galaxy Note 8: News and rumors Samsung Galaxy Note 8: News and rumors Samsung Galaxy Note 8 may launch at IFA 2017 in September, report says By Christian de Looper — Updated June 13, 2017 1:31 pm Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Why have 1 room when you can have 2? Our favorite transforming homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Galaxy Note 7 was an excellent device, save for one serious, deal-breaking flaw. Samsung will look to win back your confidence with a successor. Update: The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 could launch at IFA 2017 in September. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was an absolute disaster. Sure, the phone itself was beautiful, but the device was plagued with exploding battery issues, as well as a pair of rocky recall processes. So, it makes sense that Samsung would want to forget about the Galaxy Note line altogether. Samsung has officially confirmed, however, that it will not get rid of one of its most popular phones that easily. In fact, we could see a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 before the end of 2017. According to the most recent reports from SamMobile, the Galaxy Note 8 is internally code-named “Great,” and bears the model number SM-N950F. But what will the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 bring? Here’s everything we have heard about the device so far. Release With Apple expected to reveal the iPhone X as soon as September, Samsung could be looking to beat its rival to the punch. The Korea Herald reports the Galaxy Note 8 may be unveiled in late August to prevent Apple from completely stealing the spotlight. This would line up with the reveals of previous Galaxy Note products. The Note 7 and 5 were also first shown in August at company events in New York, and earlier devices were presented on stage at the annual International Franchise Association (IFA) convention in September. New rumors, however, suggest the device could launch a little later, in September. A report from SamMobile cites internal sources as claiming that the phone will launch at IFA 2017, which is a trade show that will take place between September 1 and September 6. Design A video has been released showing what is claimed to be the Galaxy Note 8’s front glass cover. The panel falls in line with expectations that the Note 8 will feature a design very similar to the Galaxy S8’s, but will be larger. Just like the Galaxy S8, it appears to be curved on both sides, and the cutout for the display matches that smartphone’s wider 18:5:9 aspect ratio. Until now, we’ve only really seen what the front of the Galaxy Note 8 looks like — but now a new image has leaked reportedly showing schematics of the back of the phone. The schematics, which come from Slashleaks, reveal that we’ll likely see a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, along with a dual camera. There’s also a schematic of the top and bottom of the phone, which shows a USB-C port, speaker, and headphone jack. We received what may have been our first look at the Galaxy Note 8 via SlashLeaks in April. The image showed a device resembling a larger Galaxy S8 Plus featuring seemingly sharper rounded corners and slightly slimmer top and bottom bezels, along with an S-Pen by its side. The phone, seen in the photo below, is displaying Bixby software. If you look closely, there is an S-Pen icon near the bottom and what appears to be a transparent UI pullout on the right side of the screen, near one of the hardware buttons. As for the validity of the leak, it’s believable that Samsung would merely enlarge the Galaxy S8’s design for the next-gen Note. However, the shot doesn’t show a compartment for the S-Pen, which calls its credibility into question. At the time of this writing, the image is currently sitting with an 15 percent trust score on SlashLeaks, which indicates most people aren’t convinced by it. Specs There’s no question the Galaxy Note 8 will be powered by one of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line chipsets — but which one? The Galaxy S8, released in April, utilized the company’s Snapdragon 835 processor, while rumor has it the chipmaker will release a slightly improved version, the 836, that will be featured in flagships hitting the market in the second half of 2017. Qualcomm took a similar approach last year with the 820 and 821, and a report from China’s IT Home by way of SamMobile suggests the Note 8 could benefit from the upgraded silicon. IT Home expects a modest bump in clock speed for the CPU in the 836, from the previous 2.45GHz to 2.5GHz, alongside a 740MHz GPU. The article mentions the Google Pixel 2 and LG V30 as two devices that may also receive the 836. Display The Galaxy Note range means a big screen, but how big will Samsung go for the Note 8? According to recent reports, the phone will feature a so-called Infinity Display — similar to the one found on the Samsung Galaxy S8, according to GalaxyClub. According to reports, it’s not just the size, but the pixel count that will stand out. Some rumors indicate it may have 4K resolution. Some might see that as overkill, but the point of it is not for normal use — it is for virtual reality, in which the phone is placed right in front of your eyes. Using a 4K display will help make VR much more realistic. A Weibo post in May reported the Note 8 will receive a 6.3-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 18:5:9. For comparison’s sake, the Galaxy S8 Plus features a 6.2-inch display with the same aspect ratio, which is wider than the standard 16:9 on most devices. The defunct Galaxy Note 7’s panel was 5.7 inches. Software We don’t yet know exactly when the phone will be launched, but according to some reports the device will launch with Android 7.1.1 Nougat — meaning it may not launch with the latest and greatest Android O. That could mean that it will launch before Android O, or that it will get an update soon after it is released, according to GalaxyClub. Camera For the Galaxy S8, Samsung didn’t upgrade the camera much from the Galaxy S7; but it may be saving itself for the Note 8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, better known for his insights into Apple’s future plans, is speculating the Note 8 will have the dual-camera setup many wanted to see on the Galaxy S8. He claims the phone will have 12-megapixel and 13-megapixel sensors, the second providing a 3.0x optical zoom function. That’s beyond Apple and Huawei’s 2.0x zoom mode. He also mentions dual optical image stabilization, and a six-piece lens construction. Samsung intends to beat the iPhone 7 Plus with the Note 8’s dual-lens camera, according to Kuo, and match the camera likely to feature on the iPhone X. This suggests Samsung is planning a late 2017 launch for the Note 8, to take on the challenge from Apple’s iPhone 7S Plus and the rumored iPhone X special edition. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 confirmed While it was possible that Samsung was going to end the Note line altogether in favor of something else, we now know that to not be true. In fact, in an interview with CNET, Samsung’s mobile chief D.J. Koh officially confirmed that the Note line would continue with a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. “I will bring back a better, safer, and very innovative Note 8,” Koh said in the interview. The move will certainly be risky for Samsung — the company and the Note were tarnished during the Note 7 exploding debacle. However, during the entire process the company found that there were a lot of loyal Note fans, Koh said. Bixby Prior to the Galaxy S8’s launch, we were hearing rumors that Bixby would also be a part of the Note 8 as well. Back in January, a report from Business Korea indicated Bixby would feature prominently in Samsung’s flagship phablet. The report also highlighted that Samsung was choosing to work on a successor to the Note 7 despite damage to the brand, which was later confirmed by Samsung itself. Bixby is a work in progress for Samsung, and although it’s not a reason to buy the Galaxy S8, the feature may have increased in usefulness by the time the Note 8 arrives. Not much else is known about the Galaxy Note 8 yet, but we will update this post as we find out more.
Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Apple to auto-update devices to two-factor authentication 12 Jun 2017 3 2-factor Authentication, Apple, Privacy, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Facebook wants to feel your pain (and your joy) Next: News in brief: Google teaches safety; US builds AI spies; new Twitter vulnerability by John E Dunn 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Has Apple really mandated the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) for beta users of macOS High Sierra iOS 11? And would such a thing matter anyway? The short answer is no. Apple hasn’t made 2FA mandatory for everyone, but you can see why beta users already using the older two-step verification (2SV) technology could have misunderstood a recent email received from the company: If you install the iOS 11 or macOS High Sierra public betas this summer and meet the basic requirements, your Apple ID will be automatically updated to use two-factor authentication. This simply means that people already using 2SV will be upgraded to use 2FA instead while those who have never used 2SV at all will stay as they are. Doubtless, a lot of users will be unclear as to the benefits up being upgraded from 2SV to new 2FA so let’s flesh them out. Two-step verification has been available to Apple ID and iCloud accounts since 2013, while two-factor authentication appeared in 2015 for all users running OS X El Capitan or iOS 9 or later. Apple doesn’t say how many of its users run either of these but it’s sure to be a small minority. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Apple’s established 2SV is basically the same authentication security offered by web services such as Google, Twitter, PayPal and Facebook and involves the user registering a phone number and one or more devices in order to receive a one-time code that must be entered along with the Apple service password. This design is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and SIM-swap frauds, which is why Apple wants to shunt users on to its two-factor authentication if it can. In addition to sending users SMS codes in the style of 2SV (for added security, to all registered devices), this can also generate its own offline code using an integrated app. This sounds a lot like Google’s Authenticator app except that it’s more tightly integrated with the OS itself. One interpretation of this is that Apple is, in effect, turning each Apple device into a hardware token capable of generating offline codes. That’s probably an exaggeration because a true two-factor authentication token is always a dedicated object (e.g. the YubiKey or RSA SecurID) that can’t be written to. All true tokens do is generate codes to prove they are in the user’s possession while Apple’s technology emulates this design using software. Google will probably also integrate Authenticator into Android at some point but its ambitions are to develop an authentication system for the whole of the web. Apple, by contrast, is focussed exclusively on its own users, which makes life a bit easier. What Apple still has to do is to get its users to start thinking about authentication to defend against a range of attacks, including recent ransom attacks on iCloud. At some point this layer will become mandatory, simply because it makes sense to do things that way. That moment has not arrived but the direction of travel is clear – Apple’s users should prepare themselves by upgrading now.

Nakamoto says: June 13, 2017 at 1:13 am Does anyone know if Apple is using their Secure Enclave for 2FA on devices that feature one? 2FA seems more secure than 2SV in the sense that it eliminates Security Questions, uses 6 digits (up from 4), and displays the rough location of the authentication request. It also can’t be disabled for new iCloud accounts. Reply Mahhn says: June 13, 2017 at 6:26 pm Future support call. U:Hello Apple support?, AS: Yes how can I help you.

With it seeming ever-more-certain the company will ditch the traditional home button, there have been multiple alternate locations touted on the rumor mill. The most favoured opion is within the display itself, which is believed to be Apple’s preferred solution, should it overcome the technical challenges involved. Related: iOS 11 For a while, folks thought it might be on the rear of the device, but alleged component and case leaks appear to have shot that down. A third possibility appears to be a smaller display, such as the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, but that seems even less likely. So, allow us to introduce to option four; a fingerprint sensor within the… power button? Yes, Apple has been granted a patent for a fingerprint sensor within a power button on the top of a mobile device (via Patently Apple). The patent, entitled ‘Finger biometric sensor assembly including direct bonding interface and related methods,’ was published today. It explains a method for placing the fingerprint sensor within a button, while the diagram to accompany the filing seems to show it in action. How this solution would work remains to be seen. Obviously, the power button is too slim to accommodate a full finger print, so it seems unlikely Apple would go down this route, unless there was some mechanism for sliding a finger across the sensor perhaps? Our money is still on Apple getting the in-display sensor technology right, even if it comes at the expense of an iPhone 8 release delay. Where do you think Apple will end up placing the security feature? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint   Pandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service just a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company. It was nice while it lasted. Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts. Now, in a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it some much-needed cash — and, perhaps down the line, become its new owner. In taking a $480 million investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio provider, Pandora has secured a critical infusion of money it needs to cover basic expenses. And the deal has allowed Sirius XM — controlled by the shrewd media mogul John Malone— to become the leading candidate to one day buy Pandora outright. “With this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry’s most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth,” Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said. Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: “This gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing.” The investment is the latest deal to shake up online music streaming, an industry that is increasingly popular with entrepreneurs and investors but has proved to be a financial sinkhole. Pandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year’s first quarter, to 76.7 million. Spotify, which lets users listen to specific tracks on demand — in addition to themed stations, like Pandora’s — has raised billions of dollars and is preparing for an unconventional listing on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Tidal, a similar streaming service purchased by Jay Z, sold a stake to Sprint this year as it continued to hemorrhage cash. Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition. Pandora was particularly slow to adapt. In recent years, the success of Spotify and Apple Music made it clear that on-demand services that let customers pick virtually any song to listen to at any time would lure customers away from Pandora’s internet radio offering. Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year. “Pandora’s done something sensible,” Mulligan said, “but sensible doesn’t always get enough credit.” Internet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify. This year, Pandora rolled out Pandora Premium, a $10-a-month product that largely matches what its competitors offer. Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit. Enter Sirius XM. The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price. The deal announced Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman. All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months. “Longer term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,” said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie. For Sirius XM — part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media — the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM’s traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars. “This strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for Sirius XM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where Sirius XM does not play today,” said James E. Meyer, Sirius XM’s chief executive. Although Pandora was one of the first to let customers legally stream music online, it has grappled with a host of challenges. Among them has been battling with music labels over the royalties it pays each time it plays a song. Pandora has also made a number of strategic missteps, including buying the ticket seller Ticketfly for $335 million. On Friday, the company said that it was selling the division to Eventbrite for $200 million. The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora’s major financial backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service. Pandora, already reeling, will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday’s complex series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work.

While much of the company's upcoming products remain shrouded in mystery – as evidenced by the numerous surprises at WWDC last week – other works in progress have voluntarily been thrust into the public eye. Alex Webb and Emily Chang report for Bloomberg on the latest big disclosure: After years toiling away in secret on its car project, Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has for the first time laid out exactly what the company is up to in the automotive market: It’s concentrating on self-driving technology. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said in a June 5 interview on Bloomberg Television that amounted to his most detailed comments yet on Apple’s automotive plans. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” He likened the effort to “the mother of all AI projects,” saying it’s “probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on.” Apple's car-related work has been a loosely kept secret to this point due to the various permits and regulatory approvals required to test self-driving vehicles on public roads, but that doesn't make today's news any less surprising. It's one thing to announce a product six months out, or even a year or more out as happened recently with the Mac Pro, but publicly disclosing an entrance into a huge new market – potentially a long while before the product is ready to ship – is a different thing entirely. Cook at least isn't giving away the whole story yet. The end of the Bloomberg story notes: Cook was hesitant to disclose whether Apple will ultimately manufacture its own car. "We’ll see where it takes us," Cook said. "We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do."

Monitise pioneered mobile phone payments and was once a £2billion business which many expected to dominate the industry. But its value collapsed after giants Apple and Google muscled in with rival software backed by all the wealth Silicon Valley could muster.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How to find and compare the best online broker or DIY investing platform 'If they decide to enter the market then competitors should beware because they have such deep pockets – Monitise might have been a £2billion company but Google and Apple can draw on hundreds of billions.' Founded in 2003, Monitise floated four years later and quickly became the toast of the City, winning backing from big hitters such as Visa, MasterCard and Telefonica. The firm developed a star-studded list of clients, with payment systems for Santander and most other UK banks, and tie-ups with well-known names including Premier Inn.  But envious eyes were watching from across the Atlantic – and in 2013, Apple began top-secret talks with Visa, MasterCard and US lenders about its own service. The proposals were deemed so sensitive that one firm involved, Wall Street giant JP Morgan, held all discussions in a windowless 'war room' to prevent details from leaking out. Of the 300 people who the bank set to work on the project, only 100 were told that Apple was the partner. Apple Pay is a sign of how the tech giants have their eyes on the lucrative finance world The iPhone maker finally announced its plans to enter the market with Apple Pay on September 9, 2014.  Nine days later, Visa said it was looking to reduce its stake in Monitise – sending shares crashing around 35 per cent. Google launched its Android Pay system the same year, hammering another nail into the company's coffin. Meanwhile, losses were stacking up and bosses were jumping ship.  Monitise issued three profit warnings in 12 months, co-founder Alastair Lukies – a former professional rugby player – quit, and his replacement Elizabeth Buse departed soon afterwards, quickly followed by chief finance officer Brad Petzer. Since midway through 2015, it has lost £528million.  The firm put itself up for sale two years ago. Chief executive Lee Cameron, who earned £344,000 in the year to June 30, 2016, said Monitise clients would be 'served well' by Wisconsin-based Fiserv whose offer of 2.9p per share is 26 per centmore than the company's 2.3p closing price before the deal was announced.  Fiserv, whose boss Jeffery Yabuki was paid £7.8million in 2015, is the latest foreign firm to buy a UK company after the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote made British companies look cheap.  There are concerns the UK is bad at supporting tech companies once they get beyond being a start-up. Many struggle to find the billions of pounds needed to reach the next level in the City, and are forced into the arms of the Silicon Valley giants so they can carry on growing.

Jason Snell shares the details on Six Colors: New extensions to Apple’s podcast feed specification will allow podcasts to define individual seasons and explain whether an episode is a teaser, a full episode, or bonus content. These extensions will be read by the Podcast app and used to present a podcast in a richer way than the current, more linear, approach. (Since podcast feeds are just text, other podcast apps will be free to follow Apple’s lead and also alter how they display podcasts based on these tags.) Users will be able to download full seasons, and the Podcasts app will know if a podcast is intended to be listened to in chronological order—“start at the first episode!”—or if it’s more timely, where the most recent episode is the most important. As the world of podcasting has grown, there is now a more diverse selection of shows than ever before, leading to the need for more nuanced formatting of those shows. I appreciate how Apple is implementing these changes at a feed level so that third-party apps can take advantage of them as well. The full array of podcasting changes, including a brief walkthrough of the redesigned Podcasts app in iOS 11, were first covered in a session from WWDC.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES The 10.5” iPad Pro: Future-Proof iOS 11: The MacStories Overview Readdle Brings Split View Drag & Drop to Their iPad Apps This week's sponsor V for Wikipedia A Reading Interface To Discover The World A Frontline Perspective on the Birth of the iPhone→ Linked By John Voorhees The Verge has a lengthy excerpt from Brian Merchant’s upcoming book, ‘The One Device: the Secret History of the iPhone.’ Merchant’s book chronicles the development of the iPhone from the recruitment of engineers, designers, and others at Apple, through the battles over its hardware and software implementation. What’s unique about the excerpt of ‘The One Device’ is that it doesn’t try to fit the story of the iPhone’s development into a neat and tidy straight-line narrative. Instead, the excerpt embraces the messy, twisted path the product took from inception to launch. The first battle was over hardware and whether the iPhone would be a multitouch device or an adaptation of existing iPod hardware. According to Merchant, an iPod-based Apple phone made the first calls: The first calls from an Apple phone were not, it turns out, made on the sleek touchscreen interface of the future but on a steampunk rotary dial. “We came very close,” Ording says. “It was, like, we could have finished it and made a product out of it… But then I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ” Once it was decided that the iPhone would be a multitouch device, the battleground shifted to whether the operating system would be based on OS X or the iPod’s OS: “At this point we didn’t care about the phone at all,” Williamson says. “The phone’s largely irrelevant. It’s basically a modem. But it was ‘What is the operating system going to be like, what is the interaction paradigm going to be like?’ ” In that comment, you can read the roots of the philosophical clash: The software engineers saw P2 not as a chance to build a phone, but as an opportunity to use a phone-shaped device as a Trojan horse for a much more complex kind of mobile computer. Ultimately, the iPhone was released as a touchscreen device that sported a stripped-down version of OS X, and has proven to be the mobile computer that its creators envisioned. What I like most about the excerpt, and why I immediately purchased the book, is that it tells the story of the iPhone from the perspective of the people who worked on it, which provides details that only the engineers and designers working on the front lines can bring to life. ‘The One Device: the Secret History of the iPhone’ by Brian Merchant will be released on June 20th and is available for pre-order on the iBooks Store and Amazon.

Amanda SouthworthJun 13, 2017 4:21PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Whether or not you’ve heard of it, WWDC is the one thing that impacts the technology around you every year. WWDC (which stands for World Wide Developer’s Conference) is hosted by Apple annually, as they release their new technology. Sounds nerdy? It completely is. But the main event, otherwise referred to as the keynote, is where Apple unveils the new hardware and software in the upcoming year. Even if this sounds like the most boring event ever, Apple gave developers amazing new technology this year to increase your experience on the iPhone, such as ARKit, and CoreML. ARKit gives developers the chance to use augmented reality within the code for iOS apps, which creates things like Snapchat filters, and the Pokemon Go interface. CoreML gives developers access to use machine learning, to train your iPhone to use what input you give it, and based on that, use it to categorize or guess certain items. Machine learning is used in the predictive keyboard, which guesses what you’re about to say as you text, and can be seen in the Photos app, where the app uses machine learning to recognize faces. The week continues with sessions and labs, where Apple staff and engineers discuss technology used in development, and answer your questions regarding specific API’s, otherwise known as Application Program Interface. Lunch is served daily, along with lunchtime talks from people from all different walks of life. And on Thursday, Apple holds the Bash, where a band performs and food is served. The event can be seen as one giant celebration from everyone in the community who is able to attend. facebook dialog Pinterest Courtesy of Amanda Southworth But, developers don’t see it as a strictly tech-orientated conference. As quoted from a fellow scholar, “WWDC is like Disneyland for developers.” And it’s incredibly obvious that within the community, it isn’t just a nerd cult gathering. It’s more of a family reunion. From the first day of arrival, fellow attendees recognized one another and greeted each other with warm and open arms. Even if it’s your first time attending, you’ll soon be welcomed into a community full of diverse and loving people. The community showing up to WWDC was unique, as well as the people working the community, who were POC, handicapped, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. And Apple’s attendee policy strictly forbid discrimination from anyone, which nurtures a creative and loving environment. People from all over the world gathered to be there, and you might even meet people whose work you recognize — I met the developers behind Tumblr, Grindr, and the people who created the Photos app, and other apps commonly used in your day-to-day life. Unlike many other companies, Apple strongly believes in their values, as shown when I was given the opportunity to meet Esther Hare and Shaan Pruden, two of Apple’s most influential employees. Esther and Shaan, who have been working at Apple for 11 and 28 years respectively, are both closely involved in developer. Both are strong women at Apple, who encourage diversity and inclusion in tech. Even more so, both were completely warm and welcoming to anyone who crossed their paths, and were hospitable to everyone they spoke to. Everyone attending and working the conference worked together to create a rich atmosphere of a safe place, and helped sum up WWDC into the one word that describes it best: family. facebook dialog Pinterest Courtesy of Amanda Southworth Even then, if the dazzling conference and warm people weren’t enough, it was hosted in the heart of San Jose, a culturally rich area, surrounding by coffee shops, and even the occasional horror-movie-themed donut shop, also known as Psycho Donuts. The placement of the convention center made it easy to run into any attendees in a coffee shop, or on the flight to or from the conference. Personally, my favorite place was the Boba Bar, which in addition to serving delicious food, also had a cat on site, who also had her own house. Petting a cat is a great way to relax after listening to technical talks for around 6 to 7 hours. If that doesn’t pique your social interest, consider the multiple parties hosted by separate tech companies, which frequently give out free food, clothing, and if you’re lucky, a job opportunity or internship. The entire surrounding area of San Jose acts as a meetup space for the developers visiting it, giving them a place that feels like home for the five days of the conference. To developers, WWDC isn’t just a conference. It’s a gathering of talented people, coming together to celebrate and learn about the new technology Apple holds for them in the future. Personally, I met the most caring, authentic people there from around the world, and forged relationships that I’ll remember for the rest of my life. Although you can watch the session videos on Apple’s website, there’s nothing like experiencing the excitement and anticipation the night before the keynote, or dancing with thousands of other developers after a private Fall Out Boy concert while it rains on a Thursday. Overall, don’t just go to WWDC for the technology. Go for the people.

In the PC gaming world, high refresh rate LCD's have become required purchases for anyone serious about gaming as if you thought 60 frames per second was already buttery smooth, 120fps is a totally new world. I use a 165hz display on my PC, and it has made going back to using "normal" LCD's super difficult. Here's a great demonstration on the difference of smoothness between each frame rate, and the exact problem Apple has to deal with. Chances are unless you're reading this on a gaming PC, 60fps and 120fps look the same, as your monitor is only capable of displaying 60fps. You just sort of need to imagine the difference between 60fps and 120fps as the same jump between 30fps and 60fps: This ultra-high refresh rate of the ProMotion display once again elevates the iPad to something that feels like science fiction, as most things in iOS have since gained a level of smoothness that almost feels fake- It's like when you see a trailer for a video game and are sure it's just one big pre-rendered cut scene and the game turns out to look just like that. It's a weird sensation, and one you're going to need to experience at an Apple Store. This new 10.5" size is also one more iterative step to perfecting the iPad. Last year I picked up the 12.9" iPad Pro and while you'd think the giant screen would be amazing, the device ended up being just too large and too heavy for my tastes in day to day use. The 10.5" iPad Pro is the perfect compromise between the iPad Mini being a bit too small and too close to the Plus-sized iPhones and the slight bump in screen size makes it feel like you're getting a lot of the benefits of the larger pro without the extra size and weight. Of course the new iPad Pros have gotten faster once again, with the new A10X Fusion chip sporting a six-core CPU and a 12-core GPU. Per Apple, this results in a 30% performance boost to the CPU and a 40% boost to the GPU over last year's model. The problem here, much like my first impressions of the iPhone 7, is that while 30% and 40% seem like big numbers on paper, the previous generation iPads aren't devices anyone would describe as "slow." With Apple still selling tons of non-Pro iPads which sport the A9 chip, and iPad Mini's which feature the comparatively ancient A8 chip, aside from the few "pro" apps featured during the keynote there just isn't a ton of motivation for developers to specifically target these top-tier devices. This just leads to things likely loading faster, but again, it's not like apps were slow on older iPads. There's an argument to be made somewhere that maybe the increased horsepower of the new iPads is required to render games at 120fps, but it really remains to be seen how many developers end up adding 120fps support. From speaking to a few different iOS developers, it should be reasonably easy to update games to allow them to take advantage of the new ProMotion screen, but no one is sure just how much more battery that's going to burn. 3D games rendering at 60fps historically have been major battery drains, so doubling that frame rate might be problematic if you're not plugged in. Needless to say, I'm very interested to see how this evolves. Other noteworthy improvements over last year's iPads is the addition of the camera from the iPhone 7. I never really use the back-facing camera of the iPad to take photos, but there's a noticeable difference in quality with the front-facing camera and using Facetime. The four speaker system is fantastic, and honestly, is one of the big reasons to opt for a Pro iPad over a "standard" iPad. The speakers are actually loud enough to watch movies without headphones and have a great experience doing it, versus having the anemic speakers of a non-Pro iPad cranked to full. 512GB as a top-tier option is a welcome addition as well. Admittedly, I'm likely a bit of an anomaly as I download practically everything that gets released on the App Store, but even with 256GB between apps, music, and movies I was always deleting stuff to make space for more. I'd like to think that 512GB is enough to have difficulty filling up, but, who knows. The truly strange thing about this year's release of the new iPad Pro is it almost feel like they released them too early. It's not a surprise that third party software support for the ProMotion display is nearly non-existent on day one, but most of what Apple pitched for these new iPads during the WWDC keynote is all the incredible new multitasking things you can do between manipulating files and using the new dock to rapidly switch between apps. None of that is here yet, leading to the feeling that you've got this new cool thing that doesn't really do a whole lot of cool new things just yet. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel But, hey, it's the new iPad, it's better than the old iPad, and the new screen is super awesome for apps that support it which right now appears to be limited to only the core Apple apps and a small subset of third party apps. If nothing else, it's worth checking out at an Apple Store just to see the huge difference even simple things like scrolling in Safari experience when rendered at 120fps. I'm not sure I'd rush out and buy one right now though, at least until either iOS 11 launches or more developers update their apps. 'Art of Gravity' Now Available, Get Your 3D Physics Destruction On 'Panthera Frontier' Brings Furry Space Battles to iOS and Android Next Week http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive Daring Fireball mentioned a way to see the 120Hz: you can read text clearly while scrolling it. On my old 1st-gen iPad Pro, scrolling text looks fine... but no, you can't really read it. It kind of ghosts. Wish I could have that ProMotion and TrueColor! I must get 3-4 years out of my 12.9 first 🙁 (Will probably stay with the big size—love it.) http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Oh I meant more that 120hz is immediately obvious once you start using the device but there's no way for me to like... take video of it, or something. I experimented with doing 240fps slow-mo video then slowing it down to 60fps but that was a huge failure. http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive Yeah, I'm headed to the Apple Store now to see it in person and feel bad! Steven OConnor I don't see that this is where the upgrade to the 9.7 pro unless if you make money off of this device and you can make money that will pay for this device's purpose to be owned by you I don't really see a reason to upgrade from a 9.7 pro. Two basic reasons why this can never be a laptop replacement through the first one is there way you can interact with your iTunes account it does not give you is detailed breakdown of what you've purchased what you will and how you access your iTunes account financially speaking does not show a balance owed as compared to a MacBook or a Mac or a Windows device. Second biggest reason is besides lacking the ports the biggest reason is you cannot recover a Mac through an iPad. And I'm not counting the idea of using an iPad as a hotspot either though you would burn for your data quite quickly downloading drivers and data to recover your Mac. I'm just saying in general just those basic things alone make this a non-replaceable laptop environment you can do a lot work wise but I still say it's no Mac replacement unless if you're in the light used appointment meaning data entry and less power intensive tasks If you need a lot of ports a lot of drives disc burning any of this stuff then straight up this is not for you http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp iPads have pretty great resale prices still, if you've got a 9.7" Pro and it's in good condition this upgrade would probably only cost you like $150-200, which isn't terrible to have the latest and greatest. *shrug* Valid points though. Steven OConnor All a matter of your use set. I still hold to my opinion. If you have a 9.7 pro there a lot less of a reason to upgrade. If you use this for higher end projects then it may be justified for some. I think for most who have a pro 9.7 may not see this as a reason to upgrade yet. May hold out for the next iteration. Should only get better dancj Of course there's not much point in upgrading from the previous generation - there rarely is. Most people only upgrade their iPhones and iPads once every two or three generations. Then you get a nice big jump each time. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp That's not really true, particularly since Apple started doing their payment plans where you can upgrade your iPhone every year. Steven OConnor So let me ask you this what would you do to make the iPad better besides adding the Mac operating system? I still think some sort of ports even if it was micro USB of something that will not interfere with the aesthetics of it will be quite valuable and go much farther than what they offer now It's kind of funny but Microsoft and Apple come from different sides of the scale one trying to offer laptop replacement LOL I think they can take now it's off of each other Apple more so in the regards of the additional ports or at least some sort of a wireless that that where if you were in proximity of you could have your preferred also top and it would just be a wireless transfer something like that if there really serious about being a PC replacement or a laptop replacement Robert A Elliott I am going to try to replace my 2013 MacBook Pro 13" with the 12.9" iPad. I am 8 years retired from the printing industry and haven't needed Photoshop or InDesign since I left it. I don't make money with my computers any more. I just enjoy using them. So, I was going to go with the bottom of the line 15" MB Pro at $2400. Instead, I am going to try to make the move to the iPad 12.9" at $800! One third the price! Steven OConnor If it works for you power to you. I knock no one's choices in tech. Everyone has different needs or use sets. Jack Wong It could be a desktop replacement, but it depends on what you do. As a IT support, I can remote into the server/computer and get my work done, I could work on just my iPhone when I am on the road. I found it is much easier and better to write/reply email on smartphone than a regular PC, it is just much easier when I have to take a picture and attach to the email. These are just my reasons. As of your concern, I am not sure what you mean by accessing the iTunes account and get a breakdown of what we have purchased, there is a tab where you can find your purchased app, we get email of the purchase that we have to spend money. As for the gift card balance, I could tell my balance from the App Store.app, it is at the bottom of the Feature tab. About the ports, I am not sure if you see the purpose of cloud, I have all my desktop and document files on iCloud, even my pictures. If someone need to get me a document and that is on USB then yes I need a regular PC but these days, I usually asks them to just email that to me. There is no way to make every single person to keep the files on the cloud, specially business files, unless we are hosting our own server. I don't think we will see people using tablet as a PC in the office but I have been using tablet and smartphone as a PC at home for the past few years, because I can remote into my office computer with Remote Desktop app. Moreover, I just setup a AirPrint HP printer for my boss in her apartment, I don't even have to install driver on her iPhone, it just works after I hook up the printer to the wifi there. Moreover, I don't have to install printer driver on her iOS device 1 by 1, unlike PC, I need to download the driver... point it to the IP address... and one by one if there is no Active directly on that network... Grummie Any excuse for apple fanboys to spend more money Quadzilla Great review Eli as always. My friend picked one up yesterday and he felt pretty much exactly how you do. He had the 12.9 and too big for day to day but this seems to straddle the line of big but still practical. As for trying to convince touch readers to buy one ? Good luck when most do not want to even pay $1.99 for an app as they find that too expensive and will wait for a sale :D.

On Tuesday, the iPhone maker issued a $1 billion green bond to fund renewable energy generation. It builds on $1.5 billion worth of bonds the Cupertino, California-based company sold a year ago to further its goal of running 100 percent of its operations on renewable energy. The bonds, maturing in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than Treasuries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the deal is private. They are expected to be rated Aa1, the person said. The sale was arranged by Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While companies in recent years have issued tens of billions of dollars in green bonds for projects that cut global-warming emissions, the size of Apple’s first issuance fueled speculation that other companies would follow. Business Channel Its latest bond comes less than two weeks after President Donald Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, an international pact to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said last week he sought to persuade the president not to withdraw. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among those that signed an open letter pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple said it plans to use the proceeds to finance projects involving renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, among other things. The latest bond offering includes a focus on advancing Apple’s goal of a closed-loop supply chain, through which products are made using only renewable resources and recycled material. The debt issuance means Apple doesn’t have to tap its vast offshore cash reserves to fund its renewables projects. The company is investing in solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California, including $850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century, and has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Even with cash and equivalents totaling $257 billion, Apple has issued debt totaling $99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most of that money is held outside the U.S. and would be subject to a 35 percent corporate income tax if it were repatriated.    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

Google hires ex-Apple chipset veteran to help design SoCs for Pixel phones Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/13 11:36am PDTJun 13, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 195 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Google's hardware plans for the future are getting bigger. Variety is reporting that Google has hired Manu Gulati, a hardware architect, away from Apple. Gulati is reported as having previously played a significant role in the development of Apple's SoCs for the last eight years and was hired sometime in the last few weeks. His new title at Google is Lead SOC Architect, and he's expected to work on custom chipsets for future Pixel phones. If Manu Gulati can apply the same black magic to Google's future products as he did on Apple's custom chips, things could be fantastic. Apple's "A" series chips are amazing pieces of hardware. Though Apple does license ARM's tech, unlike other manufacturers, they don't just toss the licensed reference designs on a wafer. Apple has bent over backward to optimize their silicon architecture for iOS, and the resulting performance on Apple devices definitely demonstrates that. Although some Android chipset vendors, such as Qualcomm, do make custom designs like the Kryo, for whatever reason Apple's custom hardware (combined with their software) has held an edge in performance for years. For most of us, any advantage the A series chips have doesn't make any difference without the Android operating system. But if Google is able to bring the same degree of performance enhancements and customization over into their future hardware, the future of Android SoC performance could be bright. After the dark and regressive ages of the Snapdragon 808/810 and Qualcomm's rushed 64bit development cycle, I would like nothing more than to see Google bring a first party chipset in a future Pixel device. And who knows, they might even sell it to other manufacturers, increasing competition in the currently stagnant mobile chipset space. Gulati joining Google finally lends credence to the old stories of Google's interest in SoC designing. And it appears to be full steam ahead, as supplemental job postings for SoC design have appeared on Google Careers. Whether these efforts result in a new custom chipset by Google, or we just see some new specialized hardware for machine learning, either way, things should be interesting.

Now Google just needs to start selling Pixel devices in South America (or specifically in Brazil). Leonardo Loures Quirino Amém! Renan Hehe. I knew more brazilians wanted Google's stuff. Yoshi Everyone here wants it, bro. Look at all the people wishing the good times of Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and 5 selling in almost every good store. Renan I know. I'm one of these people, lol Lucas de Eiroz ™ Google Pixel, Google Store, Android Pay (and Google Wallet), and all Google services! Renan I'm dying for Android Pay! Random! They'd better reduce their prices first by at least 50% Renan That would be a dream, too. Ricardo Ferreira If they are priced like Moto/Lenovo is, it should be a blessing. Take the Moto G5 for example and you'll see that our price isn't that far off. Freek Smulders This could be yuge! Lord Argyris Bigly big league! Duder12 HUGE kabiluddin Guess we'll see the new custom soc in late 2018/9 Honestly can't wait. destinyhud pixel 3 then!!! Godspoken I recall "Google silicon" being referenced last year as a future goal of the Pixel, very exciting. blackice85 Isn't that one of the things holding them back from providing updates for longer periods of time too? Could be a big deal not just for the performance gains. Gregory That Project Treble thing or how do you call it in O is also all about cutting on dependencies from third parties like Qualcomm. blackice85 Oh I hadn't heard about that, I bet this is one aspect of it then. Duder12 Project Treble doesnt improve years of update support. It brings updates faster since Qualcomm and OEMs can work on software updates at the same time. Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. Google doing their own SOC is the only real answer Gregory From my understanding, it eliminates the need for the drivers to be updated in the first place. someone755 You can't expect to not update drivers with new Android versions. Say there's an Android system API that a driver adheres to. As something banal, let's say we have a driver that controls whether the hardware button backlight is on or off, and that the system can control whether it is either on or off. Then a newer Android version appears which supports both the old API but also a newer one, wherein the hardware backlight can be controlled as if it were analog (from 0-255 for example). Then, the third system version comes out that ditches support for the old API and only still supports the newer one. Yes the OEM could hack things up so that values 0-254 would mean the light is off and then 255 would mean it's on, but this further complicates both the user experience and app compatibility as well as future system version compatibility. At this point if you want a stable and future-proof software solution, you absolutely have to update the driver to support the new API. And if the backlight vendor can't provide one, then it's more trouble than it's worth for the OEM to do the hack themselves and they just post a note online saying your device won't get upgraded, leaving you with no choice but to either resort to community hacks or buy a new device. Yes the example is completely idiotic but it serves as an example of why you can't go around updating devices without driver updates. Aside from the functionality aspect there are many security flaws that could affect a driver. And not updating that huge gaping hole in your security while providing monthly 'security patches' that claim to solve security threats is just inane. At that point why even bother with security patches if you can't expect chipset vendors to fix the problems in their closed-source firmware, or hold them accountable for it. Gregory While I completely understand your point, I'd like to extend it to say that there could be such a backlight that can be either on or off, and it's a hardware limitation, so it isn't possible to fully implement the new API on that device. I mean, hardware configurations vary, it's a matter of fact. The point of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is to abstract away the differences across the underlying hardware, and provide a unified API for the system services to interact with said hardware. If the HAL doesn't provide support for some new feature that was added in a system update but the hardware could technically support it, it still means that the system would behave as though that feature isn't supported by the hardware, and that's it. I'd rather have a device that doesn't support that new feature than a device that is no longer updated. And security... How about people ALWAYS check for buffer boundaries before copying memory? What do they do with all that time and disk space they save? Or, at least, if they're that lazy, run a static analyzer on your code and fix whatever it finds. And run it in valgrind to find memory leaks. It's not that hard to write vulnerability-free code from the start. someone755 But a device will never pass certification, either by Google or an FCC-like entity or another office, with broken features. This is exactly why the 8974 line got dropped -- the hardware didn't support a feature that Google wanted so they didn't let any 8974 device pass CTS. How do you think people running Nougat just fine on their hammerheads (via one custom ROM or another) feel about this conundrum when they've been cut short an entire system update because of Google's insane chip requirements? It's easy to know how to prevent bad code but often times projects start simple and private and unoptimized, and then grow into something much larger that's hard to maintain. A classic example is Android itself (look at all the memory leaks that L introduced). Gregory Well... If a device passed certification by Google (CTS) and carriers, that feature was optional from the beginning, right? Android does already support a plethora of different hardware configurations with different capabilities. If a device didn't have some feature at launch, I don't expect it to have that feature enabled with a software update. CTS is about keeping compatibility with apps (it tests public APIs), it has nothing to do with drivers and hardware. There are literally no hardware requirements that make it impossible to update existing devices more than a year or two. Carrier certification is about device interfacing correctly with carrier equipment, it did so well when it was released and certified, so just don't touch the modem firmware because it's already doing its job good enough, as simple as that. There are exactly zero reasons to modify the HAL for system updates provided HAL and the rest of the system are properly separated, which, from my understanding, they are with Project Treble. It also adds CTS-like standardized test suite for these things. What the hell is 8974? someone755 Msm8974. The Snapdragon 800 platform that phones like the N5, Z3, G2, S5, M8 etc were based on. That got blocked from receiving any sort of updates because Google decided that Vulkan or GL 3.1 was necessary for the upgrade. Not that modern low-end phones are capable of performing the task that the requirement was set for anyways. Basically the thing my entire argument is set around but alright... Owais Lone > Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. ... and Project Treble will enable device vendors to still ship updates in this exact case. Project Treble cuts out qualcom and SoC manufacturers out of the update cycle. The device vendors will be bottleneck and decision makers now. someone755 This is incorrect. Please see my reply to Gregory above. Owais Lone Your example exactly illustrates the problem now. Project Treble is supposed to abstract these internal hardware level ABIs/APIs so vendors don't have to re-implement the whole layer again. Only time when SOC vendors will have to update their code is when Project Treble itself comes out with a breaking change and a major version upgrade. Of course, vendors might have to or want to make changes here and there but the abstraction should save them from re-doing all of it on every update and if the vendor does not want to improve/optimize with every update, they shouldn't have to make any changes at all unless Treble itself comes out with an incompatible update. someone755 And say that Android P is the one where the button backlight brightness from my example becomes an analog value and the digital on/off API is dropped. Then the phones that incorporate this function will either have to have the driver updated or will not get updated to the next Android version. This is a problem and always will be, as long as chip vendors are not held responsible and held to a higher standard, and as long as the entities that certify devices for daily use (CTS, FCC etc) have some standards themselves (in the sense of not letting devices with broken/missing core features pass). Owais Lone If such a change happens at the HW level, it'll be abstracted at the treble API level so phones that leverage treble API will not need any change at all. Vendors would need to update their code if the change happened in Treble's apI itself which is extremely unlikely as it'll defeat the purpose of having Treble in the first place. That said, there will be major updates to Treble which might break backward compatibility but it's Google's job to keep those changes at a minimal or the whole idea will be worthless. someone755 This is exactly what I'm saying -- if Treble changes (which it most probably will across Android versions, as the system has changed until now), the chip vendors will *have* to provide updates. And there is no way around this limitation, Treble or not, if Google makes some absurd changes then phones won't get updated. Owais Lone Yes, that is true but why would that happen in the first place? That would completely defeat the purpose. Treble will most likely always be backward compatible. It'll probably only add new features and new APIs but not break existing ones. That's how I would handle the project. Sukrith Krishnakumar If I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! Suicide_Note Your loss. MJ How about you wait for the reviews first before deciding to skip it or not? Sukrith Krishnakumar Even if I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! TheRunner024 This is great news. How long will it take them to build a SoC? 2 years? Keith Taylor Yep bout that long. destinyhud yeah 2 years. they started this in 2015 so i would guess maybe pixel 3 could have google soc Daniel I've always been a Snapdragon all the way kind of guy, but this would definitely fix updates, give better performance, and bunches of other stuff. I'm a convert. Ditch you Snapdragon. Renan I'm with you. As long as this brings longer support for Google's devices, I'm in. psy spy Always Snapdragon? What choices did you have? Iwanova Nvidia & Mediatek? (I know, Mediatek have no source code, but still. It's mobile SoC right) jesuguru Exynos? Nomaan There was quite a competition until 2012 when we had Snapdragon, Exynos, Tegra, OMAP, NovaThor in the SoC game. Lateef Alabi-Oki Anything to put Qualcomm, with their shitty inefficient power-hungry proprietary insecure SoC drivers, out of our misery is welcome. h4rr4r Please get the drivers in mainline or at least GPLed and into AOSP. MJ I am not as excited (yet) as most of you are about this. I see two possible scenarios coming out of custom chipset from Google... 1.) The main reason Apple's SoC performs better is because it's optimized for iOS and only iOS. It is not properly documented so no other OS can really run it. I would rather stick with a Qualcomm SoC if Google goes down this road. 2.) Google creates a fully open and documented SoC but it performs no better than Apple's or Qualcomm's chips. I would prefer a fully open and documented chipset that can compete as good or better than anything else out there. Possible? I don't know... Regardless, I suspect Google is looking to make some custom hardware for AI or VR first before we see a custom chipset for a phone.

MadMartigan I'm guessing he's just really proud of his ability to copy and paste and is just showing off. Hey, some folks never even get that far. ;-) Thinker Geekbench is comparable across platforms. Therefore A10x chip (for example) will outperform Qualcomm chip on Android as well. MJ I am sure it may BUT it will perform even better with iOS. Android will never run on a A10x SoC so who cares? My point is I am not interested in a chipset that can only run Android. reggjoo That would be a fair test if you could load a "neutral​" os on both platforms, then run test. It will never happen though.

Phoenix keep on dreaming Thinker Apple A10x: Single thread 3900 Multi thread 9300 ------------------------- MacBook Pro 2016 intel: Single 3900 Multi 7700 No, Qualcomm S835 is far away from coming close to intel. Now, apple A10x is very competitive especially considering that A10x is fan-less design. Enough said. Just_No_Stop Firstly you dont say which Intel chip, the fastest laptop chip is WAY faster than the A10x. Secondly, they run 2 totally different OSes, one is very much single threaded, that can run limited threads when it does run multi-thread, and as such can dedicate the entire CPU to the benchmark. OSX is very multi-threaded, and doesnt do that, it will always run more background threads. Thirdly the A10x isnt a phone chip, its a laptop/tablet chip, and actually eats battery like crazy when full throttle, and gets very hot when it does, and as so doesnt do so for long. Thinker Geekbench 4 is functionally same across all platforms. Thus comparable. Read Geekbench blog. Oh forgot one more thing...A10x has 3 CPU cores while Intel chip above has 4 CPU cores. That only further makes multi-thread score more impressive!! Intel chip above is standard intel in base Macbook PRO in 2016. If you take fan out of Intel devices, then would that equalize things for you?? Lol. Wanna bet which will be better?! Just_No_Stop It might be functionally the same, but the OS is not, and despite claims (by the developer which has a bias to sell its product) its not comparable across platforms. It doesnt even generate the same score on the same CPU between OSX, Linux and Windows, let alone iOS and android. The base Macbook Pro from 2016 has 2 cores, so again.. which chip is it? The A10x cannot run full throttle for long, the Intel can run flat out all the time, doing the same task, if even remotely prolonged, the Intel will win. The Intel is all much more flexible than the A10x. It capable of unoptimised maths that the A10x would simple die a death trying to run. Its is at least an order of magnitude faster than the A10x, which a full desktop class OS needs. Thats why there is no A10x powered Macbook Pro. Thinker Intel has a fan. Take out fan and what happens? Just_No_Stop It would probably not be able to run as long, but it would more than manage the few seconds per test of Geekbench. Thinker Huh?! Wtf?! Please stop talking. Just_No_Stop How is that not true? I have run geekbench multiple times on my laptop and desktop, and the fan doesnt kick in on my laptop and doesnt throttle up on my desktop. Its a very brief, and very poor benchmark. You still fail to understand how the usage scenarios in an iPad Pro and a desktop class PC are completely different, which is why one goes for single core performance, and the other multicore. So i will repeat, its not that Intel cant beat Apple, its that they dont need to. Its made even worse by the fact that most laptops are seriously storage speed limited, even an SSD only helps so much, and the CPU is still waiting. The A10, in a laptop would be awful. One core would be almost always in use for background tasks, and as such would burn through battery. Android is not that dissimilar, it has far more background activity than iOS, and therefore needs less powerful, more numerous cores that use less power. The trick is making all those cores useful when you need to run a single powerful task. This is something that Android has got much better at, but it doesnt really show up well in benchmarks. Thinker The Apple iPad PRO 12.9 from 2015 with merely 2 CPU cores active at any single time (Apple A9X) and 4 GB of RAM. Yet with iOS11, it can run FOUR active windows at once. Yes, 4 windows all active and you can interact with all 4. Now, on the other hand, on Android with those 8-12 cores of CPU, you see apps constantly being kicked out of memory despite 6-8 GB RAM! Background activity you say? BS! BTW, a single powerful task does NOT need 6-8 cores of CPU. Again, please STFU! You’re really embarrassing yourself! Hrishikesh Bisen You are a plan idiot. Thinker Cross-Platform Designed from the ground-up for cross-platform comparisons, Geekbench 4 allows you to compare system performance across devices, processor architectures, and operating systems. Geekbench 4 supports Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Source: Geekbench. Just_No_Stop Source.. the company that makes and wants to sell the benchmark. Unfortunately reality doesnt support that claim. Thinker Lol. Geekbench is universally accepted. Just_No_Stop by plenty of sites that have no idea how it works, which is most of them. Thinker Here's a comparison of interest: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/3042292?baseline=3036382 Just_No_Stop iOS is not comparable to Windows 10. The Intel chip is 18% faster than the A10X in multi-core. geekbench does very badly with hyperthreading, which for applications that make use of it adds a huge performance advantage. Many apps now use it. It should also be noted that the A10x is a SoC, that includes hardware acceleration for some things that the Intel chip isnt designed for, and has little use traditionally on Laptops, this further distorts the score in the A10x favour. Dont get me wrong, its a good CPU, but its not all that. If there was an ARM Windows 10 it wouldnt run as well on the A10x as x64 windows does on Core iX. It should also be noted that there are 3 SoC that beat the standard A10 on Android, which also is more background threaded than iOS, and as such cant dedicate 100% of the CPU to the benchmark. Thinker Remind me...doesn't intel have that TURBO thingy? 3 Android SoC that beat A10?!?! 😂 Dude, you make me laugh!! Hint: single core is far more important. And remember A10 is dual core at any one time unlike Android SoC. Some of those Android are actually firing up all EIGHT cores to beat Apple's two!!! Just_No_Stop Single core is more important on iOS, not Android. Do you really think ARM and Qualcomm and Samsung, who have been at this for years, cant make a CPU as fast as Apple? They can, but the platform doesnt require such Single core performance, and making a CPU like that would hurt performance of Android, not help it. ARM has done extensive testing of such setups, but has rejected them for a reason. If you must know the A10 is very similar in structure to the Intel Core, which is why its fast, but its also why it cant run 4 cores and be power efficient. Its clear you have no idea how a CPU works, or an OS, and you put WAY to much faith in a commercial benchmark. Thinker Let's test your knowledge since you claim to know so much...how many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? No, Samsung and Qualcomm do NOT use custom design cores dumbass. They use generic core design from ARM. In fact I believe S835 CPU core design took a step backward too. But you know all this already. APPLE uses fully custom cores designed upon ARMv8 architecture. What you wrote is pure ignorance. Please stop. Just_No_Stop Qualcomm do use custom designs, Samsung doesnt, and yet the Exynos 8895 is faster than the A10.. It seems you are the ignorant one. Thinker Wrong. Anandtech: "The new Kryo 280, despite the similar name, shares no design DNA with the original Kryo. Its an octa-core, big.LITTLE configuration with four “performance” cores and four lower-power “efficiency” cores. What makes Kryo 280 unique, however, is that it’s the first design to use ARM’s new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" (BoC) license, which allows vendors to customize ARM cores. This new semi-custom option gives vendors the ability to differentiate their products from those using ARM’s stock cores while avoiding the more costly route of creating a fully-custom design from scratch." Again, like I said above, S835 CPU core was a step BACKWARDS. It is basically a generic CPU core with memory controller from Qualcomm. S820 used custom cores but with S835, Qualcomm used generic. Again, you never answered my other question. How many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? STFU dude. You are ignorant. Just_No_Stop You realise that a SoC isnt just the cores right? The memory controller and GPU are what make the 835 custom. If the 835 and the Exynos are generic then why is the Exynos faster despite a lower clock? Again, you lack understanding, all you can do is regurgitate rubbish you have read on a website. Exynos is almost entirely ARM reference, the 835 is not, generic cores maybe, but otherwise completely custom. Sadly all that customisation results in lower performance, not more. Why does it matter how many instructions per cycle it can do? What matters is the total performance. Instructions per cycle is a very old fashioned way of looking at CPU speed, more so than ever now with multicore setups and microcode interpretors. yet again you show a complete lack of understanding about how a modern SoC works. Anyone could design a CPU like the A10, only apple does, because only Apple need one like that, it doesnt show genius, or more advanced design, its just different to similarly performing ARM and Intel CPUs. Frankly I'm just blocking you now, since you arent interested in learning. Thinker Damn you're ignorant. I see that you're backtracking like crazy!! Lol No, S835 CPU core is generic. No one talked about GPU. LOL INSTRUCTIONS PER CYCLE has nothing to do about CPU speed!! Wtf are you talking about?! Typical Android dumbass who thinks he knows tech. Anyone can design like Apple yet everyone is envious of Apple chip design team, including Google!! You're a dumbass. Thinker Even today, i am still laughing at your ignorance!!! Thanks for the laugh!! PhaseBurn Google's been in the hardware field for a very, very long time, originally using Scorpion ARM-based CPUs that predate the SnapDragon, even (https://www.wired.com/2012/09/pluto-switch/). Despite what Variety says about Gulati joining to design SoCs for the Pixel line, I'm guessing that their internal SoC group will end up working on a lot of their platform networking and datacenter fabric next generation designs, in addition to anything they do on a future Pixel phone. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I'm pretty excited to hear about this news. I've always wanna see Google have their own custom chips for their hardware. Google love plot twist #2 roberto.elena I'm personally more interested in a Google SoC for Chromebooks. It's not that I don't find this news interesting for mobiles, but the biggest benefit, even more important than improved performance, is extended OS support. At the current pace of hardware improvement, I'm not interested in owning a phone for more than 1 or 2 years, but a Chromebook is a different story. I would keep it for several years. destinyhud good point. intel is fast but have issues with android apps. other oem are not that fast enough and qualcomm wont come to chromebook at least for now. so this chip used in chromebook pixel would be awesome Midnitte Sort of wish somebody (Intel, AMD,.... Google) would purchase MediaTek and position them to actually compete with Snapdragon, so that we could all benefit from longer/quicker upgrades, not to mention performance. someone755 MediaTek's strategy is much like AMD's was just a few years ago in the desktop space. The money for them is up to where OEMs (who make low-end and midrange phones) are willing to pay for the chips -- any higher and they don't have the knowledge/technology/budget to produce something more powerful. Any lower and, well, this is as low as it can go, and the other competitors (Qualcomm, Intel) have worse-performing chips available for the price that MediaTek offers theirs at. Why that is, I have no clue, but I suspect it could have something to do with Qcom having a monopoly on ARM-based chips, and Intel thinking that their overpriced-desktop-chips-with-no-competitor strategy is going to work here, in a highly competitive environment. The point here being that MediaTek works off tight margins and sells in large quantities. Restructuring this process so that it fits our idea of a Qualcomm competitor would be expensive, and definitely riskier than what the payoff is worth to the investor. reggjoo Maybe he can help bring that single core performance up to apple levels. It won't really make a big difference in the global grand scheme of things, but it would kill all that bragging rights talk. usamaisawake I know we can never know, but I honestly think that the A-chips are, on their own, just really damn good chips. iOS optimization helps, but I think a lot of it is Apple's designers. Marty I'm liking the sound of that. But going by Google's declaration that the Pixel phones are made by Google when in fact they are designed and made by HTC, these SoCs will probably be shelf-bought from the cheapest vendor. destinyhud i am sorry u r wrong at this part. designed by google and made by HTC. same like apples designed by apple claim. Marty Wrong. It's now known the Pixels were designed and made by HTC. http://www.androidauthority.com/google-hidden-htc-involvement-google-pixel-xl-code-723953/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/05/the-pixel-smartphone-is-actually-made-by-htc-not-google/#52ca3eb1e99a https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-htc-will-real-manufacturer-googles-phones-share-glory destinyhud its now knows to just u or what?? because eveyone know its designed by google. but they def have HTC previous device influence. google interview clearly said they tried to design pixel as non iphone design as possible. we are talking about hardware. finding code reference is not equal to HTC made hardware. how does that login even correlate? all the article u posted said it is made by HTC and i didnt disagree on that. it is made by HTC but designed by Google. try harder. https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/google-pixel-how-google-designed-its-first-real-phone/ Marty Read the AA article. It clearly shows HTC footprints in both hardware and software design. destinyhud AA article says nothing about hardware footprint just software foot print. software is not hardware. also there are similar article which said google was building nexus by HTC and finally decided to make their own phone which is why u could find htc code when it was in early development. we are not talking about software here again. Marty The HTC hardware footprint is clearly seen in the design. And it's noteworthy that the software would have any OEM influence at all since Android is a Google creation. You can claim whatever you want, but the evidence is clear and has been clear since the Pixels were released. Talk to the hand... needa But once you open up the phone, you can see that HTC did not design the hardware inside of it. That is always the tell tale sign. matteventu Yes and the htc logo on the battery is there because they just wanted to sign it? needa HTC doesn't have a battery manufacturing plant (assumption). It's part of being the ODM. Designing a PCB and ordering a battery to fit in a specified area are two completely different things. matteventu Dont waste your time with this bunch of G-fanboys... Marty Agreed. One thing, though, they seem to always forget is "Made by Google" when the Pixel isn't made by Google. Apple doesn't even say that about the iPhone, though every aspect of the iPhone is Apple all the way. But Google gets a pass on that lie because, as you said, they're G-fanboys. They always present excuses like..."well, it was designed by Google, that means it's made by Google." The Pixel isn't even designed by Google much less made by Google. But I guess since Google decided to lie, the chose to go all out on the lie... "This lie made by Google" Heh...Google did design and make something...lol...a lie. saf1927 If they do indeed design the SoC in-house, obviously they won't actually manufacture them since they don't own any semiconductor company, just like Apple. They will hand in the specifications to a foundry such as TSMC. Marty You'd think they'd do it that way, but Google did lie about the origin of the Pixels. If Google were to emphatically state that a future SoC is designed and engineered by them, who knows if it would be true? whispy_snippet Fucking awesome. Kimmy Gibbler I don't expect them to succeed Total Insecurity The future of Android is bright anyway :) Jordan L So this means Pixel 3 is going to be an awesome phone! I'm with a lot of people here in hoping for a cheaper Pixel. Like $399. Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel Base. I guess this mimicks Apples plan with iPhone 8, and 7s. someone755 Pixel SE. With a 4" display I wouldn't even be mad. Patel Nisha I really hope this turns out to be a big deal, not just some optimisation stuff for 3rd party components. Apple have a HUGE lead now in terms of silicon. Even Samsung’s own chips can’t compete with Apple’s. It can only really be Google who have a chance to catch up at this stage. xyz Good. Now Google fanboys will have one less excuse when Google still doesn't update phones for more than 2 years. Random! I wonder if a new chip design would help to solve the sound latency issue that makes it so frustrating to use apps such as drum emulators on Android. Or if this is really just a matter of optimizing software. Anyway, shouldn't all SoC manufacturers be designing their SoCs with a dedicated microphone co-processor in order to enable always-on hotword/voice recognition which doesn't kill the battery? Maybe that co-processor could also be the one monitoring the sensors...

[Photo: Unsplash user Isai Ramos] By Mark Sullivan4 minute Read During the WWDC keynote last week, Apple announced that the Apple Watch’s next OS (watchOS 4) will allow the device to establish a direct Bluetooth connection to other devices such as blood glucose sensors (for people with diabetes) or smart tennis rackets (yawn). advertisement Or surfboards. Wait. What? Actually, an Apple Watch with a direct connection to a sensor mounted on a surfboard could prove to be a game changer for some surfers. Apple VP Kevin Lynch briefly mentioned an Apple Watch app called Sessions by a small Green Bay, Wisconsin, company called Xensr. The app works with a sensor (the $200 Xensr Air 3D) mounted on the surfboard to capture both wave data and the performance of the surfer. David Troup The GPS radio inside the mounted sensor device, says Xensr founder David Troup, allows it to act as a “wave buoy” that collects all kinds of data about the waves in the area, and can even help forecast future waves. The gyroscope in the device tracks all motions of the surfboard; the number, locations, and sizes of waves surfed; the height of jumps off waves; and the lengths of waves surfed. Until now Xensr users have waited to get back to shore to check out wave and performance data on their phone screen. That’s because the sensor has to sync with a phone to transfer the data. But the new direct Bluetooth support in watchOS 4 will let surfers see the data (in small bits) on their wrist while they’re out on the board, paddling between waves. The data might help a surfer adjust their game in situ to catch more waves and ride them longer. Example: A big part of the art of surfing is sensing the best time—and best location on the curve of the wave—to get up on the board. This is called the takeoff point, and picking the best ones is probably the hardest thing about surfing. The Xensr app might add some science to the art. “It’ll give me a map of all my takeoff points on all my best waves,” Troup told me. That knowledge could inform the choice of takeoff point on future waves. “I may get two or three more turns on that same wave just because of the takeoff point,” Troup says. advertisement Or the app might guide a surfer to better waves. “It might tell me that I need to be a little bit further to the west of where I’ve been surfing,” Troup says. Stephen Baxter, a 37-year-old lifelong surfer who lives in Santa Cruz, California, said the Xensr app could be a useful addition to an Apple Watch user who wants to measure a surf session for fitness, just like athletes measure a run, swim, or bike ride. Baxter says the Xensr/Watch combo can be compared with the Rip Curl Search GPS watch ($400), which shares many of the same features as the Xensr app and comes in a sturdy, purpose-built case. Other products like the Trace sensor ($199) also mount to a surfboard and track similar information such as speed, length of ride, and turn radius. As with the Rip Curl Watch, Trace relays information to a smartphone for review after surfing. “If you own an Apple Watch, and you’re the kind of person who wants that kind of instant info, it could be useful,” Baxter told me. The biggest worry about the Xensr Apple Watch app might be the Watch itself. Surfing presents problems even for conventional watches, Baxter points out. “They often won’t even tell time after exposure to salt, sun, sand, water, and wind–not to mention potential impact with surfboards, rocks, and reefs.” advertisement Assuming your Watch survives, Troup says the Session app will, in the near future, give surfers the benefit of data gathered by other surfers’ Xensrs. This might be especially helpful for surfers who are trying out a spot for the first time. Xensr will also explore a social aspect of the app, which will allow surfers to talk smack among themselves about who owned the gnarliest waves on any given day. You might expect a company like Xensr to operate out of a bungalow in Venice or Malibu, but Xensr hales from Green Bay, Wisconsin. Troup, who holds a degree in artificial intelligence, says he does his surfing (and windsurfing and kitesurfing) on Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The five-year-old company of seven employees has a “field team” of professional boarders in Maui who test the sensor out on the waves. “About the time we’re finishing our software builds here in Wisconsin–around noon–our people in Maui are getting ready to go out surfing,” Troup said. “So when they come back in for breakfast, they can give us their feedback.” Xensr is funded almost entirely by Troup, with some help from local Midwest investors. He’s been talking to West Coast VCs about a fresh round of capital for the company. The West Coast VCs might be a little more appreciative of Xensr’s virtues than the Midwest firms, Troup believes. He’s right. Because many VC people in California are also surfers. Xensr will release its new Sessions app this month, and Apple will begin updating Apple Watches with watchOS 4 this fall.

UCF RESTORES uses virtual reality headsets, scents and sounds to treat post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers to lessen anxiety. Marco SantanaContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy The Orlando division of the tech company AMD received a bit of a surprise at Apple’s annual developers’ conference last week. Baked into an announcement that Apple computers would support virtual reality, in both its high-end computers and external plug ins, the company said it would do so with AMD-built hardware. Joe Cox, AMD’s Orlando-based corporate vice president, said the most significant part is that AMD now has a presence in all of Apple’s products. We caught up with Cox shortly after the announcement. How big of a deal is it to have your product in Apple computers? I’m glad we have unseated Nvidia from those Macs. They made a big deal about the power of the Vega. Clearly, this is a move to solidify its presence in virtual reality. Some have knocked VR. How big do you think virtual reality will become? Virtual reality will be around a long time. It’s definitely something that has arrived and is real. But it will take a long time to work out the kinks. Augmented reality might make more sense right now. Archive: UCF helps fight PTSD using virtual reality » Where do we stand right now? There still needs to be a lot of development in virtual reality. We are still in the flat part of the curve right now but it’s an important feature. How can AMD keep itself in the conversation about graphics processors, in the long term? We undergo constant iteration. Like my boss says: “Until it looks real and you can’t discern the difference, you are not done.” We are not worried about running out of work. We are not worried about any kind of pullback. How has Orlando played into that effort? We are known as a center of excellence for visual simulation. The military, that’s where all of this came out of. It’s part of the story. When you talk about it, you have to recognize that.

Google hires ex-Apple chipset veteran to help design SoCs for Pixel phones Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/13 11:36am PDTJun 13, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 195 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Google's hardware plans for the future are getting bigger. Variety is reporting that Google has hired Manu Gulati, a hardware architect, away from Apple. Gulati is reported as having previously played a significant role in the development of Apple's SoCs for the last eight years and was hired sometime in the last few weeks. His new title at Google is Lead SOC Architect, and he's expected to work on custom chipsets for future Pixel phones. If Manu Gulati can apply the same black magic to Google's future products as he did on Apple's custom chips, things could be fantastic. Apple's "A" series chips are amazing pieces of hardware. Though Apple does license ARM's tech, unlike other manufacturers, they don't just toss the licensed reference designs on a wafer. Apple has bent over backward to optimize their silicon architecture for iOS, and the resulting performance on Apple devices definitely demonstrates that. Although some Android chipset vendors, such as Qualcomm, do make custom designs like the Kryo, for whatever reason Apple's custom hardware (combined with their software) has held an edge in performance for years. For most of us, any advantage the A series chips have doesn't make any difference without the Android operating system. But if Google is able to bring the same degree of performance enhancements and customization over into their future hardware, the future of Android SoC performance could be bright. After the dark and regressive ages of the Snapdragon 808/810 and Qualcomm's rushed 64bit development cycle, I would like nothing more than to see Google bring a first party chipset in a future Pixel device. And who knows, they might even sell it to other manufacturers, increasing competition in the currently stagnant mobile chipset space. Gulati joining Google finally lends credence to the old stories of Google's interest in SoC designing. And it appears to be full steam ahead, as supplemental job postings for SoC design have appeared on Google Careers. Whether these efforts result in a new custom chipset by Google, or we just see some new specialized hardware for machine learning, either way, things should be interesting.

They'd better reduce their prices first by at least 50% Renan That would be a dream, too. Ricardo Ferreira If they are priced like Moto/Lenovo is, it should be a blessing. Take the Moto G5 for example and you'll see that our price isn't that far off. Freek Smulders This could be yuge! Lord Argyris Bigly big league! Duder12 HUGE kabiluddin Guess we'll see the new custom soc in late 2018/9 Honestly can't wait. destinyhud pixel 3 then!!! Godspoken I recall "Google silicon" being referenced last year as a future goal of the Pixel, very exciting. blackice85 Isn't that one of the things holding them back from providing updates for longer periods of time too? Could be a big deal not just for the performance gains. Gregory That Project Treble thing or how do you call it in O is also all about cutting on dependencies from third parties like Qualcomm. blackice85 Oh I hadn't heard about that, I bet this is one aspect of it then. Duder12 Project Treble doesnt improve years of update support. It brings updates faster since Qualcomm and OEMs can work on software updates at the same time. Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. Google doing their own SOC is the only real answer Gregory From my understanding, it eliminates the need for the drivers to be updated in the first place. someone755 You can't expect to not update drivers with new Android versions. Say there's an Android system API that a driver adheres to. As something banal, let's say we have a driver that controls whether the hardware button backlight is on or off, and that the system can control whether it is either on or off. Then a newer Android version appears which supports both the old API but also a newer one, wherein the hardware backlight can be controlled as if it were analog (from 0-255 for example). Then, the third system version comes out that ditches support for the old API and only still supports the newer one. Yes the OEM could hack things up so that values 0-254 would mean the light is off and then 255 would mean it's on, but this further complicates both the user experience and app compatibility as well as future system version compatibility. At this point if you want a stable and future-proof software solution, you absolutely have to update the driver to support the new API. And if the backlight vendor can't provide one, then it's more trouble than it's worth for the OEM to do the hack themselves and they just post a note online saying your device won't get upgraded, leaving you with no choice but to either resort to community hacks or buy a new device. Yes the example is completely idiotic but it serves as an example of why you can't go around updating devices without driver updates. Aside from the functionality aspect there are many security flaws that could affect a driver. And not updating that huge gaping hole in your security while providing monthly 'security patches' that claim to solve security threats is just inane. At that point why even bother with security patches if you can't expect chipset vendors to fix the problems in their closed-source firmware, or hold them accountable for it. Gregory While I completely understand your point, I'd like to extend it to say that there could be such a backlight that can be either on or off, and it's a hardware limitation, so it isn't possible to fully implement the new API on that device. I mean, hardware configurations vary, it's a matter of fact. The point of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is to abstract away the differences across the underlying hardware, and provide a unified API for the system services to interact with said hardware. If the HAL doesn't provide support for some new feature that was added in a system update but the hardware could technically support it, it still means that the system would behave as though that feature isn't supported by the hardware, and that's it. I'd rather have a device that doesn't support that new feature than a device that is no longer updated. And security... How about people ALWAYS check for buffer boundaries before copying memory? What do they do with all that time and disk space they save? Or, at least, if they're that lazy, run a static analyzer on your code and fix whatever it finds. And run it in valgrind to find memory leaks. It's not that hard to write vulnerability-free code from the start. someone755 But a device will never pass certification, either by Google or an FCC-like entity or another office, with broken features. This is exactly why the 8974 line got dropped -- the hardware didn't support a feature that Google wanted so they didn't let any 8974 device pass CTS. How do you think people running Nougat just fine on their hammerheads (via one custom ROM or another) feel about this conundrum when they've been cut short an entire system update because of Google's insane chip requirements? It's easy to know how to prevent bad code but often times projects start simple and private and unoptimized, and then grow into something much larger that's hard to maintain. A classic example is Android itself (look at all the memory leaks that L introduced). Gregory Well... If a device passed certification by Google (CTS) and carriers, that feature was optional from the beginning, right? Android does already support a plethora of different hardware configurations with different capabilities. If a device didn't have some feature at launch, I don't expect it to have that feature enabled with a software update. CTS is about keeping compatibility with apps (it tests public APIs), it has nothing to do with drivers and hardware. There are literally no hardware requirements that make it impossible to update existing devices more than a year or two. Carrier certification is about device interfacing correctly with carrier equipment, it did so well when it was released and certified, so just don't touch the modem firmware because it's already doing its job good enough, as simple as that. There are exactly zero reasons to modify the HAL for system updates provided HAL and the rest of the system are properly separated, which, from my understanding, they are with Project Treble. It also adds CTS-like standardized test suite for these things. What the hell is 8974? someone755 Msm8974. The Snapdragon 800 platform that phones like the N5, Z3, G2, S5, M8 etc were based on. That got blocked from receiving any sort of updates because Google decided that Vulkan or GL 3.1 was necessary for the upgrade. Not that modern low-end phones are capable of performing the task that the requirement was set for anyways. Basically the thing my entire argument is set around but alright... Owais Lone > Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. ... and Project Treble will enable device vendors to still ship updates in this exact case. Project Treble cuts out qualcom and SoC manufacturers out of the update cycle. The device vendors will be bottleneck and decision makers now. someone755 This is incorrect. Please see my reply to Gregory above. Owais Lone Your example exactly illustrates the problem now. Project Treble is supposed to abstract these internal hardware level ABIs/APIs so vendors don't have to re-implement the whole layer again. Only time when SOC vendors will have to update their code is when Project Treble itself comes out with a breaking change and a major version upgrade. Of course, vendors might have to or want to make changes here and there but the abstraction should save them from re-doing all of it on every update and if the vendor does not want to improve/optimize with every update, they shouldn't have to make any changes at all unless Treble itself comes out with an incompatible update. someone755 And say that Android P is the one where the button backlight brightness from my example becomes an analog value and the digital on/off API is dropped. Then the phones that incorporate this function will either have to have the driver updated or will not get updated to the next Android version. This is a problem and always will be, as long as chip vendors are not held responsible and held to a higher standard, and as long as the entities that certify devices for daily use (CTS, FCC etc) have some standards themselves (in the sense of not letting devices with broken/missing core features pass). Owais Lone If such a change happens at the HW level, it'll be abstracted at the treble API level so phones that leverage treble API will not need any change at all. Vendors would need to update their code if the change happened in Treble's apI itself which is extremely unlikely as it'll defeat the purpose of having Treble in the first place. That said, there will be major updates to Treble which might break backward compatibility but it's Google's job to keep those changes at a minimal or the whole idea will be worthless. someone755 This is exactly what I'm saying -- if Treble changes (which it most probably will across Android versions, as the system has changed until now), the chip vendors will *have* to provide updates. And there is no way around this limitation, Treble or not, if Google makes some absurd changes then phones won't get updated. Owais Lone Yes, that is true but why would that happen in the first place? That would completely defeat the purpose. Treble will most likely always be backward compatible. It'll probably only add new features and new APIs but not break existing ones. That's how I would handle the project.

Keith Taylor Yep bout that long. destinyhud yeah 2 years. they started this in 2015 so i would guess maybe pixel 3 could have google soc Daniel I've always been a Snapdragon all the way kind of guy, but this would definitely fix updates, give better performance, and bunches of other stuff. I'm a convert. Ditch you Snapdragon. Renan I'm with you. As long as this brings longer support for Google's devices, I'm in. psy spy Always Snapdragon? What choices did you have? Iwanova Nvidia & Mediatek? (I know, Mediatek have no source code, but still. It's mobile SoC right) jesuguru Exynos? Nomaan There was quite a competition until 2012 when we had Snapdragon, Exynos, Tegra, OMAP, NovaThor in the SoC game. Lateef Alabi-Oki Anything to put Qualcomm, with their shitty inefficient power-hungry proprietary insecure SoC drivers, out of our misery is welcome. h4rr4r Please get the drivers in mainline or at least GPLed and into AOSP. MJ I am not as excited (yet) as most of you are about this. I see two possible scenarios coming out of custom chipset from Google... 1.) The main reason Apple's SoC performs better is because it's optimized for iOS and only iOS. It is not properly documented so no other OS can really run it. I would rather stick with a Qualcomm SoC if Google goes down this road. 2.) Google creates a fully open and documented SoC but it performs no better than Apple's or Qualcomm's chips. I would prefer a fully open and documented chipset that can compete as good or better than anything else out there. Possible? I don't know... Regardless, I suspect Google is looking to make some custom hardware for AI or VR first before we see a custom chipset for a phone.

MadMartigan I'm guessing he's just really proud of his ability to copy and paste and is just showing off. Hey, some folks never even get that far. ;-) Thinker Geekbench is comparable across platforms. Therefore A10x chip (for example) will outperform Qualcomm chip on Android as well. MJ I am sure it may BUT it will perform even better with iOS. Android will never run on a A10x SoC so who cares? My point is I am not interested in a chipset that can only run Android. reggjoo That would be a fair test if you could load a "neutral​" os on both platforms, then run test. It will never happen though.

Now, apple A10x is very competitive especially considering that A10x is fan-less design. Enough said. Just_No_Stop Firstly you dont say which Intel chip, the fastest laptop chip is WAY faster than the A10x. Secondly, they run 2 totally different OSes, one is very much single threaded, that can run limited threads when it does run multi-thread, and as such can dedicate the entire CPU to the benchmark. OSX is very multi-threaded, and doesnt do that, it will always run more background threads. Thirdly the A10x isnt a phone chip, its a laptop/tablet chip, and actually eats battery like crazy when full throttle, and gets very hot when it does, and as so doesnt do so for long. Thinker Geekbench 4 is functionally same across all platforms. Thus comparable. Read Geekbench blog. Oh forgot one more thing...A10x has 3 CPU cores while Intel chip above has 4 CPU cores. That only further makes multi-thread score more impressive!! Intel chip above is standard intel in base Macbook PRO in 2016. If you take fan out of Intel devices, then would that equalize things for you?? Lol. Wanna bet which will be better?! Just_No_Stop It might be functionally the same, but the OS is not, and despite claims (by the developer which has a bias to sell its product) its not comparable across platforms. It doesnt even generate the same score on the same CPU between OSX, Linux and Windows, let alone iOS and android. The base Macbook Pro from 2016 has 2 cores, so again.. which chip is it? The A10x cannot run full throttle for long, the Intel can run flat out all the time, doing the same task, if even remotely prolonged, the Intel will win. The Intel is all much more flexible than the A10x. It capable of unoptimised maths that the A10x would simple die a death trying to run. Its is at least an order of magnitude faster than the A10x, which a full desktop class OS needs. Thats why there is no A10x powered Macbook Pro. Thinker Intel has a fan. Take out fan and what happens? Just_No_Stop It would probably not be able to run as long, but it would more than manage the few seconds per test of Geekbench. Thinker Huh?! Wtf?! Please stop talking. Just_No_Stop How is that not true? I have run geekbench multiple times on my laptop and desktop, and the fan doesnt kick in on my laptop and doesnt throttle up on my desktop. Its a very brief, and very poor benchmark. You still fail to understand how the usage scenarios in an iPad Pro and a desktop class PC are completely different, which is why one goes for single core performance, and the other multicore. So i will repeat, its not that Intel cant beat Apple, its that they dont need to. Its made even worse by the fact that most laptops are seriously storage speed limited, even an SSD only helps so much, and the CPU is still waiting. The A10, in a laptop would be awful. One core would be almost always in use for background tasks, and as such would burn through battery. Android is not that dissimilar, it has far more background activity than iOS, and therefore needs less powerful, more numerous cores that use less power. The trick is making all those cores useful when you need to run a single powerful task. This is something that Android has got much better at, but it doesnt really show up well in benchmarks. Thinker The Apple iPad PRO 12.9 from 2015 with merely 2 CPU cores active at any single time (Apple A9X) and 4 GB of RAM. Yet with iOS11, it can run FOUR active windows at once. Yes, 4 windows all active and you can interact with all 4. Now, on the other hand, on Android with those 8-12 cores of CPU, you see apps constantly being kicked out of memory despite 6-8 GB RAM! Background activity you say? BS! BTW, a single powerful task does NOT need 6-8 cores of CPU. Again, please STFU! You’re really embarrassing yourself! Hrishikesh Bisen You are a plan idiot. Thinker Cross-Platform Designed from the ground-up for cross-platform comparisons, Geekbench 4 allows you to compare system performance across devices, processor architectures, and operating systems. Geekbench 4 supports Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Source: Geekbench. Just_No_Stop Source.. the company that makes and wants to sell the benchmark. Unfortunately reality doesnt support that claim. Thinker Lol. Geekbench is universally accepted. Just_No_Stop by plenty of sites that have no idea how it works, which is most of them. Thinker Here's a comparison of interest: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/3042292?baseline=3036382 Just_No_Stop iOS is not comparable to Windows 10. The Intel chip is 18% faster than the A10X in multi-core. geekbench does very badly with hyperthreading, which for applications that make use of it adds a huge performance advantage. Many apps now use it. It should also be noted that the A10x is a SoC, that includes hardware acceleration for some things that the Intel chip isnt designed for, and has little use traditionally on Laptops, this further distorts the score in the A10x favour. Dont get me wrong, its a good CPU, but its not all that. If there was an ARM Windows 10 it wouldnt run as well on the A10x as x64 windows does on Core iX. It should also be noted that there are 3 SoC that beat the standard A10 on Android, which also is more background threaded than iOS, and as such cant dedicate 100% of the CPU to the benchmark. Thinker Remind me...doesn't intel have that TURBO thingy? 3 Android SoC that beat A10?!?! 😂 Dude, you make me laugh!! Hint: single core is far more important. And remember A10 is dual core at any one time unlike Android SoC. Some of those Android are actually firing up all EIGHT cores to beat Apple's two!!! Just_No_Stop Single core is more important on iOS, not Android. Do you really think ARM and Qualcomm and Samsung, who have been at this for years, cant make a CPU as fast as Apple? They can, but the platform doesnt require such Single core performance, and making a CPU like that would hurt performance of Android, not help it. ARM has done extensive testing of such setups, but has rejected them for a reason. If you must know the A10 is very similar in structure to the Intel Core, which is why its fast, but its also why it cant run 4 cores and be power efficient. Its clear you have no idea how a CPU works, or an OS, and you put WAY to much faith in a commercial benchmark. Thinker Let's test your knowledge since you claim to know so much...how many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? No, Samsung and Qualcomm do NOT use custom design cores dumbass. They use generic core design from ARM. In fact I believe S835 CPU core design took a step backward too. But you know all this already. APPLE uses fully custom cores designed upon ARMv8 architecture. What you wrote is pure ignorance. Please stop. Just_No_Stop Qualcomm do use custom designs, Samsung doesnt, and yet the Exynos 8895 is faster than the A10.. It seems you are the ignorant one. Thinker Wrong. Anandtech: "The new Kryo 280, despite the similar name, shares no design DNA with the original Kryo. Its an octa-core, big.LITTLE configuration with four “performance” cores and four lower-power “efficiency” cores. What makes Kryo 280 unique, however, is that it’s the first design to use ARM’s new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" (BoC) license, which allows vendors to customize ARM cores. This new semi-custom option gives vendors the ability to differentiate their products from those using ARM’s stock cores while avoiding the more costly route of creating a fully-custom design from scratch." Again, like I said above, S835 CPU core was a step BACKWARDS. It is basically a generic CPU core with memory controller from Qualcomm. S820 used custom cores but with S835, Qualcomm used generic. Again, you never answered my other question. How many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? STFU dude. You are ignorant. Just_No_Stop You realise that a SoC isnt just the cores right? The memory controller and GPU are what make the 835 custom. If the 835 and the Exynos are generic then why is the Exynos faster despite a lower clock? Again, you lack understanding, all you can do is regurgitate rubbish you have read on a website. Exynos is almost entirely ARM reference, the 835 is not, generic cores maybe, but otherwise completely custom. Sadly all that customisation results in lower performance, not more. Why does it matter how many instructions per cycle it can do? What matters is the total performance. Instructions per cycle is a very old fashioned way of looking at CPU speed, more so than ever now with multicore setups and microcode interpretors. yet again you show a complete lack of understanding about how a modern SoC works. Anyone could design a CPU like the A10, only apple does, because only Apple need one like that, it doesnt show genius, or more advanced design, its just different to similarly performing ARM and Intel CPUs. Frankly I'm just blocking you now, since you arent interested in learning. Thinker Damn you're ignorant. I see that you're backtracking like crazy!! Lol No, S835 CPU core is generic. No one talked about GPU. LOL INSTRUCTIONS PER CYCLE has nothing to do about CPU speed!! Wtf are you talking about?! Typical Android dumbass who thinks he knows tech. Anyone can design like Apple yet everyone is envious of Apple chip design team, including Google!! You're a dumbass. Thinker Even today, i am still laughing at your ignorance!!! Thanks for the laugh!! PhaseBurn Google's been in the hardware field for a very, very long time, originally using Scorpion ARM-based CPUs that predate the SnapDragon, even (https://www.wired.com/2012/09/pluto-switch/). Despite what Variety says about Gulati joining to design SoCs for the Pixel line, I'm guessing that their internal SoC group will end up working on a lot of their platform networking and datacenter fabric next generation designs, in addition to anything they do on a future Pixel phone. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I'm pretty excited to hear about this news. I've always wanna see Google have their own custom chips for their hardware. Google love plot twist #2 roberto.elena I'm personally more interested in a Google SoC for Chromebooks. It's not that I don't find this news interesting for mobiles, but the biggest benefit, even more important than improved performance, is extended OS support. At the current pace of hardware improvement, I'm not interested in owning a phone for more than 1 or 2 years, but a Chromebook is a different story. I would keep it for several years. destinyhud good point. intel is fast but have issues with android apps. other oem are not that fast enough and qualcomm wont come to chromebook at least for now. so this chip used in chromebook pixel would be awesome Midnitte Sort of wish somebody (Intel, AMD,.... Google) would purchase MediaTek and position them to actually compete with Snapdragon, so that we could all benefit from longer/quicker upgrades, not to mention performance. someone755 MediaTek's strategy is much like AMD's was just a few years ago in the desktop space. The money for them is up to where OEMs (who make low-end and midrange phones) are willing to pay for the chips -- any higher and they don't have the knowledge/technology/budget to produce something more powerful. Any lower and, well, this is as low as it can go, and the other competitors (Qualcomm, Intel) have worse-performing chips available for the price that MediaTek offers theirs at. Why that is, I have no clue, but I suspect it could have something to do with Qcom having a monopoly on ARM-based chips, and Intel thinking that their overpriced-desktop-chips-with-no-competitor strategy is going to work here, in a highly competitive environment. The point here being that MediaTek works off tight margins and sells in large quantities. Restructuring this process so that it fits our idea of a Qualcomm competitor would be expensive, and definitely riskier than what the payoff is worth to the investor. reggjoo Maybe he can help bring that single core performance up to apple levels. It won't really make a big difference in the global grand scheme of things, but it would kill all that bragging rights talk. usamaisawake I know we can never know, but I honestly think that the A-chips are, on their own, just really damn good chips. iOS optimization helps, but I think a lot of it is Apple's designers. Marty I'm liking the sound of that. But going by Google's declaration that the Pixel phones are made by Google when in fact they are designed and made by HTC, these SoCs will probably be shelf-bought from the cheapest vendor. destinyhud i am sorry u r wrong at this part. designed by google and made by HTC. same like apples designed by apple claim. Marty Wrong. It's now known the Pixels were designed and made by HTC. http://www.androidauthority.com/google-hidden-htc-involvement-google-pixel-xl-code-723953/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/05/the-pixel-smartphone-is-actually-made-by-htc-not-google/#52ca3eb1e99a https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-htc-will-real-manufacturer-googles-phones-share-glory destinyhud its now knows to just u or what?? because eveyone know its designed by google. but they def have HTC previous device influence. google interview clearly said they tried to design pixel as non iphone design as possible. we are talking about hardware. finding code reference is not equal to HTC made hardware. how does that login even correlate? all the article u posted said it is made by HTC and i didnt disagree on that. it is made by HTC but designed by Google. try harder. https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/google-pixel-how-google-designed-its-first-real-phone/ Marty Read the AA article. It clearly shows HTC footprints in both hardware and software design. destinyhud AA article says nothing about hardware footprint just software foot print. software is not hardware. also there are similar article which said google was building nexus by HTC and finally decided to make their own phone which is why u could find htc code when it was in early development. we are not talking about software here again. Marty The HTC hardware footprint is clearly seen in the design. And it's noteworthy that the software would have any OEM influence at all since Android is a Google creation. You can claim whatever you want, but the evidence is clear and has been clear since the Pixels were released. Talk to the hand... needa But once you open up the phone, you can see that HTC did not design the hardware inside of it. That is always the tell tale sign. matteventu Yes and the htc logo on the battery is there because they just wanted to sign it? needa HTC doesn't have a battery manufacturing plant (assumption). It's part of being the ODM. Designing a PCB and ordering a battery to fit in a specified area are two completely different things. matteventu Dont waste your time with this bunch of G-fanboys... Marty Agreed. One thing, though, they seem to always forget is "Made by Google" when the Pixel isn't made by Google. Apple doesn't even say that about the iPhone, though every aspect of the iPhone is Apple all the way. But Google gets a pass on that lie because, as you said, they're G-fanboys. They always present excuses like..."well, it was designed by Google, that means it's made by Google." The Pixel isn't even designed by Google much less made by Google. But I guess since Google decided to lie, the chose to go all out on the lie... "This lie made by Google" Heh...Google did design and make something...lol...a lie. saf1927 If they do indeed design the SoC in-house, obviously they won't actually manufacture them since they don't own any semiconductor company, just like Apple. They will hand in the specifications to a foundry such as TSMC. Marty You'd think they'd do it that way, but Google did lie about the origin of the Pixels. If Google were to emphatically state that a future SoC is designed and engineered by them, who knows if it would be true? whispy_snippet Fucking awesome. Kimmy Gibbler I don't expect them to succeed Total Insecurity The future of Android is bright anyway :) Jordan L So this means Pixel 3 is going to be an awesome phone! I'm with a lot of people here in hoping for a cheaper Pixel. Like $399. Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel Base. I guess this mimicks Apples plan with iPhone 8, and 7s. someone755 Pixel SE. With a 4" display I wouldn't even be mad. Patel Nisha I really hope this turns out to be a big deal, not just some optimisation stuff for 3rd party components. Apple have a HUGE lead now in terms of silicon. Even Samsung’s own chips can’t compete with Apple’s. It can only really be Google who have a chance to catch up at this stage. xyz Good. Now Google fanboys will have one less excuse when Google still doesn't update phones for more than 2 years. Random! I wonder if a new chip design would help to solve the sound latency issue that makes it so frustrating to use apps such as drum emulators on Android. Or if this is really just a matter of optimizing software. Anyway, shouldn't all SoC manufacturers be designing their SoCs with a dedicated microphone co-processor in order to enable always-on hotword/voice recognition which doesn't kill the battery? Maybe that co-processor could also be the one monitoring the sensors...

Chief Executive Tim Cook has confirmed the company is working on driverless-car technology, but Silicon Valley’s worst-kept secret is nowhere near being entirely revealed. In an interview aired for the first time Tuesday, Cook told Bloomberg TV that Apple AAPL, -0.60%  is focusing on “autonomous systems.” One purpose of such systems is driverless cars, and there are others, he said. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” one of the most difficult to AI issues to work on, he said. Cook went on to say that autonomy is a core technology Apple views as “very important,” but the company is “not really saying,” from a product point of view, that is what it will do. Apple’s route to a driverless-car world, therefore, remains a question the company is none too keen on answering, after years of dodging questions about whether it is aiming for an “Apple car.” It could take a page from Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -0.80% GOOG, -0.89%  Waymo, which focuses on the total hardware and software package for self-driving cars “while leaving vehicle production to established auto makers,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelly Blue Book. That would put Google’s parent company and Apple in direct competition, similar to their rivalry in the smartphone world, where two systems, Alphabet’s Android and Apple’s iOS, dominate, he said. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Read more: Alphabet self-driving cars could be worth $70 billion, challenge Tesla If it chooses to work on software only, Apple would be in direct competition with traditional auto makers like Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.40%  , which have raced to get autonomous cars on the road in as little as three years. Tesla has developed its own software and related advanced-driver assistance systems, the muscle to the brains provided, since October, by an onboard Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.43%  AI “supercomputer.” The AI computer makes sense of the data gathered by the car’s several sensors, and Nvidia has said it can handle full self-driving capabilities, using AI and machine learning to discern a pedestrian from a utility pole on the path of a driverless car. Apple in April received permission from California regulators to test its driverless cars on the state’s public roads, using three modified Lexus SUVs. Several other companies, from startups to parts manufacturers, other tech companies and traditional auto makers, also are testing their vehicles in California. In a late April letter to state regulators asking for changes in California’s proposed driverless-car policies, Apple said it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” and that it was “excited” about the future of automation in many areas, including transportation. Apple stock has suffered of late, falling 6.5% in the past month, but is still up 26% so far in 2017. That easily eclipses the 7.9% increase this year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07%  , which counts Apple as a member, and the 8.5% gain for the S&P 500 index.

Last year the company, based in Cupertino, Calf., sold $1.5 billion worth of bonds in its quest to run 100 percent of its operations on renewable energy. The latest bond, which matures in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to a Bloomberg source. And they are expected to be rated Aa1. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase set up the sale. Apple said the bond sale will also help support its plan for a closed-loop supply chain -- products made entirely using recycled materials. The company is investing in several non-fossil fuel projects: solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California. That includes $850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century. Apple says its new Cupertino headquarters, Apple Park, runs entirely on renewable energy and includes rooftop solar panels supplemented by fuel cells. The 2.8 million-square-foot main building, which is ring-shaped in curved glass. Apple also has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Two weeks ago, Apple criticized President Donald Trump's decision to pull the the United States out of the Paris climate accord to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change," Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among several companies pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple has cash and equivalents totaling $257 billion. But Apple has issued $99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most resources are held outside the United States and would be subject to a 35 percent corporate income tax if it moved to the United States.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions Image Source: Apple There’s no reason to get excited about Apple’s interest in self-driving cars Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 13th, 2017 at 2:52 PM Share Tweet In something of an unusual move, Apple CEO Tim Cook sat down with Bloomberg today and revealed that Apple is actively developing self-driving car technologies. In response to a question about Apple’s car ambitions, Cook stopped playing coy and flatly stated: “We’re focusing on autonomous systems. It’s a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects.” Cook’s revelation here is incredibly surprising because it’s completely out of character for Apple executives to divulge even a crumb of information about R&D initiatives. Indeed, one of Apple’s defining traits is its stubborn reluctance to confirm or deny any type of new technology they happen to be working on. Don't Miss: Behold the Google Pixel 2 of your dreams So what exactly is going on here? Why is Tim Cook seemingly taking Apple’s tried and true playbook and throwing it out the window? Is it possible Cook wants to generate some excitement in the wake of Apple shares taking a dramatic tumble this week? Or, perhaps, is this Cook’s way of assuring skeptical analysts that Apple won’t miss the next big thing? Cook’s motivations notwithstanding, you might want to temper any expectations of Apple turning the automotive industry on its head. While Apple has a history of entering new product categories and making a splash, it’s only been able to do that when entering a product category filled to the brim with unimaginative and lazy incumbents. The auto industry today, however, is a far cry from the MP3 player and smartphone markets Apple was able to upend with ease many years ago. The reality is that the auto industry has a number of sophisticated players with long track records of incredible innovation, from BMW and Porsche to Tesla. What’s more, it’s not exactly clear where Apple is going to profit from self-driving technology in the first place. Is Apple going to sell its software solution to third-party automakers? That seems like a non-starter given that most of the luxury car makers are intent on going it alone. And as for Apple releasing its own branded car, well, that’s even more unlikely for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it would require an absolutely mammoth outlay of cash for small profits relative to Apple’s size. All that aside, there’s no evidence at the moment to suggest that Apple’s mythical self-driving car technology will be so great as to render competing systems second-rate. Far from it, the language Cook used when describing Apple’s work in the area is eerily reminiscent of what Cook previously said about the Apple TV. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said of the company’s efforts. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Until Apple has something compelling to show off, there’s no reason to get excited about the fact that Apple is throwing R&D resources at a problem that other companies take much more seriously than Apple, namely Tesla.

Google hires ex-Apple chipset veteran to help design SoCs for Pixel phones Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/13 11:36am PDTJun 13, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 195 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Google's hardware plans for the future are getting bigger. Variety is reporting that Google has hired Manu Gulati, a hardware architect, away from Apple. Gulati is reported as having previously played a significant role in the development of Apple's SoCs for the last eight years and was hired sometime in the last few weeks. His new title at Google is Lead SOC Architect, and he's expected to work on custom chipsets for future Pixel phones. If Manu Gulati can apply the same black magic to Google's future products as he did on Apple's custom chips, things could be fantastic. Apple's "A" series chips are amazing pieces of hardware. Though Apple does license ARM's tech, unlike other manufacturers, they don't just toss the licensed reference designs on a wafer. Apple has bent over backward to optimize their silicon architecture for iOS, and the resulting performance on Apple devices definitely demonstrates that. Although some Android chipset vendors, such as Qualcomm, do make custom designs like the Kryo, for whatever reason Apple's custom hardware (combined with their software) has held an edge in performance for years. For most of us, any advantage the A series chips have doesn't make any difference without the Android operating system. But if Google is able to bring the same degree of performance enhancements and customization over into their future hardware, the future of Android SoC performance could be bright. After the dark and regressive ages of the Snapdragon 808/810 and Qualcomm's rushed 64bit development cycle, I would like nothing more than to see Google bring a first party chipset in a future Pixel device. And who knows, they might even sell it to other manufacturers, increasing competition in the currently stagnant mobile chipset space. Gulati joining Google finally lends credence to the old stories of Google's interest in SoC designing. And it appears to be full steam ahead, as supplemental job postings for SoC design have appeared on Google Careers. Whether these efforts result in a new custom chipset by Google, or we just see some new specialized hardware for machine learning, either way, things should be interesting.

Now Google just needs to start selling Pixel devices in South America (or specifically in Brazil). Leonardo Loures Quirino Amém! Renan Hehe. I knew more brazilians wanted Google's stuff. Yoshi Everyone here wants it, bro. Look at all the people wishing the good times of Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and 5 selling in almost every good store. Renan I know. I'm one of these people, lol Lucas de Eiroz ™ Google Pixel, Google Store, Android Pay (and Google Wallet), and all Google services! Renan I'm dying for Android Pay! Random! They'd better reduce their prices first by at least 50% Renan That would be a dream, too. Ricardo Ferreira If they are priced like Moto/Lenovo is, it should be a blessing. Take the Moto G5 for example and you'll see that our price isn't that far off. Freek Smulders This could be yuge! Lord Argyris Bigly big league! Duder12 HUGE kabiluddin Guess we'll see the new custom soc in late 2018/9 Honestly can't wait. destinyhud pixel 3 then!!! Godspoken I recall "Google silicon" being referenced last year as a future goal of the Pixel, very exciting. blackice85 Isn't that one of the things holding them back from providing updates for longer periods of time too? Could be a big deal not just for the performance gains. Gregory That Project Treble thing or how do you call it in O is also all about cutting on dependencies from third parties like Qualcomm. blackice85 Oh I hadn't heard about that, I bet this is one aspect of it then. Duder12 Project Treble doesnt improve years of update support. It brings updates faster since Qualcomm and OEMs can work on software updates at the same time. Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. Google doing their own SOC is the only real answer Gregory From my understanding, it eliminates the need for the drivers to be updated in the first place. someone755 You can't expect to not update drivers with new Android versions. Say there's an Android system API that a driver adheres to. As something banal, let's say we have a driver that controls whether the hardware button backlight is on or off, and that the system can control whether it is either on or off. Then a newer Android version appears which supports both the old API but also a newer one, wherein the hardware backlight can be controlled as if it were analog (from 0-255 for example). Then, the third system version comes out that ditches support for the old API and only still supports the newer one. Yes the OEM could hack things up so that values 0-254 would mean the light is off and then 255 would mean it's on, but this further complicates both the user experience and app compatibility as well as future system version compatibility. At this point if you want a stable and future-proof software solution, you absolutely have to update the driver to support the new API. And if the backlight vendor can't provide one, then it's more trouble than it's worth for the OEM to do the hack themselves and they just post a note online saying your device won't get upgraded, leaving you with no choice but to either resort to community hacks or buy a new device. Yes the example is completely idiotic but it serves as an example of why you can't go around updating devices without driver updates. Aside from the functionality aspect there are many security flaws that could affect a driver. And not updating that huge gaping hole in your security while providing monthly 'security patches' that claim to solve security threats is just inane. At that point why even bother with security patches if you can't expect chipset vendors to fix the problems in their closed-source firmware, or hold them accountable for it. Gregory While I completely understand your point, I'd like to extend it to say that there could be such a backlight that can be either on or off, and it's a hardware limitation, so it isn't possible to fully implement the new API on that device. I mean, hardware configurations vary, it's a matter of fact. The point of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is to abstract away the differences across the underlying hardware, and provide a unified API for the system services to interact with said hardware. If the HAL doesn't provide support for some new feature that was added in a system update but the hardware could technically support it, it still means that the system would behave as though that feature isn't supported by the hardware, and that's it. I'd rather have a device that doesn't support that new feature than a device that is no longer updated. And security... How about people ALWAYS check for buffer boundaries before copying memory? What do they do with all that time and disk space they save? Or, at least, if they're that lazy, run a static analyzer on your code and fix whatever it finds. And run it in valgrind to find memory leaks. It's not that hard to write vulnerability-free code from the start. someone755 But a device will never pass certification, either by Google or an FCC-like entity or another office, with broken features. This is exactly why the 8974 line got dropped -- the hardware didn't support a feature that Google wanted so they didn't let any 8974 device pass CTS. How do you think people running Nougat just fine on their hammerheads (via one custom ROM or another) feel about this conundrum when they've been cut short an entire system update because of Google's insane chip requirements? It's easy to know how to prevent bad code but often times projects start simple and private and unoptimized, and then grow into something much larger that's hard to maintain. A classic example is Android itself (look at all the memory leaks that L introduced). Gregory Well... If a device passed certification by Google (CTS) and carriers, that feature was optional from the beginning, right? Android does already support a plethora of different hardware configurations with different capabilities. If a device didn't have some feature at launch, I don't expect it to have that feature enabled with a software update. CTS is about keeping compatibility with apps (it tests public APIs), it has nothing to do with drivers and hardware. There are literally no hardware requirements that make it impossible to update existing devices more than a year or two. Carrier certification is about device interfacing correctly with carrier equipment, it did so well when it was released and certified, so just don't touch the modem firmware because it's already doing its job good enough, as simple as that. There are exactly zero reasons to modify the HAL for system updates provided HAL and the rest of the system are properly separated, which, from my understanding, they are with Project Treble. It also adds CTS-like standardized test suite for these things. What the hell is 8974? someone755 Msm8974. The Snapdragon 800 platform that phones like the N5, Z3, G2, S5, M8 etc were based on. That got blocked from receiving any sort of updates because Google decided that Vulkan or GL 3.1 was necessary for the upgrade. Not that modern low-end phones are capable of performing the task that the requirement was set for anyways. Basically the thing my entire argument is set around but alright... Owais Lone > Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. ... and Project Treble will enable device vendors to still ship updates in this exact case. Project Treble cuts out qualcom and SoC manufacturers out of the update cycle. The device vendors will be bottleneck and decision makers now. someone755 This is incorrect. Please see my reply to Gregory above. Owais Lone Your example exactly illustrates the problem now. Project Treble is supposed to abstract these internal hardware level ABIs/APIs so vendors don't have to re-implement the whole layer again. Only time when SOC vendors will have to update their code is when Project Treble itself comes out with a breaking change and a major version upgrade. Of course, vendors might have to or want to make changes here and there but the abstraction should save them from re-doing all of it on every update and if the vendor does not want to improve/optimize with every update, they shouldn't have to make any changes at all unless Treble itself comes out with an incompatible update. someone755 And say that Android P is the one where the button backlight brightness from my example becomes an analog value and the digital on/off API is dropped. Then the phones that incorporate this function will either have to have the driver updated or will not get updated to the next Android version. This is a problem and always will be, as long as chip vendors are not held responsible and held to a higher standard, and as long as the entities that certify devices for daily use (CTS, FCC etc) have some standards themselves (in the sense of not letting devices with broken/missing core features pass). Owais Lone If such a change happens at the HW level, it'll be abstracted at the treble API level so phones that leverage treble API will not need any change at all. Vendors would need to update their code if the change happened in Treble's apI itself which is extremely unlikely as it'll defeat the purpose of having Treble in the first place. That said, there will be major updates to Treble which might break backward compatibility but it's Google's job to keep those changes at a minimal or the whole idea will be worthless. someone755 This is exactly what I'm saying -- if Treble changes (which it most probably will across Android versions, as the system has changed until now), the chip vendors will *have* to provide updates. And there is no way around this limitation, Treble or not, if Google makes some absurd changes then phones won't get updated. Owais Lone Yes, that is true but why would that happen in the first place? That would completely defeat the purpose. Treble will most likely always be backward compatible. It'll probably only add new features and new APIs but not break existing ones. That's how I would handle the project. Sukrith Krishnakumar If I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! Suicide_Note Your loss. MJ How about you wait for the reviews first before deciding to skip it or not? Sukrith Krishnakumar Even if I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! TheRunner024 This is great news. How long will it take them to build a SoC? 2 years? Keith Taylor Yep bout that long. destinyhud yeah 2 years. they started this in 2015 so i would guess maybe pixel 3 could have google soc Daniel I've always been a Snapdragon all the way kind of guy, but this would definitely fix updates, give better performance, and bunches of other stuff. I'm a convert. Ditch you Snapdragon. Renan I'm with you. As long as this brings longer support for Google's devices, I'm in. psy spy Always Snapdragon? What choices did you have? Iwanova Nvidia & Mediatek? (I know, Mediatek have no source code, but still. It's mobile SoC right) jesuguru Exynos? Nomaan There was quite a competition until 2012 when we had Snapdragon, Exynos, Tegra, OMAP, NovaThor in the SoC game. Lateef Alabi-Oki Anything to put Qualcomm, with their shitty inefficient power-hungry proprietary insecure SoC drivers, out of our misery is welcome. h4rr4r Please get the drivers in mainline or at least GPLed and into AOSP. MJ I am not as excited (yet) as most of you are about this. I see two possible scenarios coming out of custom chipset from Google... 1.) The main reason Apple's SoC performs better is because it's optimized for iOS and only iOS. It is not properly documented so no other OS can really run it. I would rather stick with a Qualcomm SoC if Google goes down this road. 2.) Google creates a fully open and documented SoC but it performs no better than Apple's or Qualcomm's chips. I would prefer a fully open and documented chipset that can compete as good or better than anything else out there. Possible? I don't know... Regardless, I suspect Google is looking to make some custom hardware for AI or VR first before we see a custom chipset for a phone.

MadMartigan I'm guessing he's just really proud of his ability to copy and paste and is just showing off. Hey, some folks never even get that far. ;-) Thinker Geekbench is comparable across platforms. Therefore A10x chip (for example) will outperform Qualcomm chip on Android as well. MJ I am sure it may BUT it will perform even better with iOS. Android will never run on a A10x SoC so who cares? My point is I am not interested in a chipset that can only run Android. reggjoo That would be a fair test if you could load a "neutral​" os on both platforms, then run test. It will never happen though. TechGuy22 google is trying too hard i'll buy it if this time it looks pretty love my xl but not so good to look at lol Yoshi I wouldn't complain if you wish to give me your "ugly" phone. :) TechGuy22 sure 950 it's yours Yoshi Give == for free. Phoenix keep on dreaming Thinker Apple A10x: Single thread 3900 Multi thread 9300 ------------------------- MacBook Pro 2016 intel: Single 3900 Multi 7700 No, Qualcomm S835 is far away from coming close to intel. Now, apple A10x is very competitive especially considering that A10x is fan-less design. Enough said. Just_No_Stop Firstly you dont say which Intel chip, the fastest laptop chip is WAY faster than the A10x. Secondly, they run 2 totally different OSes, one is very much single threaded, that can run limited threads when it does run multi-thread, and as such can dedicate the entire CPU to the benchmark. OSX is very multi-threaded, and doesnt do that, it will always run more background threads. Thirdly the A10x isnt a phone chip, its a laptop/tablet chip, and actually eats battery like crazy when full throttle, and gets very hot when it does, and as so doesnt do so for long. Thinker Geekbench 4 is functionally same across all platforms. Thus comparable. Read Geekbench blog. Oh forgot one more thing...A10x has 3 CPU cores while Intel chip above has 4 CPU cores. That only further makes multi-thread score more impressive!! Intel chip above is standard intel in base Macbook PRO in 2016. If you take fan out of Intel devices, then would that equalize things for you?? Lol. Wanna bet which will be better?! Just_No_Stop It might be functionally the same, but the OS is not, and despite claims (by the developer which has a bias to sell its product) its not comparable across platforms. It doesnt even generate the same score on the same CPU between OSX, Linux and Windows, let alone iOS and android. The base Macbook Pro from 2016 has 2 cores, so again.. which chip is it? The A10x cannot run full throttle for long, the Intel can run flat out all the time, doing the same task, if even remotely prolonged, the Intel will win. The Intel is all much more flexible than the A10x. It capable of unoptimised maths that the A10x would simple die a death trying to run. Its is at least an order of magnitude faster than the A10x, which a full desktop class OS needs. Thats why there is no A10x powered Macbook Pro. Thinker Intel has a fan. Take out fan and what happens? Just_No_Stop It would probably not be able to run as long, but it would more than manage the few seconds per test of Geekbench. Thinker Huh?! Wtf?! Please stop talking. Just_No_Stop How is that not true? I have run geekbench multiple times on my laptop and desktop, and the fan doesnt kick in on my laptop and doesnt throttle up on my desktop. Its a very brief, and very poor benchmark. You still fail to understand how the usage scenarios in an iPad Pro and a desktop class PC are completely different, which is why one goes for single core performance, and the other multicore. So i will repeat, its not that Intel cant beat Apple, its that they dont need to. Its made even worse by the fact that most laptops are seriously storage speed limited, even an SSD only helps so much, and the CPU is still waiting. The A10, in a laptop would be awful. One core would be almost always in use for background tasks, and as such would burn through battery. Android is not that dissimilar, it has far more background activity than iOS, and therefore needs less powerful, more numerous cores that use less power. The trick is making all those cores useful when you need to run a single powerful task. This is something that Android has got much better at, but it doesnt really show up well in benchmarks. Thinker The Apple iPad PRO 12.9 from 2015 with merely 2 CPU cores active at any single time (Apple A9X) and 4 GB of RAM. Yet with iOS11, it can run FOUR active windows at once. Yes, 4 windows all active and you can interact with all 4. Now, on the other hand, on Android with those 8-12 cores of CPU, you see apps constantly being kicked out of memory despite 6-8 GB RAM! Background activity you say? BS! BTW, a single powerful task does NOT need 6-8 cores of CPU. Again, please STFU! You’re really embarrassing yourself! Hrishikesh Bisen You are a plan idiot. Thinker Cross-Platform Designed from the ground-up for cross-platform comparisons, Geekbench 4 allows you to compare system performance across devices, processor architectures, and operating systems. Geekbench 4 supports Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Source: Geekbench. Just_No_Stop Source.. the company that makes and wants to sell the benchmark. Unfortunately reality doesnt support that claim. Thinker Lol. Geekbench is universally accepted. Just_No_Stop by plenty of sites that have no idea how it works, which is most of them. Thinker Here's a comparison of interest: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/3042292?baseline=3036382 Just_No_Stop iOS is not comparable to Windows 10. The Intel chip is 18% faster than the A10X in multi-core. geekbench does very badly with hyperthreading, which for applications that make use of it adds a huge performance advantage. Many apps now use it. It should also be noted that the A10x is a SoC, that includes hardware acceleration for some things that the Intel chip isnt designed for, and has little use traditionally on Laptops, this further distorts the score in the A10x favour. Dont get me wrong, its a good CPU, but its not all that. If there was an ARM Windows 10 it wouldnt run as well on the A10x as x64 windows does on Core iX. It should also be noted that there are 3 SoC that beat the standard A10 on Android, which also is more background threaded than iOS, and as such cant dedicate 100% of the CPU to the benchmark. Thinker Remind me...doesn't intel have that TURBO thingy? 3 Android SoC that beat A10?!?! 😂 Dude, you make me laugh!! Hint: single core is far more important. And remember A10 is dual core at any one time unlike Android SoC. Some of those Android are actually firing up all EIGHT cores to beat Apple's two!!! Just_No_Stop Single core is more important on iOS, not Android. Do you really think ARM and Qualcomm and Samsung, who have been at this for years, cant make a CPU as fast as Apple? They can, but the platform doesnt require such Single core performance, and making a CPU like that would hurt performance of Android, not help it. ARM has done extensive testing of such setups, but has rejected them for a reason. If you must know the A10 is very similar in structure to the Intel Core, which is why its fast, but its also why it cant run 4 cores and be power efficient. Its clear you have no idea how a CPU works, or an OS, and you put WAY to much faith in a commercial benchmark. Thinker Let's test your knowledge since you claim to know so much...how many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? No, Samsung and Qualcomm do NOT use custom design cores dumbass. They use generic core design from ARM. In fact I believe S835 CPU core design took a step backward too. But you know all this already. APPLE uses fully custom cores designed upon ARMv8 architecture. What you wrote is pure ignorance. Please stop. Just_No_Stop Qualcomm do use custom designs, Samsung doesnt, and yet the Exynos 8895 is faster than the A10.. It seems you are the ignorant one. Thinker Wrong. Anandtech: "The new Kryo 280, despite the similar name, shares no design DNA with the original Kryo. Its an octa-core, big.LITTLE configuration with four “performance” cores and four lower-power “efficiency” cores. What makes Kryo 280 unique, however, is that it’s the first design to use ARM’s new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" (BoC) license, which allows vendors to customize ARM cores. This new semi-custom option gives vendors the ability to differentiate their products from those using ARM’s stock cores while avoiding the more costly route of creating a fully-custom design from scratch." Again, like I said above, S835 CPU core was a step BACKWARDS. It is basically a generic CPU core with memory controller from Qualcomm. S820 used custom cores but with S835, Qualcomm used generic. Again, you never answered my other question. How many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? STFU dude. You are ignorant. Just_No_Stop You realise that a SoC isnt just the cores right? The memory controller and GPU are what make the 835 custom. If the 835 and the Exynos are generic then why is the Exynos faster despite a lower clock? Again, you lack understanding, all you can do is regurgitate rubbish you have read on a website. Exynos is almost entirely ARM reference, the 835 is not, generic cores maybe, but otherwise completely custom. Sadly all that customisation results in lower performance, not more. Why does it matter how many instructions per cycle it can do? What matters is the total performance. Instructions per cycle is a very old fashioned way of looking at CPU speed, more so than ever now with multicore setups and microcode interpretors. yet again you show a complete lack of understanding about how a modern SoC works. Anyone could design a CPU like the A10, only apple does, because only Apple need one like that, it doesnt show genius, or more advanced design, its just different to similarly performing ARM and Intel CPUs. Frankly I'm just blocking you now, since you arent interested in learning. Thinker Damn you're ignorant. I see that you're backtracking like crazy!! Lol No, S835 CPU core is generic. No one talked about GPU. LOL INSTRUCTIONS PER CYCLE has nothing to do about CPU speed!! Wtf are you talking about?! Typical Android dumbass who thinks he knows tech. Anyone can design like Apple yet everyone is envious of Apple chip design team, including Google!! You're a dumbass. Thinker Even today, i am still laughing at your ignorance!!! Thanks for the laugh!! PhaseBurn Google's been in the hardware field for a very, very long time, originally using Scorpion ARM-based CPUs that predate the SnapDragon, even (https://www.wired.com/2012/09/pluto-switch/). Despite what Variety says about Gulati joining to design SoCs for the Pixel line, I'm guessing that their internal SoC group will end up working on a lot of their platform networking and datacenter fabric next generation designs, in addition to anything they do on a future Pixel phone. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I'm pretty excited to hear about this news. I've always wanna see Google have their own custom chips for their hardware. Google love plot twist #2 roberto.elena I'm personally more interested in a Google SoC for Chromebooks. It's not that I don't find this news interesting for mobiles, but the biggest benefit, even more important than improved performance, is extended OS support. At the current pace of hardware improvement, I'm not interested in owning a phone for more than 1 or 2 years, but a Chromebook is a different story. I would keep it for several years. destinyhud good point. intel is fast but have issues with android apps. other oem are not that fast enough and qualcomm wont come to chromebook at least for now. so this chip used in chromebook pixel would be awesome Midnitte Sort of wish somebody (Intel, AMD,.... Google) would purchase MediaTek and position them to actually compete with Snapdragon, so that we could all benefit from longer/quicker upgrades, not to mention performance. someone755 MediaTek's strategy is much like AMD's was just a few years ago in the desktop space. The money for them is up to where OEMs (who make low-end and midrange phones) are willing to pay for the chips -- any higher and they don't have the knowledge/technology/budget to produce something more powerful. Any lower and, well, this is as low as it can go, and the other competitors (Qualcomm, Intel) have worse-performing chips available for the price that MediaTek offers theirs at. Why that is, I have no clue, but I suspect it could have something to do with Qcom having a monopoly on ARM-based chips, and Intel thinking that their overpriced-desktop-chips-with-no-competitor strategy is going to work here, in a highly competitive environment. The point here being that MediaTek works off tight margins and sells in large quantities. Restructuring this process so that it fits our idea of a Qualcomm competitor would be expensive, and definitely riskier than what the payoff is worth to the investor. reggjoo Maybe he can help bring that single core performance up to apple levels. It won't really make a big difference in the global grand scheme of things, but it would kill all that bragging rights talk. usamaisawake I know we can never know, but I honestly think that the A-chips are, on their own, just really damn good chips. iOS optimization helps, but I think a lot of it is Apple's designers. Marty I'm liking the sound of that. But going by Google's declaration that the Pixel phones are made by Google when in fact they are designed and made by HTC, these SoCs will probably be shelf-bought from the cheapest vendor. destinyhud i am sorry u r wrong at this part. designed by google and made by HTC. same like apples designed by apple claim. Marty Wrong. It's now known the Pixels were designed and made by HTC. http://www.androidauthority.com/google-hidden-htc-involvement-google-pixel-xl-code-723953/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/05/the-pixel-smartphone-is-actually-made-by-htc-not-google/#52ca3eb1e99a https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-htc-will-real-manufacturer-googles-phones-share-glory destinyhud its now knows to just u or what?? because eveyone know its designed by google. but they def have HTC previous device influence. google interview clearly said they tried to design pixel as non iphone design as possible. we are talking about hardware. finding code reference is not equal to HTC made hardware. how does that login even correlate? all the article u posted said it is made by HTC and i didnt disagree on that. it is made by HTC but designed by Google. try harder. https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/google-pixel-how-google-designed-its-first-real-phone/ Marty Read the AA article. It clearly shows HTC footprints in both hardware and software design. destinyhud AA article says nothing about hardware footprint just software foot print. software is not hardware. also there are similar article which said google was building nexus by HTC and finally decided to make their own phone which is why u could find htc code when it was in early development. we are not talking about software here again. Marty The HTC hardware footprint is clearly seen in the design. And it's noteworthy that the software would have any OEM influence at all since Android is a Google creation. You can claim whatever you want, but the evidence is clear and has been clear since the Pixels were released. Talk to the hand... needa But once you open up the phone, you can see that HTC did not design the hardware inside of it. That is always the tell tale sign. matteventu Yes and the htc logo on the battery is there because they just wanted to sign it? needa HTC doesn't have a battery manufacturing plant (assumption). It's part of being the ODM. Designing a PCB and ordering a battery to fit in a specified area are two completely different things. matteventu Dont waste your time with this bunch of G-fanboys... Marty Agreed. One thing, though, they seem to always forget is "Made by Google" when the Pixel isn't made by Google. Apple doesn't even say that about the iPhone, though every aspect of the iPhone is Apple all the way. But Google gets a pass on that lie because, as you said, they're G-fanboys. They always present excuses like..."well, it was designed by Google, that means it's made by Google." The Pixel isn't even designed by Google much less made by Google. But I guess since Google decided to lie, the chose to go all out on the lie... "This lie made by Google" Heh...Google did design and make something...lol...a lie. saf1927 If they do indeed design the SoC in-house, obviously they won't actually manufacture them since they don't own any semiconductor company, just like Apple. They will hand in the specifications to a foundry such as TSMC. Marty You'd think they'd do it that way, but Google did lie about the origin of the Pixels. If Google were to emphatically state that a future SoC is designed and engineered by them, who knows if it would be true? whispy_snippet Fucking awesome. Kimmy Gibbler I don't expect them to succeed Total Insecurity The future of Android is bright anyway :) Jordan L So this means Pixel 3 is going to be an awesome phone! I'm with a lot of people here in hoping for a cheaper Pixel. Like $399. Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel Base. I guess this mimicks Apples plan with iPhone 8, and 7s. someone755 Pixel SE. With a 4" display I wouldn't even be mad. Patel Nisha I really hope this turns out to be a big deal, not just some optimisation stuff for 3rd party components. Apple have a HUGE lead now in terms of silicon. Even Samsung’s own chips can’t compete with Apple’s. It can only really be Google who have a chance to catch up at this stage. xyz Good. Now Google fanboys will have one less excuse when Google still doesn't update phones for more than 2 years. Random! I wonder if a new chip design would help to solve the sound latency issue that makes it so frustrating to use apps such as drum emulators on Android. Or if this is really just a matter of optimizing software. Anyway, shouldn't all SoC manufacturers be designing their SoCs with a dedicated microphone co-processor in order to enable always-on hotword/voice recognition which doesn't kill the battery? Maybe that co-processor could also be the one monitoring the sensors...

Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review: For those who dream of owning an iPad mini that runs Android Jeff Beck Follow View All Posts 2017/06/12 12:00pm PDTJun 12, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Mi Pad 3 News Reviews Tablet Reviews Xiaomi / MIUI Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design 5 Display 6 Cameras 7 Performance and battery 8 Software 9 Conclusion Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"? Well, I have some (kinda) good news for you. Today I'm reviewing the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3, a 7.9in Chinese tablet that has no shame in borrowing a healthy dose of design cues from a certain fruit logo-bearing competitor. For better or worse, the Mi Pad 3 looks an awful lot like an iPad Mini in Android clothing. Is it as good, or better than the tablet it is imitating? Let's find out. Specs SoC Mediatek MT8176 RAM 4GB Storage 64GB Display 7.9-inch 1536 x 2048 IPS LCD Battery 6,600 mAh Camera 13MP, 5MP Software Android 7.0, MIUI8 Measurements 200.4 x 132.6 x 7 mm, 328g The Good Design and build If you like the design and build quality of the iPad mini, you will like the way this looks and feels. Performance Yes, it's a Mediatek processor, but during my month of testing it's been quite a solid performer. Display The display is rumored to be the same one used in the iPad mini; it's crisp, vibrant, and responsive. Battery Longevity is good, with 8-10 hours of screen on time. The Not So Good Speakers They sound ok, but their placement is lousy. Capacitive buttons Come on, even Samsung gave those up. Software Running Android 7.0, but key features are missing. No fingerprint reader This is something that's become a standard feature in the last year, it sucks to go back to PIN unlocking. Camera Come on, no one expects a tablet camera to be any good, and Xiaomi doesn't disappoint - this one is lousy. Design It's impossible to look at the Mi Pad 3 and not be reminded of an iPad mini. The looks are strikingly similar, intentionally so. The size, weight, thickness, bezels, and camera placement are all almost identical. The back is a flat slab of aluminum with rounded sides, similar to - you guessed it - the iPad mini. Really, the only things that set it apart from the iPad are the placement of the speakers and buttons, and the lack of a home button on the front. Yeah, it's pretty much a blatant copy, but at least the source material is well designed. Hate on Apple all you want, the iPad mini is a nice looking device that's easy to hold, and so is the Mi Pad 3 by extension. Let's take a little tour of the tablet. At the top left corner of the device is a headphone jack, and centered at the bottom of the tablet is a USB-C port. The left side is bare and the right side features a power bottom and volume rocker about an inch below the top. The buttons are the only parts that feel a bit cheap on this tablet. While they are made of aluminum and have nice feedback, they are a bit too loose in their sockets, which makes them wiggle when touched and rattle when shaken. A small thing, but hard to ignore once you notice it. The front of the device is dominated by the display, surrounded by black bezels of moderate size top and bottom. The navigation buttons are back-lit capacitive keys at the bottom of the display arranged in the Samsung fashion, which feels backwards to many users, including myself. That's two things I really don't care for in one aspect of the tablet. Now, the buttons can be remapped in the settings to change the back button to the left and menu to the right. However, the icons can't be changed as they are back-lit cutouts, so instead of fixing the layout, it makes it even worse as the icons no longer match their actions. On the plus side, the duration that the buttons stay lit can be adjusted, or the back-light can be disabled completely system wide, or while using specific apps. You might have noticed that the home button is not a fingerprint scanner as it is on the iPad mini. There isn't one anywhere else on the device either, nor is there NFC, or a microSD card slot. Now, 64GB of internal space helps offset the need for expandable storage, and you're not likely to use a tablet to pay for your groceries with Android Pay, but the missing fingerprint scanner is frustrating. That's become a pretty standard feature on devices in 2017, and I miss it here. Going back to using a pin number to unlock my device feels archaic. Funny how quickly times change. Flipping the device over, there's not a lot going on. A 13MP camera occupies the upper left corner, and twin speakers sit at the bottom of the rear panel spaced an inch and a half apart. The speakers are stereo, which is laughable as an inch and a half of separation is barely sufficient for your ears to distinguish the difference between the channels. They are also completely useless as stereo speakers when holding the tablet in landscape mode, the way I assume 99 percent of people orient their tablet when watching a movie. They still play audio in stereo when the tablet is oriented in landscape, meaning you have a top and bottom channel instead of a right and left channel. That's just bizarre. In terms of volume, the speakers are about as loud as you'd expect with a tablet this size. In a quiet room they are perfectly fine for watching a show or playing a game. They don't have any low end, but they are clear and distortion free. Audio from the headphone jack is great, with enough power to drive a set of 50mm headphones well above a comfortable listening level. Taken as a whole, the tablet is very well constructed and feels light yet solid in hand. There are no gaps, the glass panel on the front is completely uniform, and weight is evenly distributed across the device. If you want to get a good approximation for how it feels to hold one, get your hands on an iPad mini. A tech novice might not even be able to tell them apart with a blindfold on. Display The highlight of the Mi Pad 3 is definitely the IPS LCD display. Its resolution of 2048×1536 is identical to that of the screen found in the iPad mini. It's rumored that the display is, in fact, sourced from the same supplier as the one that adorns Apple's smallest tablet. That wouldn't surprise me at all, as it is quite brilliant. Colors are deep and rich, black levels are respectable, and the white balance is well calibrated. It has all the nits you need for outdoor viewing, and even more importantly, in my opinion, it can drop to delightfully low brightness levels for late night use. The LCD panel can dim even further than the AMOLED screen on my Nexus 6P, something I find impressive. A number of tweaks can be made to the screen through the settings panel. The tint can be adjusted and a black and white mode can also be enabled to supposedly increase battery life. I don't believe color has the same impact on power consumption on an LCD panel as it does on an AMOLED display, but the setting is there nonetheless and will make Gothic and noir fans happy. There's also a reading mode that amps up the red levels for nighttime viewing, a feature I always love to see implemented on the system level. Cameras Frankly, I sometimes wonder why we even bother with this section in tablet reviews. There seems to be an unwritten law that tablet cameras must be lousy, and man, Xiaomi is a law-abiding company in that regard. I've take a few shots for you to look at, because, hey, I already spent some time typing a header for this section, so why not. Previous Next At first blush the pictures look acceptable, but once you take a closer look it's apparent that the images are bland, soft, and lacking vibrancy. All these were taken with the 13MP rear camera, the photos from the front facing camera were even worse. The selfies I took made me look absolutely awful, so I vainly excluded them from the review. The image quality is mediocre, even for a tablet, but the camera app is downright awful. The only setting to be found is a toggle to switch between the front and rear camera and photo and video mode. That's it, folks. There's nothing else there, well, besides a handful of filters thrown in as an afterthought. The camera app doesn't even allow you to preview the images you capture, you've got to switch to the album app to view your mediocre photos. Poor effort, but let's be honest, most people are (hopefully) never going to use the cameras anyways. Performance and battery These are two areas where the Mi Pad 3 performs surprisingly well.  Here are a couple of benchmarks for the tablet for those of you who insist on such things. On the left is Antutu and on the right GeekBench 4. Now, those numbers may not look very impressive to those who can discern their meaning, but I personally think benchmark numbers are limited in their usefulness. With that in mind, let me tell you how the tablet performs on daily tasks. Apps and games open quickly, and switching between applications doesn't tax the Mi Pad at all. 4GB of RAM is plenty to keep it chugging along. The half dozen games I downloaded on the Mi Pad 3 all played just fine, with only an occasional skipped frame on the most taxing titles. In short, it's actually very pleasant to use. Even when playing a more intense game, like Asphalt 8, the tablet gets just warm enough to be perceptible, and even then it's only the top third of the device where warmth can be felt at all. Not bad, Mediatek. Longevity is quite solid as well. With an ample 6,600mAh battery, I saw between 8-10 hours of screen on time per charge, with a bit less than that when playing a lot of games. That's shorter than the advertised 12 hours of battery life, but it's ample time to keep you entertained during a long flight, or last for a full day of playing Candy Crush while pretending to take notes during business meetings. The only concern I had with battery life is that standby battery drain is higher than I would like to see, with the battery falling 5-8 percent overnight. That's not as good as it could be, but hopefully it's something that can be tightened up in future updates (if there are future updates). Software Speaking of updates, the Mi Pad 3 comes in need of an update right out of the box. It's running Android 7.0, not 7.1, which is a little annoying since 7.1 has been available for several months now. What goes a step beyond annoying to straight up aggravating is that some of the most important features of Nougat are missing in MIUI 8.2. There's no split screen support on the Mi Pad 3, which severely hampers its usefulness as a productivity device. You also can't pin apps, or set up multiple user profiles, and expanded notifications are nowhere to be found. Xiaomi has also done the best it could to mimic Apple by 'iOS'ing the look of app icons, adding a quick ball shortcut tool, and by removing the app drawer. Seriously, manufacturers: leave the app drawer alone! Unlike the build on MIUI found on the Mi Note 2, there doesn't seem to be any way to enable an app drawer, either. I won't harp on this too much, though, as installing a custom launcher is an easy fix to the homescreen set up if it bothers you. Besides the coat of iPaint, the software is fairly bland and unobtrusive. The quantity of pre-installed apps is worthy of praise. There is not a single app on the tablet that I would classify as bloat. There are a couple custom tool apps, like the calculator and notes app, but besides that there's not much else taking up space on the device. This leaves a large portion of the 64GB of on-board storage available for personal use, which is good since there is no expandable memory on the tablet. (The available storage in the image is not indicative of the total storage capacity as additional apps and games were installed on the tablet when I took the screenshot.) There are a few of software touches added by Xioami that I do enjoy. You can wake the tablet with a double tap of the screen, a blue light filter setting is included in  the quick settings shade, and the system animations all look fluid and elegant. The settings menus are also laid out in a manner that I found intuitive and user friendly. Besides that, there's not a lot else to be said. It's a bland version of Nougat that looks like iOS and is missing a couple of useful features. Conclusion It's common knowledge that global tablet sales are down. It seems we, as consumers, have figured out that very few people actually need a tablet. Our phones screens are getting larger, and our laptops are getting thinner and more tablet-like with touchscreens, fold over displays, and lift away bodies. There's just less need for a third device to fit between these two, and most people who need one already have one, and don't have many compelling reasons to upgrade. Most tablets aren't great for productivity, and the Mi Pad 3 is worse than average in that regard. Its predecessor, the Mi Pad 2, rocked Android, but was also available with Windows, making it at least a little business friendly. This new model can't even run split screen apps. Where it does shine is as a media consumption device. With its beautiful screen, competent battery life, and adequate performance, this is a great tablet for killing time during a commute or flight. There is a problem with the Mi Pad 3, though, at least for US based readers: it's way too expensive for what you get. GeekBuying, who supplied our review unit sells them for $250 (thanks guys). For just $50 more you can buy a 128GB iPad Mini 4, or a full-size 32GB iPad. Granted, those are limited time sale prices, but still, you'd have to be kinda nuts to go with the Mi Pad over an iPad. Even as an Android fanatic myself, I readily admit that Apple just does tablet software better. I'm sure I'll take heat for that in the comments, but I doubt any other writer at AP would disagree. If you want a cheap media consumption device, you can pick up an 8 inch Amazon fire tablet for $80-125. The screen won't be as pretty, and the build quality won't be as nice, but for less than half the price you still get a serviceable tablet. At $150-175, the Mi Pad 3 would be easy to recommend to Android purists who want a tablet with nice build quality and a great screen. At $250, with mediocre software and a lengthy list of small irritations, I just don't really know who is going to want to buy this. Perhaps you disagree, so feel free to tell me why in the comments. Also, if there are any questions you still have that weren't answered by the review, drop them below and I'll do my best to answer them.

PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol MJ "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?" No... I dislike Apple as a company and as a platform so much I don't really what a device that looks like iJunk. Jeff Beck I really need to start putting an asterisk next to every sentence that is intended to be read with sarcasm. MJ Do you really think that would stop me? LOL I have read many comments by Android users that seem to admire Apple's hardware design. TannoV Well I mean, Apple's design is pretty good. Those Jet Black and Product(RED) iPhone 7 designs were stunningly gorgeous, and the pre-trashcan Mac Pro had a beautiful case. Timothy Vreeland Since they started using all metal designs on their phones, Apple devices have looked great (aside from the absurd bezels). Pre HTC styling though, their designs were some of the ugliest available in the smart phone market. Lord Argyris The recent MBPs (2016 and onward) are gorgeous. I'm typing on one right now. Looks were far from the only reason I bought it, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't factor somewhat into it. It's almost like there's some law against making a Windows laptop that isn't tapered, or where the screen and bottom actually meet flush, or which doesn't have bits chiseled off the sides. The MBP is one of only a tiny handful of laptops that actually look good in profile (the Chromebook Pixel was another example, even with the weird hinge sticking out in the back). Jeff Beck I read that first sentence in my best villain voice in my head. jesuguru An asterisk is definitely the best and most universally recognized way to denote sarcasm. /s Jeff Beck You have a point there... George but then your articles would just be one big asterisk~ C64 Mediatek.. no no no no Daniel I'm surprised nobody else is complaining about this. If it ain't Snapdragon (RIP Intel), I'm not gonna buy it. Random! Read Daniel Marcus' comment on it. genericanimefan "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?" Can't say I ever have JG Ditto. But, now, I'm kinda curious how an Apple made Android device would turn out. Technically, nothing would stop them, other than Apple considering Android to be an inferior OS... They'd probably do like Amazon, a heavily tweaked fork (resembling iOS) with no Google services. Of course, without the Play Store... Unless Apple could find a way to get iOS apps to run native on Android. Daniel They would never risk that. They know how smart us Androiders are (the tinkerers anyway), and they also know we would get iOS apps on other devices with some work. Dmitry Stepanushkin Tinkerers are minority. You need a lot of knowledge and time to do it. Also Apple can easily lock bootloader and never give You keys or specs and tools to do something they don't want You to. For example, see how DRM implemented. Without Google Play Services they even don't need to pass Google checks. So they may do anything possible to protect it from "tinkerers". Daniel We might be a minority, but we usually give away the mods (XDA devs). And if Apple did make a device, lots of people would use it; increasing the amount of tinkerers. Dmitry Stepanushkin If they make such device, and it will be cheaper than iPad, it will sell good. Many people will buy it for "first Apple tablet running Android". I expect high quality hardware. If it will even run iOS apps, then many iPad users may switch to it. JSo "An iPad mini that runs Android." Yeah, a crappy version of Android. John Maverick Android on tablets is a complete disgrace TannoV Depends. It's not great, but with some tweaks it works fine. John Maverick I have a Galaxy Tab A 10.1. The Tablet itself it's great and Samsung did a good job with Touchwiz, even if it is still running on Marshmallow. The apps however, on a bigger screen (that it's not a tv) are a complete shame, terrible and embarassing. Daniel Not always. But with Android apps on Chromebooks, it's better to use Chrome OS for your tablet needs anyway. Chava Salinas R I totally agree with the conclusion, I have an iPad Air and barely use, an iPad mini for work and it stays in my backpack most of the time. At some point I considered getting a Pixel C, but after giving it some thought, I felt that there was no need to upgrade, my Android phone serves most of my needs and my 2-in-1 Windows laptop fills the gap when in need for a bigger screen. dextersgenius @Jeff: What's the GPS on this like? Also, how's the audio quality via 3.5mm? Imparus "Even as an Android fanatic myself, I readily admit that Apple just does tablet software better." Unfortunately the apps I use on my tablet aren't available on iOS nor are any app that can give the same experience, so I can't just buy an iPad even if the OS might be better designed for tablet (doesn't matter much when it is the apps that is most important). Hopefully Google or Nvidia brings out a new tablet this year or the next, so I at least have some good options when it becomes time to upgrade. NooSH "Capacitive buttons: Come on, even Samsung gave those up." .. uh, maybe on phones they did, but samsung tablets all still have Capacitive touch buttons, even the latest Tab S3.. i will agree that i wish tablets would shy away from capacitive buttons, just pointing that out. Timothy Vreeland Yes. Also most current tablets don't have a finger print reader ,so it isn't as absurd as the written makes it seem. Patriciaahenry Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Sam Koda I think it is time you guys stop complaining about the lack of app drawer in MIUI. MIUI never had any app drawer and probably never will. Get used to it. When you review a device with MIUI, it is understood that it doesn't come with app drawer. The best you can do instead of repeating yourself is to put a link to the review of MIUI. Timothy Vreeland Agreed. Jeff Beck My first experience with MIUI. I'll complain about it every time as it might be the only article a person reads about a MIUI device. Sam Koda You are right, it might be the only article a person reads. Does that means your regular readers should also read it all the time?. My opinion is still relevant. You can put a link to the review of MIUI 8. And let it be. And if a Xiaomi device comes with some special feature, which is not available on the regular MIUI you just post it. Nathan J There really aren't any great new Android tablets. But, for those who like Android but not necessarily for Android apps, but more the tinkering aspect, I would urge you to go Raspberry Pi. There's a 7" touch screen you can get for it, and a case that holds the screen, the Pi, and a battery (power pack). So while not as portable as a tablet (it's like a tablet with a big hump on the back), it's totally tinker friendly, hardware and software. If you think, "I like tinkering on Android, but I'll void the warranty and there are obstacles," get a Pi and mess around with it. And everything runs off a microSD card, so get several and rotate projects. I'm a big fan of one called RetroPie. ;) Тарас Мукин I don't really get the point of small tablets anymore. Phones are big enough, difference is not significant. I'd rather buy iPad Pro with android, than Mini one. (And yes, I am aware of Pixel C and Samsung devices -- they are too powerful and expensive for what I'd want them to use) Andy Roid No micro SD slot? Into the trash it goes I use tablets for media consumption, especially when travelling. 64GB non-expandable storage just won't cut it Rann Xeroxx Xiaomi makes a 7.9" ipad mini clone tablet that runs Windows 10. This is the one I would buy if I were buying one. Thomas Gladdines This is one sad iteration, the Mi Pad 2 was better in almost all aspects and even ran windows 10 as an additional option... Tiwi see the sw support to mipad 1 and 2..this tab will be update for 6 months and then stop.. so, Save money o change brand :D Dmitry Stepanushkin Save money, buy iPad😂 Kevin Davis Mediatek. Well, that ended that discussion. Daniel Marcus Can we get over the stigma around MediaTek already? Their Kernel repository is regularly updated (last push was for Android Wear, about two weeks ago), their chips run cool, their radios have good reception, their reference firmware is highly stable and has great debugging tools for developers, and their flashing software is easy enough to use and their devices are difficult to brick. Their chips aren't the fastest, but they aren't particularly slow. They aren't so far behind in any technical way so as to impact the use of the devices. Frankly, the only thing Qualcomm really has over MediaTek at this point is raw speed, and that comes at the cost of heat and power use. Every time I see Google making changes to Android in the name of battery life, I have to wonder why. MediaTek has had standby power usage on par or better than the current versions of Android with Qualcomm processors for years now. (This tablet has significantly worse standby than the older MediaTek tablet I had that ran near-stock Android 5.1.) We complain that Qualcomm's phones get hot and have to be throttled. We complain that Samsung and often other phones with Qualcomm radios have poor reception. Bluetooth issues have been common, even on Google's own Pixel devices. Qualcomm has dropped support for the Snapdragon 801, and with it many once-flagship devices that won't get Android 7. (MediaTek is still actively adding Android 7 support to older devices, including processors released around the same time as the 801.) I'm not saying MediaTek is perfect, but I think it's time to recognize that Qualcomm isn't some perfect chipset poster child. Just because a device is using a MediaTek chip instead of a Qualcomm doesn't have any real impact on the performance or longevity of the device in daily use. Kevin Davis Nope. Hey, why don't you write a book next time instead of an endless run on comment. Here's a thought, you use them if you like them. Wow, lots of lengthy butthurt. 😂 WesleySmalls I don't find your comment all that long. It's pretty funny really, because you have been completely owned in this discussion, without any effort. Your "lol ur butthurt" comment gave that away. Kevin Davis Lol. Hard to believe. There are actually a few mediatek trolls. Have a super day, little buddy. 😂 WesleySmalls "Anyone who doesn't share my views or completely owns me in a discussion is a troll" Kevin Davis Whatever makes you feel better, little mediatek bitch. LMFAO WesleySmalls I haven't even said anything about MediaTek, so that was a pretty sad reply. I don't even have to do anything, you'll just own yourself. Kevin Davis Lol. F'ck off, moron boy. WesleySmalls Aww you don't like it little fella? Maybe mommy can get you some apple juice Kevin Davis Does mediatek pay you per comment, little shitbag troll? WesleySmalls Did MediaTek steal your apple juice, little fella? Kevin Davis F'ck off, mediatek bitchboy WesleySmalls It was a serious question; what did MediaTek do to you that makes you so paranoid? Kevin Davis You're not serious about anything other than being a little troll. They make garbage. I don't use them. If you like them, use them. Is that hard to follow? Oh , and F'ck off, boy. WesleySmalls Wow, so because they make products that you do not like that makes anyone who opposes you a "troll" or "MediaTek shill"? That's pretty sad, especially considering you are applying this to the conversation that never discussed, nor even named this. Now go and drink your apple juice, ISIS supporter(notice how I accuse you of something that has not even been named in the conversation) Kevin Davis Goodbye, mediatek bitch. Boring. WesleySmalls I really don't get why you keep calling me that when I haven't said anything about that. Kevin Davis Blah, blah, blah.......Boring and blocked. I hope they pay per post. Goodbye, mediatek bitch. WesleySmalls Hahaha that's so sad! wow Damn. You really embarrassed yourself. Could've just responded to the comment with facts to counter what the poster was saying, but instead made it obvious that you had nothing to say and no way of maturely handling a disagreement by running around calling random people "boy" or "troll". Kevin Davis Hello shitbag, and goodbye. Go fuck yourSELVES. 🖕🏻 wow Lmaooo thanks for proving my point. You really gave me a laugh 😂😂 Random! Mediatek doesn't have any support in custom ROMs. As soon as Mediatek starts helping developers and release enough info to enable custom ROM developers to support their chipsets, I'll adopt Mediatek as a viable option. Until then, no thanks. I'll never rely solely on manufacturer updates, specially if this manufacturer chose a budget chipset. Daniel Marcus The second sentence in my post I noted that MediaTek is now regularly updating their source repository. There are several MTK devices that have unlocked bootloaders and fairly decent ROM support (say, the Blu R1 and several Umi devices). The reason for a lack of custom software development is low market penetration, not anything inherent in their chips today. As you have demonstrated, though, people tend to keep old views and all the marketing done around Snapdragon and the importance of benchmarks has led companies to use those chips in major product launches. Similarly, the lack of software updates to MediaTek based devices is mostly because they're cheaper devices that just don't pay to update, not because MediaTek hasn't provided updated firmware for the chipset. My current daily driver is a Blu R1 Plus. It runs pretty much stock Android 6.0 which is, frankly, almost indistinguishable from 7.1. It's snappy, has great reception and battery life, and between VoLTE support and some excellent noise cancellation, the calls are exceptionally clear. Unlike my Nexus 5x, the Bluetooth is very reliable. It's not the fastest device, nor does it have the best camera, and it's a couple of (minor) versions of Android behind. As a phone though, it's exactly what I need. Also, it was $160, so I can't really complain. Random! Let's hope the custom ROM situation keeps improving. I have no prejudice against non-mainstream chipsets, I'm just worried about updates and software choices (nobody likes shitty stock out-of-date spyware-ridden firmware). As soon as there's a Mediatek-based phone with almost-flagship performance and decent custom ROM support (at least official Lineage) I'll jump on it. I'm a huge enthusiast of phones with a good cost/benefit. Btw, I've just remembered my dad's phone is Mediatek-based. It's a Lenovo K3 Note (MT6752), has decent performance at a decent price, but finding a custom ROM for it and making it work was a royal pain in the ass. Running some​ unofficial version of Lineage It's still far from perfect, but much much better than the spyware-ridden OS that came with it (it wasn't even stock, just some atrocious ROM installed by eBay vendor to offer support for languages beyond the Chinese and English options available with the stock os) Edward Green Hmm. I have a Chromebook Plus for when I need a larger screen. I also have the smaller Asus Flip for when that is too big (although DPI is too low for use as a reader even if it is a great panel). Even without (coming) resizable window support you can have apps side by side, floating, and desktop Web Apps too. But I still have a use for a 7/8 inch tablet, and Android is okay at that size. When giving a talk you can run PPT remote and have notes, slide and controls in a one handed but readable device. (And Bluetooth to Android Apps on ChromeOS is pretty broken last time I checked) This ticks a lot of Nexus 7 replacement boxes - except the lack of split screen. What are the other options? Daniel Hey, the Plus has 7.0 (Nougat). Google introduced better resizing support in nougat and it will completely ready by 8.0 Davis Hernandez so, they ditched the first gen's Tegra k1 for a mediatek in the next two installments? WTF Zxyon Rhysivz Should have an SD card slot Martin Cohen I just got the Amazon 8" Fire. After installing the Google Play Store (look it up), it is fine for me. Only 1280 x 800, but for $110 with 32GB, especially since it can use a 128GB card, quite acceptable. xyz "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?"

Google hires ex-Apple chipset veteran to help design SoCs for Pixel phones Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/13 11:36am PDTJun 13, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 195 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Google's hardware plans for the future are getting bigger. Variety is reporting that Google has hired Manu Gulati, a hardware architect, away from Apple. Gulati is reported as having previously played a significant role in the development of Apple's SoCs for the last eight years and was hired sometime in the last few weeks. His new title at Google is Lead SOC Architect, and he's expected to work on custom chipsets for future Pixel phones. If Manu Gulati can apply the same black magic to Google's future products as he did on Apple's custom chips, things could be fantastic. Apple's "A" series chips are amazing pieces of hardware. Though Apple does license ARM's tech, unlike other manufacturers, they don't just toss the licensed reference designs on a wafer. Apple has bent over backward to optimize their silicon architecture for iOS, and the resulting performance on Apple devices definitely demonstrates that. Although some Android chipset vendors, such as Qualcomm, do make custom designs like the Kryo, for whatever reason Apple's custom hardware (combined with their software) has held an edge in performance for years. For most of us, any advantage the A series chips have doesn't make any difference without the Android operating system. But if Google is able to bring the same degree of performance enhancements and customization over into their future hardware, the future of Android SoC performance could be bright. After the dark and regressive ages of the Snapdragon 808/810 and Qualcomm's rushed 64bit development cycle, I would like nothing more than to see Google bring a first party chipset in a future Pixel device. And who knows, they might even sell it to other manufacturers, increasing competition in the currently stagnant mobile chipset space. Gulati joining Google finally lends credence to the old stories of Google's interest in SoC designing. And it appears to be full steam ahead, as supplemental job postings for SoC design have appeared on Google Careers. Whether these efforts result in a new custom chipset by Google, or we just see some new specialized hardware for machine learning, either way, things should be interesting.

Now Google just needs to start selling Pixel devices in South America (or specifically in Brazil). Leonardo Loures Quirino Amém! Renan Hehe. I knew more brazilians wanted Google's stuff. Yoshi Everyone here wants it, bro. Look at all the people wishing the good times of Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and 5 selling in almost every good store. Renan I know. I'm one of these people, lol Lucas de Eiroz ™ Google Pixel, Google Store, Android Pay (and Google Wallet), and all Google services! Renan I'm dying for Android Pay! Random! They'd better reduce their prices first by at least 50% Renan That would be a dream, too. Ricardo Ferreira If they are priced like Moto/Lenovo is, it should be a blessing. Take the Moto G5 for example and you'll see that our price isn't that far off. Freek Smulders This could be yuge! Lord Argyris Bigly big league! Duder12 HUGE kabiluddin Guess we'll see the new custom soc in late 2018/9 Honestly can't wait. destinyhud pixel 3 then!!! Godspoken I recall "Google silicon" being referenced last year as a future goal of the Pixel, very exciting. blackice85 Isn't that one of the things holding them back from providing updates for longer periods of time too? Could be a big deal not just for the performance gains. Gregory That Project Treble thing or how do you call it in O is also all about cutting on dependencies from third parties like Qualcomm. blackice85 Oh I hadn't heard about that, I bet this is one aspect of it then. Duder12 Project Treble doesnt improve years of update support. It brings updates faster since Qualcomm and OEMs can work on software updates at the same time. Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. Google doing their own SOC is the only real answer Gregory From my understanding, it eliminates the need for the drivers to be updated in the first place. someone755 You can't expect to not update drivers with new Android versions. Say there's an Android system API that a driver adheres to. As something banal, let's say we have a driver that controls whether the hardware button backlight is on or off, and that the system can control whether it is either on or off. Then a newer Android version appears which supports both the old API but also a newer one, wherein the hardware backlight can be controlled as if it were analog (from 0-255 for example). Then, the third system version comes out that ditches support for the old API and only still supports the newer one. Yes the OEM could hack things up so that values 0-254 would mean the light is off and then 255 would mean it's on, but this further complicates both the user experience and app compatibility as well as future system version compatibility. At this point if you want a stable and future-proof software solution, you absolutely have to update the driver to support the new API. And if the backlight vendor can't provide one, then it's more trouble than it's worth for the OEM to do the hack themselves and they just post a note online saying your device won't get upgraded, leaving you with no choice but to either resort to community hacks or buy a new device. Yes the example is completely idiotic but it serves as an example of why you can't go around updating devices without driver updates. Aside from the functionality aspect there are many security flaws that could affect a driver. And not updating that huge gaping hole in your security while providing monthly 'security patches' that claim to solve security threats is just inane. At that point why even bother with security patches if you can't expect chipset vendors to fix the problems in their closed-source firmware, or hold them accountable for it. Gregory While I completely understand your point, I'd like to extend it to say that there could be such a backlight that can be either on or off, and it's a hardware limitation, so it isn't possible to fully implement the new API on that device. I mean, hardware configurations vary, it's a matter of fact. The point of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is to abstract away the differences across the underlying hardware, and provide a unified API for the system services to interact with said hardware. If the HAL doesn't provide support for some new feature that was added in a system update but the hardware could technically support it, it still means that the system would behave as though that feature isn't supported by the hardware, and that's it. I'd rather have a device that doesn't support that new feature than a device that is no longer updated. And security... How about people ALWAYS check for buffer boundaries before copying memory? What do they do with all that time and disk space they save? Or, at least, if they're that lazy, run a static analyzer on your code and fix whatever it finds. And run it in valgrind to find memory leaks. It's not that hard to write vulnerability-free code from the start. someone755 But a device will never pass certification, either by Google or an FCC-like entity or another office, with broken features. This is exactly why the 8974 line got dropped -- the hardware didn't support a feature that Google wanted so they didn't let any 8974 device pass CTS. How do you think people running Nougat just fine on their hammerheads (via one custom ROM or another) feel about this conundrum when they've been cut short an entire system update because of Google's insane chip requirements? It's easy to know how to prevent bad code but often times projects start simple and private and unoptimized, and then grow into something much larger that's hard to maintain. A classic example is Android itself (look at all the memory leaks that L introduced). Gregory Well... If a device passed certification by Google (CTS) and carriers, that feature was optional from the beginning, right? Android does already support a plethora of different hardware configurations with different capabilities. If a device didn't have some feature at launch, I don't expect it to have that feature enabled with a software update. CTS is about keeping compatibility with apps (it tests public APIs), it has nothing to do with drivers and hardware. There are literally no hardware requirements that make it impossible to update existing devices more than a year or two. Carrier certification is about device interfacing correctly with carrier equipment, it did so well when it was released and certified, so just don't touch the modem firmware because it's already doing its job good enough, as simple as that. There are exactly zero reasons to modify the HAL for system updates provided HAL and the rest of the system are properly separated, which, from my understanding, they are with Project Treble. It also adds CTS-like standardized test suite for these things. What the hell is 8974? someone755 Msm8974. The Snapdragon 800 platform that phones like the N5, Z3, G2, S5, M8 etc were based on. That got blocked from receiving any sort of updates because Google decided that Vulkan or GL 3.1 was necessary for the upgrade. Not that modern low-end phones are capable of performing the task that the requirement was set for anyways. Basically the thing my entire argument is set around but alright... Owais Lone > Qualcomm can still decide to not ship new drivers for old versions of Android just like they always have. ... and Project Treble will enable device vendors to still ship updates in this exact case. Project Treble cuts out qualcom and SoC manufacturers out of the update cycle. The device vendors will be bottleneck and decision makers now. someone755 This is incorrect. Please see my reply to Gregory above. Owais Lone Your example exactly illustrates the problem now. Project Treble is supposed to abstract these internal hardware level ABIs/APIs so vendors don't have to re-implement the whole layer again. Only time when SOC vendors will have to update their code is when Project Treble itself comes out with a breaking change and a major version upgrade. Of course, vendors might have to or want to make changes here and there but the abstraction should save them from re-doing all of it on every update and if the vendor does not want to improve/optimize with every update, they shouldn't have to make any changes at all unless Treble itself comes out with an incompatible update. someone755 And say that Android P is the one where the button backlight brightness from my example becomes an analog value and the digital on/off API is dropped. Then the phones that incorporate this function will either have to have the driver updated or will not get updated to the next Android version. This is a problem and always will be, as long as chip vendors are not held responsible and held to a higher standard, and as long as the entities that certify devices for daily use (CTS, FCC etc) have some standards themselves (in the sense of not letting devices with broken/missing core features pass). Owais Lone If such a change happens at the HW level, it'll be abstracted at the treble API level so phones that leverage treble API will not need any change at all. Vendors would need to update their code if the change happened in Treble's apI itself which is extremely unlikely as it'll defeat the purpose of having Treble in the first place. That said, there will be major updates to Treble which might break backward compatibility but it's Google's job to keep those changes at a minimal or the whole idea will be worthless. someone755 This is exactly what I'm saying -- if Treble changes (which it most probably will across Android versions, as the system has changed until now), the chip vendors will *have* to provide updates. And there is no way around this limitation, Treble or not, if Google makes some absurd changes then phones won't get updated. Owais Lone Yes, that is true but why would that happen in the first place? That would completely defeat the purpose. Treble will most likely always be backward compatible. It'll probably only add new features and new APIs but not break existing ones. That's how I would handle the project. Sukrith Krishnakumar If I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! Suicide_Note Your loss. MJ How about you wait for the reviews first before deciding to skip it or not? Sukrith Krishnakumar Even if I have enough money to buy a pixel by that time I'll surely be skipping the first pixel with this soc! Who knows if SD808/810, LG nucleon or nucleus or whatever it was called happens with this soc as well?! TheRunner024 This is great news. How long will it take them to build a SoC? 2 years? Keith Taylor Yep bout that long. destinyhud yeah 2 years. they started this in 2015 so i would guess maybe pixel 3 could have google soc Daniel I've always been a Snapdragon all the way kind of guy, but this would definitely fix updates, give better performance, and bunches of other stuff. I'm a convert. Ditch you Snapdragon. Renan I'm with you. As long as this brings longer support for Google's devices, I'm in. psy spy Always Snapdragon? What choices did you have? Iwanova Nvidia & Mediatek? (I know, Mediatek have no source code, but still. It's mobile SoC right) jesuguru Exynos? Nomaan There was quite a competition until 2012 when we had Snapdragon, Exynos, Tegra, OMAP, NovaThor in the SoC game. Lateef Alabi-Oki Anything to put Qualcomm, with their shitty inefficient power-hungry proprietary insecure SoC drivers, out of our misery is welcome. h4rr4r Please get the drivers in mainline or at least GPLed and into AOSP. MJ I am not as excited (yet) as most of you are about this. I see two possible scenarios coming out of custom chipset from Google... 1.) The main reason Apple's SoC performs better is because it's optimized for iOS and only iOS. It is not properly documented so no other OS can really run it. I would rather stick with a Qualcomm SoC if Google goes down this road. 2.) Google creates a fully open and documented SoC but it performs no better than Apple's or Qualcomm's chips. I would prefer a fully open and documented chipset that can compete as good or better than anything else out there. Possible? I don't know... Regardless, I suspect Google is looking to make some custom hardware for AI or VR first before we see a custom chipset for a phone.

MadMartigan I'm guessing he's just really proud of his ability to copy and paste and is just showing off. Hey, some folks never even get that far. ;-) Thinker Geekbench is comparable across platforms. Therefore A10x chip (for example) will outperform Qualcomm chip on Android as well. MJ I am sure it may BUT it will perform even better with iOS. Android will never run on a A10x SoC so who cares? My point is I am not interested in a chipset that can only run Android. reggjoo That would be a fair test if you could load a "neutral​" os on both platforms, then run test. It will never happen though.

Phoenix keep on dreaming Thinker Apple A10x: Single thread 3900 Multi thread 9300 ------------------------- MacBook Pro 2016 intel: Single 3900 Multi 7700 No, Qualcomm S835 is far away from coming close to intel. Now, apple A10x is very competitive especially considering that A10x is fan-less design. Enough said. Just_No_Stop Firstly you dont say which Intel chip, the fastest laptop chip is WAY faster than the A10x. Secondly, they run 2 totally different OSes, one is very much single threaded, that can run limited threads when it does run multi-thread, and as such can dedicate the entire CPU to the benchmark. OSX is very multi-threaded, and doesnt do that, it will always run more background threads. Thirdly the A10x isnt a phone chip, its a laptop/tablet chip, and actually eats battery like crazy when full throttle, and gets very hot when it does, and as so doesnt do so for long. Thinker Geekbench 4 is functionally same across all platforms. Thus comparable. Read Geekbench blog. Oh forgot one more thing...A10x has 3 CPU cores while Intel chip above has 4 CPU cores. That only further makes multi-thread score more impressive!! Intel chip above is standard intel in base Macbook PRO in 2016. If you take fan out of Intel devices, then would that equalize things for you?? Lol. Wanna bet which will be better?! Just_No_Stop It might be functionally the same, but the OS is not, and despite claims (by the developer which has a bias to sell its product) its not comparable across platforms. It doesnt even generate the same score on the same CPU between OSX, Linux and Windows, let alone iOS and android. The base Macbook Pro from 2016 has 2 cores, so again.. which chip is it? The A10x cannot run full throttle for long, the Intel can run flat out all the time, doing the same task, if even remotely prolonged, the Intel will win. The Intel is all much more flexible than the A10x. It capable of unoptimised maths that the A10x would simple die a death trying to run. Its is at least an order of magnitude faster than the A10x, which a full desktop class OS needs. Thats why there is no A10x powered Macbook Pro. Thinker Intel has a fan. Take out fan and what happens? Just_No_Stop It would probably not be able to run as long, but it would more than manage the few seconds per test of Geekbench. Thinker Huh?! Wtf?! Please stop talking. Just_No_Stop How is that not true? I have run geekbench multiple times on my laptop and desktop, and the fan doesnt kick in on my laptop and doesnt throttle up on my desktop. Its a very brief, and very poor benchmark. You still fail to understand how the usage scenarios in an iPad Pro and a desktop class PC are completely different, which is why one goes for single core performance, and the other multicore. So i will repeat, its not that Intel cant beat Apple, its that they dont need to. Its made even worse by the fact that most laptops are seriously storage speed limited, even an SSD only helps so much, and the CPU is still waiting. The A10, in a laptop would be awful. One core would be almost always in use for background tasks, and as such would burn through battery. Android is not that dissimilar, it has far more background activity than iOS, and therefore needs less powerful, more numerous cores that use less power. The trick is making all those cores useful when you need to run a single powerful task. This is something that Android has got much better at, but it doesnt really show up well in benchmarks. Thinker The Apple iPad PRO 12.9 from 2015 with merely 2 CPU cores active at any single time (Apple A9X) and 4 GB of RAM. Yet with iOS11, it can run FOUR active windows at once. Yes, 4 windows all active and you can interact with all 4. Now, on the other hand, on Android with those 8-12 cores of CPU, you see apps constantly being kicked out of memory despite 6-8 GB RAM! Background activity you say? BS! BTW, a single powerful task does NOT need 6-8 cores of CPU. Again, please STFU! You’re really embarrassing yourself! Hrishikesh Bisen You are a plan idiot. Thinker Cross-Platform Designed from the ground-up for cross-platform comparisons, Geekbench 4 allows you to compare system performance across devices, processor architectures, and operating systems. Geekbench 4 supports Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Source: Geekbench. Just_No_Stop Source.. the company that makes and wants to sell the benchmark. Unfortunately reality doesnt support that claim. Thinker Lol. Geekbench is universally accepted. Just_No_Stop by plenty of sites that have no idea how it works, which is most of them. Thinker Here's a comparison of interest: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/3042292?baseline=3036382 Just_No_Stop iOS is not comparable to Windows 10. The Intel chip is 18% faster than the A10X in multi-core. geekbench does very badly with hyperthreading, which for applications that make use of it adds a huge performance advantage. Many apps now use it. It should also be noted that the A10x is a SoC, that includes hardware acceleration for some things that the Intel chip isnt designed for, and has little use traditionally on Laptops, this further distorts the score in the A10x favour. Dont get me wrong, its a good CPU, but its not all that. If there was an ARM Windows 10 it wouldnt run as well on the A10x as x64 windows does on Core iX. It should also be noted that there are 3 SoC that beat the standard A10 on Android, which also is more background threaded than iOS, and as such cant dedicate 100% of the CPU to the benchmark. Thinker Remind me...doesn't intel have that TURBO thingy? 3 Android SoC that beat A10?!?! 😂 Dude, you make me laugh!! Hint: single core is far more important. And remember A10 is dual core at any one time unlike Android SoC. Some of those Android are actually firing up all EIGHT cores to beat Apple's two!!! Just_No_Stop Single core is more important on iOS, not Android. Do you really think ARM and Qualcomm and Samsung, who have been at this for years, cant make a CPU as fast as Apple? They can, but the platform doesnt require such Single core performance, and making a CPU like that would hurt performance of Android, not help it. ARM has done extensive testing of such setups, but has rejected them for a reason. If you must know the A10 is very similar in structure to the Intel Core, which is why its fast, but its also why it cant run 4 cores and be power efficient. Its clear you have no idea how a CPU works, or an OS, and you put WAY to much faith in a commercial benchmark. Thinker Let's test your knowledge since you claim to know so much...how many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? No, Samsung and Qualcomm do NOT use custom design cores dumbass. They use generic core design from ARM. In fact I believe S835 CPU core design took a step backward too. But you know all this already. APPLE uses fully custom cores designed upon ARMv8 architecture. What you wrote is pure ignorance. Please stop. Just_No_Stop Qualcomm do use custom designs, Samsung doesnt, and yet the Exynos 8895 is faster than the A10.. It seems you are the ignorant one. Thinker Wrong. Anandtech: "The new Kryo 280, despite the similar name, shares no design DNA with the original Kryo. Its an octa-core, big.LITTLE configuration with four “performance” cores and four lower-power “efficiency” cores. What makes Kryo 280 unique, however, is that it’s the first design to use ARM’s new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" (BoC) license, which allows vendors to customize ARM cores. This new semi-custom option gives vendors the ability to differentiate their products from those using ARM’s stock cores while avoiding the more costly route of creating a fully-custom design from scratch." Again, like I said above, S835 CPU core was a step BACKWARDS. It is basically a generic CPU core with memory controller from Qualcomm. S820 used custom cores but with S835, Qualcomm used generic. Again, you never answered my other question. How many instruction set per cycle can A10 do vs S835? STFU dude. You are ignorant. Just_No_Stop You realise that a SoC isnt just the cores right? The memory controller and GPU are what make the 835 custom. If the 835 and the Exynos are generic then why is the Exynos faster despite a lower clock? Again, you lack understanding, all you can do is regurgitate rubbish you have read on a website. Exynos is almost entirely ARM reference, the 835 is not, generic cores maybe, but otherwise completely custom. Sadly all that customisation results in lower performance, not more. Why does it matter how many instructions per cycle it can do? What matters is the total performance. Instructions per cycle is a very old fashioned way of looking at CPU speed, more so than ever now with multicore setups and microcode interpretors. yet again you show a complete lack of understanding about how a modern SoC works. Anyone could design a CPU like the A10, only apple does, because only Apple need one like that, it doesnt show genius, or more advanced design, its just different to similarly performing ARM and Intel CPUs. Frankly I'm just blocking you now, since you arent interested in learning. Thinker Damn you're ignorant. I see that you're backtracking like crazy!! Lol No, S835 CPU core is generic. No one talked about GPU. LOL INSTRUCTIONS PER CYCLE has nothing to do about CPU speed!! Wtf are you talking about?! Typical Android dumbass who thinks he knows tech. Anyone can design like Apple yet everyone is envious of Apple chip design team, including Google!! You're a dumbass. Thinker Even today, i am still laughing at your ignorance!!! Thanks for the laugh!! PhaseBurn Google's been in the hardware field for a very, very long time, originally using Scorpion ARM-based CPUs that predate the SnapDragon, even (https://www.wired.com/2012/09/pluto-switch/). Despite what Variety says about Gulati joining to design SoCs for the Pixel line, I'm guessing that their internal SoC group will end up working on a lot of their platform networking and datacenter fabric next generation designs, in addition to anything they do on a future Pixel phone. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I'm pretty excited to hear about this news. I've always wanna see Google have their own custom chips for their hardware. Google love plot twist #2 roberto.elena I'm personally more interested in a Google SoC for Chromebooks. It's not that I don't find this news interesting for mobiles, but the biggest benefit, even more important than improved performance, is extended OS support. At the current pace of hardware improvement, I'm not interested in owning a phone for more than 1 or 2 years, but a Chromebook is a different story. I would keep it for several years. destinyhud good point. intel is fast but have issues with android apps. other oem are not that fast enough and qualcomm wont come to chromebook at least for now. so this chip used in chromebook pixel would be awesome Midnitte Sort of wish somebody (Intel, AMD,.... Google) would purchase MediaTek and position them to actually compete with Snapdragon, so that we could all benefit from longer/quicker upgrades, not to mention performance. someone755 MediaTek's strategy is much like AMD's was just a few years ago in the desktop space. The money for them is up to where OEMs (who make low-end and midrange phones) are willing to pay for the chips -- any higher and they don't have the knowledge/technology/budget to produce something more powerful. Any lower and, well, this is as low as it can go, and the other competitors (Qualcomm, Intel) have worse-performing chips available for the price that MediaTek offers theirs at. Why that is, I have no clue, but I suspect it could have something to do with Qcom having a monopoly on ARM-based chips, and Intel thinking that their overpriced-desktop-chips-with-no-competitor strategy is going to work here, in a highly competitive environment. The point here being that MediaTek works off tight margins and sells in large quantities. Restructuring this process so that it fits our idea of a Qualcomm competitor would be expensive, and definitely riskier than what the payoff is worth to the investor. reggjoo Maybe he can help bring that single core performance up to apple levels. It won't really make a big difference in the global grand scheme of things, but it would kill all that bragging rights talk. usamaisawake I know we can never know, but I honestly think that the A-chips are, on their own, just really damn good chips. iOS optimization helps, but I think a lot of it is Apple's designers. Marty I'm liking the sound of that. But going by Google's declaration that the Pixel phones are made by Google when in fact they are designed and made by HTC, these SoCs will probably be shelf-bought from the cheapest vendor. destinyhud i am sorry u r wrong at this part. designed by google and made by HTC. same like apples designed by apple claim. Marty Wrong. It's now known the Pixels were designed and made by HTC. http://www.androidauthority.com/google-hidden-htc-involvement-google-pixel-xl-code-723953/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/05/the-pixel-smartphone-is-actually-made-by-htc-not-google/#52ca3eb1e99a https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-htc-will-real-manufacturer-googles-phones-share-glory destinyhud its now knows to just u or what?? because eveyone know its designed by google. but they def have HTC previous device influence. google interview clearly said they tried to design pixel as non iphone design as possible. we are talking about hardware. finding code reference is not equal to HTC made hardware. how does that login even correlate? all the article u posted said it is made by HTC and i didnt disagree on that. it is made by HTC but designed by Google. try harder. https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/google-pixel-how-google-designed-its-first-real-phone/ Marty Read the AA article. It clearly shows HTC footprints in both hardware and software design. destinyhud AA article says nothing about hardware footprint just software foot print. software is not hardware. also there are similar article which said google was building nexus by HTC and finally decided to make their own phone which is why u could find htc code when it was in early development. we are not talking about software here again. Marty The HTC hardware footprint is clearly seen in the design. And it's noteworthy that the software would have any OEM influence at all since Android is a Google creation. You can claim whatever you want, but the evidence is clear and has been clear since the Pixels were released. Talk to the hand... needa But once you open up the phone, you can see that HTC did not design the hardware inside of it. That is always the tell tale sign. matteventu Yes and the htc logo on the battery is there because they just wanted to sign it? needa HTC doesn't have a battery manufacturing plant (assumption). It's part of being the ODM. Designing a PCB and ordering a battery to fit in a specified area are two completely different things. matteventu Dont waste your time with this bunch of G-fanboys... Marty Agreed. One thing, though, they seem to always forget is "Made by Google" when the Pixel isn't made by Google. Apple doesn't even say that about the iPhone, though every aspect of the iPhone is Apple all the way. But Google gets a pass on that lie because, as you said, they're G-fanboys. They always present excuses like..."well, it was designed by Google, that means it's made by Google." The Pixel isn't even designed by Google much less made by Google. But I guess since Google decided to lie, the chose to go all out on the lie... "This lie made by Google" Heh...Google did design and make something...lol...a lie. saf1927 If they do indeed design the SoC in-house, obviously they won't actually manufacture them since they don't own any semiconductor company, just like Apple. They will hand in the specifications to a foundry such as TSMC. Marty You'd think they'd do it that way, but Google did lie about the origin of the Pixels. If Google were to emphatically state that a future SoC is designed and engineered by them, who knows if it would be true? whispy_snippet Fucking awesome. Kimmy Gibbler I don't expect them to succeed Total Insecurity The future of Android is bright anyway :) Jordan L So this means Pixel 3 is going to be an awesome phone! I'm with a lot of people here in hoping for a cheaper Pixel. Like $399. Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel Base. I guess this mimicks Apples plan with iPhone 8, and 7s. someone755 Pixel SE. With a 4" display I wouldn't even be mad. Patel Nisha I really hope this turns out to be a big deal, not just some optimisation stuff for 3rd party components. Apple have a HUGE lead now in terms of silicon. Even Samsung’s own chips can’t compete with Apple’s. It can only really be Google who have a chance to catch up at this stage. xyz Good. Now Google fanboys will have one less excuse when Google still doesn't update phones for more than 2 years. Random! I wonder if a new chip design would help to solve the sound latency issue that makes it so frustrating to use apps such as drum emulators on Android. Or if this is really just a matter of optimizing software. Anyway, shouldn't all SoC manufacturers be designing their SoCs with a dedicated microphone co-processor in order to enable always-on hotword/voice recognition which doesn't kill the battery? Maybe that co-processor could also be the one monitoring the sensors...

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 144.29 -0.87 -0.60% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 964.17 -12.30 -1.26% Facebook Inc FB ▼ 149.80 -0.45 -0.30% T. Rowe Price Group Inc TROW ▲ 73.25 +0.01 +0.01% AdChoices Fund managers such as T Rowe Price and Federated Investors, who were already overweight the sector, said they were buying beaten-down so-called 'FANG' stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - during a two-day selloff that marked the largest tech sector decline in nearly a year. Google, Apple and other large tech stocks rose modestly in morning trading Tuesday. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund, said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy. With other secular growth stories hard to find, "It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'" he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines. Analysts expect the S&P 500 technology index to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including Qualcomm Inc and International Business Machines Corp, which have lagged in 2017. "This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity," said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc, Applied Materials Inc, Arista Networks Inc and STMicroelectronics NV. In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing. © REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo FILE PHOTO: A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in Vienna COMEBACK OF THE 'TRUMP TRADE?' The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs. That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring. In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund. Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple. Momentum-based technology stocks have "built a valuation air pocket underneath [them] creating cause for pause," Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday. Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year. Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged. "It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done," he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 144.29 -0.87 -0.60% CME Group Inc CME ▼ 126.78 -0.54 -0.42% AdChoices The Dow gained 92 points to close at a record-high 21,328. The S&P 500 gained 0.45 percent, with information technology leading advancers. Shares of Apple, Google-Parent Alphabet and Tesla all rose, pushing the Nasdaq composite 0.73 percent higher.  Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said the Nasdaq 100 futures had taken a respite Tuesday before the bell "from the pullback that has characterized the technology sector in the last two days." "There is room to short-term oversold territory, so we would assume the pullback still has a hold, although it is likely to mature in the next few days," Stockton said. Technology stocks have easily outperformed this year, with the S&P information technology sector advancing 17.6 percent. By comparison, health care — the second-best performer in the S&P — had risen 12.1 for 2017 entering Tuesday's session. The Nasdaq completed a 2.31 percent two-day pullback Monday as valuation concerns around the sector escalated. A survey of fund managers released Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed the Nasdaq at the top of the most-crowded trade list. The survey also showed that 84 percent of fund managers believe the U.S. is the most overvalued equity market. Load Error Still, it's "important to note that the last two days have shown little to no real signs of weakness with pullback attempts in S&P, DJIA holding and rallying back to unchanged," said Mark Newton, managing partner at Newton Advisors, in a note. "The Tech selloff looks nearly complete in the short run with XLK ... down to weekly support near trendlines from last November," he said. Investors also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve as the central bank kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Investors largely expect the central bank to raise interest rates by a quarter point. Market expectations for a June rate hike were 99.6 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Investors will also look for clues about how the Fed plans to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. In economic news, the National Federation of Independent Business' (NFIB) small business optimism index came in unchanged at 104.5 for May. "The bottom line continues to be that small businesses remain hopeful for positive policy changes out of the [Trump] Administration," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "Companies are still hiring but not really increasing investments in their business. On the former, a growing issue is the dearth of supply for qualified workers which we keep talking about," Boockvar said. Meanwhile, U.S. producer prices remained unchanged last month as energy costs recorded their biggest decline in more than a year, suggesting inflation pressures were easing after rising at the start of the year.

Macs already on the developer beta can update through the Mac App Store. Registered developers can also access the update through the Apple Developer Connection. Apple hasn’t announced any new features in the developer seeds of macOS Sierra 10.12.6, and it is most likely a maintenance release. Any remaining macOS Sierra releases are most likely to be maintenance and/or security-focused as the company ramps up to macOS High Sierra this fall.

He says Apple is working on the software for self-driving cars, and that artificial intelligence is a big part of the project. In an interview with Bloomberg Cook said, We’re focusing on autonomous systems. It’s a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. Reports of the Apple Car project, dubbed Titan, have been circulating for the past couple years. Until now, however, there’s hasn’t been any sort of official confirmation from Cupertino. Apple’s self-driving car project is all about the software, at least for now Apple seems more interested in the software to make cars self-driving as opposed to making its own autonomous vehicle. That seems to be a change from the company’s earlier effort where reports said Apple wanted to make its own self-driving electric car. Focusing on the software side of self-driving cars may be Bob Mansfield’s doing. Cook assigned him to Project Titan last summer and by fall people were being laid off amidst reports that Mansfield was shifting the focus away from an actual car. With the actual car off the table the question now is about the software: How does Apple plan to use the platform it’s making? Mr. Cook isn’t saying, but it’s likely some sort of partnership is coming. Without a car manufacturer on board, Apple’s self-driving software won’t be of much use. That said, there’s still a chance Apple could end up making its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us. We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do,” he said. Translation: Tim Cook confirmed Apple is developing software for self-driving cars, but he won’t confirm how it’s going to be used.

Top 6 Free Mac Security Tools 2 Comments Add a comment CudaBoy June 13, 2017 Looks like I nailed this one, too. A “system” is what I proposed Apple would do waaaay back when the clones here thought Apple was going to make a car. So here’s the deal. No major car company here in the US will use Apple’s “system” for retail sales but possibly for fleets of Ubers or something like that. Maybe in China some company would give up control of the “brains” of the car but NOT any US mfg. Anybody doubt this theory? After Apple successfully sells the system to some fleets or foreign mfgs if at that point they “care” about owning the whole widget they would possibly look into mfg their own cars here or somewhere else for import. IMO, Apple’s huge treasure trove of cash which is doing the planet NO GOOD for years now, could be spent on something more beneficial than a car.

Both models were introduced last week at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California. 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro now available in Apple’s stores The new iPad Pro models sport Apple’s A10X processor, embedded M10 processor, ProMotion Retina displays with True Tone wide and wide color gamut, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, Touch ID support, four speakers, front and rear-facing cameras, Smart Connector and Lightning connector. Both models are available in Space Gray, Gold, and Silver in 64 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB capacities. The 10.5-inch version is also available in Rose Gold. The Mac Observer’s checks showed the 10.5-inch model in stock in every store we checked. The 12.9-inch model, however, was hit and miss with some locations showing it wouldn’t be in store for at least another week. Pricing for the 10.5-inch model starts at US$649 for the 64 GB model, and $799 for the 12.9-inch 64 GB model. Both support Apple’s $99 Apple Pencil.

Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review: For those who dream of owning an iPad mini that runs Android Jeff Beck Follow View All Posts 2017/06/12 12:00pm PDTJun 12, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Mi Pad 3 News Reviews Tablet Reviews Xiaomi / MIUI Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design 5 Display 6 Cameras 7 Performance and battery 8 Software 9 Conclusion Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"? Well, I have some (kinda) good news for you. Today I'm reviewing the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3, a 7.9in Chinese tablet that has no shame in borrowing a healthy dose of design cues from a certain fruit logo-bearing competitor. For better or worse, the Mi Pad 3 looks an awful lot like an iPad Mini in Android clothing. Is it as good, or better than the tablet it is imitating? Let's find out. Specs SoC Mediatek MT8176 RAM 4GB Storage 64GB Display 7.9-inch 1536 x 2048 IPS LCD Battery 6,600 mAh Camera 13MP, 5MP Software Android 7.0, MIUI8 Measurements 200.4 x 132.6 x 7 mm, 328g The Good Design and build If you like the design and build quality of the iPad mini, you will like the way this looks and feels. Performance Yes, it's a Mediatek processor, but during my month of testing it's been quite a solid performer. Display The display is rumored to be the same one used in the iPad mini; it's crisp, vibrant, and responsive. Battery Longevity is good, with 8-10 hours of screen on time. The Not So Good Speakers They sound ok, but their placement is lousy. Capacitive buttons Come on, even Samsung gave those up. Software Running Android 7.0, but key features are missing. No fingerprint reader This is something that's become a standard feature in the last year, it sucks to go back to PIN unlocking. Camera Come on, no one expects a tablet camera to be any good, and Xiaomi doesn't disappoint - this one is lousy. Design It's impossible to look at the Mi Pad 3 and not be reminded of an iPad mini. The looks are strikingly similar, intentionally so. The size, weight, thickness, bezels, and camera placement are all almost identical. The back is a flat slab of aluminum with rounded sides, similar to - you guessed it - the iPad mini. Really, the only things that set it apart from the iPad are the placement of the speakers and buttons, and the lack of a home button on the front. Yeah, it's pretty much a blatant copy, but at least the source material is well designed. Hate on Apple all you want, the iPad mini is a nice looking device that's easy to hold, and so is the Mi Pad 3 by extension. Let's take a little tour of the tablet. At the top left corner of the device is a headphone jack, and centered at the bottom of the tablet is a USB-C port. The left side is bare and the right side features a power bottom and volume rocker about an inch below the top. The buttons are the only parts that feel a bit cheap on this tablet. While they are made of aluminum and have nice feedback, they are a bit too loose in their sockets, which makes them wiggle when touched and rattle when shaken. A small thing, but hard to ignore once you notice it. The front of the device is dominated by the display, surrounded by black bezels of moderate size top and bottom. The navigation buttons are back-lit capacitive keys at the bottom of the display arranged in the Samsung fashion, which feels backwards to many users, including myself. That's two things I really don't care for in one aspect of the tablet. Now, the buttons can be remapped in the settings to change the back button to the left and menu to the right. However, the icons can't be changed as they are back-lit cutouts, so instead of fixing the layout, it makes it even worse as the icons no longer match their actions. On the plus side, the duration that the buttons stay lit can be adjusted, or the back-light can be disabled completely system wide, or while using specific apps. You might have noticed that the home button is not a fingerprint scanner as it is on the iPad mini. There isn't one anywhere else on the device either, nor is there NFC, or a microSD card slot. Now, 64GB of internal space helps offset the need for expandable storage, and you're not likely to use a tablet to pay for your groceries with Android Pay, but the missing fingerprint scanner is frustrating. That's become a pretty standard feature on devices in 2017, and I miss it here. Going back to using a pin number to unlock my device feels archaic. Funny how quickly times change. Flipping the device over, there's not a lot going on. A 13MP camera occupies the upper left corner, and twin speakers sit at the bottom of the rear panel spaced an inch and a half apart. The speakers are stereo, which is laughable as an inch and a half of separation is barely sufficient for your ears to distinguish the difference between the channels. They are also completely useless as stereo speakers when holding the tablet in landscape mode, the way I assume 99 percent of people orient their tablet when watching a movie. They still play audio in stereo when the tablet is oriented in landscape, meaning you have a top and bottom channel instead of a right and left channel. That's just bizarre. In terms of volume, the speakers are about as loud as you'd expect with a tablet this size. In a quiet room they are perfectly fine for watching a show or playing a game. They don't have any low end, but they are clear and distortion free. Audio from the headphone jack is great, with enough power to drive a set of 50mm headphones well above a comfortable listening level. Taken as a whole, the tablet is very well constructed and feels light yet solid in hand. There are no gaps, the glass panel on the front is completely uniform, and weight is evenly distributed across the device. If you want to get a good approximation for how it feels to hold one, get your hands on an iPad mini. A tech novice might not even be able to tell them apart with a blindfold on. Display The highlight of the Mi Pad 3 is definitely the IPS LCD display. Its resolution of 2048×1536 is identical to that of the screen found in the iPad mini. It's rumored that the display is, in fact, sourced from the same supplier as the one that adorns Apple's smallest tablet. That wouldn't surprise me at all, as it is quite brilliant. Colors are deep and rich, black levels are respectable, and the white balance is well calibrated. It has all the nits you need for outdoor viewing, and even more importantly, in my opinion, it can drop to delightfully low brightness levels for late night use. The LCD panel can dim even further than the AMOLED screen on my Nexus 6P, something I find impressive. A number of tweaks can be made to the screen through the settings panel. The tint can be adjusted and a black and white mode can also be enabled to supposedly increase battery life. I don't believe color has the same impact on power consumption on an LCD panel as it does on an AMOLED display, but the setting is there nonetheless and will make Gothic and noir fans happy. There's also a reading mode that amps up the red levels for nighttime viewing, a feature I always love to see implemented on the system level. Cameras Frankly, I sometimes wonder why we even bother with this section in tablet reviews. There seems to be an unwritten law that tablet cameras must be lousy, and man, Xiaomi is a law-abiding company in that regard. I've take a few shots for you to look at, because, hey, I already spent some time typing a header for this section, so why not. Previous Next At first blush the pictures look acceptable, but once you take a closer look it's apparent that the images are bland, soft, and lacking vibrancy. All these were taken with the 13MP rear camera, the photos from the front facing camera were even worse. The selfies I took made me look absolutely awful, so I vainly excluded them from the review. The image quality is mediocre, even for a tablet, but the camera app is downright awful. The only setting to be found is a toggle to switch between the front and rear camera and photo and video mode. That's it, folks. There's nothing else there, well, besides a handful of filters thrown in as an afterthought. The camera app doesn't even allow you to preview the images you capture, you've got to switch to the album app to view your mediocre photos. Poor effort, but let's be honest, most people are (hopefully) never going to use the cameras anyways. Performance and battery These are two areas where the Mi Pad 3 performs surprisingly well.  Here are a couple of benchmarks for the tablet for those of you who insist on such things. On the left is Antutu and on the right GeekBench 4. Now, those numbers may not look very impressive to those who can discern their meaning, but I personally think benchmark numbers are limited in their usefulness. With that in mind, let me tell you how the tablet performs on daily tasks. Apps and games open quickly, and switching between applications doesn't tax the Mi Pad at all. 4GB of RAM is plenty to keep it chugging along. The half dozen games I downloaded on the Mi Pad 3 all played just fine, with only an occasional skipped frame on the most taxing titles. In short, it's actually very pleasant to use. Even when playing a more intense game, like Asphalt 8, the tablet gets just warm enough to be perceptible, and even then it's only the top third of the device where warmth can be felt at all. Not bad, Mediatek. Longevity is quite solid as well. With an ample 6,600mAh battery, I saw between 8-10 hours of screen on time per charge, with a bit less than that when playing a lot of games. That's shorter than the advertised 12 hours of battery life, but it's ample time to keep you entertained during a long flight, or last for a full day of playing Candy Crush while pretending to take notes during business meetings. The only concern I had with battery life is that standby battery drain is higher than I would like to see, with the battery falling 5-8 percent overnight. That's not as good as it could be, but hopefully it's something that can be tightened up in future updates (if there are future updates). Software Speaking of updates, the Mi Pad 3 comes in need of an update right out of the box. It's running Android 7.0, not 7.1, which is a little annoying since 7.1 has been available for several months now. What goes a step beyond annoying to straight up aggravating is that some of the most important features of Nougat are missing in MIUI 8.2. There's no split screen support on the Mi Pad 3, which severely hampers its usefulness as a productivity device. You also can't pin apps, or set up multiple user profiles, and expanded notifications are nowhere to be found. Xiaomi has also done the best it could to mimic Apple by 'iOS'ing the look of app icons, adding a quick ball shortcut tool, and by removing the app drawer. Seriously, manufacturers: leave the app drawer alone! Unlike the build on MIUI found on the Mi Note 2, there doesn't seem to be any way to enable an app drawer, either. I won't harp on this too much, though, as installing a custom launcher is an easy fix to the homescreen set up if it bothers you. Besides the coat of iPaint, the software is fairly bland and unobtrusive. The quantity of pre-installed apps is worthy of praise. There is not a single app on the tablet that I would classify as bloat. There are a couple custom tool apps, like the calculator and notes app, but besides that there's not much else taking up space on the device. This leaves a large portion of the 64GB of on-board storage available for personal use, which is good since there is no expandable memory on the tablet. (The available storage in the image is not indicative of the total storage capacity as additional apps and games were installed on the tablet when I took the screenshot.) There are a few of software touches added by Xioami that I do enjoy. You can wake the tablet with a double tap of the screen, a blue light filter setting is included in  the quick settings shade, and the system animations all look fluid and elegant. The settings menus are also laid out in a manner that I found intuitive and user friendly. Besides that, there's not a lot else to be said. It's a bland version of Nougat that looks like iOS and is missing a couple of useful features. Conclusion It's common knowledge that global tablet sales are down. It seems we, as consumers, have figured out that very few people actually need a tablet. Our phones screens are getting larger, and our laptops are getting thinner and more tablet-like with touchscreens, fold over displays, and lift away bodies. There's just less need for a third device to fit between these two, and most people who need one already have one, and don't have many compelling reasons to upgrade. Most tablets aren't great for productivity, and the Mi Pad 3 is worse than average in that regard. Its predecessor, the Mi Pad 2, rocked Android, but was also available with Windows, making it at least a little business friendly. This new model can't even run split screen apps. Where it does shine is as a media consumption device. With its beautiful screen, competent battery life, and adequate performance, this is a great tablet for killing time during a commute or flight. There is a problem with the Mi Pad 3, though, at least for US based readers: it's way too expensive for what you get. GeekBuying, who supplied our review unit sells them for $250 (thanks guys). For just $50 more you can buy a 128GB iPad Mini 4, or a full-size 32GB iPad. Granted, those are limited time sale prices, but still, you'd have to be kinda nuts to go with the Mi Pad over an iPad. Even as an Android fanatic myself, I readily admit that Apple just does tablet software better. I'm sure I'll take heat for that in the comments, but I doubt any other writer at AP would disagree. If you want a cheap media consumption device, you can pick up an 8 inch Amazon fire tablet for $80-125. The screen won't be as pretty, and the build quality won't be as nice, but for less than half the price you still get a serviceable tablet. At $150-175, the Mi Pad 3 would be easy to recommend to Android purists who want a tablet with nice build quality and a great screen. At $250, with mediocre software and a lengthy list of small irritations, I just don't really know who is going to want to buy this. Perhaps you disagree, so feel free to tell me why in the comments. Also, if there are any questions you still have that weren't answered by the review, drop them below and I'll do my best to answer them.

PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol MJ "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?" No... I dislike Apple as a company and as a platform so much I don't really what a device that looks like iJunk. Jeff Beck I really need to start putting an asterisk next to every sentence that is intended to be read with sarcasm. MJ Do you really think that would stop me? LOL I have read many comments by Android users that seem to admire Apple's hardware design. TannoV Well I mean, Apple's design is pretty good. Those Jet Black and Product(RED) iPhone 7 designs were stunningly gorgeous, and the pre-trashcan Mac Pro had a beautiful case. Timothy Vreeland Since they started using all metal designs on their phones, Apple devices have looked great (aside from the absurd bezels). Pre HTC styling though, their designs were some of the ugliest available in the smart phone market. Lord Argyris The recent MBPs (2016 and onward) are gorgeous. I'm typing on one right now. Looks were far from the only reason I bought it, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't factor somewhat into it. It's almost like there's some law against making a Windows laptop that isn't tapered, or where the screen and bottom actually meet flush, or which doesn't have bits chiseled off the sides. The MBP is one of only a tiny handful of laptops that actually look good in profile (the Chromebook Pixel was another example, even with the weird hinge sticking out in the back). Jeff Beck I read that first sentence in my best villain voice in my head. jesuguru An asterisk is definitely the best and most universally recognized way to denote sarcasm. /s Jeff Beck You have a point there... George but then your articles would just be one big asterisk~ C64 Mediatek.. no no no no Daniel I'm surprised nobody else is complaining about this. If it ain't Snapdragon (RIP Intel), I'm not gonna buy it. Random! Read Daniel Marcus' comment on it. genericanimefan "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?" Can't say I ever have JG Ditto. But, now, I'm kinda curious how an Apple made Android device would turn out. Technically, nothing would stop them, other than Apple considering Android to be an inferior OS... They'd probably do like Amazon, a heavily tweaked fork (resembling iOS) with no Google services. Of course, without the Play Store... Unless Apple could find a way to get iOS apps to run native on Android. Daniel They would never risk that. They know how smart us Androiders are (the tinkerers anyway), and they also know we would get iOS apps on other devices with some work. Dmitry Stepanushkin Tinkerers are minority. You need a lot of knowledge and time to do it. Also Apple can easily lock bootloader and never give You keys or specs and tools to do something they don't want You to. For example, see how DRM implemented. Without Google Play Services they even don't need to pass Google checks. So they may do anything possible to protect it from "tinkerers". Daniel We might be a minority, but we usually give away the mods (XDA devs). And if Apple did make a device, lots of people would use it; increasing the amount of tinkerers. Dmitry Stepanushkin If they make such device, and it will be cheaper than iPad, it will sell good. Many people will buy it for "first Apple tablet running Android". I expect high quality hardware. If it will even run iOS apps, then many iPad users may switch to it. JSo "An iPad mini that runs Android." Yeah, a crappy version of Android. John Maverick Android on tablets is a complete disgrace TannoV Depends. It's not great, but with some tweaks it works fine. John Maverick I have a Galaxy Tab A 10.1. The Tablet itself it's great and Samsung did a good job with Touchwiz, even if it is still running on Marshmallow. The apps however, on a bigger screen (that it's not a tv) are a complete shame, terrible and embarassing. Daniel Not always. But with Android apps on Chromebooks, it's better to use Chrome OS for your tablet needs anyway. Chava Salinas R I totally agree with the conclusion, I have an iPad Air and barely use, an iPad mini for work and it stays in my backpack most of the time. At some point I considered getting a Pixel C, but after giving it some thought, I felt that there was no need to upgrade, my Android phone serves most of my needs and my 2-in-1 Windows laptop fills the gap when in need for a bigger screen. dextersgenius @Jeff: What's the GPS on this like? Also, how's the audio quality via 3.5mm? Imparus "Even as an Android fanatic myself, I readily admit that Apple just does tablet software better." Unfortunately the apps I use on my tablet aren't available on iOS nor are any app that can give the same experience, so I can't just buy an iPad even if the OS might be better designed for tablet (doesn't matter much when it is the apps that is most important). Hopefully Google or Nvidia brings out a new tablet this year or the next, so I at least have some good options when it becomes time to upgrade. NooSH "Capacitive buttons: Come on, even Samsung gave those up." .. uh, maybe on phones they did, but samsung tablets all still have Capacitive touch buttons, even the latest Tab S3.. i will agree that i wish tablets would shy away from capacitive buttons, just pointing that out. Timothy Vreeland Yes. Also most current tablets don't have a finger print reader ,so it isn't as absurd as the written makes it seem. Patriciaahenry Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Sam Koda I think it is time you guys stop complaining about the lack of app drawer in MIUI. MIUI never had any app drawer and probably never will. Get used to it. When you review a device with MIUI, it is understood that it doesn't come with app drawer. The best you can do instead of repeating yourself is to put a link to the review of MIUI. Timothy Vreeland Agreed. Jeff Beck My first experience with MIUI. I'll complain about it every time as it might be the only article a person reads about a MIUI device. Sam Koda You are right, it might be the only article a person reads. Does that means your regular readers should also read it all the time?. My opinion is still relevant. You can put a link to the review of MIUI 8. And let it be. And if a Xiaomi device comes with some special feature, which is not available on the regular MIUI you just post it. Nathan J There really aren't any great new Android tablets. But, for those who like Android but not necessarily for Android apps, but more the tinkering aspect, I would urge you to go Raspberry Pi. There's a 7" touch screen you can get for it, and a case that holds the screen, the Pi, and a battery (power pack). So while not as portable as a tablet (it's like a tablet with a big hump on the back), it's totally tinker friendly, hardware and software. If you think, "I like tinkering on Android, but I'll void the warranty and there are obstacles," get a Pi and mess around with it. And everything runs off a microSD card, so get several and rotate projects. I'm a big fan of one called RetroPie. ;) Тарас Мукин I don't really get the point of small tablets anymore. Phones are big enough, difference is not significant. I'd rather buy iPad Pro with android, than Mini one. (And yes, I am aware of Pixel C and Samsung devices -- they are too powerful and expensive for what I'd want them to use) Andy Roid No micro SD slot? Into the trash it goes I use tablets for media consumption, especially when travelling. 64GB non-expandable storage just won't cut it Rann Xeroxx Xiaomi makes a 7.9" ipad mini clone tablet that runs Windows 10. This is the one I would buy if I were buying one. Thomas Gladdines This is one sad iteration, the Mi Pad 2 was better in almost all aspects and even ran windows 10 as an additional option... Tiwi see the sw support to mipad 1 and 2..this tab will be update for 6 months and then stop.. so, Save money o change brand :D Dmitry Stepanushkin Save money, buy iPad😂 Kevin Davis Mediatek. Well, that ended that discussion. Daniel Marcus Can we get over the stigma around MediaTek already? Their Kernel repository is regularly updated (last push was for Android Wear, about two weeks ago), their chips run cool, their radios have good reception, their reference firmware is highly stable and has great debugging tools for developers, and their flashing software is easy enough to use and their devices are difficult to brick. Their chips aren't the fastest, but they aren't particularly slow. They aren't so far behind in any technical way so as to impact the use of the devices. Frankly, the only thing Qualcomm really has over MediaTek at this point is raw speed, and that comes at the cost of heat and power use. Every time I see Google making changes to Android in the name of battery life, I have to wonder why. MediaTek has had standby power usage on par or better than the current versions of Android with Qualcomm processors for years now. (This tablet has significantly worse standby than the older MediaTek tablet I had that ran near-stock Android 5.1.) We complain that Qualcomm's phones get hot and have to be throttled. We complain that Samsung and often other phones with Qualcomm radios have poor reception. Bluetooth issues have been common, even on Google's own Pixel devices. Qualcomm has dropped support for the Snapdragon 801, and with it many once-flagship devices that won't get Android 7. (MediaTek is still actively adding Android 7 support to older devices, including processors released around the same time as the 801.) I'm not saying MediaTek is perfect, but I think it's time to recognize that Qualcomm isn't some perfect chipset poster child. Just because a device is using a MediaTek chip instead of a Qualcomm doesn't have any real impact on the performance or longevity of the device in daily use. Kevin Davis Nope. Hey, why don't you write a book next time instead of an endless run on comment. Here's a thought, you use them if you like them. Wow, lots of lengthy butthurt. 😂 WesleySmalls I don't find your comment all that long. It's pretty funny really, because you have been completely owned in this discussion, without any effort. Your "lol ur butthurt" comment gave that away. Kevin Davis Lol. Hard to believe. There are actually a few mediatek trolls. Have a super day, little buddy. 😂 WesleySmalls "Anyone who doesn't share my views or completely owns me in a discussion is a troll" Kevin Davis Whatever makes you feel better, little mediatek bitch. LMFAO WesleySmalls I haven't even said anything about MediaTek, so that was a pretty sad reply. I don't even have to do anything, you'll just own yourself. Kevin Davis Lol. F'ck off, moron boy. WesleySmalls Aww you don't like it little fella? Maybe mommy can get you some apple juice Kevin Davis Does mediatek pay you per comment, little shitbag troll? WesleySmalls Did MediaTek steal your apple juice, little fella? Kevin Davis F'ck off, mediatek bitchboy WesleySmalls It was a serious question; what did MediaTek do to you that makes you so paranoid? Kevin Davis You're not serious about anything other than being a little troll. They make garbage. I don't use them. If you like them, use them. Is that hard to follow? Oh , and F'ck off, boy. WesleySmalls Wow, so because they make products that you do not like that makes anyone who opposes you a "troll" or "MediaTek shill"? That's pretty sad, especially considering you are applying this to the conversation that never discussed, nor even named this. Now go and drink your apple juice, ISIS supporter(notice how I accuse you of something that has not even been named in the conversation) Kevin Davis Goodbye, mediatek bitch. Boring. WesleySmalls I really don't get why you keep calling me that when I haven't said anything about that. Kevin Davis Blah, blah, blah.......Boring and blocked. I hope they pay per post. Goodbye, mediatek bitch. WesleySmalls Hahaha that's so sad! wow Damn. You really embarrassed yourself. Could've just responded to the comment with facts to counter what the poster was saying, but instead made it obvious that you had nothing to say and no way of maturely handling a disagreement by running around calling random people "boy" or "troll". Kevin Davis Hello shitbag, and goodbye. Go fuck yourSELVES. 🖕🏻 wow Lmaooo thanks for proving my point. You really gave me a laugh 😂😂 Random! Mediatek doesn't have any support in custom ROMs. As soon as Mediatek starts helping developers and release enough info to enable custom ROM developers to support their chipsets, I'll adopt Mediatek as a viable option. Until then, no thanks. I'll never rely solely on manufacturer updates, specially if this manufacturer chose a budget chipset. Daniel Marcus The second sentence in my post I noted that MediaTek is now regularly updating their source repository. There are several MTK devices that have unlocked bootloaders and fairly decent ROM support (say, the Blu R1 and several Umi devices). The reason for a lack of custom software development is low market penetration, not anything inherent in their chips today. As you have demonstrated, though, people tend to keep old views and all the marketing done around Snapdragon and the importance of benchmarks has led companies to use those chips in major product launches. Similarly, the lack of software updates to MediaTek based devices is mostly because they're cheaper devices that just don't pay to update, not because MediaTek hasn't provided updated firmware for the chipset. My current daily driver is a Blu R1 Plus. It runs pretty much stock Android 6.0 which is, frankly, almost indistinguishable from 7.1. It's snappy, has great reception and battery life, and between VoLTE support and some excellent noise cancellation, the calls are exceptionally clear. Unlike my Nexus 5x, the Bluetooth is very reliable. It's not the fastest device, nor does it have the best camera, and it's a couple of (minor) versions of Android behind. As a phone though, it's exactly what I need. Also, it was $160, so I can't really complain. Random! Let's hope the custom ROM situation keeps improving. I have no prejudice against non-mainstream chipsets, I'm just worried about updates and software choices (nobody likes shitty stock out-of-date spyware-ridden firmware). As soon as there's a Mediatek-based phone with almost-flagship performance and decent custom ROM support (at least official Lineage) I'll jump on it. I'm a huge enthusiast of phones with a good cost/benefit. Btw, I've just remembered my dad's phone is Mediatek-based. It's a Lenovo K3 Note (MT6752), has decent performance at a decent price, but finding a custom ROM for it and making it work was a royal pain in the ass. Running some​ unofficial version of Lineage It's still far from perfect, but much much better than the spyware-ridden OS that came with it (it wasn't even stock, just some atrocious ROM installed by eBay vendor to offer support for languages beyond the Chinese and English options available with the stock os) Edward Green Hmm. I have a Chromebook Plus for when I need a larger screen. I also have the smaller Asus Flip for when that is too big (although DPI is too low for use as a reader even if it is a great panel). Even without (coming) resizable window support you can have apps side by side, floating, and desktop Web Apps too. But I still have a use for a 7/8 inch tablet, and Android is okay at that size. When giving a talk you can run PPT remote and have notes, slide and controls in a one handed but readable device. (And Bluetooth to Android Apps on ChromeOS is pretty broken last time I checked) This ticks a lot of Nexus 7 replacement boxes - except the lack of split screen. What are the other options? Daniel Hey, the Plus has 7.0 (Nougat). Google introduced better resizing support in nougat and it will completely ready by 8.0 Davis Hernandez so, they ditched the first gen's Tegra k1 for a mediatek in the next two installments? WTF Zxyon Rhysivz Should have an SD card slot Martin Cohen I just got the Amazon 8" Fire. After installing the Google Play Store (look it up), it is fine for me. Only 1280 x 800, but for $110 with 32GB, especially since it can use a 128GB card, quite acceptable. xyz "Have you ever walked through a mall and passed by the Apple store and stared longingly at the iPad Mini and thought to yourself, "Man, I sure wish I could buy one of those that ran Android"?"

The eagerly anticipated Apple Park finally began welcoming the tech giant's employees in April 2017, eight years since the late Steve Jobs hired Norman Foster for the project. As the campus is still not fully complete, there has so far been little in the form of criticism of the ring-shaped structure, its surrounding park and ancillary buildings. But Wired has published a scathing review – mainly criticising the project's lack of consideration for responding to, or improving, the Bay Area city of Cupertino in which it is located. "Apple's new HQ is a retrograde, literally inward-looking building with contempt for the city where it lives and cities in general," reads the article, titled If You Care About Cities, Apple's New Campus Sucks. Its author, Wired deputy editor Adam Rogers, likens the futuristic-looking campus to the suburban tech headquarters of the 1950s. "By building a mega-headquarters straight out of the middle of the last century, Apple has exacerbated the already serious problems endemic to 21st-century suburbs like Cupertino – transportation, housing, and economics." "Apple Park is an anachronism wrapped in glass, tucked into a neighbourhood," he adds. Rogers lays into the design of UK architecture firm Foster + Partners' circular principal office building, saying that it offers little opportunity for change, expansion or legacy – should Apple choose to leave or relocate in the future. Architectural adaptability has been key to Silicon Valley's past success, he adds. "When you have a statement building like the Spaceship, the circuit can't complete," says Rogers. "If Apple ever goes out of business, what would happen to the building?" "That's why nobody builds these things anymore," he continues. "Successful buildings engage with their surroundings – and to be clear, Apple isn't in some suburban arcadia. It's in a real live city, across the street from houses and retail, near two freeway onramps." Related story How Steve Jobs hired Norman Foster: "Hi Norman. I need some help" Apple has not done enough to improve public transport infrastructure for employees living in San Francisco and San Jose, says Rogers, and instead chose to bolster roads that will encourage drivers and increase congestion. It provides buses for commuters, although only 1.5 per cent of employees currently use public transport to reach the campus, and the company has not gone as far as rival Google by adding accommodation close to the site. Only 10 per cent of Apple's workers live in Cupertino, according to the article. The company is paying relatively small sums for parking restitution to nearby towns, and has created a recycled-water distribution system that will benefit Cupertino's other development projects, but Rogers says that "these community benefits feel small". "The company could have chipped in to double the frequency of CalTrain's commuter rail," he says. "It could have built a transit centre in Cupertino, which, unlike Mountain View and Palo Alto, has none." "It's hard to get them to help fix local problems. They have even less of an incentive to solve planning problems than California homeowners do." The article points to the almost-complete Salesforce Tower in San Francisco as a comparative model for successful office development. Apple's ring provides 2.5 million square feet (230,000 square metres) of workspace on 175 acres (71 hectares), while the skyscraper offers 1.5 million square feet (140,000 square metres) on just an acre (0.4 hectares), is directly connected to major transit station, and cost one-fifth of the price to construct. "A more contemporary approach to commercial architecture builds up instead of out," says Rogers. "But putting form factor aside, the best, smartest designers and architects in the world could have tried something new. Instead it produced a building roughly the shape of a navel, and then gazed into it." "It may look like a circle, but it's actually a pyramid – a monument, more suited to a vanished past than a complicated future." All of the 12,000 Apple employees due to work at the campus are expected to have moved in by September 2017, when the company anticipates the majority of the architecture and landscaping to be fully finished.

Apple has invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing—China’s biggest ride-hailing service—and decided last year to shift the focus of its endeavors away from making an electric car and toward perfecting autonomous driving technology. Apple has been granted permits to test its self-driving systems on California roads, but what form their product will eventually take is still an open question. “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something that is incredibly exciting for us,” Cook said. “But we’ll see where it takes us — we’re not really saying from a product point of view what we’ll do. It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” Comments « Leaked images show glass backs for iPhone 7, 7s and 8; claim all will have wireless charging Daily Deal: PDF Expert 2.2 for Mac » Related Stories Apple releases third round of betas for iOS 10.3.3, tvOS 10.2.2, watchOS 3.2.3 Apple issues $1 billion green bond to fund clean energy Apple opens up HomeKit accessory prototyping Apple announces ‘HomePod’ Smart Speaker Apple unveils iOS 11, featuring major iPad UI improvements Apple shows off watchOS 4 Subscribe to iLounge Weekly ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

BUSINESS Apple is working on self-driving car technology, Tim Cook confirms Peter Parks / AFP/Getty Images Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is focusing on autonomous systems. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is focusing on autonomous systems. (Peter Parks / AFP/Getty Images) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter It’s official: Apple Inc. plans to develop technology that powers self-driving cars — and although it’s a relative latecomer to the increasingly competitive field, analysts say it’s not too late for the tech giant to make its mark there. In an interview with Bloomberg TV released Tuesday, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple is focusing on autonomous systems, which he described as the “mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects.” It’s a sign that Apple still intends to be a player in self-driving vehicle development. In recent years, Apple was rumored to have plans for a car manufacturing business. Then, after reports that the Cupertino, Calif., company had abandoned those plans, Bloomberg reported in October that Apple was shifting its focus to developing an autonomous driving system that would give it the flexibility of working with other automakers or later revisiting the idea of building its own vehicle. Cook wouldn’t limit Apple’s plans just to self-driving vehicles, saying there were other purposes for autonomous systems, but he did tamp down expectations about vehicle manufacturing. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do, but we are being straightforward that it’s a core technology that we view as very important,” he said. Cook’s interview seems to confirm what many analysts have speculated: that Apple will stick to what it knows as it seeks to make an impact in the competitive race to develop self-driving vehicles. Analysts say Apple’s focus on autonomous systems makes sense. After all, building a car is a specialized area of expertise, said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. Marrying Apple’s software savvy with an automaker’s vehicle manufacturing experience is “a lot smarter than trying to venture so far out of your area of expertise,” she said. Controlling an autonomous vehicle’s operating system could also open up opportunities for apps in and around the car, said Andrew Uerkwitz, managing director at Oppenheimer & Co. But he said it’s hard to see a connection between their broader software platforms and self-driving cars. “It’s much further away from the center than anything else they’ve done, but clearly they don’t think so,” he said. Uerkwitz said Apple could be hindered by its relatively late entrance into the race. For example, Waymo — a Google spinoff that’s still owned by Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc. — has logged 2 million miles of driving since 2009. Other tech companies, such as Uber and Lyft, have also already begun testing vehicles and forming partnerships with automakers. Waymo and ride-hailing company Lyft have signed a deal to collaborate on autonomous technology through pilot projects and product development. And Lyft and General Motors are using the new Bolt EV as test vehicles. Lindland said these tech companies, like Apple, could see more benefit from working on the software side, rather than developing their own vehicle manufacturing facilities. Last year, General Motors bought San Francisco software startup Cruise Automation, which had been developing autonomous-vehicle technology, while Ford announced a $1 billion investment in a driverless vehicle software company, Argo AI. But while partnerships are developing, Lindland said, Apple still has time to make connections. “This is the absolute infancy of automated driving,” she said. “Everyone’s fair game.” CAPTION Members of Congress described the terror of a shooting at a ballfield in Virginia. A gunman killed three people at a San Francisco UPS facility Wednesday.

All of the apps have access to a new library that includes more than 500 professionally drawn shapes, and there's a new feature that allows users to reply to comments and join threaded conversations. Apple is also introducing new auto-correction and text replacement options that are designed to save users time when typing, and these new features are available in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers across both iOS and Mac. Pages for iOS and Mac now support linked text boxes, and there's a feature allowing users to export documents as fixed layout ePub books. When collaborating with other users on a document, there are new options for changing margins, headers, footers, and paper size in both apps, and in Pages for iOS specifically, there's a new page thumbnail view for better navigation. In Pages for Mac, Stock and Currency functions will now return data from the previous market day's close. The same Stock and Currency update is coming to Keynote for Mac, and there's also a new option to edit notes while displaying slides in Light Table view. Also new to the Mac version of Keynote are new pan and zoom options. Light Table view is expanding to Keynote for iOS, and there's an option to edit presenter notes when viewing slides. Both versions of Numbers are being updated with support for print preview when working on collaborative spreadsheets, and the Insert Stock Quote feature and the Stock and Currency functions now use data from the previous market day's close. All of Apple's iWork apps are available from the iOS App Store and Mac App Store for free. The apps have been fully free for download since April of 2017. - Pages for Mac - [Mac App Store] - Keynote for Mac - [Mac App Store] - Numbers for Mac - [Mac App Store] - Pages for iOS - [App Store] - Keynote for iOS - [App Store] - Numbers for iOS - [App Store] Tags: iWork, Pages, Keynote, Numbers 98 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) tethead 3 days ago at 11:16 am OMG, they actually added back in linked text boxes!! Their removal of this feature with the "new" iWork suite several years ago caused me to stop using these for work - and now we're happy with another solution - but at least I can finally open and edit my older documents. I wonder if all my feedback submitted on that finally got read?? Rating: 14 Votes Brutonus 3 days ago at 11:27 am I never used Pages '09, what are linked text boxes actually? They allow you to link two separate text boxes, so when text does not fit in the first, it overflows in the next. It's all explained on this new help document on Apple: https://support.apple.com/nl-be/HT207731 Rating: 10 Votes DanielDD 2 days ago at 02:26 pm Is there actually an advantage to using this applications when Office seems so much more superior? I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything I'm sincerely curious as to what the benefit would be to using them vs office. Pages is miles ahead of Word in: - Responsiveness - Font rendering - Making tables - Graphic heavy documents - Generating equations (since last update) Add that to a simpler user interface, and Pages becomes a really good app. Rating: 9 Votes HobeSoundDarryl 3 days ago at 11:46 am Wait.... Apple's word processor didn't let you type directly on the page? o_O More accurately, Pages '09 was basically 2 programs in one: * a "skinny" Word Processor * a "skinny" DTP (Page Layout) Program The Word Processor side worked pretty similar to how Pages has worked in the last few years (and yes, you could just type into a page). The DTP side gave people who wanted to make something that looked like magazines, fancy newsletters, etc extraordinarily good control over where text could be placed... and flowed page to page. It seemed to have many of the best features of "fat" DTP software via a relatively easy-to-use Apple UI. When Apple decided to feature-sync Pages between Macs & iDevices, the DTP side features that separated it from being "just a word processor" were many of the popular features that were dropped. And this one- linked text boxes- was one of the biggies that was dropped. Glad to see it's finally come back again. I hope it works as well as it did 8 years ago. Many of the gripes about missing Pages '09 revolve around missing the DTP-side features of Pages '09. It was a really good "skinny" DTP program (and still is). Rating: 6 Votes jamescobalt 2 days ago at 03:31 pm Is there actually an advantage to using this applications when Office seems so much more superior? I've developed nearly a hundred presentations in a professional capacity (not as in, I made presentations for meetings at work like everyone does but as the actual end product at a marketing agency) in both Keynote and Powerpoint and find Keynote is much faster to work in than PowerPoint - the fact you can work with vectors is huge, and the application rarely gets bogged down when working with huge files. PowerPoint does have some awesome features I'd love to see come to Keynote, but it still takes significantly longer to get the same quality output. Numbers has nothing on Excel for flexibility and depth, and the same is true for Pages on Word outside of desktop publishing ...but Microsoft has Publisher which is more powerful for desktop publishing too. In that case - do you want a simple tool that does a little of both, or two separate tools that are more complicated but do much more? Are you working on a brochure/one-off item? Or is it a monthly 125 page magazine? (not that you'd use Microsoft Publisher for professional magazine work either!) And of course, are you more comfortable with Apple's UX approach or Microsoft's UX approach? You can click between a dozen panes till your fingers are sore, or handle more ribbons than a rhythmic gymnastic competition. Pick your poison. Rating: 4 Votes saqibhasan 2 days ago at 02:55 pm Is there actually an advantage to using this applications when Office seems so much more superior? I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything I'm sincerely curious as to what the benefit would be to using them vs office. I hate word. How does backspace suddenly change the font, the font size, color and paragraph justification for the text BEYOND the cursor?!?! Move a text box by 5 pixels and it shifts four pages down, inside out and upside down. Grrrrrrrr. Rating: 4 Votes CrystalQuest76 2 days ago at 01:51 pm Otherwise, yes, Office is superior, ubiquitous and integrated into many systems, workflows, work environments, universities and quite simply more widely liked and used. While MS Word and MS Excel are considered by all that use both iWorks and MS Office as superior, experts have a strong consensus that Keynote is better than PowerPoint. I would argue that for certain tasks, Pages and Numbers are the better products if you are proficient in their use (because they function distinctly differently than MS Office). They are stronger when having simple tasks to be accomplished. I also favor Pages for newsletters over MS Word. Naturally if it is complex layout that I would use InDesign if available. Any academic paper that requires any sort of citation is easier using MS Word because of its References tool and Source Manager. Rating: 3 Votes T'hain Esh Kelch 2 days ago at 12:59 pm Many of the gripes about missing Pages '09 revolve around missing the DTP-side features of Pages '09. It was a really good "skinny" DTP program (and still is). It is certainly miles better than Word, but it is also still miles worse than Pages '09 in that aspect. The skinny DTP part of Pages '09 is what made is so amazing. :( Rating: 3 Votes Glassed Silver 22 hours ago at 02:20 am 95% of people use Excel to display data and generally only use some very basic functions. For this crowd, Numbers is superior. The fact that you can have multiple, independent tables on the same sheet is really nice. But yes, Numbers needs better conditional formatting, and for many, pivot tables. This, it's rather close to perfect home office software. And one cannot underestimate the utility and design advantage of multiple, independent tables per sheet. It may sound crazy, but it's absolutely ridiculous nobody else seems to adopt this concept, because it gives you so much freedom through a very simply concept. Probably one of Number's best features. Also makes your documents look a lot lighter and they become easier on the eyes. Glassed Silver:mac Rating: 3 Votes GeneralChang 3 days ago at 12:02 pm More accurately, Pages '09 was basically 2 programs in one: * a "skinny" Word Processor * a "skinny" DTP (Page Layout) Program The Word Processor side worked pretty similar to how Pages has worked in the last few years (and yes, you could just type into a page). The DTP side gave people who wanted to make something that looked like magazines, fancy newsletters, etc extraordinarily good control over where text could be placed... and flowed page to page. It seemed to have many of the best features of "fat" DTP software via a relatively easy-to-use Apple UI. When Apple decided to feature-sync Pages between Macs & iDevices, the DTP side features that separated it from being "just a word processor" were many of the popular features that were dropped. And this one- linked text boxes- was one of the biggies that was dropped. Glad to see it's finally come back again. I hope it works as well as it did 8 years ago. Many of the gripes about missing Pages '09 revolve around missing the DTP-side features of Pages '09. It was a really good "skinny" DTP program (and still is). With the addition of linked text boxes, it's actually back to being fully useable for me, which is pretty cool.

Photo: Reuters ALSO READ Apple CEO Tim Cook takes 15% pay cut after iPhone sales drop Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in California Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech programme GRAPHIC: All you need to know about Artificial Intelligence After years toiling away in secret on its car project, Apple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook has for the first time laid out exactly what the company is up to in the automotive market: It’s concentrating on self-driving technology. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on June 5. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.”   “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” Cook said in his most detailed comments to date on Apple’s plans in the car space. “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.”   The prospect of self-driving cars has seen a slew of technology companies push into the auto industry, which is estimated to be worth $6.7 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey & Co. Alphabet’s Waymo unit has signed partnerships with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Lyft to develop the technology. And carmakers from BMW to General Motors have opened sizable Silicon Valley offices and dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire autonomous vehicle startups.   Apple had initially been seeking to build its own car, before recalibrating those ambitions last year to prioritise the underlying technology for autonomous driving, Bloomberg News reported. The iPhone maker had hired more than 1,000 engineers to work on Project Titan, as the car team is known internally, after it started in 2014.   Ballooning costs and headcount led to Apple veteran Bob Mansfield being given the reins of the team in 2016. Cook has never before openly outlined Apple’s plans, though public filings have surfaced in recent months that provided snapshots of Apple’s efforts.   The iPhone maker secured a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in April to test three self-driving sports-utility vehicles, photos of which emerged several weeks later. A half-dozen vehicles had been surreptitiously testing the autonomous technology on public roads in and around the San Francisco Bay area for at least a year, according to someone familiar with Project Titan. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment on how long the company has been conducting road tests.   In December, Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, penned a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealing the company’s interest in automotive technology. It became public when it was published on a federal website. In the letter, Kenner wrote about the company’s excitement surrounding the potential for automated systems in fields like transportation.   “There is a major disruption looming there,” Cook said on Bloomberg Television, citing self-driving technology, electric vehicles and ride-hailing. “You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame.” Cook was also bullish about the prospects for electric vehicles, a market which last week helped Tesla become the world’s fourth-biggest carmaker by market capitalisation, even as it ranks well outside the top 10 by unit sales. “It’s a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station,” Cook said.   Apple invested $1 billion last year in Didi Chuxing, the biggest Chinese ride-hailing service. The announcement came soon after Mansfield took over Project Titan and set about cutting hundreds of engineers. Whereas Apple had initially been building its own car, Mansfield scrapped those plans in favor of building an autonomous driving system. The company will make a decision on whether to proceed with the push later this year, the people said at the time.   In the interview on Bloomberg Television, Cook was hesitant to disclose whether Apple will ultimately manufacture its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Read More On Apple Inc | Tim Cook | Project Titan | Automobiles | Self-driving Technology | Artificial Intelligence | Companies | News PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Calculate Your Premium in Seconds and Buy Health Insurance Today Super Saver Health Insurance For Your Family Apple focusing on autonomous car: Tim Cook Cook unveils Apple's interest in automotive market: It's concentrating on self-driving technology Cook unveils Apple's interest in automotive market: It's concentrating on self-driving technology After years toiling away in secret on its car project, Apple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook has for the first time laid out exactly what the company is up to in the automotive market: It’s concentrating on self-driving technology. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on June 5. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.”   “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” Cook said in his most detailed comments to date on Apple’s plans in the car space. “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.”   The prospect of self-driving cars has seen a slew of technology companies push into the auto industry, which is estimated to be worth $6.7 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey & Co.

Chief Executive Tim Cook has confirmed the company is working on driverless-car technology, but Silicon Valley’s worst-kept secret is nowhere near being entirely revealed. In an interview aired for the first time Tuesday, Cook told Bloomberg TV that Apple AAPL, -0.60%  is focusing on “autonomous systems.” One purpose of such systems is driverless cars, and there are others, he said. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” one of the most difficult to AI issues to work on, he said. Cook went on to say that autonomy is a core technology Apple views as “very important,” but the company is “not really saying,” from a product point of view, that is what it will do. Apple’s route to a driverless-car world, therefore, remains a question the company is none too keen on answering, after years of dodging questions about whether it is aiming for an “Apple car.” It could take a page from Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -0.80% GOOG, -0.89%  Waymo, which focuses on the total hardware and software package for self-driving cars “while leaving vehicle production to established auto makers,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelly Blue Book. That would put Google’s parent company and Apple in direct competition, similar to their rivalry in the smartphone world, where two systems, Alphabet’s Android and Apple’s iOS, dominate, he said. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Read more: Alphabet self-driving cars could be worth $70 billion, challenge Tesla If it chooses to work on software only, Apple would be in direct competition with traditional auto makers like Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.40%  , which have raced to get autonomous cars on the road in as little as three years. Tesla has developed its own software and related advanced-driver assistance systems, the muscle to the brains provided, since October, by an onboard Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.43%  AI “supercomputer.” The AI computer makes sense of the data gathered by the car’s several sensors, and Nvidia has said it can handle full self-driving capabilities, using AI and machine learning to discern a pedestrian from a utility pole on the path of a driverless car. Apple in April received permission from California regulators to test its driverless cars on the state’s public roads, using three modified Lexus SUVs. Several other companies, from startups to parts manufacturers, other tech companies and traditional auto makers, also are testing their vehicles in California. In a late April letter to state regulators asking for changes in California’s proposed driverless-car policies, Apple said it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” and that it was “excited” about the future of automation in many areas, including transportation. Apple stock has suffered of late, falling 6.5% in the past month, but is still up 26% so far in 2017. That easily eclipses the 7.9% increase this year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07%  , which counts Apple as a member, and the 8.5% gain for the S&P 500 index.

Chief Executive Tim Cook has confirmed the company is working on driverless-car technology, but Silicon Valley’s worst-kept secret is nowhere near being entirely revealed. In an interview aired for the first time Tuesday, Cook told Bloomberg TV that Apple AAPL, -0.60%  is focusing on “autonomous systems.” One purpose of such systems is driverless cars, and there are others, he said. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” one of the most difficult to AI issues to work on, he said. Cook went on to say that autonomy is a core technology Apple views as “very important,” but the company is “not really saying,” from a product point of view, that is what it will do. Apple’s route to a driverless-car world, therefore, remains a question the company is none too keen on answering, after years of dodging questions about whether it is aiming for an “Apple car.” It could take a page from Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -0.80% GOOG, -0.89%  Waymo, which focuses on the total hardware and software package for self-driving cars “while leaving vehicle production to established auto makers,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelly Blue Book. That would put Google’s parent company and Apple in direct competition, similar to their rivalry in the smartphone world, where two systems, Alphabet’s Android and Apple’s iOS, dominate, he said. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.

TSLA, -1.40%  , which have raced to get autonomous cars on the road in as little as three years. Tesla has developed its own software and related advanced-driver assistance systems, the muscle to the brains provided, since October, by an onboard Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.43%  AI “supercomputer.” The AI computer makes sense of the data gathered by the car’s several sensors, and Nvidia has said it can handle full self-driving capabilities, using AI and machine learning to discern a pedestrian from a utility pole on the path of a driverless car. Apple in April received permission from California regulators to test its driverless cars on the state’s public roads, using three modified Lexus SUVs. Several other companies, from startups to parts manufacturers, other tech companies and traditional auto makers, also are testing their vehicles in California. In a late April letter to state regulators asking for changes in California’s proposed driverless-car policies, Apple said it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” and that it was “excited” about the future of automation in many areas, including transportation. Apple stock has suffered of late, falling 6.5% in the past month, but is still up 26% so far in 2017. That easily eclipses the 7.9% increase this year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07%  , which counts Apple as a member, and the 8.5% gain for the S&P 500 index.

Check Out These Charts To Estimate By Cammy Harbison On 06/13/17 AT 2:25 PM Close When will iOS 11 beta 2 release? While no one can accurately predict when the next iOS 11 beta will be released to developers, we can take a look back at the past history of Apple iOS beta releases to get a ballpark estimate of when it should arrive. Below is a screenshot of an interactive chart made by William Hains showing the amount of time between iOS beta releases. To see the interactive chart in action, click here. Or to see the estimated release date, check out the data below. When will iOS 11 beta 2 come out ? Check out our chart for the best estimate of when Apple's next developer mobile software will release. Photo: ThinkyBits.com When Will iOS 11 Beta 2 Release? iOS Beta Release History Give Clues Looking at firmware beta release history (listed below), you’ll see Apple sets a solid trend of releasing the second beta of a major firmware either 14 or 15 days after the first beta is dropped. iOS 10 was an exception to this rule with 22 days passing between the release of beta 1 and beta 2. Therefore, it’s safe to say the iOS 11 beta 2 will likely release in a window of 12-21 days.  iOS 11 beta 1 was released Monday, June 5, 2017. If Apple continues the same trend as the past, then we should see an iOS 10 beta 2 release between Friday, June 16 and Monday, June 26 (I’m leaning towards Monday, June 19 myself.) iOS 10 Beta Release Timeline Time between iOS 10 Beta 1 and 2: 22 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 2 and 3: 13 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 3 and 4: 14 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 4 and 5: 8 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 5 and 6: 6 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 6 and 7: 4 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 7 and 8: 7 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 8 and 9: 12 days Time between iOS 10 Beta 9 and Public Release: 6 days iOS 9 Beta Release Timeline iOS 9 Beta Release Chart Photo: Wikipedia Time between iOS 9 Beta 1 and 2: 15 days Time between iOS 9 Beta 2 and 3: 16 days Time between iOS 9 Beta 3 and 4: 13 days Time between iOS 9 Beta 4 and 5: 16 days Time between iOS 8 Beta 5 and Public Release: 10 days iOS 8 Beta Release Timeline iOS 8 Beta Release Chart Photo: Wikipedia Time between iOS 8 Beta 1 and 2: 15 days Time between iOS 8 Beta 2 and 3: 20 days Time between iOS 8 Beta 3 and 4: 14 days Time between iOS 8 Beta 4 and 5: 14 days Time between iOS 8 Beta 5 and GM: 36 days Time between iOS 8 GM and Public Release: 8 days iOS 7 Beta Release Timeline iOS 7 Beta Releases Photo: Wikipedia Time between iOS 7 Beta 1 and 2: 14 days Time between iOS 7 Beta 2 and 3: 14 days Time between iOS 7 Beta 3 and 4: 21 days Time between iOS 7 Beta 4 and 5: 8 days Time between iOS 7 Beta 5 and 6: 9 days Time between iOS 7 Beta 6 and GM: 26 days iOS 6 Beta Release Timeline Time between iOS 6 Beta 1 and 2: 15 days Time between iOS 6 Beta 2 and 3: 20 days Time between iOS 6 Beta 3 and 4: 21 days Time between iOS 6 Beta 4 and GM: 37 days Time between iOS 6 GM and Public Release: 7 days iOS 5 Beta Release Timeline Time between iOS 5 Beta 1 and 2: 18 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 2 and 3: 17 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 3 and 4: 11 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 4 and 5: 15 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 5 and 6: 13 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 6 and 7: 12 days Time between iOS 5 Beta 7 and GM: 34 days Time between iOS 5 GM and Public Release: 8 days iOS 4 Beta Release Timeline Time between iOS 4 Beta 1 and 2: 12 days Time between iOS 4 Beta 2 and 3: 14 days Time between iOS 4 Beta 3 and 4: 14 days Time between iOS 4 Beta 4 and GM: 20 days Time between iOS 4 GM and Public Release: 14 days Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Macs & Mac OS X | 12 Jun 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) 2017 iMac Configuration Quirks: Don’t Get Burned! by Adam C. Engst Thinking about buying one of Apple’s just-updated iMacs? You’ll want to pay close attention while configuring them because you could end up with a worse configuration for the same price depending on how you start, or you might pay more for the same configuration. Alert reader Yasuhiro Sugawara of Sugarwater Brothers deserves the credit for identifying these quirks in Apple’s online store. 21.5-inch iMac’s Radeon Pro 555 versus 560 -- First, imagine that you want to buy a 21.5-inch iMac with the fastest processor and a 1 TB Fusion Drive. Apple’s online store provides three configurations, the lowest of which we’ll ignore because it lacks the 4K Retina display and can’t be configured with a faster processor. If you start with a middle-level 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, choose the faster 3.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, and select a 1 TB Fusion Drive in place of the 1 TB hard drive, you end up with a price of $1699. If you instead start with the top-level 21.5-inch iMac, you can create the same configuration for the same price merely by selecting the faster processor, since it already comes with a 1 TB Fusion Drive. Here’s the thing though. As Yasuhiro Sugawara noticed, everything is the same, including the price, except for the Radeon Pro graphics processor. The middle-level iMac comes with the Radeon Pro 555 with 2 GB of video memory, whereas the top-level iMac includes the Radeon Pro 560 with 4 GB of video memory. To reiterate, that’s for the exact same $1699. How much of a difference does the higher-numbered Radeon Pro graphics chip with twice as much video memory make? It’s impossible to say without formal benchmarking. AMD says that the Radeon Pro 555 has 12 compute units and can hit 1.3 teraflops, whereas the 560 has 16 compute units and can reach up to 1.9 teraflops. On the Tech Report Web site, there’s a discussion of these graphics chips that suggests there might be a slight performance improvement by getting the 560 over the 555. Whether or not you’ll notice the difference between the 555 and the 560, I can’t see any reason you wouldn’t want the faster 560 with more video memory for no extra money. It will be at least theoretically better and may increase the resale value of the iMac. Regardless, if you want a 21.5-inch iMac with the fastest processor and at least a 1 TB Fusion Drive, start with the top model, not the middle model. The price equivalency stays in place as you add RAM or storage, though the top model can also take up to 32 GB of RAM, whereas the middle model tops out at 16 GB. As with the previous 21.5-inch iMac models, you cannot upgrade the RAM yourself, as you can with the 27-inch iMac, so make sure to order with the right amount to start. Yasuhiro Sugawara’s discovery piqued my curiosity, so I investigated other Macs. With the 15-inch MacBook Pro, I couldn’t create a similar situation, because the middle configuration offers a $100 option of stepping up from the Radeon Pro 555 with 2 GB of video memory to the top model’s Radeon Pro 560 with 4 GB of video memory. Clearly, Apple considers that jump to be worth $100, at least when it comes to the MacBook Pro. 27-inch iMac’s Radeon Pro 575 versus 580 -- However, when I worked through the 27-inch iMac configurations, I found the same issue as with the 21.5-inch models. To see this, configure the middle and top 27-inch iMacs with the 4.2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, and give the middle one a 2 TB Fusion Drive to match the top model. Although both configurations cost $2499, the middle one has only the Radeon Pro 575 with 4 GB of video memory, whereas the top one has the Radeon Pro 580 with 8 GB of video memory. The Radeon Pro 575 has 32 compute units versus 36 compute units in the 580, and the peak performance is 4.5 teraflops for the 575 and 5.5 teraflops for the 580. So once again, if you want a 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display and the fastest processor, start with the top model. The pricing equivalency remains in place as you add RAM here too, and sticks whether you want a 2 TB or 3 TB Fusion Drive. (Speaking of adding RAM, you can upgrade the RAM yourself in all three 27-inch iMac models. The Mac Observer notes that even the low-end model can take up to 64 GB of RAM, contrary to Apple’s Tech Specs page, although you’ll need to buy it from an independent supplier.) 27-inch iMac’s SSD Pricing -- There is one area in which this unusual pricing equivalency does not remain in place for the 27-inch iMac, and that’s if you want to swap the Fusion Drive for an SSD. When you configure the middle 27-inch iMac with a 512 GB or 1 TB SSD, it will be $100 cheaper than the identically configured top model. With a 512 GB SSD, the middle model runs $2599 and the top model $2699. Go up to a 1 TB SSD and the middle model is only $2999, whereas the top model costs $3099. I see three possible explanations for this discrepancy at the moment. In order: This pricing is exactly how things should be, with the top 27-inch iMac model being $100 more expensive due to having the faster Radeon Pro with twice as much video memory. It’s possible that Apple would prefer to charge more for the faster graphics chip in general but couldn’t figure out how to work that in without bringing SSDs into the mix. But why wouldn’t Apple carry this $100 surcharge over to the 21.5-inch models? It’s a simple mistake, though there’s no telling whether the actual prices should be higher or lower. If this is the case, we may see Apple adjust the prices soon. The more expensive SSDs in the top 27-inch iMac models are actually faster or better in some other way. Apple’s Tech Specs page for the iMac doesn’t call out any difference. I have contacted Apple about this situation, but haven’t heard back yet. In the meantime, the moral of the story is to pay careful attention when you start configuring an iMac to make sure you’re getting the best possible set of options for your money.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

During an interview with Bloomberg Television, he clarified that “what we’re focusing on [is] autonomous systems.” That is to say, Cupertino isn’t putting all of its eggs into the self-driving-vehicle basket. Rather, it is addressing a more generalized issue—which just happens to also cover self-driving vehicles. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” Cook said, adding that this is “probably one of the most difficult AI projects.” Reports of an Apple car have been kicking around for some time; from securing auto-themed domain names to poaching Tesla execs, it’s clear the company is at least exploring the idea. But Cook never formally acknowledged work on a vehicle—autonomous, electric, or otherwise. And by last fall, it looked like the prospect of an Apple iCar was in the rearview mirror when Cupertino cut hundreds of jobs from its autonomous vehicle team. The tech titan, instead, turned its focus toward creating software so it can potentially partner with existing automakers. Based on what little Cook revealed to Bloomberg, Apple appears to be right on track with Project Titan, moving forward with its “autonomous systems.” “Autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us,” Cook told Bloomberg. “We’ll see where it takes us.” In April, the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued Apple an autonomous vehicle test permit for three 2015 Lexus RX450h cars (the same as Google) and six drivers. The CEO, meanwhile, remained mum on future products, but added that autonomy is “a core technology that we view as very important.” There is plenty of competition in this space: Not only is rival Google testing its own self-driving vehicles, but manufacturers like Volvo, Ford, Toyota, GM, Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, and Tesla, among others, have jumped on the autonomous bandwagon.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Tim Cook teases more details on Apple's car project JOHN CETRINO / EPA Apple CEO Tim Cook before delivering the commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology June 17. Apple CEO Tim Cook before delivering the commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology June 17. (JOHN CETRINO / EPA) Brian FungBlue Sky Innovation It may be the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley that Apple has been working on something having to do with cars. The issue is, nobody outside of Apple could really say what the project has been about — until now. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has shed more light on his company's automotive efforts, revealing that the company is "focusing on autonomous systems," according to an interview with Bloomberg News published Tuesday. In plain English, that means the technology behind self-driving cars. Apple still won't say publicly if it intends to sell a car of its own, but Cook's remarks implied that the company is less interested in building a machine on wheels than developing the software or brains that could power one. "It's a core technology that we view as very important," Cook said. He likened the effort to "the mother of all AI projects," saying it's "probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on." To see and interpret the world around them, self-driving cars require sophisticated computing and sensing systems. Artificial intelligence, or AI, can help make sense of that data. By analyzing thousands of hours of readings from test drives, companies such as Google and Ford hope that their machines will soon drive more safely and efficiently than humans can. This raises the possibility that, just as Apple and Google became the dominant companies in mobile operating systems with iOS and Android, the same will be true in the operating systems for self-driving cars. "Apple appears to be taking the same route as Waymo/Google, which is to focus on the technology of self-driving cars while leaving vehicle production to established automakers," said Karl Brauer, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. "This puts Apple and Google in direct competition, again. Are we looking at a future with two major autonomous vehicle systems just as we currently have two major smartphone systems? The answer seems to be 'yes.'" The public got an early hint in April that Apple was interested in entering the self-driving car wars, when the company got permission from California regulators to test-drive a handful of modified Lexus SUVs on public roads. But it was less clear then just what aspect of self-driving technology Apple was pursuing. The company declined to comment for this story. Automotive analysts say that building lots of working cars, and quickly, can be a far more complex endeavor than building a smartphone or laptop. (Tesla's struggles with meeting production targets offer further evidence of how challenging auto manufacturing can be at scale.) Cars have a lot of moving parts. Large, established players in Detroit enjoy huge economies of scale that can make it harder for a new entrant to get started. And, some say, whereas Apple's success with the iPhone came at a time when most people didn't have cellphones, the market for cars is already saturated, raising questions about how much money Apple could really make by selling actual cars. All that could help explain why Apple, despite being one of the world's wealthiest companies, appears to be focusing more heavily — for now — on self-driving software.

Successful independent green grocers Bramley's Apple have set up a branch in Station Road, and the passionate people behind the counter are already enjoying their dream job in the village. The new venture from Owen Stedman, 35, and Phil Cowey, 29, opened yesterday (June 12) and residents have already been stopping by to take a look. But customers do not need to visit the shop to enjoy the produce. Bramley's Apple offers a home delivery service, as well as special packages for businesses and schools in Cobham and the surrounding area.

"If I could make this work as a living I would do it for the rest of my life", said Mr Cowey. "That's what I told my wife. And now it's happening. "I love food, love people and love helping people. I don't know why you wouldn't want to do a job like this." Mr Cowey has worked for Bramley's Apple for eight years and during that time has fallen in love with the business and the grocer's life.

Now a location has opened in Stoke D'Abernon, Mr Cowey said: "Our first day was absolutely wonderful. We've been properly welcomed by the community. "People have been well chuffed that we are here. Even the ones who have just done their weekly shop at Waitrose or wherever have said they will be dropping by. "Owen had great things to say about the community here and wanted to be here. "I think we can last here because we have, as we do in our other locations, the delivery service.

"We also do a lot of wholesaling, which makes up a large part of our business. So local restaurants can make use of our fresh local produce." Mr Stedman added: "We will deliver straight to people's door, if people want to get in touch in the morning we can deliver the same day, providing we have what they want in stock - it's not a problem." Boxes of fresh veg start at £10 and can be delivered to areas in the vicinity of Cobham, including Oxshott and Weybridge.

Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share June 13, 2017 1:14 PM EDT APPLE INC -0.87 At Closing, June 15th 144.29 USD The bull or bear debate about Apple hinges in large measure on one question: Is a 21 percent slide in sales in China over the last year a temporary hiccup or a sign of permanent change in the world's largest market for smartphones? Apple's booming stock price is tied largely to expectations that the next versions of the iPhone will unleash a surge of sales, particularly in China. The biggest share of Apple’s revenue growth in the last four years -- about one-third of the $51 billion gain -- came from the region that Apple calls Greater China, which consists of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The new iPhone is expected to reverse what has been five consecutive quarters of falling sales in the region. Bernstein Research estimates iPhone unit sales in China may jump by 35 to 40 percent in Apple's fiscal year ending September 2018. Apple of My Eye The region including China has been the biggest contributor to Apple's revenue growth in the last four years Source: Bloomberg Note: Apple's revenue for the 12 months ended April 1 is being compared with the company's revenue for the 12 months ended March 30, 2013. That's the optimistic case. There is debate whether the sliding China sales are a blip or an indication that the growth Apple experienced in China after the blockbuster 2014 iPhone edition was the aberration. The troubling thing is it's hard to rely on Apple itself for a confident reading of the company's promise in China. Apple repeatedly hasn’t come to grips, at least publicly, with its challenges in China. Only with an honest accounting can investors have confidence in the potential for Apple’s China recovery.  Wrong Direction Apple's revenue in the region consisting of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan has fallen from a peak in late 2015 Source: Bloomberg Note: Quarters shown here reflect Apple's fiscal year, which ends each September. When sales in China first starting falling more than a year ago, Apple executives said at first that the situation wasn't as bad as the numbers suggested. Starting in April 2016, executives said that Apple's China region revenue was hurt by a reduction in inventory by smartphone sellers, by the relative weakness of the currencies in Hong Kong and China compared with the U.S. dollar, tough comparisons to blockbuster 2015 iPhone sales and slower economic growth in China. (This was not long after Apple had said it wasn't feeling the effects of slowing Chinese economic growth.)  More recently, Apple has said sales declines in the China region wouldn't get worse. That has proved to be true so far. I suppose congratulations are in order for acknowledging a falloff in revenue more than six months after it started. In May, CEO Tim Cook said Chinese consumers were particularly prone to holding off on buying new iPhones until Apple releases the remodeled edition later this year.  There is an endless grab bag of excuses, and some of them are valid. Apple also deserves major kudos for being one of the few U.S. tech companies to build a huge and successful business in China, and it's clear the company is in China for the long haul. But Apple could also benefit from far more candor about its present and future in China.  I cringed when Cook told Bloomberg Television's Emily Chang in a recent interview that his company's latest iPhones were the first and third most popular smartphones in China. That may be true given that his competitors sell scores of different models and Apple has only two current generation phones. But he's also not choosing the most accurate way to discuss Apple's standing in China. Apple's First-Quarter Smartphone Market Share in China 9.2% Apple is in fact the fourth most popular smartphone company in China. Local companies Huawei, Oppo and Vivo all sell more smartphones in China than Apple does, according to research firm IDC. In the first three months of this year, Apple sold 9.2 percent of total smartphone units in China, IDC figures show. Two years earlier, Apple was the top-selling smartphone company with a 14.7 percent share of devices sold.  Shop Local Chinese companies are the top three smartphone sellers in China. Two years earlier, Apple sold the most smartphones in China. Source: IDC Note: IDC didn't break out market share for Oppo and Vivo in the 2015 period. In the first quarter of 2017, IDC didn't specify Samsung's market share. Are the market share losses temporary? Cook doesn't really go there. He has said a couple of times that sales of older generation iPhones are disappointing in China. That seems like a potential weakness worth some elaboration, but Cook doesn't go there, either.  Nor has Cook discussed much how competition and the maturation of China's internet economy are creating fresh risks for Apple. China in 2017 is a far different tech market from what it was a few years ago when Apple’s efforts there came to stunning financial fruition. Now, Chinese companies are making smartphones that are competitive head to head with some of the iPhone's best features and functions. The popularity of Tencent's WeChat app in China makes iPhones less essential for many people. They can swap an Apple device for a rival smartphone without losing hold of where they spend the majority of their digital time.  If the next iPhones sell like crazy in China, I will be wrong and Apple's lack of candor will be moot. But if China sales don't deliver as expected, Apple will have a lot of explaining to do.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The market share rankings in China have been volatile over time. And Apple doesn't typically care about market share. But in this case it seems Apple does care about market share.

First they snatch the smartphone, then users are fooled into clicking on a fake link. (WLS) An ABC7 I-Team Investigation WLS By Jason Knowles and Ann Pistone Tuesday, June 13, 2017 12:14PM A new elaborate scam can victimize smartphone users multiple times. First they snatch the smartphone, then users are fooled into clicking on a fake link. It starts with a simple crime: a stolen smartphone. But it's not just the expensive device that the thieves want. The thieves then pass your phone on to high-tech hackers, experts say. Then, they scam you again by sending you a link saying your phone has been found. "There are two parts to it," said Andrew Hoog, of NowSecure in Oak Park. "There is the criminal organization that's capable of stealing iPhones, this is basically your strong arm. They've got people on the streets that will mug you and take your phone." Once the phone gets into the hands of hackers they use special websites to figure out the device's phone number. Then you get a text message, either on your new phone or on another device synced to the cloud. "And you can from this text message that the attackers already know a lot about this individual's phone. They know it is an iPhone 7, they know the name on the account," Hoog said. The text says your smartphone has been located and all you have to do is click on a link and enter your Apple ID and password. The problem? That link is not really from Apple. "I see the little blue underline, I've read the message, I lost my iPhone, I'm getting excited, on the phone it looks like Apple's website, it feels like Apple's website. I'm almost there. I'm at the finish line, let me type in my user name and password and recover my phone," Hoog said. Hoog said it's an elaborate scheme known as targeted phishing. Smartphone users are victimized twice, if not more because then they can take everything learned about the user and perpetrate more attacks, Hoog said. He said the scheme can be carried out using many brands of smartphones and that thieves now need to use this secondary phishing step to make the theft worthwhile. "The reason they want to do this is if you steal an I phone and it is locked it is very difficult to sell that in the market because apple has put in a lot of security that makes it difficult to go out there and re use it," Hoog said. "If you can convince somebody to give you their iCloud user name and password. They can unlock the device, wipe it and sell it for more money on the black market." The Chicago Police Department would not disclose recent smartphone theft figures, telling the I-TEAM to file a Freedom of Information Act request. The I-Team submitted one and have not yet heard back. In February 2014, detectives told us the problem was skyrocketing and that 90 percent of the stolen phones were resold for $2,000 a piece in Hong Kong. So how do people keep their smartphones safe? "Just keep it on me at all times so I know it is close to me," Tara Patterson said. "It's always in my backpack." "So I charge it when I sit down and I'd be lying if I, if every time someone doesn't come within in 10 foot, I don't make sure it's not snagable," said Nicholas Kelley. But if a smartphone does get stolen or lost, users can protect themselves from targeted phishing scam by keeping a few tips in mind: -Go to real sites, on your own, to track your device. -Be suspicious of any inbound link that asks for your information. -Most legitimate companies like Apple and Google will not send you a link and ask you to enter personal information.

Apple’s tax exempt bond is expected to finance various clean energy and environmental projects. The tech company’s green bond is the first offered since Trump withdrew from the climate deal earlier this month. The iPhone producer issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion after former President Barack Obama signed the non-binding agreement in 2015, which obligates America to reduce 28 percent of greenhouse gasses by 2030. The second green bond merely assures foreign government that the U.S. is still committed to meeting Paris’ obligations, Apple officials said. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy, said in a statement announcing the decision. Green bonds have grown in popularity during the last few years, especially in 2016, when companies issued $81 billion of green bonds, which is double the number issued in 2015, according to Climate Bonds Initiative, a project founded to promote environmental causes. Apple directed $442 million of last year’s bond to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling. The Silicon Valley company generates significant tax benefits from its sizable green energy projects, especially the Apple Energy, a subsidiary company that produces and sells solar power. The company acquired tax credits last year after kick-starting the subsidiary, which won federal approval from the Federal Energy Regulation Commission in 2016 to start selling excess energy from its various California and Nevada solar farms. Instead of buying solar electricity from another operator, FERC’s approval gave Apple the ability to sell the juice from its own clean power plants. Apple’s strategy bolstered CEO Tim Cook’s environmental credentials, gave them some independence from the broader U.S. electric grid, and allowed the company to take advantage of the investment tax credit (ITC), which helped reduce Apple’s tax burden. The credit gives breaks to owners of solar projects worth 30 percent of project costs. Cutting the Paris agreement causes solar and wind power to be deployed more slowly, according to John Sterman, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and senior advisor at ClimateInteractive, a project that crunches the numbers for those involved in the climate deal.

Developers Are Already Impressed With Apple's Augmented Reality Software "It tends to just work." At this year's annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple released a suite of augmented reality development tools, which it refers to as ARKit. It's only been out for a week, and already, it's being called a game changer. It is user-friendly, in accordance with Apple's defining ethos. It contains refinements of existing augmented reality tech. And it will be widely available on iOS 11, the new operating system for the iPhone and the iPad. During its tech demo, Apple showed off a series of effects that are best described as impressive. One can take a digital coffee cup, place it on a table, and move it around; the cup will get larger and smaller to correspond with the distance from the iPad, creating the illusion of movement. Digital steam hangs in the air. A digital lamp creates digital light, which casts digital shadows on the tabletop. Kyle Russell, partner of tech venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted out the following video of a fighter plane, mapped onto a real environment. In the video, the camera circles around the object to show off the motion tracking, which, according to Russell, animates at approximately 60 frames per second. The fighter plane maintains its positioning, even when Russell points the device away. "The most impressive aspect of ARKit is that it tends to just work," said Cody Brown, founder of virtual reality production studio IRL, in an online interview with Motherboard. "Other AR software often requires some sort of physical tracking mechanism (like a QR code), which inevitably becomes a major piece of friction if you are trying to get anyone to use this stuff." "Another incredible aspect of ARKit is how it handles lighting adjustments in real time, continued Brown. "I can only imagine the math and magic underneath this tech to make it work." Brown's praise harkens back to Apple's marketing slogan in the early aughts: "It just works." Users don't need to know how something works; it's just important that it does. "One thing that really stands out about augmented reality is its intuitiveness," said Don McMahon, Professor of Special Education Technology at Washington State University and director of the Assistive Technology Lab, in an interview with Motherboard. "Compare that to virtual reality, which takes you to a completely different world that is completely artificial." "But with augmented reality, I can see the physical world around me," continued McMahon. "There's just a little bit of digital information overlaid on top of it." Image: Don McMahon McMahon is a lead voice for AR technology serving practical, educational purposes, beyond the more obvious play. And in special education, which demands that individual students have individual learning plans, AR is a natural fit. "Augmented reality is incredibly engaging, and it provides multiple ways to represent information," said McMahon. "It's going to become as much a part of education as mobile devices are currently." American schools fight a binary battle of "zero-tolerance," treating smart phones and students' technology as pure distractions, rather than co-opting their functions for learning environments. Augmented reality might endure similar growing pains. But McMahon gives several examples of how, done properly, augmented reality can serve a variety of educational functions. For someone who is mentally disabled, an augmented overlay could help him or her navigate an urban environment, such as determining the proper bus to take, or traveling to a local store. Image: Don McMahon Flash cards can be made more interactive—instead of having the definition on one side and the corresponding word on the other, the word can lead to a graphic of the organ or system in question. When iOS 11 launches in Fall 2017, it will become the largest AR platform in the world, making this new technology available to millions of users. And although we're probably years away from having pervasive, augmented technology in modern life—head-mounted displays need to catch up for this to truly happen—this is the beginning of a revolution.

According to Variety, Google has hired Manu Gulati, a former SoC architect at Apple for the last 8 years, a move that has been confirmed on Gulati’s LinkedIn profile.  What does this hire mean? Well, it means that Google just got very serious about creating custom processors for its Pixel lineup of devices. Gulati’s title at Google is Lead SoC Architect, meaning he’ll be overseeing development of the silicon. Speaking to his qualifications, he is currently credited with 15 chip-related patents while at Apple, one of which is the hardware-based secure storage of fingerprints on the iPhone. This technology is utilized by Apple Pay. Gulati is also credited with being instrumental in the building of Apple’s custom chip lineup, beginning with the A4 and so on. Before that, he worked at Broadcom and AMD. As for when we might see Gulati’s work inside of Google’s phones, we aren’t sure yet. It may be too late for this year’s Pixel lineup, but it’s entirely possible that Google will have something special in 2018. We just don’t know. As you can imagine, though, Google will likely make a very big deal about this, so don’t think we won’t know when Google starts using its own chips in the Pixel lineup. // Variety Post navigation Previous StoryLG Might be Making the New Pixel XL Next StoryGoogle’s Pixel Launcher Hits 1 Million Installs Patel Nisha My guess is that a Google built chip would be for the second iteration of their standalone VR headset rather than a phone. Marc Perrusquia Thank God NOTHING touches Apple’s CPU designs right now. We need real competition. WickedToby741 Who’s to say this will be limited to Pixel phones? If they’re going to go through the trouble of developing a custom SOC, I doubt they’ll ever sell enough Pixels to justify the cost. It’d make more sense if they’re making chips for Android as a whole. It would make sense in the long run with how important on device machine learning is becoming. Awol If they can monopolize the chip market with the main manufacturers it could go a long way to aid in eliminating fragmentation of the ecosystem. Let’s be frank, the current chips make is difficult to keep the phones up to date without significant investment and no one wants that. mrjayviper a new SoC will require more than 1 architect! interstellarmind What’s really nuts​ about this whole thing is that Variety broke the story. gabe1989 mmm custom chip lineup. nom. DanG Year 2020. That’s Pixel 5. Shadowstare This is a huge get for Google. The 3rd generation Pixel phones and related devices (because I wouldn’t expect his impact to be felt this fall for the Pixel 2), should be pretty dope. Perhaps this is a step toward Google getting back in the OEM game and producing their own hardware devices. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Thanks Apple. But 2018 seems to be a bit soon to have a chip that’s ready to play with the big dogs. 2019 maybe? I mean we don’t even have rumors. OligarchyAmbulance They said when the first Pixel launched they were already working on in-house SoC’s. Just because they hired this guy doesn’t mean they just started work. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Doesn’t mean it’ll be ready by next year either. Between completing the design(they just brought on the expert) testing, and finding manufacturers that aren’t busy building other people’s chips…i can’t imagine Google having enough stock to launch next year in New phones. The window is just too small for such a big move. Xyvis Absolutely. People don’t realize that it takes years to produce a chip. The chips Qualcomm releases each year have been in development for far more than a year. It may make it to the Pixel 3 but I don’t think we will see anything before that, assuming they have chip plans already being worked on. If not then probably not before Pixel 4. Suicide_Note This is excellent news and, once the chips are ready for use in Pixel devices, should solve the issue people have with Google’s software support timeframe. Good_Ole_Pinocchio ? Has it ever occurred to folks that at the pace Google. Innovates.. They just don’t want to support devices for longer than 3 years? Intentionally, so they can keep pushing forward? disastrousrainbow Apple be like: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09cf75a85f514f5b13883dc19bbb3c294fa13de54f3e08f8a9c206252a348922.gif Drew Apple is way ahead of the curve with SoCs. Don’t think they care much. chris pinkston Wouldn’t say they are ahead as far as the soc as a whole..only the CPU portion. Qualcomm’s Soc is probably the best overall though the CPU isn’t as good as Apple’s Marc Perrusquia What are you babbling about? The CPU and GPU in the A10 completely stomp the 835 which is 7 months newer. The A9 from 2015 also stomped the 2016 820 and 821. The memory in the iPhone is also much faster clocked at 3200mhz vs 1866mhz in Qualcomm SOC’s. The integrated storage controller is the same Apple uses in their industry leading PCIE MacBook Pro SSDs leading to storage performance that’s 6-8 times faster than UFS 2.1. The only thing Qualcomm SOC’s win in is the integrated modem, and only marginally. chris pinkston What are you babbling about? I said the CPU of the A10 was faster..No it’s gpu is not faster than the adreno 540 on the SD 835. Benchmarks I’ve seen show it being faster than the A10 in graphics. A10 may have faster ram but the storage read speeds I’ve seen for the iPhone 7 are no faster than ufs 2.1 on phones like the Galaxy s8 for example. And lastly yes the sd835 has the better integrated modems. Jason B Developing a full-on custom SoC from an ARM license will take at least 18 months, at best, so Google is looking ahead to secure their smartphone future. This is the only way they can provide software support longer than their current timeframes, as they’ll own and control the source IP. Qualcomm hasn’t been the greatest partner in providing long-term support, as it’s more profitable for them to produce new chips to sell, rather than supporting older chips that no longer make a profit. Suicide_Note Exactly. It’s amazing how few people understand this. Thelmaswilson Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj158d: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Monsieur Its a given fact that any given company would want to milk their product lineup as long as they can so they can fatten up their bottom line. Its not in qualcomm favor to release new chip every yr as those chips require a lots of R&D and production cost. Otherwise Braodcomm and Nvidia wouldn’t have folded their modem/SoC division. Its the market and technology evolution which qualcomm is trying to meet. As for support for older phones; see my point for technology evolution. How can you support mobile pay / VR / Digital Assistant on older h/w where associated chips are missing? Even mighty Apple was not able to port Siri backwards with s/w upgrade. You need both h/w and s/w to make a feature works. Louisepayne you can include an extra 1471/USD weekly in your revenue… https://youtu.be/LPvE20djSAg rebretz000 I am liking this news. It will probably take a few years for Google to produce a good mobile chip, I hope I’m wrong, but I can’t wait for a complete in-house Pixel phone to be built. Google needs to buy Essential and fold Rubin back and get themselves one step closer to being a complete device maker.

The project, known internally as Project Titan, was reportedly scaled back in October of last year when Apple appeared to move away from making an electric car. Without going into much detail, Cook talked about “three vectors of change” that will disrupt the auto industry: self-driving cars, electric cars and ride-sharing companies. “Clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars,” Cook said in an interview with Bloomberg. “There are others.” Cook admits that the work being done is incredibly difficult and likened it to being “the mother of all AI projects.” Apple appears to have started testing its autonomous car technology in California earlier this year, making it one of at least 30 companies given a permit to hit the state’s roads.

Cook said that he viewed autonomous driving as “the mother of all (artificial intelligence) projects.” Apple’s chief executive stopped short of committing that the company will actually build its own autonomous car, but said that he is fascinated by the convergence of autonomous driving, electric cars and ride sharing. “I think there is major disruption looming there,” he said. Apple has been secretly working for some time on car-based technology, an effort that has been clouded in secrecy. The company was reportedly initially working on its own vehicle, but refocused those efforts last year to instead build autonomous driving technology that could one day be used by other car makers. Cook’s carefully chosen words during his Bloomberg interview suggested as much. “We are focusing on autonomous systems, he said. “And clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars.” Apple isn’t the only major tech company developing autonomous car technology. Google has long been public about its self-driving car project, and Uber, Tesla, Baidu, Nvidia and others all have their own efforts in this space as well.

How to download watchOS 3.2.3 beta 3 to your Apple Watch By Rene Ritchie, Serenity Caldwell Tuesday, Jun 13, 2017 at 1:10 pm EDT 32 Comments Installing the watchOS 3.2.3 beta is more complex than an iOS or macOS beta, but it's also for developers only. Update June 13, 2017: Apple has just released watchOS 3.2.3 beta 3 for developers. If you already have a previous watchOS 3 beta installed, proceed to the Watch app on your iPhone running iOS 10 and download away. If you were waiting to begin watchOS 3.2.3 testing with beta 3, keep reading and we'll walk you through the set up! There's yet to be a public beta for watchOS the way there has been for iOS and OS X, and that's okay — the process for installing the software is more complicated, and really meant for developers only. You need to install a certificate on your Apple Watch, then download the software to your iPhone running iOS 10 beta, transfer it across, and get it up and running. It's not hard, but it does take patience and you may have to troubleshoot. Apple occasionally offers updates to iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS as closed developer previews or public betas for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac (sadly, no public beta for the Apple Watch). While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device. That's why we strongly recommend staying away from developer previews unless you need them for software development, and using the public betas with caution. If you depend on your devices, wait for the final release. How to download the watchOS 3.2.3 beta certificate How to install watchOS 3.2 on your Apple Watch How to downgrade to watchOS 3 How to install the watchOS 3.2.3 beta certificate Note: Make sure you're running the developer beta for iOS 10 on your iPhone before trying to install watchOS 3. Log into developer.apple.com on the iPhone paired with your Apple Watch. Go to the watchOS 3 download page. Tap on Download watchOS 3 beta Configuration Profile. Tap on Apple Watch from the Choose a Device popup. Tap on Install begin. Enter your Passcode Tap on Install to confirm. Tap on Restart to reboot your Apple Watch. Once your Apple Watch has rebooted the installation process goes back to normal. How to install watchOS 3.2 on your Apple Watch The certificate is what tells the Watch app on your iPhone that watchOS 3 is available. Once the Watch app detects it, the process for installing it is the same as any other watchOS update, detailed below. (If the beta doesn't show up, reboot again.) Connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi and launch the Apple Watch app. Tap on the My Watch tab. Tap on General. Tap on Software Update. Tap on Download and Install. Enter your iPhone Passcode. Tap Agree to the Terms and Conditions. Make sure your Apple Watch is charged to at least 50% and connect it to the magnetic charger. Tap Install on your iPhone and/or your Apple Watch. The Watch OS update will download and transfer to your Apple Watch and Apple Watch will reboot to apply the update. You can follow the progress on the Apple Watch screen, and once it's done, you'll be all set. If the watchOS 3 update fails at the verification stage, try again. If it fails repeatedly, un-pair and re-pair your Apple Watch and try again. (That un-pairing and re-pairing process takes a while so make sure verification really isn't working for you before you go through it.) How to downgrade watchOS Instructions for reverting back to watchOS are behind the developer center log in, so we can't replicate them here. Suffice it to say you can't do it on your own. Your Watch will have to go back to Apple. That alone should give anyone who doesn't absolutely need the developer beta pause to reconsider installing it in the first place. For developers who, for whatever reason, really do need to revert, you can find instructions for contacting Apple at the bottom of this document: watchOS Beta Software Installation Guide (PDF) Apple Watch watchOS 3 review Apple Watch Series 2 review Apple Watch buyers guide Apple Watch users guide Apple Watch news Apple Watch discussion Buy at Apple Reader comments How to download watchOS 3.2.3 beta 3 to your Apple Watch 32 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Mac Guy watchOS 3.2 beta 4. <yawn> I'm over the beta thing. I did do the betas for wOS2 and 3 and that was interesting. But it took a while to get rid of the beta token so I could get the General Release. wOS3 was the proverbial game changer and 3.2 isn't offering much in features with the big ones being Theater mode and Find My AirPods. I like it, but it's not enough to get me to do the beta dance again. I can wait for the GR. It'll be here before my AirPods. 0 3 months ago Reply Stubbs69 I went to update my Watch OS to 3.1.1 the day that became official and was able to download it, but couldn't install because they pulled it. To this day I have that annoying notification still showing, but NO ONE I ask ANYWHERE can tell me if 3.1.1 was ever released to everyone.

I wish to install the Watch OS 3 beta on my watch and was wondering if I do install it and use it till the official release and when the official version comes out on September am I able to upgrade to that version without having to send the watch back to Apple for a reload back to Watch OS 2? I know the iphone public beta should go directly to the official but was wondering if this would be the same for the watch OS 3 beta? Thanks in advance :)﻿ 0 10 months ago Reply steviet02 Don't make the same mistake I did and try to load the iOS Profile onto the watch. Even though it asks you if you want to download the profile to the watch it will download the iOS profile and then reboot the watch. Go directly to the developer.apple.com site, log in, and go directly to downloads. Select watchOs download button and then install the profile to the watch. Once rebotted, go to the Watch App on the iphone and try the software update. 2 11 months ago Reply Reuven79 Something is not right as it does not show the Beta upgrade.

How to download tvOS 10.2.2 beta 3 to your Apple TV By Rene Ritchie, Serenity Caldwell Tuesday, Jun 13, 2017 at 2:13 pm EDT 10 Comments Installing the tvOS 10.2.2 beta is more complex than an iOS or macOS beta, but it's also for developers only. Update June 13, 2017: Apple has just released tvOS 10.2.2 beta 2 for developers. If you already have a tvOS 10 beta installed, proceed to System > Software Updates and download away. If you've been waiting for beta 2 to get started with tvOS 10.2.2, keep reading and we'll walk you through the set up! Apple hasn't announced a public beta for tvOS the way the company has for iOS and macOS. That means until it is released to everyone this fall, it's only available to developers. It also means installing it on the Apple TV (4th generation) is more complicated than a simple download and go. If you're a developer and you're having trouble getting the tvOS beta installed, here's what you need to do. Unlike Apple's other operating systems, you can't back up your Apple TV; as such, Apple offers two options for updating tvOS: over the air, which just updates the system; and via USB-C, which restores the device to its factory settings. How to install the tvOS 10.2 beta over-the-air How to install the tvOS 10.2 beta over USB-C How to install the tvOS 10.2 beta over-the-air A note, before we begin: "Over the air" is technically a bit of a misnomer, since you have to use a USB-C cable to initially connect your Apple TV to your Mac to install the tvOS configuration profile. That being said, once you've installed the configuration profile, you'll be able to wirelessly update your Apple TV to any subsequent beta versions. Updating over the air only updates the system software; your configurations and apps should remain on your Apple TV as-is. On your Mac, go to developer.apple.com/download. Enter your developer username and password to log in. Click on the blue Download button to the right of tvOS 10 beta configuration profile. Install the Apple Configurator app from the Mac App Store. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to AC power. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to your Mac using a USB-C cable. Launch Apple Configurator. Click on Add Profiles to your Apple TV and add the tvOS 10 beta configuration profile you downloaded previously. (Or simply drag and drop the file to the Apple TV icon.) Reboot your Apple TV once the configuration profile is installed. On your Apple TV, click on Settings. Click on System. Click on Software Update. Your Apple TV should now detect tvOS 10.1.1 and download and install it just like any other update. How to install the tvOS 10.1 beta over USB-C If you prefer to wipe your Apple TV developer unit before updating, you can use the Restore Image option, which connects to your Mac via USB-C. On your Mac, go to developer.apple.com/download. Enter your developer username and password to log in. Click on the blue Download button to the right of tvOS 10 restore image. Click on the blue Download button to the right of Xcode 8. Install Xcode 8 on your Mac. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to AC power. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to your Mac using a USB-C cable. Launch iTunes. Select your Apple TV when it appears in iTunes. Hold down the Option key and click on Check for Updates. Browse to and click on the tvOS 10.1.1 beta you downloaded in step 3. Once iTunes has updated your Apple TV, hook it back up to your television and you're good to go. Have you got tvOS 10.1.1 up and running on your Apple TV? Which method did you use and how did it work for you?

In an interview with Bloomberg Television , the chief executive said the company is focusing on "autonomous systems" that could run inside driverless vehicles. "We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects," Cook said. "It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on." However, he stopped short of confirming the company was planning to manufacture its own self-driving car. "We're not really saying from a product point of view, what we will do ... it's a core technology that we view as very important," he said. Apple CEO Tim Cook (Photo: Apple) Read More British supercar maker McLaren denies it's in talks with Apple over £1.5 billion takeover bid Apple's has been widely rumoured to be working on driverless car technology for several years. In December 2016, a letter to the highway regulator in the United States revealed the iPhone maker had a secret project underway involving transportation. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," it stated. The letter didn't give away how far along Apple's driving project was, but stated that there would be "significant societal benefits of automated vehicles." It proposed that established car manufacturers (such as Ford, which is investing in driverless cars) and new entrants, such as itself, Google and Uber, should share data to improve the technology.

"This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios." Apple already has a car-based system called CarPlay, which lets you use Apple gadgets through the car's navigation and entertainment system. Experts have previously suggested the tech company is likely more interesting in building software to run a car than manufacturing the vehicle itself. Apple secured a permit in April to test autonomous vehicles in California and has recruited dozens of auto experts . It has also registered several domain names, such as apple.car and apple.auto.

Registered developers can download the update by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software using iTunes. Due to the installation requirements, tvOS betas are only available for developers, so tvOS 10.2.2 will not be publicly available until the finalized version of the software is released. No major feature changes or bug fixes were discovered in the first two betas of tvOS 10.2.2, and it appears to focus on minor under-the-hood improvements and security enhancements. tvOS 10.2.2 will be one of the last updates to the tvOS 10 operating system as Apple is already working on the next-generation version of tvOS, tvOS 11.

Registered developers can download the watchOS 3.2.3 update through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General --> Software Update. For the beta to be installed, the Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it has to be in range of the iPhone. Apple restricts watchOS betas to developers because there’s no way to downgrade software on an Apple Watch. Non-developers will need to wait for the public release to get the update. No notable features or bug fixes were discovered in the first two betas of watchOS 3.2.3, suggesting the update focuses primarily on under-the-hood improvements. watchOS 3.2.3 is likely to be one of the last updates to the watchOS 3 operating system, as Apple has shifted its focus to the next-generation version of watchOS, watchOS 4.

If you already have the macOS Sierra beta installed, head to Mac App Store > Updates and download away. If you've been waiting for beta 3 to start testing macOS 10.12.6, keep reading and we'll walk you through the setup! macOS Sierra is coming this fall with plenty of awesome new features that developers can take advantage of in their apps; as such, Apple is releasing early beta software so that developers can make their apps work seamlessly when the full operating system launches to the public. Apple occasionally offers updates to iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS as closed developer previews or public betas for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac (sadly, no public beta for the Apple Watch). While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device. That's why we strongly recommend staying away from developer previews unless you need them for software development, and using the public betas with caution. If you depend on your devices, wait for the final release. How to make an archived backup of your Mac How to download the macOS Sierra developer beta How to install the macOS Sierra developer beta How to get started with the macOS Sierra developer beta How to make an archived backup of your Mac with Time Machine Before you begin, make sure you back up your Mac. The download and installation process is fairly easy, but any time you make significant changes to your computer, you risk problems.

Connect an external hard disk or Time Capsule with a USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt cable. Click on the Apple icon () in the upper left corner of your screen. Select System Preferences... from the dropdown menu. Select Time Machine in the System Preferences window. Turn the Time Machine slider On. Click Select Backup Disk and choose the disk you'd like to use. Time Machine will format the hard drive for backups and start within two minutes.

Mavericks had the green button to just "maximize" the window instead of entering fullscreen, and had that icon in the top right to take you into fullscreen separately: http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/46/4e/6c/464e6c0c-e2b0-c2a4-062... -1 10 months ago Reply azguy Yes, except Mavericks never had a true Maximize button. Unfortunately, the Mac has never had a true Maximize button. The green button used to be a zoom button which would attempt to scale to the content. (A neat idea but not a maximize replacement) Linux and Windows both have a Maximize button and the lack of one on the Mac can be very frustrating for switchers. I switched back in 2008 and I still miss the Maximize function. As a teacher I know hundreds of other switchers who also miss the Maximize function from Linux and Windows. The graphic gives users the best of all the platforms: - A zoom or scale the window to the content function. - A full screen function. - A true Maximize function which the Mac has never had. 0 10 months ago Reply Matty As soon as i get my Samsung SSD to replace my HDD, ill be loading up Mac OS Sierra :D Going to bring new life to my Macbook Pro! :D 2 10 months ago Reply Quis89 Am I missing something on iMore lately?

Seems they released both developer and public beta at the same time. There must have been some major issue(s) to do that. I know I was having some issues with Wi-Fi and the Internet after beta 3. Pages were either taking forever to render or they were getting hung up and not loading at all. We reset the modem 3 times but that had no effect. And it only the Macbook Pro that was having the issue. All 4 iPhones in the house worked perfectly as did everything else on WiFi. So I suspect it was a problem with beta 3. Not an issue however...that's what beta programs are all about. I'll see if the WiFi issue is handled in beta 4. 1 5 months ago Reply wezra Just got it for public beta as well. 1 3 months ago Reply Jude526 I just got my Mac Pro a week ago. Love it.

Large investors, whose high exposure to large-cap technology stocks boosted their returns during the first quarter of the year, are doubling down on their investments even as stocks like Apple Inc and Facebook Inc stumble. Fund managers such as T Rowe Price and Federated Investors, who were already overweight the sector, said they were buying beaten-down so-called 'FANG' stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com Inc , Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - during a two-day selloff that marked the largest tech sector decline in nearly a year. Google, Apple and other large tech stocks rose modestly in morning trading Tuesday. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund, said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy. With other secular growth stories hard to find, "It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'" he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines. Analysts expect the S&P 500 technology index to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including Qualcomm Inc and International Business Machines Corp, which have lagged in 2017. "This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity," said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc, Applied Materials Inc , Arista Networks Inc and STMicroelectronics NV . In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing. COMEBACK OF THE 'TRUMP TRADE?' The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs. That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring. In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund. Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple. Momentum-based technology stocks have "built a valuation air pocket underneath creating cause for pause," Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday. Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year. Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged. "It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done," he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.

Apple still isn't making any promises about whether it will release a self-driving car in the future, but the company's CEO Tim Cook recently acknowledged that the company is working on the brains of one. During an interview with Bloomberg Television's Emily Chang at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, Tim Cook said the Cupertino tech giant is currently working on what it believes to be "the mother of all AI projects." "You've said cars are an area ripe for disruption," Chang says. "How important is it that Apple not miss out on cars?" "I think there is a major disruption looming there," Cook begins. "Not only for self-driving cars, but also the electrification piece. If you've driven an all-electric car it's actually a marvelous experience… Plus, you have ridesharing on top of this, so you've got… three vectors of change happening, generally, in the same time frame." He goes on to say that Apple is "focusing on autonomous systems." Related Apple's Project Titan Is Not About Building a Car Apple's Project Titan Is Not About Building a Car "Clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars," Cook says. "There are others." He adds that "autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us, but we'll see where it takes us. We're not really saying, from a product point of view, what we will do, but we are being straightforward that it's a core technology that we view as very important." Bloomberg in October reported that Apple had "drastically scaled back" its car team, cutting hundreds of jobs. Cupertino is now focused on creating software rather than an actual vehicle, Bloomberg said at the time, so it can potentially partner with existing carmakers. That followed a September report from the New York Times, which said Apple had "laid off dozens" of people as it cut back its car effort, dubbed Project Titan.

However, it seems Google is looking to get even more serious about its smartphones after a new report claims that the company has hired a chip architect from Apple. For some background, Apple develops all of its hardware in-house, and then uses a manufacturing firm to create the devices before making their way to the hands of millions. This includes the processors used in the iPhone, as Apple doesn’t use chips from the likes of Qualcomm like many other OEM’s do. Manu Gulati has been working with Apple on its processors for the last 8 years and hopes to help Google progress its own smartphones to be more Apple-like. This may not be the best comparison to use, but you could also look at it as a comparison to Samsung with its Exynos lineup of processors. According to the same report, Google has also opened up more than a few job opportunities so that it can “tightly control future Pixel hardware”. Hopefully, Google follows through on this move and ends up producing its own processors as it would be an interesting look to the current scenery of Android smartphones, many of which are powered by Qualcomm SoCs.

But the tech giant is late to the game and may have to blow through a lot of cash to catch up. Investors could punish Apple if the company doesn't deliver a worthy self-driving product. Now we finally know that the Apple car won't be an actual car, based on CEO Tim Cook's revelation to Bloomberg's Emily Chang. Instead, Apple is working on self-driving technology based on artificial intelligence. "We're focusing on autonomous systems," Cook told Chang in an interview last week. "It's a core technology that we view as very important. ... We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects." With this news, the big Silicon Valley pivot away from building a brave new type of car, and its reversion to what the tech industry does best, is complete. Google has retired its podmobiles and will henceforth work with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on commercializing its autonomous systems. Wall Street analysts have decided it would be foolish to invest in Tesla as a carmaker and that they would rather buy into its market cap of more than $50 billion to see if CEO Elon Musk can create an all-new mobility/data business. You could read Apple's announcement in two ways. The first is that it's a company that authentically wants to get in on the disruption of the transportation industry you've likely been hearing about, mostly because Silicon Valley never stops talking about it. The second is that it's a white flag of surrender. If Cook is for real and Apple will dive into autonomous and electrified vehicles, the tech giant is so far behind that investors would pummel the company if it blew through significant cash trying to catch up. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Brendan McDermid/Reuters Video: Mystery Self-Driving Car Spotted In East Bay May Be Apple Project It's the optimist's view and the pessimist's view. For popular consumption, Cook is, of course, going to talk up Apple's transportation efforts, despite the lack of any meaningful engagement on this front beyond Apple CarPlay. The main Silicon Valley company deeply involved in transportation, Tesla, has seen a nearly 70% appreciation in its share price over the first six months of 2017. That's impossible to avoid. And yet unlike Steve Jobs, who had a simple plan for making people happy with easy-to-use computers and sexy entertainment-oriented devices, Cook has adopted the technocratic lingo of engineered futurism that now defines the conversation about transportation tech. It sounds good, but the tech is far from hitting the streets. "You've got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame," Cook told Chang, speaking of autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and ride-hailing. What Cook means is that you have three relatively new (compared with Apple) buzzy tech firms making major noise about those ideas: Google, Tesla, and Uber. Daimler It's frankly odd that Apple would be seriously thinking about getting in on this action. If the company — at its core a design firm — wanted to do cars, it should have just done cars. Tesla has shown that a seat-of-the-pants automaker can be created in the 21st century. But Apple serially botched everything about doing a car and ended up killing what was the original Project Titan to pursue this different, wonkier concept. It's even more baffling that Apple would go all hot-and-heavy on AI when the biggest opportunity for it to disrupt an industry would be TVs. It's entirely questionable whether anyone would want to buy an Apple car or related services. But many folks would most likely want to buy a proper Apple TV, as opposed to the streaming box the company currently makes. Or maybe a cynic? Then again, we've seen this movie before. Cook has been an able steward of Apple's legacy, but he also hasn't been able to launch that new, world-changing product yet — and every year he doesn't, Apple must rely more on the cash-cow iPhone. The cynic in me says Cook is just talking up mobility because investors are excited about the prospects of self-driving cars, and an Apple CEO's embracing the idea sends a stock-price-boosting signal. (He did share the news with Bloomberg, after all.) The realist says Apple will get out of its depth here and could start to shift into capital-destruction mode. The car business is notoriously volatile and capital-intensive. For Apple to enter it at any level more intensely than it has so far could be ruinous.

It goes from that shiny new gizmo to a gadget with odd smudges and a buildup of dust. Let’s get precious looking good again, shall we? This guide will be especially useful if you are in the market for a used laptop or looking to sell one. You’ll be able to drive the price up if the notebook looks like it’s well taken care of, so give it a good cleaning outside when you also format the hard drive 4 Things You MUST Do When Selling or Giving Away Your Old Computer, Phone or Tablet 4 Things You MUST Do When Selling or Giving Away Your Old Computer, Phone or Tablet Here’s a fun thing I like to do: buy an old hard drive on eBay, then run recovery software on it. It’s a little data treasure hunt, and you’ll be amazed at what you can... Read More . What You Will Need The items you need to clean a laptop are easy to find and cost very little. Chances are, you probably already have them. Microfiber cloths — I used 3M’s Scotch Brite mirror cleaning cloth, but other users on the internet have had success with spectacles-cleaning microfiber cloths as well as soft towel-like microfiber cloths. Get as large a pack as you can, we’ll go through at least 10 of them in this guide. Yes, it’s a bit overkill, but these microfiber cloths are cheap. Distilled/filtered water — No, you don’t need any fancy cleaning solutions. Filtered water will usually get the job done. Even Apple recommends using clean, dirt-free water. Spray bottle — That water needs to go into a spray bottle. Any standard bottle with a spray will do. You could even repurpose an old cleaning bottle. Disinfecting wipes — Any standard set of disinfecting wipes will do, as long as they don’t contain bleach, says Orange County Public Schools [PDF]. Get scented ones if you want your Macbook to smell lemony fresh. Cotton swabs — You can use a standard pack of Q-tips, even the ones that you already have. Squeeze blower — These hand-squeezed blowers are mostly used for cameras. Again, go with any brand you like. Just don’t use a hair dryer, electric air blower, or anything that is going to blow hot air or air at high speed. Compressed air can — You’ll need a can of compressed air to blow off all the dirt. Remember, compressed air only! (Optional) Rubbing alcohol — Get a standard bottle of isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol. You probably won’t need it, but in case your screen has some serious gunk, this will help you clean it. What You Will Not Need You’ll find plenty of guides online talking about disinfectant sprays, aerosol cans, and specialized cleaning solutions. Disregard everything. In cleaning guides, HP and Apple both recommend only using compressed air and no aerosol sprays. In fact, Apple explicitly states, “Don’t use aerosol sprays, solvents, abrasives, or cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide that might damage the finish.” Advertisement More importantly, as this guide will show, it’s just a waste of your money. You don’t need any of those elements. Switch It Off! Before you start cleaning, the first thing you need to do is to remove anything plugged into the laptop and power it down completely. No, not sleep mode. You need to shut it down. Step 1: Cleaning the Shell In this guide, we will cover laptops with both plastic bodies (like most HP and Dell laptops) as well as aluminum bodies (like MacBooks). The material makes a slight difference. Start by shutting the lid of your laptop. Then use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe the outside. What’s “damp” you ask? Grab that spray bottle and fill some water in it. Spray the water lightly (a couple of sprays, not more) on one side of your microfiber cloth. Make sure there is no excess water (i.e. it isn’t wet or dripping). Don’t go up-down or side-to-side. The proper way to clean a laptop is in circular strokes. This avoids streaks and doesn’t put undue pressure on edges. Pro Tip: Don’t use your hand to apply pressure. This can damage the body if you inadvertently apply too much pressure. Instead, use your fingers for pressure, and only move in circular patterns. Do the same thing on the bottom of the laptop, and the sides. Avoid the open ports and the charging port! Don’t take your damp cloth anywhere near it. We’ll go into details about the ports in a bit. Finally, use a cotton swab to clean all the nooks and crannies that the microfiber cloth is missing. You’ll need it for any grooves or corners, since you weren’t applying pressure there with the cloth. Step 2: Cleaning the Keyboard and Trackpad Grab a fresh microfiber cloth and clean the trackpad, again in circular patterns. Next comes the tough part, the keyboard. In case you didn’t know, your keyboard is the dirtiest part of your laptop. This is why you need the disinfectant wipes. First, use the squeeze blower on the keyboard. If you have a chiclet keyboard (like with MacBooks), this won’t do much. If you have an open keyboard (you can see the dust below the keys), this will blow out a lot of dust. Make sure you angle the blower in one direction, and use it in that direction only. Next, grab a new microfiber cloth and run it over all the keys to drag up any loose dust on them. We’ll call this one the “dust microfiber” — keep it handy, you’ll need it again later. Then, clean each key with a disinfectant wipe, changing the wipes as they get dirty. Be gentle! Your keyboard doesn’t need too much force. Once you’re done disinfecting, take a new microfiber cloth. Like with the shell, make it damp with some sprayed water and clean all the keys. Again, be gentle, but get all the sides. Step 3: Cleaning the Ports For the open ports on the laptop, first use the squeeze blower to blow out any dust in those. Be careful, you don’t need to go nuts here. Next, use a cotton swab and gently clean the insides as much as you can. Don’t apply any pressure at all! These parts of the laptop are quite fragile, and the slightest pressure can affect the tiny pins here. After the squeeze blower and cotton swab have taken out most of the dust, and only if you spot more dust in the ports, then use the compressed air can to clean it up. Remember, compressed air cans should be used at an angle. Step 4: Cleaning the Screen This is the part of your cleaning expedition where you have to be the most careful. Before you start, know one thing. If you press too hard on a panel, you might end up with a dead pixel on your screen, so be gentle at this stage. Depending on the laptop, it will have either a TN or IPS panel for the LCD screen. Without getting into the jargon, TN panels are a little more fragile, while IPS panels usually have a glass protection panel. Pro Tip: To clean the laptop’s screen, flip it on its back. Find a stable, flat surface and place your laptop screen’s back on it, so that your keyboard is in the air. As Tom Strong Reviews points out, this lets you apply gentle pressure on the screen without having the screen go back with your force. Once it’s in position, start off with your trusty “dust microfiber” to wipe away all the excess dust on the screen. Run it lightly around the four edges by folding it and resting the corner against the screen. Do not stick your finger in the microfiber and run it along the edges. To get the edges, use a cotton swab again. Next, like with the earlier steps, dampen a new microfiber cloth with a few sprays of distilled water, and again, wipe the screen in concentric circles. Like with the dust microfiber, fold it and use the corner to lightly run around the edges. In 90 percent of cases, this will clean up your screen. In case it doesn’t, you’ll need that rubbing/isopropyl alcohol, since it is effective in cleaning LCD monitors The Best Way To Effectively Clean LCD Monitor Screens The Best Way To Effectively Clean LCD Monitor Screens Read More . Mix equal parts rubbing alcohol and water in the spray bottle, dampen a new microfiber cloth (yup, you’ll need a new one), and clean the screen like earlier. This mixture is more effective than plain water at cleaning up gunk. Step 5: Cleaning the Fans and Insides That takes care of the outside, but you might need to clean the insides too. No matter what, you need to clean dust from the fans or heat ducts. It’s a good way to fix an overheating laptop How To Fix An Overheating Laptop How To Fix An Overheating Laptop The greatest threat for your laptop, except for your your coffee mug, is overheating. It can cause hardware failure and permanent damage. Read More . For Laptops That Open Some laptops have a bottom panel that opens up. Take apart a few screws and you’ll see the guts of your machine. If your laptop allows for that, use the manufacturer’s manual to open it up. It’s the same procedure as what you would do when upgrading the RAM of your laptop. Warning: This will most likely void your warranty. Once the laptop is open, use the can of compressed air to blow all the dust. Don’t stick the tip of the straw all the way inside, that can damage some components. And don’t touch the fans at all. Blow as much as you can, and try to blow in the direction of the exhaust vents. For Laptops That Don’t Open In case your laptop doesn’t open, like most MacBooks, then your cleaning job is simpler. Aim the can of compressed air at the exhaust vents of the laptop and let it rip. Remember, no direct contact, but put in as much air as you can. Enjoy Your Clean Laptop! That’s it! By the end of this exercise, your laptop should be looking as good as new. It’s a good idea to keep using those microfiber cloths regularly to clean up the laptop rather than wait till it gathers so much gunk again. The screen, especially, should be cleaned regularly.

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bull trend has weathered a mid-June market whipsaw punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is digesting its FAANG-fueled key reversal — a bearish technical pattern — while the Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and S&P MidCap 400 rattle the cage on uncharted territory. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.22%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has thus far absorbed the mid-June whipsaw. Last week’s low (2,415.7) closely matched near-term support. The successful retest of support, and close within the former range, is constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop has strengthened. The blue-chip benchmark has reached record territory, and pulled in modestly. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of the 21,115 support. The Dow notched consecutive session lows last week within three points. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.47%  has staged a massive two-session downdraft, plunging to the range bottom from all-time highs. Notable support spans from 6,164 to 6,170, an area matching the mid-May breakout point, illustrated below. The index closed Monday at 6,175, and has thus far maintained the range bottom on a closing basis. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has formed a key reversal, a bearish technical pattern, detailed Monday. The downturn has thus far concluded with a successful test of the breakout point, circa 6,164. Tactically, this area is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 6,068, and a deeper floor nominally under the 6,000 mark. An eventual violation would mark a “lower low” likely inflicting consequential damage. Recall that the striking June plunge resembles the bearish March 21 downdraft. Though the prevailing downturn has been more aggressive, the mid-March plunge failed to follow through lower. A one-month consolidation phase was punctuated by the April gap higher. Amid the Nasdaq’s two-day downdraft, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing record territory. The Dow’s record close (21,271.97) and absolute all-time high (21,305.35) — both established Friday — remain firmly within view. The prevailing breakout attempt punctuates a successful test of support — the Dow 21,115 area — also illustrated on the hourly chart. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Despite last week’s whipsaw, the S&P has maintained the June range, and remains within striking distance of record highs. The bigger picture As detailed above, technical cross currents have surfaced against a still bullish intermediate-term technical backdrop. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite digests its worst two-session plunge since September. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -0.51% is pressing uncharted territory. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (141.61) and absolute record peak (142.90) — both established Friday — remain under siege. Slightly more broadly, the June rallies have been directionally sharp, fueled by volume spikes, and punctuated by comparably flat pullbacks. A firmly-grounded breakout attempt is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is rattling the cage on a breakout. The MDY briefly tagged all-time highs Friday, and Monday’s close also registered as a fractional record. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from tight six-month ranges, and positioned for potentially material longer-term follow-through. Combined, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 have each registered an all-time closing high within the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has staged a massive bearish reversal, plunging to three-week lows. Its downturn has thus far inflicted limited damage, in the broad sweep, though the technology-fueled selloff can broaden, and is worth tracking for follow-through. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained the June range. Tactically, the S&P’s 2,405 breakout point marks important support, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 2,388. Delving deeper, the May low (2,352) likely defines a last-ditch floor. The S&P’s intermediate-term technical bias remains bullish barring a violation. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish-leaning as partly detailed in the next section. See also: Bull trend confirmed, S&P 500 sustains break to ‘clear skies’ territory. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. FAANG-fueled downdraft stirs healthy sector rotation Drilling down further, the prevailing FAANG-fueled downdraft — the downturn in technology bellwethers Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) — has thus far been punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Consider the traditional sector leaders: the technology sector, transports and financials. To start, the Technology Select Sector SPDR has plunged from nearly 17-year highs amid a sustained volume spike. In the process, the group has ventured under first support matching the breakout point (56.00). Still, a deeper floor closely matches the May low, circa 54.40, and the 50-day moving average. A posture higher preserves the group’s series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” — signaling an uptrend — and a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. The initial retest of the 50-day has concluded with a respectable intraday reversal, and close near session highs. Meanwhile, the transports have ticked higher amid the technology sector’s downturn. Late last month, the group cleared the 50-day moving average — a recent bull-bear inflection point — rising toward the range top. More broadly, the prevailing six-month range is pinned to the steep 2016 rally, illustrated on the four-year chart. This is a bullish longer-term backdrop. A break from the range top opens the path to uncharted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Similarly, the Financial Select Sector SDPR, profiled last week, has come to life technically. As illustrated, the group has placed distance atop the 50-day moving average, breaking decisively from a three-month range. Here again, the June upturn punctuates a continuation pattern, pinned to the steep 2016 rally. Other sectors rising amid the June cross currents include the materials,homebuilders and health care sector. Collectively, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains rotational and technically constructive. See added sector detail: Nasdaq’s FANG-fueled key reversal masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. Moving to specific names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.53% — initially profiled Aug. 5 — has returned 20.4% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.2%.) As illustrated, the prevailing downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, placing the shares 4.5% under the June peak. Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 68.30, has defined the intermediate-term uptrend, and a posture higher supports a bullish technical bias. Microsoft is the third-largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Meanwhile, Apple, Inc. AAPL, -0.60% initially profiled Dec. 9, has returned 27.6%. Here, the June downturn has been slightly more aggressive. The shares have violated support matching a one-month range bottom, and the 50-day moving average, currently 148.60. Still, Apple’s second session lower — the violation of the 50-day moving average — was fueled by an analyst downgrade. Analyst-driven moves are frequently one-day wonders. Tactically, the shares have thus far maintained firmer support matching the May breakout point, circa 144.50. This area offers a last-ditch technical floor from which to work, and a posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. Apple is the largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Finally, Micron Technology MU, -1.61%  is a well positioned large-cap semiconductor name. Technically, the June downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, circa 29.40. Bullish price action. Separately, the 50-day moving average has recently defined the trend, and is rising toward support. Micron’s path of least resistance technically points higher barring a violation. Micron was initially profiled Aug. 2.

Apple is working on the "autonomous systems" behind driverless cars, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview published by Bloomberg on Tuesday, in his most detailed comments about the company's secretive plans. The technology giant has been tight-lipped on any of its autonomous vehicle plans, despite numerous reports that it has been researching them under codename "Project Titan". Cook's comments illustrate that Apple is working on the software behind the vehicle. "We're focusing on autonomous systems. And clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems are self-driving cars. There are others," Cook said in an interview with Bloomberg on June 5, that appears to have been published Tuesday. "And we sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on and so autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us, but we'll see where it takes us." Cook made clear that the company is not ready to say what exactly they will do from a "product point of view". "But we are being straightforward that it's a core technology that we view as very important," the CEO added. Despite Apple trying to keep its project under wraps, some of its test cars have been spotted. A white Lexus RX450h SUV was seen in April sporting a number of sensors and cameras. That same month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple permission to test autonomous cars on roads around the state. Cook's comments mirror a letter that it submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) towards the end of last year about its car plans, which also gave a large hint that software was the main focus."The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple said in a letter dated Nov. 22. tags #Apple #Current Affairs #Project Titan #world Related news Business Delhi's Connaught Place 9th most expensive office market in the world: Survey Jun 16, 2017 12:20 PM Trends 7 airlines impose fly-ban on TDP MP Diwakar Reddy; Centre too steps in Jun 16, 2017 12:03 PM Business Maharashtra agri loan to exclude those getting income from other sources Jun 16, 2017 11:40 AM Business Last month was second hottest May on record: NASA Jun 16, 2017 11:34 AM Business Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju orders probe into Vizag airport row Jun 16, 2017 10:58 AM Business Tinkering with MTC will hit rural telecom network: Vodafone Jun 16, 2017 08:30 AM Business Indian businesses take part in International Expo in Astana Jun 16, 2017 08:30 AM India Companies offer pre-GST discounts to clear stock Jun 16, 2017 08:08 AM Business This day, that year: Nation bids adieu to 'deshbandhu' Chittaranjan Das Jun 16, 2017 07:48 AM News Most Popular Top News Summer effect: These 7 cos post their best earnings show in the June quarter Wholesale inflation falls sharply to 2.1% in May as food prices crash Are advertisers losing the game to adblockers, again?

By Gaurav Sharma Updated June 13, 2017 17:58 BST The 'leaf' on the logo of Apple store turns green to welcome the World Earth Day on April 20, 2016 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province of ChinaVCG/Getty Images Apple has issued a $1bn (£784m) bond offer on Tuesday (13 June), the proceeds of which would be used to finance clean energy and environmental initiatives. In a statement issued by the technology giant's investor relations office, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said the objective was to take a leadership role in tackling the issue of climate change. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet," she added. Jackson also said the green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord Paris climate agreement, that President Donald Trump withdrew the US from earlier this month, ignoring the pleas of several American corporate chief executives, including Apple's boss Tim Cook. The funds raised from Apple's bond offer will be deployed to finance "renewable energy and energy efficiency" at the company's facilities. Apple also said it would step up its efforts towards making its supply chain more sustainable, and double up its drive to use recycled material, thereby reducing its need to mine rare earth minerals. The company has form when it comes to issuing green bonds. In 2016, Apple issued its first green bond of $1.5bn with similar objectives. The offer was the largest green bond issued by any US company, in a market that is worth $81bn, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television recorded at last week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Cook admitted, “We’re focusing on autonomous [driving] systems.” Looking into his crystal ball, Cook says there’s a “major disruption looming” for the automotive industry, thanks to ride sharing, self-driving technology, and electric vehicles, which he described as a “marvellous experience”. For Apple, Cook believes self-driving vehicle systems are a “core technology that we view as very important” and described the challenge as “the mother of all AI projects”. When speaking about whether the company was looking to produce its own car, the Apple CEO was less forthcoming, simply saying: “We’ll see where it takes us. We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Although Apple’s work in this field is about as a secret as the fact that WWE isn’t a real sporting competition, this is the first time a senior executive from the typically secretive firm has publicly discussed its self-driving technology efforts. Known internally as Project Titan since 2014, news has been circulating about Apple’s autonomous vehicle ambitions for a few years now, with reports indicating it was initially planning to develop its own self-driving electric car. At one stage, the project was being worked on by up to 1000 engineers. Late last year, though, sources told Bloomberg Apple had scaled back the project to focus on underlying autonomous vehicle technology because of spiralling costs, management changes and departures from the engineering team. Above: An early Apple development mule. Within the last year, the company has gained approval to test its autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in the US. In December, a letter emerged from Apple to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), where the company sought clarification about the agency’s reporting requirements. More recently, Apple asked the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to relax its public reporting requirements. Established automakers, parts suppliers, and Silicon Valley companies, including Google and Uber, are all busy working on autonomous vehicles and self-drving car technology.

In what cannot be a coincidence, the quintet all fell concurrently – albeit to varying degrees – raising questions over whether a repeat of the dotcom bubble is potentially in the offing. FAANG's precipitous decline commenced the morning of June 9 the second markets reopened, with all five sliding synchronously. In some cases the falls were historically savage — Netflix had fallen by nine percent by close of trading on Monday (June 12), while Apple was down over six percent. While initially investors were anxious their simultaneous slide may be symptomatic of a wider market correction, by the end of the day it was clear the drop was restricted largely to these stocks — producing fresh panic about the viability of the tech sector. Friday FAANG blood bath: — FB down 3.28% — AMZN down 3.16% — AAPL down 3.88% — NFLX down 4.73% — GOOG down 3.4%https://t.co/BxhDeNPCAh — MarketWatch (@MarketWatch) June 9, 2017 ​While it's arguable their sudden decline was partially inspired by a market note released by Goldman Sachs the day prior, which suggested investors were overly reliant on the group for growth, the tech sector's fortunes have more generally declined since FAANG's flop — despite there being no tangible developments to explain the fall. For example, the NASDAQ 100, a stock market index dominated by tech firms, has been falling as a whole ever since Friday (June 9) too. Moreover, the market note made a potentially troubling historic comparison. FANG or FAAMG vs 1999 Tech bubble. #GOLDMANSACHS pic.twitter.com/iytSC8e5kn — Topslicer (@Kellyism09) June 13, 2017 ​"Perhaps most remarkable is the outperformance of stocks with strong balance sheets alongside a rallying equity market and extremely easy financial conditions. Our basket of S&P 500 firms with strong balance sheets has outperformed our weak balance sheet basket (GSTHWBAL) by 520 basis points during the last six months. Strong balance sheet outperformance in a 10%+ equity market rally is rare, occurring in only 5% of six-month stretches in the last 30 years. One notable episode was in 2000, at the Tech Bubble peak…" the note said. While the past is no guide to the future, one of the world's largest investment banks noting echoes of a major financial collapse in the present market should certainly be a cause for concern. The dotcom bubble, which inflated between 1997 and 2000 before collapsing spectacularly in 2001, resulted in losses of over US$5 trillion and has become a byword for reckless speculation, irrational investor exuberance about unproven and/or unprofitable business models. Goldman Sachs stacks up the "FAAMG" stocks against the dotcom bubble. pic.twitter.com/GdP7cG8SCf — Robin Wigglesworth (@RobinWigg) June 9, 2017 ​Admittedly, the tech market 2000 was a very different beast to now. Then, shares could double or triple in price in a single day, a company adding ".com" to its name would automatically add billions to its value, and businesses that had never turned a profit and/or hemorrhaged money would post record IPOs almost daily. In 2017, most publicly listed tech firms are profitable — highly so. In 2016 alone, Apple generated cash revenues of around US$125 every minute of every day of the year, Google is projected to grow its earnings at a double-digit rate and Amazon is continuing to seize market share from almost literally every traditional retailer. Nonetheless, the market is still arguably overvalued — in some cases significantly. Scores of tech firms have reached "unicorn" status, being valued at over US$1 billion. Some are "mega-unicorns" — companies that have surpassed the US$10 billion mark. Controversial "ride sharing" app Uber is valued at over US$60 billion and AirBNB at around US$30 billion. Given such unrealistic projections of worth, it's perhaps unsurprising a May Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers suggest around three quarters believe tech stocks are expensive and/or bubble-like.  [#Media] Snapchat Woos Advertisers with Discount Coupons after Poor Revenues | #Ads #IPO #Marketing https://t.co/q5ClaJdXow pic.twitter.com/HlqFLMlFCL — Marie Tournier (@marie_tournier) May 31, 2017 ​Despite this, investors still seemingly refuse to learn the lessons of the past. Photo sharing social media platform Snapchat — which generates revenues of US$300 million annually — went public in March, valued at US$29 billion. While analysts suggested the loss-making company could go on to become the next Facebook, the same was said about Twitter and LinkedIn, which are arguably two tech failure stories. Other similarly loss-making firms such as Pinterest, Dropbox and Spotify, are also scheduled to publicly list on stock exchanges in 2017. It may take just one launch failing miserably to cause the tech bubble's 2.0 incarnation to calamitously pop. ...

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Jun 14, 2017 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple’s Tim Cook talks automobiles Bloomberg After years toiling away in secret on its car project, Apple Inc chief executive officer Tim Cook has for the first time laid out exactly what the company is up to in the automotive market: It is concentrating on self-driving technology. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Monday last week. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects,” Cook said in his most detailed comments to date on Apple’s plans in the car space. “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.” Apple had initially been seeking to build its own car, before recalibrating those ambitions last year to prioritize the underlying technology for autonomous driving, Bloomberg News reported. The iPhone maker had hired more than 1,000 engineers to work on Project Titan, as the car team is known internally, after it started in 2014. Ballooning costs and headcount led to Apple veteran Bob Mansfield being given the reins of the team last year. Cook has never before openly outlined Apple’s plans, although public filings have surfaced in recent months that provided snapshots of Apple’s efforts. Apple in April secured a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test three self-driving sports-utility vehicles, photographs of which emerged several weeks later. A half-dozen vehicles had been surreptitiously testing the autonomous technology on public roads in and around the San Francisco Bay area for at least a year, according to someone familiar with Project Titan. In December last year, Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, penned a letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealing the company’s interest in automotive technology. It became public when it was published on a federal Web site. In the letter, Kenner wrote about the company’s excitement surrounding the potential for automated systems in fields like transportation. “There is a major disruption looming there,” Cook said on Bloomberg TV, citing self-driving technology, electric vehicles and ride-hailing. “You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame.” In the interview on Bloomberg TV, Cook was hesitant to disclose whether Apple will ultimately manufacture its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” This story has been viewed 1423 times.

Bears Slash At Leaders; Stock Indexes Trim Losses (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has for many years made it clear it wants to play some role in the auto industry, but the company has shied away from offering any specifics — until now. After years of operating in mystery, Apple's CEO Tim Cook for the first time ever explained Apple's vision. Speaking to Bloomberg Television in early June, the executive said the company's main focus is on "autonomous systems," which includes self driving cars and other un-named initiatives. Some of the more ambitious rumors over the year consisted of Apple developing and selling its own branded, car but others suggested that the company was looking to merely dominate the "infotainment" aspect of the driving experience. In the meantime, Cook isn't offering any details from a product point of view for what it will eventually make and sell. Nevertheless, the focus on autonomous systems represents "the mother of all artificial intelligence projects," Cook emphasized. "It's a core technology that we view as very important." What Else Is Known? While Apple can operate in secrecy, no company can hide from the general public, a separate Bloomberg report noted. For instance, a white Lexus RX450h SUV was spotted exiting a known Apple facility in April. There was no need to speculate at the time, as Apple was granted approval from the California Department of Motor to operate three autonomous vehicles on public streets. A source close to Apple's secretive car unit dubbed Project Titan told Bloomberg that six vehicles have been in operation on public roads near the San Francisco Bay area for at least a year. Perhaps for some this raises more questions than answers, particularly what's next for Apple. "We'll see where it takes us," Cook added in his interview. "We're not really saying from a product point of view what we will do."

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bull trend has weathered a mid-June market whipsaw punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is digesting its FAANG-fueled key reversal — a bearish technical pattern — while the Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and S&P MidCap 400 rattle the cage on uncharted territory. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.22%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has thus far absorbed the mid-June whipsaw. Last week’s low (2,415.7) closely matched near-term support. The successful retest of support, and close within the former range, is constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop has strengthened. The blue-chip benchmark has reached record territory, and pulled in modestly. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of the 21,115 support. The Dow notched consecutive session lows last week within three points. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.47%  has staged a massive two-session downdraft, plunging to the range bottom from all-time highs. Notable support spans from 6,164 to 6,170, an area matching the mid-May breakout point, illustrated below. The index closed Monday at 6,175, and has thus far maintained the range bottom on a closing basis. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has formed a key reversal, a bearish technical pattern, detailed Monday. The downturn has thus far concluded with a successful test of the breakout point, circa 6,164. Tactically, this area is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 6,068, and a deeper floor nominally under the 6,000 mark. An eventual violation would mark a “lower low” likely inflicting consequential damage. Recall that the striking June plunge resembles the bearish March 21 downdraft. Though the prevailing downturn has been more aggressive, the mid-March plunge failed to follow through lower. A one-month consolidation phase was punctuated by the April gap higher. Amid the Nasdaq’s two-day downdraft, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing record territory. The Dow’s record close (21,271.97) and absolute all-time high (21,305.35) — both established Friday — remain firmly within view. The prevailing breakout attempt punctuates a successful test of support — the Dow 21,115 area — also illustrated on the hourly chart. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Despite last week’s whipsaw, the S&P has maintained the June range, and remains within striking distance of record highs. The bigger picture As detailed above, technical cross currents have surfaced against a still bullish intermediate-term technical backdrop. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite digests its worst two-session plunge since September. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -0.51% is pressing uncharted territory. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (141.61) and absolute record peak (142.90) — both established Friday — remain under siege. Slightly more broadly, the June rallies have been directionally sharp, fueled by volume spikes, and punctuated by comparably flat pullbacks. A firmly-grounded breakout attempt is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is rattling the cage on a breakout. The MDY briefly tagged all-time highs Friday, and Monday’s close also registered as a fractional record. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from tight six-month ranges, and positioned for potentially material longer-term follow-through. Combined, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 have each registered an all-time closing high within the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has staged a massive bearish reversal, plunging to three-week lows. Its downturn has thus far inflicted limited damage, in the broad sweep, though the technology-fueled selloff can broaden, and is worth tracking for follow-through. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained the June range. Tactically, the S&P’s 2,405 breakout point marks important support, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 2,388. Delving deeper, the May low (2,352) likely defines a last-ditch floor. The S&P’s intermediate-term technical bias remains bullish barring a violation. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish-leaning as partly detailed in the next section. See also: Bull trend confirmed, S&P 500 sustains break to ‘clear skies’ territory. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. FAANG-fueled downdraft stirs healthy sector rotation Drilling down further, the prevailing FAANG-fueled downdraft — the downturn in technology bellwethers Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) — has thus far been punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Consider the traditional sector leaders: the technology sector, transports and financials. To start, the Technology Select Sector SPDR has plunged from nearly 17-year highs amid a sustained volume spike. In the process, the group has ventured under first support matching the breakout point (56.00). Still, a deeper floor closely matches the May low, circa 54.40, and the 50-day moving average. A posture higher preserves the group’s series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” — signaling an uptrend — and a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. The initial retest of the 50-day has concluded with a respectable intraday reversal, and close near session highs. Meanwhile, the transports have ticked higher amid the technology sector’s downturn. Late last month, the group cleared the 50-day moving average — a recent bull-bear inflection point — rising toward the range top. More broadly, the prevailing six-month range is pinned to the steep 2016 rally, illustrated on the four-year chart. This is a bullish longer-term backdrop. A break from the range top opens the path to uncharted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Similarly, the Financial Select Sector SDPR, profiled last week, has come to life technically. As illustrated, the group has placed distance atop the 50-day moving average, breaking decisively from a three-month range. Here again, the June upturn punctuates a continuation pattern, pinned to the steep 2016 rally. Other sectors rising amid the June cross currents include the materials,homebuilders and health care sector. Collectively, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains rotational and technically constructive. See added sector detail: Nasdaq’s FANG-fueled key reversal masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. Moving to specific names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.53% — initially profiled Aug. 5 — has returned 20.4% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.2%.) As illustrated, the prevailing downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, placing the shares 4.5% under the June peak. Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 68.30, has defined the intermediate-term uptrend, and a posture higher supports a bullish technical bias. Microsoft is the third-largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Meanwhile, Apple, Inc. AAPL, -0.60% initially profiled Dec. 9, has returned 27.6%. Here, the June downturn has been slightly more aggressive. The shares have violated support matching a one-month range bottom, and the 50-day moving average, currently 148.60. Still, Apple’s second session lower — the violation of the 50-day moving average — was fueled by an analyst downgrade. Analyst-driven moves are frequently one-day wonders. Tactically, the shares have thus far maintained firmer support matching the May breakout point, circa 144.50. This area offers a last-ditch technical floor from which to work, and a posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. Apple is the largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Finally, Micron Technology MU, -1.61%  is a well positioned large-cap semiconductor name. Technically, the June downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, circa 29.40. Bullish price action. Separately, the 50-day moving average has recently defined the trend, and is rising toward support. Micron’s path of least resistance technically points higher barring a violation. Micron was initially profiled Aug. 2.

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bull trend has weathered a mid-June market whipsaw punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is digesting its FAANG-fueled key reversal — a bearish technical pattern — while the Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and S&P MidCap 400 rattle the cage on uncharted territory. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.22%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has thus far absorbed the mid-June whipsaw. Last week’s low (2,415.7) closely matched near-term support. The successful retest of support, and close within the former range, is constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop has strengthened. The blue-chip benchmark has reached record territory, and pulled in modestly. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of the 21,115 support. The Dow notched consecutive session lows last week within three points. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.47%  has staged a massive two-session downdraft, plunging to the range bottom from all-time highs. Notable support spans from 6,164 to 6,170, an area matching the mid-May breakout point, illustrated below. The index closed Monday at 6,175, and has thus far maintained the range bottom on a closing basis. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has formed a key reversal, a bearish technical pattern, detailed Monday. The downturn has thus far concluded with a successful test of the breakout point, circa 6,164. Tactically, this area is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 6,068, and a deeper floor nominally under the 6,000 mark. An eventual violation would mark a “lower low” likely inflicting consequential damage. Recall that the striking June plunge resembles the bearish March 21 downdraft. Though the prevailing downturn has been more aggressive, the mid-March plunge failed to follow through lower. A one-month consolidation phase was punctuated by the April gap higher. Amid the Nasdaq’s two-day downdraft, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing record territory. The Dow’s record close (21,271.97) and absolute all-time high (21,305.35) — both established Friday — remain firmly within view. The prevailing breakout attempt punctuates a successful test of support — the Dow 21,115 area — also illustrated on the hourly chart. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Despite last week’s whipsaw, the S&P has maintained the June range, and remains within striking distance of record highs. The bigger picture As detailed above, technical cross currents have surfaced against a still bullish intermediate-term technical backdrop. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite digests its worst two-session plunge since September. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -0.51% is pressing uncharted territory. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (141.61) and absolute record peak (142.90) — both established Friday — remain under siege. Slightly more broadly, the June rallies have been directionally sharp, fueled by volume spikes, and punctuated by comparably flat pullbacks. A firmly-grounded breakout attempt is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is rattling the cage on a breakout. The MDY briefly tagged all-time highs Friday, and Monday’s close also registered as a fractional record. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from tight six-month ranges, and positioned for potentially material longer-term follow-through. Combined, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 have each registered an all-time closing high within the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has staged a massive bearish reversal, plunging to three-week lows. Its downturn has thus far inflicted limited damage, in the broad sweep, though the technology-fueled selloff can broaden, and is worth tracking for follow-through. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained the June range. Tactically, the S&P’s 2,405 breakout point marks important support, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 2,388. Delving deeper, the May low (2,352) likely defines a last-ditch floor. The S&P’s intermediate-term technical bias remains bullish barring a violation. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish-leaning as partly detailed in the next section.

These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. FAANG-fueled downdraft stirs healthy sector rotation Drilling down further, the prevailing FAANG-fueled downdraft — the downturn in technology bellwethers Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) — has thus far been punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Consider the traditional sector leaders: the technology sector, transports and financials. To start, the Technology Select Sector SPDR has plunged from nearly 17-year highs amid a sustained volume spike. In the process, the group has ventured under first support matching the breakout point (56.00). Still, a deeper floor closely matches the May low, circa 54.40, and the 50-day moving average. A posture higher preserves the group’s series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” — signaling an uptrend — and a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. The initial retest of the 50-day has concluded with a respectable intraday reversal, and close near session highs. Meanwhile, the transports have ticked higher amid the technology sector’s downturn. Late last month, the group cleared the 50-day moving average — a recent bull-bear inflection point — rising toward the range top. More broadly, the prevailing six-month range is pinned to the steep 2016 rally, illustrated on the four-year chart. This is a bullish longer-term backdrop. A break from the range top opens the path to uncharted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Similarly, the Financial Select Sector SDPR, profiled last week, has come to life technically. As illustrated, the group has placed distance atop the 50-day moving average, breaking decisively from a three-month range. Here again, the June upturn punctuates a continuation pattern, pinned to the steep 2016 rally. Other sectors rising amid the June cross currents include the materials,homebuilders and health care sector. Collectively, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains rotational and technically constructive. See added sector detail: Nasdaq’s FANG-fueled key reversal masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. Moving to specific names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.53% — initially profiled Aug. 5 — has returned 20.4% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.2%.) As illustrated, the prevailing downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, placing the shares 4.5% under the June peak. Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 68.30, has defined the intermediate-term uptrend, and a posture higher supports a bullish technical bias. Microsoft is the third-largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Meanwhile, Apple, Inc. AAPL, -0.60% initially profiled Dec. 9, has returned 27.6%. Here, the June downturn has been slightly more aggressive. The shares have violated support matching a one-month range bottom, and the 50-day moving average, currently 148.60. Still, Apple’s second session lower — the violation of the 50-day moving average — was fueled by an analyst downgrade. Analyst-driven moves are frequently one-day wonders. Tactically, the shares have thus far maintained firmer support matching the May breakout point, circa 144.50. This area offers a last-ditch technical floor from which to work, and a posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. Apple is the largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Finally, Micron Technology MU, -1.61%  is a well positioned large-cap semiconductor name. Technically, the June downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, circa 29.40. Bullish price action. Separately, the 50-day moving average has recently defined the trend, and is rising toward support. Micron’s path of least resistance technically points higher barring a violation. Micron was initially profiled Aug. 2.

Speaking to Bloomberg in an interview published on Tuesday, Cook confirmed that Apple is working on "autonomous systems" for cars. Cook, who didn't elaborate on Apple's work, would only say that he believes self-driving car technology is "very important" to his company. For years, Apple (aapl) has remained tight-lipped as rumors have swirled, saying the company is working on car technology. Initially, market watchers speculated that Apple was working on its own car. The vehicle would come with self-driving car technology and possibly hit the road within the next few years. Last year, however, rumors started to surface that suggested Apple had moved on from the automaker operation and would instead focus on vehicle technology. Earlier this year, the California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test self-driving cars on the state's roads, lending even more credibility to the reports. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Still, Apple has decided against directly acknowledging its car ambitions. In past earnings calls, for instance, Cook has only hinted or quipped about possible moves into the car business. By working on self-driving car technology, Apple is putting itself in direct competition with a slew of competitors, including Alphabet's Waymo (googl), which has been developing an autonomous driving product for years. Prominent carmakers, including General Motors (gm) and BMW, are also examining the possibility of joining the market. In his interview with Bloomberg, Cook suggested that Apple's home-brewed artificial intelligence technology would prove critical to differentiating its product from the others. Cook didn't say, however, how Apple's technology might differ from the others. Although Cook acknowledged Apple is working on car technology, he didn't rule out the possibility of his company eventually building its own car. Instead, he told Bloomberg that Apple will "see where" Apple's work on car technology might lead the company.

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bull trend has weathered a mid-June market whipsaw punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is digesting its FAANG-fueled key reversal — a bearish technical pattern — while the Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and S&P MidCap 400 rattle the cage on uncharted territory. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.22%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has thus far absorbed the mid-June whipsaw. Last week’s low (2,415.7) closely matched near-term support. The successful retest of support, and close within the former range, is constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop has strengthened. The blue-chip benchmark has reached record territory, and pulled in modestly. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of the 21,115 support. The Dow notched consecutive session lows last week within three points. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.47%  has staged a massive two-session downdraft, plunging to the range bottom from all-time highs. Notable support spans from 6,164 to 6,170, an area matching the mid-May breakout point, illustrated below. The index closed Monday at 6,175, and has thus far maintained the range bottom on a closing basis. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has formed a key reversal, a bearish technical pattern, detailed Monday. The downturn has thus far concluded with a successful test of the breakout point, circa 6,164. Tactically, this area is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 6,068, and a deeper floor nominally under the 6,000 mark. An eventual violation would mark a “lower low” likely inflicting consequential damage. Recall that the striking June plunge resembles the bearish March 21 downdraft. Though the prevailing downturn has been more aggressive, the mid-March plunge failed to follow through lower. A one-month consolidation phase was punctuated by the April gap higher. Amid the Nasdaq’s two-day downdraft, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing record territory. The Dow’s record close (21,271.97) and absolute all-time high (21,305.35) — both established Friday — remain firmly within view. The prevailing breakout attempt punctuates a successful test of support — the Dow 21,115 area — also illustrated on the hourly chart. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Despite last week’s whipsaw, the S&P has maintained the June range, and remains within striking distance of record highs. The bigger picture As detailed above, technical cross currents have surfaced against a still bullish intermediate-term technical backdrop. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pressing all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite digests its worst two-session plunge since September. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -0.51% is pressing uncharted territory. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (141.61) and absolute record peak (142.90) — both established Friday — remain under siege. Slightly more broadly, the June rallies have been directionally sharp, fueled by volume spikes, and punctuated by comparably flat pullbacks. A firmly-grounded breakout attempt is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is rattling the cage on a breakout. The MDY briefly tagged all-time highs Friday, and Monday’s close also registered as a fractional record. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from tight six-month ranges, and positioned for potentially material longer-term follow-through. Combined, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 have each registered an all-time closing high within the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has staged a massive bearish reversal, plunging to three-week lows. Its downturn has thus far inflicted limited damage, in the broad sweep, though the technology-fueled selloff can broaden, and is worth tracking for follow-through. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained the June range. Tactically, the S&P’s 2,405 breakout point marks important support, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 2,388. Delving deeper, the May low (2,352) likely defines a last-ditch floor. The S&P’s intermediate-term technical bias remains bullish barring a violation. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish-leaning as partly detailed in the next section. See also: Bull trend confirmed, S&P 500 sustains break to ‘clear skies’ territory. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. FAANG-fueled downdraft stirs healthy sector rotation Drilling down further, the prevailing FAANG-fueled downdraft — the downturn in technology bellwethers Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) — has thus far been punctuated by healthy sector rotation. Consider the traditional sector leaders: the technology sector, transports and financials. To start, the Technology Select Sector SPDR has plunged from nearly 17-year highs amid a sustained volume spike. In the process, the group has ventured under first support matching the breakout point (56.00). Still, a deeper floor closely matches the May low, circa 54.40, and the 50-day moving average. A posture higher preserves the group’s series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” — signaling an uptrend — and a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. The initial retest of the 50-day has concluded with a respectable intraday reversal, and close near session highs. Meanwhile, the transports have ticked higher amid the technology sector’s downturn. Late last month, the group cleared the 50-day moving average — a recent bull-bear inflection point — rising toward the range top. More broadly, the prevailing six-month range is pinned to the steep 2016 rally, illustrated on the four-year chart. This is a bullish longer-term backdrop. A break from the range top opens the path to uncharted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Similarly, the Financial Select Sector SDPR, profiled last week, has come to life technically. As illustrated, the group has placed distance atop the 50-day moving average, breaking decisively from a three-month range. Here again, the June upturn punctuates a continuation pattern, pinned to the steep 2016 rally. Other sectors rising amid the June cross currents include the materials,homebuilders and health care sector. Collectively, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains rotational and technically constructive. See added sector detail: Nasdaq’s FANG-fueled key reversal masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. Moving to specific names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.53% — initially profiled Aug. 5 — has returned 20.4% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.2%.) As illustrated, the prevailing downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, placing the shares 4.5% under the June peak. Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 68.30, has defined the intermediate-term uptrend, and a posture higher supports a bullish technical bias. Microsoft is the third-largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Meanwhile, Apple, Inc. AAPL, -0.60% initially profiled Dec. 9, has returned 27.6%. Here, the June downturn has been slightly more aggressive. The shares have violated support matching a one-month range bottom, and the 50-day moving average, currently 148.60. Still, Apple’s second session lower — the violation of the 50-day moving average — was fueled by an analyst downgrade. Analyst-driven moves are frequently one-day wonders. Tactically, the shares have thus far maintained firmer support matching the May breakout point, circa 144.50. This area offers a last-ditch technical floor from which to work, and a posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. Apple is the largest U.S. company as measured by market cap. Finally, Micron Technology MU, -1.61%  is a well positioned large-cap semiconductor name. Technically, the June downturn has been punctuated by a successful test of the breakout point, circa 29.40. Bullish price action. Separately, the 50-day moving average has recently defined the trend, and is rising toward support. Micron’s path of least resistance technically points higher barring a violation. Micron was initially profiled Aug. 2.

The CEO said as much in an interview last week on the same day WWDC 2017 kicked off, but he would not also confirm whether an Apple-brand car is in the works. Don't Miss: Pixel 2 XL has reportedly been canceled for an even bigger Google phone “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook told Bloomberg Television. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important. It’s probably one of the most difficult A.I. projects actually to work on.” The CEO stressed that autonomy is a core technology for Apple, but the company isn’t ready to explain what type of automotive products it’s actually developing. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Cook admitted that we’re witnessing a major disruption in the automotive industry right now that includes various factors like self-driving technology, electric vehicles, and ride-hailing apps. “There is a major disruption looming there,” Cook said. “You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame.” Cook also lauded electric cars in the interview, saying that “it’s a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station.” Apple’s CEO did not mention Project Titan by name, which is the rumored codename for Apple’s car project. Bob Mansfield is leading Apple’s Project Titan, according to earlier reports, and the veteran engineer is responsible for changing the team’s focus. Instead of building an Apple car, Project Titan is developing an autonomous driving system, those reports said. As for ride-sharing apps, Apple invested $1 billion last year in China’s Didi Chuxing service, which may fit well with the now-confirmed autonomous driving project. Cook’s interview follows below.

Knell had already knocked out one of the other partygoers, a well-spoken English “twit” who had tried to tell him it wasn’t “cool” to be hungry. Actor and author Peter Coyote, a close friend of Knell’s, intervened, telling Lennon (who was dressed as Santa Claus) to sit down before the Hell’s Angel could strike again. This incident took place in the Georgian building in Savile Row, Mayfair, that served as Apple Corps’s offices. Apple Corps was the venture set up by the Beatles in 1968. It was somewhere between a conventional entertainment business and a hippy nirvana. The story of the early years of the company is told in Ben Lewis’s entertaining and surprising new film, The Beatles, Hippies And Hell’s Angels. This is a Beatles documentary with a difference. There are no screaming teenagers or scenes of John, Paul, Ringo, George singing "Love Me Do".  Coyote (the former hippy turned star of such movies as ET and Bitter Moon) is an interviewee. After all, he was there as part of the posse of Californian Hell’s Angels and counter-culture figures invited to Apple’s London HQ by George Harrison for reasons that are still a little obscure. With his wonderfully gravelly voice, Coyote is also the narrator of the film. Derek Taylor, the Beatles' press office at Apple Corps (Tom Hanley) This isn’t an official documentary. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the remaining living Beatles, aren’t involved. Lewis, though, has tracked down the secretaries, journalists, DJs, sound engineers, musicians, accountants, hairdressers and freeloaders who lived, worked and hung out at Apple Corps. He tells a story at once comical and very sad. If you want to know why the Beatles split up, you will find out here. This is one of the few rock docs in which the accountant’s voice features as strongly as that of his music biz clients. As Steven Maltz, the account at Apple, explains on camera, he had been going through the group’s papers in 1966 and was shocked to discover “nothing had been done”. The Beatles hadn’t filled in their tax returns. They were then probably the most successful band in the world and yet they were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Maltz told the musicians that they should start businesses and invest in them to save themselves from having to give all their money to the taxman. Read more The Beatles' 'Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band' at 50 Apple Corps was an exercise in capitalism but one launched in a very hippy fashion. The new venture involved music, films, fashion and electronics. The aim was to use music to change the world. “All the profits won’t go into our pockets. They’ll go to help people, but not like a charity,” McCartney explained the enterprise in a 1968 interview. Given this approach, it was little wonder that Apple Corps was soon haemorrhaging money as the Fab Four invested in some of the most unlikely new businesses and were fleeced by a variety of chancers. The irony is that the story the documentary tells is almost identical to that of the Eric Idle/Neil Innes Beatles spoof, The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash (1978). John Lennon and Yoko Ono on the steps of Apple Corps at 3 Saville Row in 1969 One of Apple’s first steps was to shoot their film Magical Mystery Tour in the West Country. This was goonish psychedelia – the Beatles’ very own, very British answer to the drug-fuelled trip across America by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters in a school bus a couple of years before. Magical Mystery Tour was received with incomprehension when it was broadcast on the BBC. It didn’t help that it went out in black and white, given that had made in mind-bending psychedelic colour. Apple Music began signing up artists, among them James Taylor, Badfinger and Mary Hopkins (who had been recommended by the model Twiggy). And it was a diverse roster: one of the company’s excursion was into big brass band music with the Black Dyke Mills Band; another was spreading Krishna consciousness and transcendental mediation. The staff working at Apple Corps enjoyed themselves. A typical day for the secretaries might start with a sherry and a cigarette. This would be followed by a long lunch. “You never quite knew who was going to be coming into the office,” one former secretary recalls. George Harrison at Apple Corps. Arguments over the business venture led to the band splitting up (Tom Hanley) Visitors like journalist Ray Connolly might drop by for a drink. It wasn’t unusual for strange gifts to be delivered (among them, once, a donkey). Apple Corps had opened its own fashion boutique. The company invested heavily in new technology, especially electronics, under their hippy boffin “Magic Alex” (Yanni Alexis Mardas). Read more Liverpool announces plans to celebrate 50th anniversary of Sgt Pepper George Martin: A tribute to the man behind The Beatles' best songs Sir Paul McCartney sues Sony over rights to The Beatles back catalogue Lewis – director of such other docs as Google and the World Brain and The Great Contemporary Art Bubble – reflects on the Apple Corps story. “I thought it was a story that was almost Chaucerian in a way. It was a yarn about something which was quite trivial involving really famous people. It revealed them to be really, really human. I liked all the contradictions. On the one hand, you thought that the Beatles were being really silly and self-indulgent because they had lost of money. On the other, you really identified with them. The Beatles were pretty nice people, clever people, sane people. Given the level of fame John, Paul, Ringo and George had gone through, they had emerged relatively unscathed.” It was only to be expected that the Beatles would be a little naive about business. For many years, they had been in a bubble. They’d been touring and recording, and having very limited exposure to the everyday world. Now, they wanted to run a business and live by hippy values but money kept on getting in the way. Derek Taylor with Ringo Starr at Apple Corps (Tom Hanley) The latter part of the documentary looks at the power struggle that eventually tore the band apart. The Beatles realised they needed a strong and savvy figure to sort out the mess that was Apple Corps. McCartney favoured his father-in-law, New York attorney Lee Eastman. John Lennon and the others were keener on Allen Klein, the famously abrasive business manager of the Rolling Stones. In meetings about the future of the company, Klein is said to have called Eastman a “shithead” and to have dismissed his offer to the Beatles as “a piece of crap”. Eastman responded by telling Klein he was “a perfect asshole”.  Lennon persuaded Starr and Harrison to go with Klein. McCartney couldn’t accept the idea that Klein was running Apple. This, as much as bad feeling about Yoko Ono or Linda, was what was to stop the Beatles recording and, eventually, to lead to the break-up of the band. “It was only after Allen Klein destroyed the utopian, hippy concept of Apple that the Beatles actually split. Paul threw in the towel,” Lewis notes. In hindsight, Apple Corps seems ahead of its time. It combined technology, music, film and fashion. This could have been a great business – if only it had been run a little more efficiently. Paul and Linda McCartney outside Apple Corps in 1969 Lewis insists that his film is not intended to be “irreverent or disrespectful.” Instead, he is trying to tell the story of Apple Corps in an “honest and truthful way.” Having spent a year making the documentary, he is in awe of Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting ability. “The music never dies. It is on such a level of cosmic genius that it never dies. If you’re a young person, it sounds as good today as it did then. It’s like what would happen if Verdi and Mozart had lived in the same town, had met each other and started writing music together.” The director is hoping that Paul, Ringo and the Apple management might appreciate the imaginative quality of the filmmaking, not least the Yellow Submarine-style animation. They may be curious, too, about the many hitherto unseen archive photographs taken inside the Apple offices that are included in the film. “Sometimes, I have the fantasy that they will ring me up and say ‘let’s do it again, Ben, but this time we will give you interviews.’” The Beatles, Hippies and Hells Angels will be broadcast on 17 June, 9pm, Sky Arts and catch-up More about: The Beatles Apple Corps Ben Lewis Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

In an interview posted online Tuesday with Bloomberg TV, Cook said the artificial intelligence project involves three aspects: autonomous cars, electric vehicles and ride-booking. "There is a major disruption looming there," Cook told Bloomberg during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., on June 5. "You've got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame." And it makes for challenging work. "Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars — there are others. And we sort of see it as the mother all AI projects," Cook said. "It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something that is incredibly exciting for us. But we'll see where it takes us — we're not really saying from a product point of view what we'll do. It's a core technology that we view as very important." Initially, Apple sought to build its own car -- a plan called Project Titan -- but last year decided to instead focus on the underlying technology for autonomous driving. Since Project Titan began in 2014, Apple has hired 1,000 engineers. Several other tech companies have been working on self-driving car technology, including Alphabet's waymo and processor company Intel. Cars manufacturers, including Tesla, General Motors and BMW, have been developing the vehicles. Ride-sharing company Uber has also jumped in. In April, Apple received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicle to test three self-driving sports-utility vehicles. It has been using a Lexus RX450h SUV equipped with sensors and cameras, Bloomberg reported. A half-dozen vehicles were seen on public roads in and around the San Francisco Bay area for at least a year. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment how long the company has been conducting road tests. California has granted autonomous car testing permits to 30 companies. Last November, Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, revealing the company's interest in automotive technology. Apple has already registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto. Cook is high on electric cars. "It's a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station," Cook said. And Apple sees ride-hailing as part of the self-driving development. Last year, Apple invested $1 billion last year in Didi Chuxing, the biggest Chinese ride-hailing service. Cook isn't sure whether Apple will actually manufacture the cars -- like it does phones, computers and watches. "We'll see where it takes us," Cook said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh iPhone 8 production is on schedule, but you still won’t be able to get one at launch Chris Smith @chris_writes June 13th, 2017 at 12:01 PM Share Tweet iPhone fans, now’s a good time to start typing up a letter to Santa if you’re planning to buy the iPhone 8 this year, because there’s one more report that says your best chance of getting one is by Christmas rather than at launch. Apparently, iPhone 8 production isn’t experiencing any delays, but that doesn’t mean Apple will have enough supply at launch. Don't Miss: Amazon Echo just dropped to its lowest price of all time In a research note seen by Barron’s, BlueFin Research Partners say there is no delay in ordering components for Apple’s next iPhones at this time. But the iPhone X, which is what they call the iPhone 8, will see a limited launch in September, with Apple seen making only 13 million units. “Our ongoing reads reinforce our earlier view that Apple will offer only minimal units of the iPhone X at launch with improved availability in October,” they say, adding that Apple is making “a total of 13M iPhone X builds through September, a reduction of 5M from our original forecast in March.” However, analysts John Donovan and Steve Mullane say the iPhone X will soon take up the majority of iPhone manufacturing in the months that follow — see the table below — a trend that will continue next year. Apple is seen, once again, adopting OLED screens for all its iPhones in the future, which may turn out to contribute to iPhone sales growth. Image Source: BlueFin Research Partners via Barrons “iPhone X builds ramp in CQ4’17, projecting to represent 55% of the mix, and this ratio remains fairly steady through mid-2018,” the report notes. “We continue to track increases in 2018 and 2019 build projections by tens of millions of units each year, and while forward projections are dubious, the possibility of sustained growth is welcome news indeed. The rationale behind this is that the step up to the new OLED design will filter across all offerings in future generation phones and with an installed base hurtling towards 750M in the coming year. Additionally, as many as 300M of those phones by mid-2018 will be over 2 years old and should provide fertile ground for continued growth.” The analysts also say that all component decisions have been finalized, adding that they do see “potential for a mid-cycle refresh that could expand OLED into additional models sometime in 2018.” Even if Apple won’t be able to meet iPhone 8 demand at launch or in the critical December quarter, the company is apparently stocking up on OLED displays parts in preparation for the year ahead. Apple and “and the contract manufacturers are content to get in as many parts as possible as early as possible in order to satisfy what appears to be an insatiable demand for the OLED phone(s).” Tags: Apple, iPhone 8 View Comments Trending 1 Tech Google Drive can now do much more than just photos 2 Tech iPhone 7, 7 Plus remain top sellers as Galaxy S8 sales disappoint in the US 3 Tech New Galaxy Note 8 video leak gives us a closer look at the phone’s killer design 4 Tech How Apple can salvage an iPhone 8 design that looks embarrassingly bad 5 Tech T-Mobile is updating its network faster than Apple can update iPhones Picked For You OnePlus 5 shown from every angle in new series of leaks By Chris Smith 2 days ago New renders suggest a Galaxy Note 8 design that’s classic Samsung By Chris Smith 2 days ago There’s a secret way to get unlimited Verizon hotspot data for $50 a month By Chris Mills 1 day ago Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Apple has been secretive about its autonomous driving program called Project Titan. During Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, Cook admitted the company is working on self-driving technology. Read: Alexa, Siri, Apple TV: Are Amazon And Apple Putting Their Rivalry Aside? "We're focusing on autonomous systems," Cook told Bloomberg. "It's a core technology that we view as very important." Cook’s comments come after the company introduced its home assistant, HomePod. The CEO then went on to talk about the importance of artificial intelligence. "We sort of see it as the mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects," he said. "It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on." What Is Project Titan? Previous reports have pointed to moves the company was making on the project. In April, Apple was given the green light for testing self-driving cars in California, the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles’ website revealed. Apple’s DMV application includes a walkthrough of the Development Platform Specific Training and details about an autonomous-vehicle system called Apple Automated System. In the documents, an Apple official said the "development platform uses hardware and software to monitor surrounding objects and events." The application also included a copy of the testing process Apple used to certify six drivers who will pilot three modified 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs. Apple reportedly hired three former NASA engineers for Project Titan, also in April. The engineers, who previously worked on detection of 3D objects and motion planning algorithms, were supposed to test Apple's self-driving car software. Read: iOS 11 And watchOS 4: New Apple Watch And iPhone Health Features Will Help With Your Workouts A report in March said the iPhone maker was quietly operating a research lab in Switzerland and had hired computer visions and robotics researchers, possibly for self-driving technology. Cook would not say last week if Apple will end up developing its own self-driving car in the future. "We’ll see where it takes us," Cook told Bloomberg. "We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do." Apple vs. Samsung Apple rival Samsung seems to be going in the same direction. The company was granted permission by South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport last month to test self-driving cars. Samsung, which had previously entered the auto business but failed, said it was not looking into developing autonomous cars. “The pilot run is being carried out for software and solution development for an autonomous car, nothing more,” a Samsung official told the Korea Herald at the time. “The test has nothing to do with devices development, but [is being carried out] to test software and algorithm under development by Samsung.” Other companies have been experimenting with self-driving technology. Uber is testing its autonomous cars in various U.S. cities. Meanwhile, Google created its self-driving car unit Waymo last year. The company, which is in a legal battle with Uber, launched a self-driving taxi program in Phoenix in April and is also testing driverless truck technology.  Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

However, it appears that the tech giant has developed a third option that many may have overlooked. Apple has been granted a new patent that illustrates an edge-to-edge screen iPhone with a thin Touch ID sensor placed in power button that sits at the top of the smartphone.  Scroll down for video Apple has been granted a new patent that illustrates an edge-to-edge screen iPhone with a thin Touch ID sensor placed in power button that sits at the top of the smartphone APPLE'S NEW PATENT  Apple has been granted a new patent that illustrates an edge-to-edge screen iPhone with a thin Touch ID sensor placed in power button that sits at the top of the smartphone. The user would simply place their finger on the button, allowing the technology to carry out the finger matching process.  But because the Touch ID would be much thinner than the current sensor, users would have to roll their finger over it – instead of just laying their finger on it. Apple also noted that the ‘sensor assembly cooperates with the processor to perform at least one of a finger biometric enrollment and authentication function.’  From the first moment rumors began surfacing about the iPhone 8, the idea that Apple would design the smartphone with an edge-to-edge had been the top speculation. However, there have been conflicting reports surrounding the location of the Touch ID function, which has been located at the bottom of previous iPhone models, separated from the screen. Apple experts and leakers have argued that the sensor will be placed underneath the display, while others have suggested that it will be put on the back of the smartphone – just slightly below the firm’s iconic logo. Now, Apple may have given away the answer in a patent filed in December 2016, entitled ‘Finger biometric sensor assembly including direct bonding interface and related methods’, according to reports in Patently Apple. In the document, Apple has explained that the finger biometric sensor, or Touch ID, could be placed in the 'pushbutton', the function that turns the smartphone on and off.

IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing  - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging   - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models with a wraparound OLED screen - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass, on the back or in the power button on top of the phone - Aluminium back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition - Premium model could cost $1,000 (£775) Although this innovation comes directly from Apple, it could always be just another patent that will go unused. It could also not be what the firm has planned for the iPhone, as the tech giant had published another patent in May that highlighted technology that embeds the sensor into the screen.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 144.29 -0.87 -0.60% CME Group Inc CME ▼ 126.78 -0.54 -0.42% AdChoices The Dow gained 92 points to close at a record-high 21,328. The S&P 500 gained 0.45 percent, with information technology leading advancers. Shares of Apple, Google-Parent Alphabet and Tesla all rose, pushing the Nasdaq composite 0.73 percent higher.  Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said the Nasdaq 100 futures had taken a respite Tuesday before the bell "from the pullback that has characterized the technology sector in the last two days." "There is room to short-term oversold territory, so we would assume the pullback still has a hold, although it is likely to mature in the next few days," Stockton said. Technology stocks have easily outperformed this year, with the S&P information technology sector advancing 17.6 percent. By comparison, health care — the second-best performer in the S&P — had risen 12.1 for 2017 entering Tuesday's session. The Nasdaq completed a 2.31 percent two-day pullback Monday as valuation concerns around the sector escalated. A survey of fund managers released Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed the Nasdaq at the top of the most-crowded trade list. The survey also showed that 84 percent of fund managers believe the U.S. is the most overvalued equity market. Still, it's "important to note that the last two days have shown little to no real signs of weakness with pullback attempts in S&P, DJIA holding and rallying back to unchanged," said Mark Newton, managing partner at Newton Advisors, in a note. "The Tech selloff looks nearly complete in the short run with XLK ... down to weekly support near trendlines from last November," he said. Investors also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve as the central bank kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Investors largely expect the central bank to raise interest rates by a quarter point. Market expectations for a June rate hike were 99.6 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Investors will also look for clues about how the Fed plans to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. In economic news, the National Federation of Independent Business' (NFIB) small business optimism index came in unchanged at 104.5 for May. "The bottom line continues to be that small businesses remain hopeful for positive policy changes out of the [Trump] Administration," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "Companies are still hiring but not really increasing investments in their business. On the former, a growing issue is the dearth of supply for qualified workers which we keep talking about," Boockvar said. Meanwhile, U.S. producer prices remained unchanged last month as energy costs recorded their biggest decline in more than a year, suggesting inflation pressures were easing after rising at the start of the year.

Tim Cook has finally confirmed one of the Apple rumors we keep seeing out there: Apple is working on self-driving car technology. The CEO said as much in an interview last week on the same day WWDC 2017 kicked off, but he would not also confirm whether an Apple-brand car is in the works. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook told Bloomberg Television. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important. It’s probably one of the most difficult A.I. projects actually to work on.” Popular Searches The Bank Of Japan 8301 ▼ 38,700.00 -700.00 -1.78% Under Armour Inc UA ▼ 20.33 -0.76 -3.60% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 144.29 -0.87 -0.60% NVIDIA Corp NVDA ▲ 152.37 +0.65 +0.43% The CEO stressed that autonomy is a core technology for Apple, but the company isn’t ready to explain what type of automotive products it’s actually developing. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook said. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Cook admitted that we’re witnessing a major disruption in the automotive industry right now that includes various factors like self-driving technology, electric vehicles, and ride-hailing apps. “There is a major disruption looming there,” Cook said. “You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame.” Cook also lauded electric cars in the interview, saying “it’s a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station.” Apple’s CEO did not mention Project Titan by name, which is the rumored codename for Apple’s car project. Bob Mansfield is leading Apple’s Project Titan, according to earlier reports, and the veteran engineer is responsible for changing the team’s focus. Instead of building an Apple car, Project Titan is developing an autonomous driving system, those reports said. As for ride-sharing apps, Apple invested $1 billion last year in China’s Didi Chuxing service, which may fit well with the now-confirmed autonomous driving project.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below.

Apple's iPads Are Now The Tablet Of Choice Among Kindergartners Why Wealth Protection Is Important to Investors (GuruFocus) Related AMZN Factors Driving FANG Still Intact, But Macro Backdrop More Mixed Amazon Prime Gives 2% Cash Back on Debit Card Purchases Stocks Sell Off As FANGs Falter, Chinese Techs Tumble (Investor's Business Daily) Despite the market’s reaction to a recent Goldman Sachs research report, technology valuations are not likely to be lower anytime soon. On Friday, Robert Boroujerdi, a Goldman Sachs analyst, published a research report where he identified what he currently sees as a “valuation air pocket” in technology stocks. “This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult-to-decipher risk narratives (e.g. FAAMG’s realized volatility is now below that of Staples and Utilities),” Boroujerdi wrote. However, Boroujerdi forgets to mention how much the stock market has changed over the past 20 years, and how tough of a comparison this is to make to the dot.com bubble. Current Valuations Of Technology Companies Almost every tech company can be defined as overvalued in today’s market. But, what does that really mean? Investors have been saying Tesla has been overvalued for years, yet the stock is up nearly 65 percent this year. Other notable “overvalued tech stocks” include Amazon (180.59 P/E ratio) and Netflix (198.47 P/E ratio). A More Mature Technology Market A list of few of the stocks that were impacted by the crash in 2000 include eToys.com, theGlobe.com and Pets.com. The majority of these companies had just gone public before 2000 and shot up as investors anticipated a huge growth story in a young and upcoming company. These companies are nowhere near as mature as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), among other well-known tech stocks highlighted by the research report. Specifically, theGlobe.com went public in 1998 and jumped an astonishing 600 percent in its first day of trading. EToys.com was founded in 1997, and in just three short years the company warned investors that its shares might be “worthless.” Meanwhile, Apple went public in 1980 and has always created the latest and most popular smartphones on the market, in addition to computers and other technology products. Apple is not showing any signs of slowing down. Amazon started publicly trading 1997 and has become the industry leader in the electronic commerce industry. Apple and Amazon are not like eToys.com or theGlobe.com. Both Apple and Amazon shares have steadily grown over 25,000 percent since they went public. Another Missing Factor: The Emergence of ‘Passive Investments’ Today, instead of investing in individual stocks, investors choose to make more diversified plays and pour their money into exchange-traded funds. ETF’s represented over 30 percent of the stock market back in 2013 and this number has likely grown today. These passive investments end up driving up valuations on technology stocks. Thus, because the money is going to continue to flow into these stocks, unless there is a sell-off among ETF’s, the technology sector will continue to be composed of overvalued companies. Brian Frank, a portfolio manager for the Frank Value mutual fund, told the New York Times in 2015, “There’s no doubt in my mind that passive investing in E.T.F.s and index funds inflates the price of index stocks versus non-index stocks. The whole market is overvalued. Index stocks are more overvalued.” Maybe technology stocks are not the lone sector, could other industries be impacted by this emergence of passive investing?

According to Variety, Gulati has been tasked with leading the effort to build highly optimized chips for Google’s Pixel smartphones in-house. He had been spearheading Apple’s own chip developments for close to eight years. By hiring an industry expert, Google is hoping to distance itself from the rest of the pack. Like other flagship Android devices, Pixel smartphones use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 processor. This makes it harder for Google to differentiate Pixel devices from other Android phones. “In addition to Gulati’s hire, Google is now looking to hire additional chip experts to tightly control future Pixel hardware,” Variety learned from sources familiar with the hire. A custom chip would allow Google to develop a more secure smartphone with better camera features, advanced biometric authentication, optimized power consumption and so forth. iPhone 7, for example, is six times faster at image recognition than Google’s Pixel phone because its 64-bit A10 Fusion chip has a highly-optimized Image Signal Processor. And with iOS 11, Apple is integrating features like Metal 2, machine learning and augmented reality directly into a phone’s main chip, which would have been impossible if the company hadn’t closely controlled chip design. For those wondering, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srouji, oversees the company’s semiconductor and wireless teams, reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. “Johny has built one of the world’s strongest and most innovative teams of silicon and technology engineers, overseeing breakthrough custom silicon and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple’s entire product line,” according to his bio page on the Apple Leadership website. Johny joined Apple in 2008 to lead development of the A4, the first Apple-designed system on a chip powering iPhone 4 and the original iPad. Apple’s semiconductor team is comprised of engineers who worked at startups like P.A. Semi that Apple acquired after releasing the original iPhone. Apple’s logic was simple: it wanted to take its chip destiny into its own hands to tightly integrate the hardware and software, optimize device performance and power consumption and enable hardware features simply not possible on devices that use off-the-shel parts that are readily available to all vendors. Incredibly, the strategy paid off big time. Even the last-generation A9 processor inside iPhone 6s smokes competition in single-core performance, for instance. The A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7 family is even faster and Apple’s latest chip, the A10X Fusion inside the new iPad Pros, features 30 percent faster CPU performance and forty percent faster graphics than the previous generation.

PHOTO: AFP [SAN FRANCISCO] Apple Inc, which issued the biggest green bond ever sold by a US corporation last year to finance projects fighting global warming, is doing it again. On Tuesday, the iPhone maker issued a US$1 billion green bond to fund renewable energy generation. It builds on US$1.5 billion worth of bonds the Cupertino, California-based company sold a year ago to further its goal of running 100 per cent of its operations on renewable energy. The bonds, maturing in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than Treasuries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the deal is private. They are expected to be rated Aa1, the person said. The sale was arranged by Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Powered by GET.com sentifi.com Market voices on: While companies in recent years have issued tens of billions of dollars in green bonds for projects that cut global-warming emissions, the size of Apple's first issuance fueled speculation that other companies would follow.  Its latest bond comes less than two weeks after President Donald Trump decided to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, an international pact to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said last week he sought to persuade the president not to withdraw. SEE ALSO: Apple, Dell joining Foxconn's bid for Toshiba chip business "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change," Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among those that signed an open letter pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple said it plans to use the proceeds to finance projects involving renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, among other things. The latest bond offering includes a focus on advancing Apple's goal of a closed-loop supply chain, through which products are made using only renewable resources and recycled material. The debt issuance means Apple doesn't have to tap its vast offshore cash reserves to fund its renewables projects. The company is investing in solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California, including US$850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century, and has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Even with cash and equivalents totaling US$257 billion, Apple has issued debt totaling US$99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most of that money is held outside the US and would be subject to a 35 per cent corporate income tax if it were repatriated.

Megan Geuss - Jun 13, 2017 3:44 pm UTC Enlarge Simone Pittaluga reader comments 64 Share this story Rumors have been traded for years now about Apple’s automotive ambitions. Would Apple try to compete with Tesla to build an electric vehicle? Would it go toe-to-toe with its old foe Google to offer self-driving cars? In recent months, however, a clearer picture of Apple’s automotive work has slowly been revealed, most recently with Apple CEO Tim Cook telling Bloomberg in an interview that Apple is “focusing on autonomous systems. And um, clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars.” Further ReadingIs Apple self-driving car software coming? DMV permit suggests soBack in December, Apple wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to say that it was investing heavily in machine learning and automation, without giving any salient details about what the company was building. Then in April, Apple applied for a California DMV permit to test autonomous systems on public roads using “three 2015 Lexus RX540h SUVs and six drivers.” Cook’s recent comments are unsurprising but bolster the notion that Apple is working to build an autonomous car system, possibly one that extends beyond basic autonomous functions that have hit the road today. In Apple’s December NHTSA letter, the company’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote, “Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation." Cook echoed that broad view of autonomy in his recent comments, too, noting that there are other uses for autonomous technology beyond transportation. He added, “we sort of see [autonomy] as the mother of all AI projects.” But he ended on a vague note, saying, “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we’ll do, but we are being straightforward that [autonomy is] a core technology.” The Apple CEO also noted that the electrification of transportation as well as ride-sharing signaled a “major disruption looming.” Cook waxed especially effusive about electric cars as well. “If you’ve driven an all-electric car, it’s actually a marvelous experience. And it’s a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station.” Megan Geuss Megan is a staff editor at Ars Technica. She writes breaking news and has a background in fact-checking and research.

CDT June 13, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST OK, Apple is officially working on self-driving cars. CEO Tim Cook recently elaborated on the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant's plans in an interview with Bloomberg. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said in an interview during the Apple Worldwide developers Conference, published online Tuesday. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” Cook was unsure whether Apple would build its own self-driving cars. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” he said. “It’s probably one of the most difficult A.I. projects actually to work on.” With self-driving cars, electronic cars and ride-sharing, the automotive landscape has "three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame," Cook said. Remember, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi, a ride-sharing company in China last year. And it also reportedly hired Dan Dodge, the former head of Blackberry's automotive software division, Bloomberg reported. Apple had long been rumored to be at work on its own autonomous vehicle as part of an initiative called Project Titan, but the company had yet to officially confirm its plans. The company had hired more than 1,000 engineers as part of that initiative, Bloomberg reported. Then last year, Apple reportedly reduced the staffing of its non-confirmed car project, a move some considered a refocusing of the company's vision. Two months ago, the California Department of Motor Vehicles added Apple to the list of applicants to test autonomous vehicles. And in December 2016, Apple sent a letter sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) about the Department of Transportation's Federal Automated Vehicles Policy and its desire to work with the agency on helping to define industry best practices. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, in the letter. With dozens of companies working on self-driving cars, the Boston Consulting Group estimates the global market for fully autonomous vehicles could grow from $42 billion in 2024 to nearly $77 billion in 2035 (and 12 million fully autonomous vehicles in use by then). Whether Apple's research into autonomous driving systems results in a car remains to be seen. It's an important core technology, Cook said. "We’ll see where it takes us," he said. "We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do." Read more: iCar, what?

He's known as "the father of Ethernet." In 1979, Metcalfe started a company to sell Ethernet technology, 3Com Corp. Later that same year, Steve Jobs tried to get Metcalfe to join Apple. "I had never heard of Steve Jobs, and I had never heard of Apple, but and I had just started my own company so I turned him down," say Metcalfe, speaking to CNBC. "And instead of getting angry with me, he helped me all all through the 1980s. My company benefited greatly from Steve's support, and he's one of my heroes." Photo by Kim Kulish Bob Metcalfe, the co-inventor of the Ethernet, holding an original piece of Ethernet cable. 3Com went on to go public in 1984, and in 1999, its peak year for sales, the networking tech company did $5.7 billion in sales. In 2010, 3Com merged with Hewlett Packard. Metcalfe considered Jobs a mentor. "He was 10 years younger than me, so that was odd. I had a Ph.D. He dropped out his sophomore year in college, but he was my mentor anyway," says Metcalfe. "He was a scary fellow. You get within a few feet of him and he could convince you of anything — and it's famously called 'Steve's reality distortion field' ... as you walk further away you got about 10 or 15 feet away, then you came to your senses and you realize that maybe he was just being persuasive."

It's part of pushing new boundaries, he says. "[Jobs] had very high standards and he did not suffer fools gladly, and so he annoyed a lot of people," says Metcalfe. "In order to make an omelet you have to break some eggs," he continues. "So he, you know, he's famous for being a bit of a jerk from time to time, and I think that was part of the package deal.

"So a willingness to break eggs is one of the things I learn from Steve," says Metcalfe. Metcalfe says he also learned from Jobs the importance of packaging products for the general consumer, not just for the tech community. While Metcalfe generally is in awe of Jobs and grateful for what he has learned from the tech icon, Metcalfe says there was one downside to being friends with Steve Jobs. "Steve Jobs came to our wedding," says Metcalfe. "And what's wrong with having Steve Jobs at your wedding? No one remembers anything about the wedding except the fact that Steve Jobs was there."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung By Brian Fung June 13 Follow @b_fung (Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg) It might be the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley that Apple has been working on something having to do with cars. The issue is, nobody outside of Apple could really say what the project has been about — until now. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has shed more light on his company’s automotive efforts, revealing that the company is “focusing on autonomous systems,” according to an interview with Bloomberg News published Tuesday. In plain English, that means the technology behind self-driving cars. Apple still won’t say publicly if it intends to sell a car of its own, but Cook’s remarks implied that the company is less interested in building a machine on wheels than developing the software or brains that could power one. Cook continued: “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” He likened the effort to “the mother of all AI projects,” saying it’s “probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on.” To see and interpret the world around them, self-driving cars require sophisticated computing and sensing systems. Artificial intelligence, or AI, can help make sense of that data. By analyzing thousands of hours of readings from test drives, companies such as Google and Ford hope that their machines will soon drive more safely and efficiently than humans can. This raises the possibility that, just as Apple and Google became the dominant companies in mobile operating systems with iOS and Android, the same will be true in the operating systems for self-driving cars. “Apple appears to be taking the same route as Waymo/Google, which is to focus on the technology of self-driving cars while leaving vehicle production to established automakers,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “This puts Apple and Google in direct competition, again. Are we looking at a future with two major autonomous vehicle systems just as we currently have two major smartphone systems? The answer seems to be ‘yes.’ ” The public got an early hint in April that Apple was interested in entering the self-driving car wars, when the company got permission from California regulators to test-drive a handful of modified Lexus SUVs on public roads. But it was less clear then just what aspect of self-driving technology Apple was pursuing. The company declined to comment for this story. Automotive analysts say that building lots of working cars, and quickly, can be a far more complex endeavor than building a smartphone or laptop. (Tesla’s struggles with meeting production targets offer further evidence of how challenging auto manufacturing can be at scale.) Cars have a lot of moving parts. Large, established players in Detroit enjoy huge economies of scale that can make it harder for a new entrant to get started. And, some say, whereas Apple’s success with the iPhone came at a time when most people didn’t have cellphones, the market for cars is already saturated, raising questions about how much money Apple could really make by selling actual cars. All that could help explain why Apple, despite being one of the world’s wealthiest companies, appears to be focusing more heavily — for now — on self-driving software. business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

The video was posted today, marking the company’s public admission regarding true purpose of the secretive project. Laying out exactly what Apple is up to in the automotive market, Cook said their current efforts are concentrated on self-driving technology. Here’s what he said (edited for clarity): We’re focusing on autonomous systems. It’s a core technology that we view as very important and probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. There is a major disruption looming there. You’ve got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame. If you’ve driven an electric car, it’s actually a marvelous experience. The “three vectors” Cook refers to are as follows: Self-driving technology Electric vehicles Ride-hailing As you may have suspected, he ultimately declined to say whether or not Apple might eventually manufacture its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us,” Cook added. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do.” Watch the full video below. Ever since rumors began swirling that Project Titan involves a self-driving vehicle, there’s been no shortage of reports analyzing whether or not Apple should build its own car. In October of last year, Bloomberg reported that Project Titan had refocused from building an actual vehicle to developing autonomous self-driving software. Whether or not the fruits of Apple’s labor will ever see the light of day in CarPlay, or perhaps as a standalone new app for autonomous driving, remains to be seen.

Jun 13, 2017 Bezel-free screen 'feels more immediate', but only those 'looking for it' will notice, say reviewers whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin email Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple announced the second generation of its range-topping iPad Pro tablets at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week, including a replacement for the popular base model. See related  Apple iPad Pro 10.5 vs Pro 9.7: What's the difference? E3 2017: Super Mario Odyssey, F1 2017 and more WWDC 2017: Apple unveils new MacBooks, iPad Pro and more The Cupertino-based tech giant has swapped the model's 9.7ins display for a 10.5ins screen, all while retaining almost identical dimensions to the outgoing unit.   It also comes with Apple's brand new A10X processor, which helps increase the frame rate on the tablet's screen and boasts support for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The new iPad Pro promises to be more powerful and significantly smoother to use than its predecessor, but is it worth upgrading? Here's what the critics had to say. Design  "The 10.5ins Pro keeps most of the same design language," says ArsTechnica, including the existing "glass front" and all "the same ports in the same places".  Apple has tweaked the proportions to accommodate the 10.5ins display, but it "feels mostly the same" as the 9.7ins model, the website says.  While the bezels have shrunk, the tablet still feels "as sturdy and seamless as the previous model" thanks to the single piece of aluminium that encases the device, says Engadget. Performance  The new 10.5ins screen comes with Apple's "Pro Motion" feature, says The Verge, which modulates the frame rate of the screen to smooth scrolling animations and save battery life when looking at a still image.  For instance, the frame rate will "lower and optimise" with on-screen video and pictures to save battery life. However, it will increase to provide a smoother experience when the user is scrolling through an article or typing. The £79 Apple Pencil also benefits from an increase in frame rate, as Wired says drawing and note-taking "feel more immediate". This is partly due to the improved processing power, which can "predict" the user's writing inputs.  It's noticeably different to the regular iPad, but the Verge argues users will only see the difference if they are "looking for it". Price and release Orders have already opened for the new iPad Pro 10.5ins and updated 12.9ins model, which can be picked up for £619 and £789 respectively.  These models both come with 64GB of stage - double that of the old model - and 128GB and 246GB variants are available.  Sign up for our daily newsletter Newsletter CloseSign me up Read more: Technology Apple tablets iPad WWDC 2017 You are here: Home technology iPad Pro 10.5: What do the critics think?

The power button, perhaps. Today, Apple was granted a cache of 68 patents, which hint at the possible new locations for the fingerprint reader. The Power button patent was filed in Q2 2015, while the Xperia Z5 came out in early Q4 that year - the first Sony phone to put a fingerprint reader on the Power button. Sony already disables this functionality in the US, anyway, which reduces the chances of a patent dispute with Cupertino. Apple patent drawings of possible new locations for Touch ID Apples system promises to be smaller than prior art, allowing it to mount the button even on the sides of a slender-bezel phone. The button could be positioned on top (Apples original placement and seemingly the preferred option again), but other positions are possible too. It could be covered with a protective glass or even sapphire. Other Apple patents show the biometric sensor hiding under the touch display, either via a transparent conductive finger biometric sensing pixels or an acoustic imaging system.

Left: [STEPHEN LAM/Getty Images] Right: [ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP/Getty Images]    Apple CEO Finally Reveals Secret Plans To Change Automobile Industry Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 11:29 AM 06/13/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple CEO Tim Cook finally revealed details about the company’s elusive self-driving car project in an interview published Tuesday by Bloomberg. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” said Cook. “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects. It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.” Cook and the tech conglomerate in general have been very hush about its potential involvement in the automotive industry until this point. “Autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us. And uh, we’ll see where it takes us,” Cook continued. “We are not really saying in a product point of view what we will do. But we are being straightforward that it’s a core technology that we view as very important.” Apple laid off dozens of employees last year who were part of their driverless car initiative, according to The New York Times, which ostensibly signaled it was throwing in the proverbial white towel. But soon after, there were reports in September that Apple was possibly teaming up with the luxury sports car company McLaren, after the two businesses engaged in discussions. It also allegedly poached engineers from Lit Motors, a startup that developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle. At first, Apple seemed to be trying to build its own autonomously functioning car, but later decided to mostly focus on creating the fundamental technology, according to Bloomberg. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, wrote in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, offering the company’s thoughts on possible federal guidelines. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience—to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” (RELATED: Distracted Driving Is A Huge Problem, And Autonomous Cars Could Help) The tech giant is presumably trying to keep up to speed with the rest of the global business community’s autonomous vehicle initiatives, like Google, Uber, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, and the Chinese-backed Faraday Future. Several other firms are developing the revolutionary technology as well. All of these corporations, including Apple, appear to realize that people will spend a lot of extra money for their car to drive itself. The average person is willing to spend $4,900 more for a car that has driverless technologies, with some potential consumers saying they would be prepared to pay more than $10,000 extra, according to a study conducted by researchers at Cornell University.

It's a text- and messenger-crazy world, and Apple wants in on the business side. The consumer giant debuted Apple Business Chat for its Messages application today, a chat-based customer service channel for businesses.  Apple officials debuted the new tool at the company's WWDC Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif. today. Officials called it a "powerful new way for your customers to get answers to their questions, learn about and purchase your products, and engage with your existing support channels." 'Always-On Customer Service' Essentially, it's a live-chat function in Apple's iMessage ecosystem that connects with the 1 billion active Apple iOS apps device users use — Apple Maps, Siri, Search and their own website and apps. Customers can also use it to pay for items through Apple Pay or schedule follow up support sessions through calendar integration. “Apple Business Chat validates a growing trend where businesses aim to offer ‘always-on’ customer service, across any customer channel of their choice," Scott Horn, Chief Marketing Officer of [24]7, told CMSWire in an email. "Apple’s strong security and data-protection measures bode well for the adoption of this technology." Horn sees great potential for businesses integrating Apple Business Chat with intelligent chatbot technology. "Apple Business Chat has tremendous potential to allow consumers to more easily find answers and information and communicate in natural language through consumer-friendly applications," Horn added. "Chatbots can be used to answer both simple and complex customer service questions as well as perform transactions across iPhone, iPad and iWatch.”    Live Chat in Text Form Customers will be able to from inside their iOS messenger platform connect with businesses through chat, pay for items, share photos of broken products, share videos and book flights after choosing seats. Apple's thinking here? Forget the "contact us" and 800 number on company "about us" pages. For consumers wanting to chat with a business, messaging icons will appear directly within search results on their iOS mobile devices to help them strike a conversation with a business. Apple Business Chat with Apple Pay Cash is the most important iOS announcement since the release of Siri. It is a stunning new paradigm. pic.twitter.com/zBRWL0cDlY — Brian Roemmele (@BrianRoemmele) June 9, 2017 Playing with Apple Business Chat services, the iMessage based apple bot framework.

HUGE HUGEEEE #apple #wwdc pic.twitter.com/dEhQeId1km — Frank Petruccelli (@FVPetro) June 9, 2017 Following Facebook's Lead? Sounds like a familiar tune. Facebook targeted businesses through its Messenger App at its developer conference in April 2016.  The social media giant launched its Messenger Platform (Beta) with bots at its Facebook Developers Conference. Facebook has deployed its bots to provide Messenger users with automated subscription content like weather and traffic updates in addition to customized communications like receipts, shipping notifications and live automated messages. Twitter has longed try to leverage its direct messaging for business and customer service purposes. Apple still may have a long way to go. Constellation Research analysts in a blog post yesterday noted, "iMessage isn't as widely used as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, both of which report more than 1 billion unique users." But Apple's competitively in the mix now, according to analyst Cindy Zhou of Constellation. "Chatbot customer support has already become popular within Facebook Messenger, Twitter, WhatsApp and WeChat in Asia," Zhou said, adding, "Apple iMessage has an opportunity to compete in this space with its native app."  Holding Off on Release Till They 'Get It Right' Apple's Business Chat is not yet publicly available. Apple wants to "get it right," as Apple's Grant Ritchie said on stage today in San Jose. "Elevating customer service takes coordination and takes time," he said. Apple officials are hoping for a success, naturally, something they've already had in the business arena ($25 billion in revenue and climbing, according to some reports). Ritchie said the new tool will give developers the opportunity to add "chat intent" tags to retarget and improve conversations with customers as they continue to seek answers and help. Agents can have product details targeted for chatting customers. And there will be features added to ensure the right customer representative in the right location can get the message for discussion. "You don't want to waste your time waiting on hold," Apple's Ritchie said. "A telephone call is not visual. Sometimes you need to show businesses what you're seeing." 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Vista Equity Partners Continues MarTech Buying Spree, More News Where Does AI Fit in Your Marketing Strategy?

It's been a pretty straightforward affair as far as connectivity between iOS devices, and the cars' infotainment systems is concerned, but other than that, you could write a successful soap opera based on everything that's happened. 5 photos Actually, make that everything we think has happened, as Apple was never ready to admit anything about it auto industry ventures, so we were all left to play the detective's game and speculate. It all went as far as some people reporting strange noises coming out of a small facility owned by the company, prompting comedic parallels with Roswell and the Area 51. The fake clip showing Apple's alleged electric car made those connections even more obvious, but the company has admitted to giving up on the presumed initial nature of its Titan project - developing an EV from scratch - and switching focus to something else. Now, Apple CEO Tim Cook opened up on the company's car-related plans for the first time during an interview with Bloomberg and, as suspected, it all has to do with autonomous driving. "We're focusing on autonomous systems," he admits. "We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on," continues Cook, after making it clear that autonomy isn't necessarily restricted to cars. The CEO also talked about the three vectors that are shaping up the car industry at the moment, with implications in other fields as well: electrification, ride-hailing, and self-driving technology. While Apple is definitely working on the latter, Cook wasn't willing to get into any more detail: "We'll see where it takes us. We're not really saying from a product point of view what we will do, but we are being straightforward that it's a core technology that we view as very important."

It’s the latest mobile operating system of Apple that can change your iPhone and iPad. But it’s a significant upgrade for Apple’s new tablet. The latest iPad Pro can be a real laptop replacement for some people. Thanks to its revamped iOS. In this post, let’s talk about the top features of iOS 11. Some of them were announced at Apple’s WWDC 2017. 1. It can scan QR Codes on Router It means that you no longer have to type in the Wi-Fi passwords. iOS 11 comes with a QR code reader enabling users to scan the code on the router and connect to the network instantly. Another interesting function is that you can send your password over-the-air to another device, like your iPad. From your iPad, it’ll automatically fill all the required fields so the device can connect. This feature is built in the native camera. It’s designed to start apps and websites after it reads the code. Now, when you line your camera to the reader that comes with a QR code, your device notifies you if you like to join the network. To connect, simply tap the connect button. With this function, it makes a lot easier to connect when you’re in a restaurant, airport and other establishments offering free Wi-FI. This feature is almost the same as the AirPods pairing. Those who are connected to the network will see a notification informing them that another device wants to connect to the network. Unfortunately, older iDevices can’t enjoy this function. 2. It has a dock. The latest iPad Pro is designed as a laptop replacement for some people. With iOS 11, replacing it will be a lot easier. Thanks to the “dock” that’s similar to a Mac computer. Although it’s hidden, you can access it by swiping it up. With the bottom app dock, you can quickly jump from one app to another, just like on your MacBook. 3. It allows drag and drop. It’s another standout feature of iOS 11. With this feature, you can move images, for instance, between applications. However, this feature is limited to iPad because the company wants to make it as a PC replacement. Then again, this function is buried inside the iOS filesystem. It works the same way on iPad. That is, you can drag an image from Photos to an iMessages thread. It can also work with links and bookmarks. However, you can’t enable it without the use of an iOS simulator. Although it’s not available on iPhone, this cool feature allows iPad to feel different from other tablets. It’s the first to offer such functionality. 4. It offers updates to camera and photos apps. Apple has new photo and video formats. For video, it now supports HEVC and HEIF for images. These new formats can shrink photo and videos sizes up to 50 percent. With this feature, it can save valuable storage space on the iDevice. Unfortunately, these formats are only available on the new iPads and iPhones. The iOS 11 features new editing options. With these options, you can choose a portion of the Live Photo that looks best. The new iOS also allows cropping of Live Photos. It also features new Bounce and Long Exposure options, as well as Loop. Bounce works like Loop. That is, it loops over and over, just like a GIF. The only difference is that Bounce forwards and backwards. The Long Exposure option combines your Live Photo video and place it in a single shot to give a blur effect. The Photos app has new dynamic support when you view Memories video through portrait or landscape mode. Through machine learning improvements, more types of Memories videos are generated. 5. It has Files app iOS 11 introduces a Files app. It’s a new application that allows you to sort all your files. In here, you can browse, search and organize your files in one place. What’s great about it is that it lets you sort files from your other iOS devices, in iCloud Drive, Box, Google Drive and other services. This is truly one way to say that Apple wants the iPad Pro to be the main computer for some people who don’t like using an iMac or MacBook. 6. It offers seamless iCloud syncing of iMessages. With that in mind, iMessages will no longer take up your iDevice’s storage anymore. It means that when you delete an iMessage conversation on your iPad, that conversation will also disappear on your iPhone and MacBook. As a result, it frees up iMessage storage. iMessages can take up a lot of space in your iDevice. All those messages are in the “Other” storage. Once iOS 11 is available, all iMessages are backed up to iCloud. 7. It offers person-to-person payment features. Upgrading to iOS 11 lets you use Apple Pay’s person-to-person payment feature. It works the same way as PayPal and Venmo. The only difference is that it’s offered in an app-free solution. Apple Pay payments utilize Touch ID to authenticate a transaction. Then, it uses iMessages to send payment to your friends or contacts. With this payment option, there’s no more excuse for you not to pay back your friends. 8. It enables lock screen and notification center in one place. In iOS 11, lock screen and notification center are joining forces. That is, you can now easily see old alerts you’ve missed. 9. It offers “Do Not Disturb” when driving. The iOS 11 has a Do Not Disturb feature while driving. With this feature, all notifications are shut off when you’re behind the wheel. This feature lets you drive safely. The best part of this function is that it sends a text to those people who are contacting you with a message that you’ll get back to them shortly. To break through this feature, you can enter the word “urgent” so you can get in contact with someone while driving. More Features We can’t use these features yet because the official release of iOS 11 is still three months away. However, developers continue to discover new features now and then.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Worse Than Domestic Obama Cronyism? Exporting It Globally Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Worse Than Domestic Obama Cronyism? Exporting It Globally Posted at 11:02 am on June 13, 2017 by Seton Motley Share on Facebook Share on Twitter We just narrowly escaped the cronyism-infested eight years of the Barack Obama Administration. If you were a Leftist – the $4-trillion-per-year-government world was your oyster. The biggest bureaucratic favors of your wildest imaginings – were only a campaign contribution away. Cronyism is one of the largest, slimiest critters in the Swamp against which now-President Donald Trump ran – promising to drain and dismantle. Which he – sporadically, in fits and starts – has started to do. But as difficult as is unwinding the century-plus-long Swamp expansion – it got dramatically harder when the Obama-esque cronyism leaked out beyond our borders. A fortnight ago we wrote of the DC Cronies working together to maximize their domestic cronyism when it comes to illegally strip-mining intellectual property (IP) protections: “One of the other biggest…Crony beneficiaries – was Apple. You know, that tiny little $800 billion company – that really needs as much government assistance as they can muster. (Note: that was sarcasm.) “A couple of years ago, Apple declared war on Qualcomm – and enlisted the Obama Administration to aid in the assault. “Qualcomm had the audacity to invent the fundamental components of what makes an iPhone an iPhone – and then charge Apple to use them. To which Apple strenuously objects. “Without Qualcomm’s inventions, Apple’s iPhone – is just a very shiny, very skinny telephone. No Internet connection. No email. No apps. No videos. None of any and everything that makes the iPhone – worth the at least $750 per Apple charges us. “For making that $750 minimum charge possible, Qualcomm charges Apple…less than $20 per phone. Get that? For all of the essential intelligent guts combined – Qualcomm charges Apple less than 3% of what Apple charges us. Apple charges us that much – for one USB power adapter. “And Apple doesn’t want to pay even that. Even though they signed contracts – agreeing to pay that. “So now Apple has sued Qualcomm. And has unilaterally, preemptively declared that they won’t pay Qualcomm the tiny fraction of what they charge us. They’ll keep making the iPhones. They’ll keep charging us nearly $1,000 per for them. They just won’t pay Qualcomm for making the whole process possible. Trending NEW POLL: Did Trump Try to Obstruct Justice in the Russia Investigation? Susan Wright “And all along the way – the Obama Administration Turkeys were helping Apple destroy the next generation of all things iPhone. And by extension – all things economy. And on their way out the door – they took two even worse, more damaging steps…. “What these Obama changes do – is declare a brand new government war on IP. Via antitrust law. Which is a novel, totally terrible idea. Here – and all over the rest of the global market planet.” And there it is. Obama’s awful, crony, anti-economy assault on IP – has gone global. China (Huawei) and South Korea (Samsung) each have domestic competitors to U.S.-based Qualcomm – working the same side of the technological IP street. Qualcomm thus far has been in the innovation lead – and thus is a target. Of the Obama Administration – and governments all over the world. So China and South Korea are importing the Obama Crony IP Assault model (undoubtedly with other governments to follow) – to further the theft from and destruction of Qualcomm. So as to favor their domestic cronies. The Korean Government Takes Aim at U.S. Giant Qualcomm China’s Huawei Battles to Own the Next Generation of Wireless Technology In the United States, patents – like the ones Qualcomm hold and are having stolen – are by specific name protected in our Constitution. South Korea has some pretty good laws written to protect patents. The problem is – the Korean government ignored these laws as they steamrolled and railroaded Qualcomm: “The Korea Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”), which is roughly equivalent to our FTC Bureau of Competition, fined Qualcomm $850+ million USD, the largest fine in South Korean history, for allegedly engaging in three types of anti-competitive activity…. “Without going into the actual merits of KFTC’s case against Qualcomm, the KFTC appears to have engaged in multiple political and procedural irregularities that should nullify its decision and fine. “For example, the KFTC denied Qualcomm certain procedural safeguards that the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (“KORUS”) guarantees to American companies, such as Qualcomm’s right to cross-examine witnesses and right to examine all evidence in KFTC’s case file, including exculpatory evidence. The KFTC also contravened more than twenty years of industry practices and standards regarding patent royalties, i.e. estoppel. These are basic rights that are important parts of the fair and impartial rule of law, and KORUS itself.” And unfortunately, China…is China. They don’t really have the sort of patent and process protections the U.S. and Korea have (not that the U.S. or Korea adhered to them here). So China too is steamrolling and railroading Qualcomm. This is omni-directionally terrible. If no one can protect the things they spend a whole lot of time and money developing – no one will spend any time or money developing anything. And our entire Information Economy – comes to a screeching, crashing halt. If the governments charged with protecting these developments instead begin actively attacking the developers – behold, again, the screeching, crashing halt. And that’s a free market problem – that will very quickly beget a free speech problem. Right now, 80% of an iPhone is produced in totalitarian, anti-freedom, Communist China. Thankfully, the most important 20% – the brains that make the iPhone the iPhone – are owned by Qualcomm in the good old US of A. If China and Korea (and the cavalcade of governments to come, all following the Obama lead) succeed in crushing Qualcomm – China will very happily have their company Huawei finish off the iPhone. Let us imagine what an end-to-end China cell phone will look like. Google Quietly Gives Up Its Fight To Combat Censorship In China: “Google has quietly removed a feature that warned Chinese citizens when they were searching for terms banned by the Chinese government, reports Chinese censorship watchdog site, Greatfire.org. “For instance, when people tried to search for the term ‘freedom’ from mainland China, they would get a pop-warning from Google that said, ‘We’ve observed that searching for [freedom] in mainland China may break your connection to Google for a short while. This interruption is outside of Google’s control,’ and it would give the person the option to change the search term or search anyway. “At some point in the first week of December, the warning stopped being displayed and the help article that explained how to use the feature was removed. This after months of games over it, where the Chinese government found ways to disable it and Google found ways to bring the warning back.” Do you want this Chinese domestic censorship – exported globally via millions of all-Chinese iPhones? Neither do I. Apple’s giant pettiness and short-sightedness – is really very stupid. And our government (via our courts) – should very quickly knock them back into Reality. Instead, our Obama government sided with the short-sighted – undermining the very essence of our $18+ trillion economy. And served as a poisonous visual aide – for very bad governments all over the globe. Thankfully, Obama is gone. Trump should as quickly as possible staff up the relevant agencies – to end these inertia-backed ongoing anti-economy actions. And Trump should go global – and defend American companies getting royally fleeced all over. It is – amongst many other very good things – precisely what “America First” is all about.

Name: Subject: Message: LG continues to dominate large panel market, eyes mobile OLED displays Newsby Brian Reigh3 days ago 4 817 10 The latest data indicate that LG Display is still No. 1 in the global large display panel market, boasting the world’s highest shipments for 30 consecutive quarters. See also: LG will ramp up OLED display production to keep up with increasing demand 2 weeks ago LG’s mobile phone division may not be doing so spectacularly, but LG Display is an entirely different story. Thanks to its robust television sales as well as lucrative deals with companies like Apple, LG Display has retained its position as the No. 1 large display panel manufacturer in the world for 30 consecutive quarters. According to HIS Markit, a British financial services company, the South Korean display manufacturer has shipped 35.42 million units during the first quarter of this year. Thanks to its robust television sales as well as lucrative deals with companies like Apple, LG Display has retained its position as the No. 1 large display panel manufacturer. LG Display’s Q1 shipment of 9-inch or larger display panels accounted for 21.4 percent of the total global market share, which decreased by 8 percent compared to last year’s Q1 to 165 million units. A close second was BOE Display at 21 percent; the Chinese manufacturer has been expanding its OLED business and is rumored to be working with Apple for next-generation iPhones. Samsung Display, on the other hand, posted a 10 percent share, ranking fifth globally. This is not all too surprising since apart from its televisions, the company remains committed to small- and mid-sized OLED displays, practically monopolizing the market. However, that may change in the future as LG is reportedly looking to transform its P10 production facility in Paju, Korea to manufacture mobile OLED displays. The facility was originally designed for large OLED panels for televisions, but with the exponential growth of the mobile OLED business, the South Korean electronics company may be devising a new plan. After all, LG is expected to debut its first flagship with an OLED screen later this year. HIS Markit’s report on small- and mid-sized display panel market is set to be released later this month, so stay tuned for that. Would you like to see an LG-made flagship smartphone with an OLED screen? Do you think LG will continue to dominate the large panel market despite competition from Chinese and Taiwanese companies?

To qualify as a green bond, Apple has to pledge to use the proceeds on items such as renewable energy projects, green buildings, and resource conservation efforts. Combined with Apple's $1.5 billion green bond issued last year, the new debt will make Apple the single largest U.S. dollar-denominated issuer in the market niche. The bond offering comes days after President Trump announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord, a move Apple opposed. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet," Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives and the former head of the EPA, said in a statement. "We're proud to offer investors another opportunity to join us in this important work." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. The idea is to appeal to investors who want to help improve the environment. Globally, the green bond market should exceed $200 billion this year, more than double the $93 billion in issued in 2016, Moody's Investors Service said in January. Some new mutual funds, like the Mirova Global Green Bond fund, are investing almost entirely in the green securities. Apple and other major tech companies including Microsoft (msft) and Facebook (fb) sent a letter to the president opposing the Paris accord departure. "We believe the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort," the group wrote. Apple (aapl) says it covers the power needs of 100% of its facilities with renewable energy commitments in 24 countries including the United States and China. Overall, 96% of the electricity Apple uses worldwide is covered by renewable purchases.

X All the ways Apple’s iOS 11 will change your iPhone The new operating system for iPhones and iPads will be rolled out this Autumn Tue, Jun 13, 2017, 15:30 Apple’s latest iOS updates will include changes to Apple Pay and Siri. Photograph: Reuters         After Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference last week, everybody was talking about new hardware. The company introduced its new HomePod speaker, a competitor to Amazon’s Echo, and unveiled a new iMac Pro, along with upgraded iMacs and MacBooks. The company also announced an update to its mobile operating system – the one that powers the millions of iPhones and iPads that have become a common part of everyday life for many people. Apple will roll out iOS 11 this Autumn, with a host of new features. What are they? Let’s take a look. ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving’ We all know how dangerous texting, or using your phone in general, while driving can be, but it doesn’t stop people from thinking they can get away with it. Plus, buzzing alerts on your phone are distracting even if you don’t look at them (and sometimes it seems like they never stop). Apple’s next update will include a possible solution to that problem: it will automatically block notifications when your phone thinks you are behind the wheel. Texts sent via iMessage will also be intercepted. When one arrives, the phone will send an automatic reply saying you are driving and that you’ll respond when you get to your destination. (You can programme your phone to let some numbers through the blockade, so loved ones can reach you in a pinch.) When the phone has determined that you’ve stopped driving, your screen will come back to life, and you can catch up on everything you’ve missed. Customisable Control Centre The Control Centre, that panel full of easily-accessed buttons and tools you see when you swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen, will also get an overhaul in the new update. Soon all the controls will be on one colourful, widget-filled page. Some have complained that the new layout is confusing and cluttered, but it doesn’t have to be: The Control Centre will be customisable, so you can add as many (or as few) widgets as you like, including quick access to your camera, calculator or Apple TV. Additionally, there’s a new toggle for the iPhone’s “Low Power” mode, designed to save battery life while you’re out without a spot to charge your phone. The new Control Centre also features quick accessibility settings, including options to magnify your screen, change the brightness, make text display larger (or smaller), enable Do Not Disturb mode, and more. And each setting now makes use of Apple’s “3D Touch” feature, where pressing and holding on an icon brings up additional useful options. Siri will get to know you. Well. Siri, Apple’s personal assistant programme, will get an overhaul too. The company said the programme will soon have “a new, more natural voice” that will be more “expressive” than the robotic lilt it currently has. At the conference last week, some audio of both the male and female voices were played to showcase its more nuanced pronunciations. But the biggest changes for Siri will be under the bonnet, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence. Here is what that means: Apple says Siri will learn so much from you that it will be able to anticipate your needs and make suggestions before you even ask for them. For example, it will offer news stories based on things it has learned you like. If you’re texting a friend about a film you saw or a place you visited, Siri will auto-type the name of the movie or the place. It will suggest new searches for you in Safari based on articles you’ve read. It will automatically queue up songs you like, suggest songs it thinks you will like or answer trivia questions about songs you play. Siri is going to know a lot about you. ‘Offload Unused Apps’ iOS 11 will also help save storage on your phone. When your storage runs low, a new optional feature will automatically remove apps you don’t use very often. It is called “Offload Unused Apps” and you can turn it on by going to Settings, then tapping General. The selected apps are removed, and you get back all of the space they were using, which can be especially useful for people who’ll need to make room for more photos, for phone updates, or just to download music or movies for a long flight. Don’t worry, though. Your phone will keep any data you have associated with the deleted app, which will display as a gray icon after it has been removed. If you ever want to reinstall it, all you have to do is tap the gray icon and everything is back to the way it was. (Even before iOS 11 is released, users may find themselves receiving warnings about some apps that have not kept pace with Apple’s changes.) Apple Pay via text message Apple’s mobile payment system, Apple Pay, will also get a boost with the new update. Using your credit or debit card, you will be able to send money to anyone who also uses iOS11 with just a text message, which can be especially useful for splitting the check at a restaurant, paying someone gas money, or even paying the rent if you’re close with your landlord. You even get an electronic receipt that shows the payment went through. Receiving money from someone will be just as easy. Once you’ve been paid via text message you can either use Apple Pay to spend that money at stores and online or you can transfer it to your bank account. If you already use Apple Pay to pay for purchases at participating retailers, the ability to quickly send and receive money from other iPhone users may appeal to you.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# Mandsaur ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Exam results 2017 Kulbhushan Jadhav News Technology News Apple issues $1 bln green bond after Trump's Paris climate exit Shares0 Tue, 13 Jun 2017-08:25pm , Reuters Apple Inc offered a $1 billion bond dedicated to financing clean energy and environmental projects on Tuesday, the first corporate green bond offered since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement. The offering comes over a year after Apple issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion - the largest issued by a U.S. corporation - as a response to the 2015 Paris agreement. Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products. The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials. Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten - an attempt to address criticism that Apple's products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart. Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius.

It looks like Google is getting awful serious about designing its own smartphone processors. The company recently hired an engineer named Manu Gulati from Apple, according to Variety. Gulati has at least 15 Apple patents related to chip design under his belt and will be key in Google's plan to build its own processors, Variety said. Apple currently builds its own smartphone processors but Google does not. Apple's newest A10X chips, for example, are built-in house instead of by companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Qualcomm currently supplies its Snapdragon processor for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Gulati's LinkedIn profile says he's now Google's "lead SOC architect." SoC stands for "system on a chip." Gulati worked at Apple for almost 8 years as a micro-architect and has also been employed by Broadcom and AMD. If Google begins building processors in house, like Apple, it would potentially cut down on Google's reliance on Qualcomm. That may not be a big hit for Qualcomm, at least not yet, since the company still provides millions of its Snapdragon processors to smartphone makers such as Samsung, LG, HTC and others. Still, this is a significant trend in the smartphone market. Other firms, such as Huawei and Samsung, have also started to build chips in-house, allowing them to rely less on potential supply restraints from outside parties. A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment. Google confirmed Manu is now working for Google but declined to provide additional details. Read the full Variety report.

The Surface Laptop is a simple product, but it’s an exciting one. It’s the first real laptop from Microsoft, and it might just offer the perfect mix of style and substance. Whereas the Surface Book and Surface Pro are hybrid devices with fancy flippy screens, futuristic hinges and – in my opinion, anyway – numerous obvious drawbacks, the Surface Laptop is exactly what its name implies. This is a laptop for everyone, the same way the MacBook Air was before Apple bizarrely left it to rot. Windows laptops have been getting gorgeous for a while now, with Huawei and HP leading in the style stakes with metal bodies, and Dell impressing with its more business-like XPS series. The Surface Laptop sits in the middle; it feels more playful but no less classy. The outer shell is metal, and it’s dimensions are slightly smaller than Apple’s most iconic laptop. Open the display and you’ll find a soft fabric covering the keyboard. It’s called Alcantara, and while it isn’t new for the Surface line – it was possible to buy a Surface Pro Type Cover with it on – it’s the first time I've used a laptop that offers something other than metal or plastic to lean on. Alcantara is soft and has an appearance that isn't too dissimilar to felt. Microsoft says it's resistant to splashes and is easy to wipe down if it becomes messy. Having only used the Surface Laptop for about a day so far, the benefits of the material are already obvious. First, it’s soft – much more so than cold metal. Leaning against it for long periods is noticeably more comfortable, making typing a more pleasant experience. There are unknowns, however. How will it wear over time? Will it come unstuck from the metal base? Nevertheless, the design seems nice enough. The keyboard itself is good and wide, with well-spaced keys that have plenty of travel. The glass trackpad, too, is great – although I do notice the smaller size when coming from the MacBook Pro. Related: Best laptops Microsoft is meant to be aiming this device squarely at students, but it doesn’t really seem to be skimping on any particular area that would put off those that don’t fit that demographic. The 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen is beautifully sharp and vivid, while the 3:2 aspect ratio is ideal for reading and skipping through photos. It supports the Surface Pen, but you'll have to buy it separately. Internal options start with the £979 base model with a Core i5 and 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD, but I'd recommend jumping up a tier to £1249, which gets you double the storage and RAM. £2149 will bag up 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM and a Core i7. Pre-Order: Microsoft Surface Laptop at Microsoft.co.uk from £799 The port selection Microsoft has chosen has whipped up something of a controversy, for precisely the opposite reason Apple incited much dismay when it updated its MacBook Pros last year. Whereas Apple opted for purely USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, Microsoft has stuck with a far less future-gazing array of connectors. One side has a USB 3 Type-A port, headphone jack and mini-DisplayPort; the other side houses the Surface Connector for charging. For me, the lack of even one USB-C is a shame, especially since it’s far from the unknown quantity it was 12 months ago. Still, Microsoft said that it plans to sell a dongle to add in some of the USB-C functionality at a later date. Unlike most other Windows laptops, the Surface Laptop doesn’t come running Windows 10 out of the box. Instead, it comes with a version called Windows 10 S that focuses on security and better performance over time. The biggest user-facing difference is that Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, rather than any application downloaded from the internet. This means that, currently, you can’t install Spotify, Steam, iTunes or even browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. It’s limiting, no doubt, but Microsoft claims it’s to aid students and schools to bulk-install apps onto machines and keep them more secure. If you want more freedom, and I'd suspect most people spending £1000 on this laptop will, then you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free for 12 months. We’ll save most of our battery scores for the final review, but if Microsoft’s claim of 14 hours is correct then this could be something special. Pre-Order: Microsoft Surface Laptop at Microsoft.co.uk from £799 First Impressions The Surface Laptop is sleek and unique in its design, it has a lovely screen and feels fast and fluid to use. It's an exciting proposition that seems to be have been executed very well. 0 shares Read Comments toboev June 13, 2017, 3:38 pm "you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free *for* 12 months" for 12 months, or "within 12 months"? Word Merchant June 14, 2017, 8:46 am Given how very low my expectations of anything from Microsoft are, then, yes, it just might. Word Merchant June 14, 2017, 8:46 am Probably 'for'.

By Nicholas Quah June 13, 2017, 11 a.m. June 13, 2017, 11 a.m. Editor’s note: Hot Pod is a weekly newsletter on the podcasting industry written by Nick Quah; we happily share it with Nieman Lab readers each Tuesday. Welcome to Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. This is issue 123, published June 13, 2017. We’ve got a lot to talk about. RELATED ARTICLE HomePod, death to autoplay, and a smarter Apple News: These are the key Apple updates for publishers June 5, 2017“It may look obscure,”tweeted Gimlet’s Matt Lieber, “but this is the biggest thing to happen to the podcast business since Serial first went nuclear.” Lieber was talking about a major announcement that came out of the podcast session at WWDC, the Apple developer conference, which took place on Friday. It was a piece of business delivered with relatively little fanfare — par for the course, I think, with the nature of Apple’s historically chill relationship with podcasts —  and Lieber’s right. This is a very big deal, and a lot of change is on the way. Here’s the headline: Apple is finally opening up in-episode analytics for podcasts. The data will be anonymized, consistent with Apple’s general stance on privacy, and the new analytics layer is scheduled to arrive with the iOS 11 update this fall. This means that podcast publishers will, at long last, receive data that tells them just how much of their episodes are actually being listening to — within the Apple Podcast app, at least, which is still largely understood to serve the majority of listening. (Estimates, however sampled, tend to range between 60 and 80 percent). Previously, podcast consumption was chiefly conceptualized based on downloads, a black box metric that’s criticized as lacking the level of granularity that are table stakes for advertisers buying on digital platforms in 2017. With this announcement, that measurement issue — long articulated as the defining problem of the medium — can finally be meaningfully interrogated, with many believing that the hurdle impeding advertisers from committing more dollars to the space can be thrown out the window. But some are also arguing this change will bring a mixed bag of consequences, and in some ways, the new data puts the space at risk of snuffing out various dynamics that make it special. Which is to say, while there’s a hope that this will finally lead to podcasting realizing its full economic potential, the shadow of Web 2.0 looms large. The WWDC session also contained a few other useful announcements, including a design overhaul for Podcasts app and new extensions to feed specifications that would give publishers more control over how they can present episodes within RSS feeds. Among other things, publishers will now have the ability to bundle episodes by season and signal which episodes are actual content versus extras like trailers. Noted Apple writer Jason Snell has a good rundown on this over at his blog, and you can check out the spec document here. And as I mentioned last week, this is probably what the redesign looks like, courtesy of this Reddit thread. (Once again, your mileage may vary with sourcing Reddit.) But let’s get back to the analytics stuff. Since Friday’s announcement — which you can watch in full at this link, but only on the Safari browser, because Apple — there’s been a ton of writing appraising the matter, and in case you’d like a quick primer, I recommend this write-up by Recode’s Peter Kafka, which also contains screenshots of the upcoming analytics dashboard. (I’m going spelunking in some rabbit holes here, so a primer this is not.) Here, we’ll attend to wonkier questions: What does this new analytics universe portend? How will the podcast business change? If so, who wins and who loses? I wasn’t born a prophet, so I don’t know how exactly this will play out, but I do have some notes and assessments on a bunch of the key issues. This write-up is by no means comprehensive, and I’ll be exploring more questions in future issues as we deal with the consequences of announcements. For now, let’s jump in, and we’ll move through a bunch of topics. Just double-checking: Is this really a big deal? Yep, I’m pretty certain it’s massive, but it’s worth weighing the counter-argument. Even if Apple serves a majority of all listeners, the argument goes, it doesn’t account for the whole listening universe, and as such there might be muted effects to how this ends up moving the way business is being done. I’m not sure I’d buy much stock in that view: first, not only does most listening quantitatively happen on Apple, the company is qualitatively synonymous with the space. Second, there still doesn’t appear to be a strong alternative to Apple with a big enough consolidated market share that could meaningfully challenge (or avoid) the way Apple defines audience measurement. Which means that, in June 2017, it’s still feasible to think that whenever Apple says jump, most folks are still pretty much going to make like Durant. How will the new analytics layer change the way we currently understand podcast audiences in the aggregate? A couple of parts to this: (1) Many believe that an ecosystem-wide audience resizing is in the cards. Because the vast majority of podcast audience appraisal is conducted based on downloads — and because we don’t actually know what happens to an episode after it’s downloaded — the way podcast audiences are represented, understood, and sold is almost certainly going to change. Just about everyone I spoke to frames this in terms of some form of downsizing, which makes intuitive sense, because there will always be some percentage of episodes being downloaded that are left unlistened (and ads left unserved). But the positive spin I’m given is that this change nevertheless comes with a higher level of accountability, and the gains in trust from advertisers will likely lead to much greater gains over the long term. As Matt Turck, Panoply’s chief revenue officer, puts it, “I’m assuming we will see listener numbers fall short of download numbers; however, the benefit to making analytics far less mysterious should vastly outweigh the concern.” (2) That said, there remains the possibility that the new in-episode analytics layer might reveal inconvenient truths about audience behavior. I’ve been told there are a few non-Apple tools and platforms (like Spotify and some third-party listening apps) with in-episode analytics already in the market, and while they only supporting a minority share of listening, the consumption data they’ve been collecting suggests there’s nothing especially revolutionary hiding in those new numbers. Aaron Lammer, of Longform and Stoner, is one among the skeptical. “I would push back against the idea that there is some great insight lurking in these analytics,” he said when we chatted over Twitter. “As people who’ve set up elaborate app-based analytics hooks where you can track everything will tell you-there isn’t that much interesting… I’d rather look [at] it as standardization rather than revolutionary shift.” That point on standardization, I think, is really important to file away in your head. (3) Bryan Moffett, the COO of National Public Media, made a good observation on how the proliferation of dynamic ad insertion technology might mean the transition to an in-episode analytics world would still contain tricky imprecision. To quote him in full: A dynamic ad server will serve up many different versions of a single episode. They could vary in length by a few minutes or even more. For example, if one user gets an episode of TED Radio Hour with four dynamic :30 sponsorships and a :30 promotion block in its hour of content, but another user for some reason gets the same episode with just two :30 sponsors, the length difference is over a minute and the content is not aligned minute by minute for each episode. Apple’s analytics rolls up all listening to a given episode and averages, so there is bound to be some imprecision. It’s not a lot, and it’s certainly a better world than the one we live in now. It’s never easy shifting gears. How will the podcast business be affected? Time will tell, obviously. But here’s the range of the thinking out there: (1) As I mentioned, there is a sense from some bigger publishers that this new analytics layer will finally allow them to kick open conversations that may meaningfully unlock long coveted brand advertising dollars. Contrary to direct response advertisers, whose intended outcomes (and measurement methodologies) additionally revolve around conversions off promo codes, brand advertisers are generally thought to require a higher level of trust in the impressions being reported back to them. Podcasting’s black-box download-oriented measurement universe has long been described as the primary hurdle preventing brand advertisers from allocating more dollars to the medium, and it is believed that Apple’s in-episode analytics are a significant first step forward in opening up conversations between brand advertisers and podcast publishers across the system (conversations that have to do with perception as much as actualities). (2) But how does this development affect the direct response side of the podcast advertising business? There’s a general belief among the folks I’ve talked to that direct response advertisers, or performance-based advertisers, will likely be stable, though there appears to be suspicion that the new analytics layer presents yet another horizon of opportunities for those advertisers and their respective agencies to haggle more over prices. I’m also being told that there are expectations of some oncoming turbulence/fluctuations in price points, as those advertisers go through the process of figuring out how to integrate this new data layer into their current practices. (3) There are two versions of the apocalyptic view on the business end. The first takes the shape of some worries about ad-skipping, and what the new analytics layer is going to reveal about the extent of this behavior. (For more background on this, read this Wall Street Journal from last summer). The end-times scenario is said to be one where it’s discovered that podcast ads are skipped over at such a volume and intensity as to kill their value. On this front, the responses seem to generally track along the built-in split between brand advertising and performance-based advertising; there is a sense that, even if there is a problem, it would mostly affect the former, while the latter would remain somewhat stable, because conversions are still taken to be more important than impressions. Again, the positive spin I’m served ties back to a sense of greater accountability that the new analytics layer brings into publisher-advertiser interactions: we’ll know who is actually providing value to advertisers, and we’ll know who isn’t doing so as much. As Midroll chief revenue officer Lex Friedman said, “Podcasters who are confident that people are listening to their ads should be very happy about this.” The second apocalyptic argument presents a scenario where podcast CPMs plummet, ultimately leading to the collapse of the market. This view generally draws on a parallel between podcasts and what happened to blogs once the format started experiencing waves of ad tech development. Personally, I can’t quite see the specifics of how this move by Apple could bring those dynamics to podcasting just yet. My understanding of the plummeting blog CPMs pegs the phenomenon to the continuous structural devaluing of blog advertising real estate brought on emerging ad technologies that gave advertisers (and ad tech companies) unchecked leverage. And while I think the broader risk of podcasts possibly going down the road of blogs is absolutely real, I don’t have a sense that this new analytics layer alone automatically leads to a devaluing of podcast advertising real estate. If anything, Acast’s recent rollout of a programmatic podcast advertising product is more likely to incur those types of effects, should the tool ever get traction — this development from Apple strikes me as a step forward that’s small enough to stop short from these effects. Who wins, who loses? (1) Obviously, publishers who have made a practice of inflating download numbers will get checked — though the counterargument that all metrics, without active third-party verification, can be gamed over time is certainly a prudent one. (2) An argument can be made that this system-wide shift to a new analytics standard would usher in a weeding-out period. Podcasts delivering strong ad value will get additional data to strengthen their appeal for more advertising dollars, and podcasts not doing so will be flushed out of the ad market. It would mean that high-performing podcasts would be in a better position to extract more value, while not-so-high-performing podcasts would have a harder time accessing advertising dollars. (3) It should be considered that whatever audience readjustments happen will probably disproportionately and negatively impact smaller podcasters’ ability to derive advertising revenue. Which is to say, just as how every publisher experiences the turbulence of discovering that its meaningful listening audience size is probably going to be smaller than its downloads, smaller podcasts will be whipped around harder, and in some (if not most) cases, that could lead to those shows falling beneath a certain threshold for advertising consideration. That’s bad for podcasts with already relatively small but meaningfully engaged audiences. In these cases, there are presumably two available moves: first, lean deeper into a niche that maintains a specific appeal for relevant advertisers, and second, pursue other non-advertising revenue streams. I suppose, generally speaking, it’s worth keeping in mind that advertisers need to be served value too, and also, advertising isn’t necessarily the only business model available to publishers. Content considerations. Metrics and measurements have long informed the way programs are created, and we should probably expect to see the dynamic express itself further with the new analytics layer. A couple of threads to consider: (1) Knowing just how much of episodes are being listened to presents a much better feedback loop to improve not just editorial products, but also advertising products. And there is also the likely effect that we’ll see the blossoming of new formats, genres, and show structures that come from playing toward what the new metrics tells us. (2) On the flip side, there should also be room for the more general worry that we’re sliding into a world where metrics outweigh creative decisions. I think there’s always room for that concern, regardless of whatever metrics are available — there will, to some extent, always be operators looking to play to the numbers rather than actually use the numbers to make better work. (3) I’m pretty drawn to the question, raised here on Twitter by The Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal, of whether increased data granularity within a medium would lead to the detriment of experimentation within that medium. Instinctively, I feel as if there is some truth to this, but I also suspect experimentation has less to do with the available metric universe and more to do with the ways in which compensation is structured off those metrics. (A quick tangent: I also find myself wondering how “experimental” material is defined; personally, I tend to grade experimental-ness relative to however the medium currently behaves, and think experimental programming will exist in any format regardless of where it is in its life cycle. I think the more interesting question here is about the conditions under which “experimentation” can exist within high-budget and high-scale productions.) I’m not even close to being done, but I’ll leave it here for now. Obviously, this enormous and complex development contains many, many layers, and I’ll continue to dig around and write about them in future issues. (I mean, that’s why Hot Pod exists, right?) Here are some of the questions I’ll be thinking about: To what extent will podcasting go down the road of blogs, and what does that even mean? And should podcasting end up experiencing those same dynamics, what are the differences based on audio as a media format? How will the podcast industry change? Will the professionalizing publishers benefit as they hoped for? What will happen to smaller and indie podcasters? How will podcasting change for audiences? Will we see the industry create more jobs for producers, developers, and assorted media folk? How will the development impact what I’ve described as the bifurcation of the space, with podcasts as extension-of-blogging on one side and podcasts as extension-of-radio on the other? As for my own normative view on all of this, I’m still figuring it out. I do think that the podcast industry is indeed still comparatively tiny, as Recode’s Peter Kafka points out, with podcast ad spending projected to only be about $250 million this year. While it’s growing at a solid and steady rate, it’s still peanuts compared to where radio (about $14.1 billion) is today, and there’s more to be gained and lost from changing how business is being done today. And like Kafka, I do think change was going to happen no matter what. Also, as I mentioned on Twitter, I find myself skeptical about the nostalgia and privileging of the status quo. But that’s a story for another day. Roman Mars, Esquire. New Hampshire Public Radio’s Civics 101 has some new competition in the form of a somewhat surprising side project from the 99% Invisible chief: “What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law” is an explainer podcast that features Mars being taught the basics of constitutional law by UC Davis professor Elizabeth Joh based on ongoing developments in the current iteration of the White House. I’m told that the podcast is officially produced under the Radiotopia banner, which brings the number of Radiotopians with two podcasts up to two (the other is Hrishikesh Hirway, who makes both Song Exploder and the West Wing Weekly for the indie podcast collective). Mars’ new podcast comes mere days before the launch of another new Radiotopia podcast, Ear Hustle. That’s scheduled to roll out later this week. Career spotlight. Spend enough time in the New York podcast scene — or any major city with a podcast scene, really — and you’re bound to bump into someone who came up through WNYC, which was once the city’s only major institution dealing with narrative radio. In this week’s Career Spotlight, we’re bumping into Leital Molad, who currently leads podcast development for the Pierre Omidyar-backed First Look Media. Hot Pod: What do you do? Leital Molad: I’m the executive producer of podcasts at First Look Media. In a nutshell, I develop and produce podcasts for The Intercept (First Look’s investigative news site) and Topic (our entertainment studio). Right now we have two podcasts in production, Politically ReActive and Intercepted. I oversee those shows week to week, working with the producers, giving editorial notes, and liaising with our business team on the marketing side. The other big part of my job is taking pitches for new shows, creating pilots, and bringing projects to launch. Since I got to First Look last October, we launched three shows: Maeve in America, Intercepted and Missing Richard Simmons. HP: Where did you start, and how did you end up in this position? Molad: I started as an intern at WNYC in 2000. The next year I got a full time job as a production assistant for Studio 360 with Kurt Andersen, and spent the next 15 years working on that show, ultimately running it as senior producer. My last year at WNYC I launched and EP’ed a health podcast, Only Human. I started thinking about my next career move and figured that this podcast renaissance was a great time to break out of my cozy public radio cocoon and try something new. So I took the leap and went to First Look — a media startup that was just getting into podcasting. HP: How did you learn to do the job? Molad: WNYC was an amazing place to learn everything I know about radio and audio. I got to wear many hats, ranging from basic show production — booking guests, writing scripts, cutting tape — to reporting my own stories, producing documentaries, and running live events. And I learned a ton about launching new shows after working on Only Human, which has been very helpful in my new job. Also, having been in the trenches with audio production (which I love), I can be a better manager of producers and engineers. Getting new shows off the ground at a startup often means being able to jump in on production when needed, and that’s been invaluable. HP: When you started out, what did you think wanted to do? Molad: After college, I didn’t land on what I wanted to do until I was brainstorming with a family friend who offered to help with some career advice. He asked me, “If you could have anyone’s job, who would it be?” Right away I said, “Terry Gross.” He said, “Well, that’s what you need to do!” I had been a DJ at my college station and an avid listener of public radio, and those two things just clicked. I wasn’t sure how to become the next Terry Gross; eventually I figured I should go to journalism school. So I came to New York for grad school at NYU, and then, very luckily, landed the internship at Studio 360. My dream of hosting evolved into an appreciation and desire for producing, which I fell in love with.  Maybe I’ll still host a show some day, we’ll see!  (You know, they say anyone can start a podcast with a laptop and a microphone…) Molad adds that she’s on the lookout for more female voices, and that interested parties should get in touch.

Entertainment | 05 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (25) Apple Will Enter Smart Speaker Market in December with HomePod by Adam C. Engst With the announcement of the HomePod during the WWDC keynote today, Apple finally put the brakes on the endless speculation about whether the company would release a smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s popular Echo and its Google Home competitor. However, Apple didn’t just wade into the fray with a me-too product. In fact, during the announcement, the whole “smart” part of the “smart speaker” didn’t warrant mention until near the end. Instead, Apple focused its attention on the “speaker” features of the HomePod. Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said that Apple has been working for years to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home, and to that end, the company first designed the HomePod to be a great speaker. It’s just under 7 inches (17 cm) tall and is covered in a 3-D mesh fabric. It features an array of seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own driver, and precision acoustic horns that can direct sound in any direction. Bass comes from a 4-inch Apple-designed woofer that faces upward to move a lot of air, and software provides automatic bass equalization to avoid distortion as the volume increases. All this is powered by Apple’s A8 chip, which the company first used in the iPhone 6. It provides real-time acoustic modeling, audio beam-forming, and multi-channel echo cancellation. Since speakers live in different rooms with radically different acoustic properties, the HomePod has spatial awareness, in that it can detect its surroundings and adjust the music to match. It even knows if there’s a second HomePod in the room, and if so, it changes how it emits sound to provide the best possible listening experience. Apple is also using the HomePod’s processing capabilities and its array of six microphones to let you control it via Siri. Control what? Music, of course, and Apple assumes that you’ll have an Apple Music subscription. To that end, Apple has expanded Siri’s vocabulary when it comes to music. Plus, the HomePod will connect directly to Apple Music, so you won’t have to play music through another device, although we expect that will be possible as well. What about all the other stuff that people have become accustomed to asking of the Echo and Google Home smart speakers? Apple got to this at the very end, almost as an afterthought. You’ll be able to ask Siri for news, unit conversion, stock info, weather forecasts, traffic reports, sports scores, and more. You’ll also be able to send messages, make reminders, set alarms and timers, and control HomeKit devices. Apple emphasized the privacy aspects of the HomePod. Until you say “Hey, Siri,” all recognition happens only locally. Only after you utter that trigger phrase is any data sent to Apple, where it’s associated with an anonymous Siri ID. All communications are end-to-end encrypted. Why didn’t Apple plug the virtual assistant features of the HomePod more? We have a few theories: It’s possible that Apple’s research shows that what people do most with smart speakers is listen to music. That’s certainly been our experience. Many of the things these smart speakers can do are better done elsewhere or are trivial examples. They’re good at bar trivia questions like who won the Super Bowl in 1967, but how often do you really wonder about such questions? Although Apple would never admit this, it’s also possible that Siri doesn’t work as well as Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant technologies. Evaluating this would be difficult, and it’s likely that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The HomePod will cost $349, which is a lot more than the smart speaker competition. The Amazon Echo Dot is $49.99, the Echo is $179.99, and the Echo Show is $229.99. The Google Home runs $129 but can be found for under $100. Apple instead suggested that we should compare the HomePod against the cost of quality Wi-Fi speakers, which are $300 to $500, plus the $50 to $200 cost of a smart speaker. It’s all about how you frame things. Regardless of why Apple chose to focus more on the audio quality of the HomePod than its Siri-driven smarts, we won’t be able to evaluate how well it does at either until it ships, which Apple promised for December 2017 in the United States, UK, and Australia. With other companies, that would be too late for the holiday shopping season, but since Apple sells so much directly, early to mid December should still work. Other countries will have to wait a little longer.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

At WWDC, Apple unveiled the HomePod, its entry into the smart speaker market. Due to ship in December for $349, the HomePod promises to provide high-quality audio and virtual assistant capabilities via Siri. We’ll just have to wait until then to see how it compares with the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices.

I assume that by this statement that there was no indication beyond the Keynote as to whether the HomePod will support AirPlay from a Mac or iOS device. Certainly nothing about that was said during the Keynote itself from what I recall. I have to admit that I am not overly impressed with the HomePod. It would have to be pretty incredibly awesome sound and indispensable integration with the Apple ecosystem (and also support AirPlay...I don't have an Apple Music subscription and have no plan to ever get one as I had subscription services for music and software) for me to consider spending about $200 more for a HomePod than an Echo. And that does not even account for the fact that I am no where near an "audiophile". Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 09:59 Yeah, no indication, but it makes very little sense that it would work only with Apple Music. There are just too many situations where you might want to play audio that's not in Apple Music. I think the allure of the HomePod is twofold: the audio quality and the deep integration with the Apple ecosystem. Being able to set it up merely by holding an iPhone next to it is pretty neat, and you'll be able to send iMessages and control HomeKit devices. As to how it really competes with other products on quality and responsiveness, there's no telling until it ships. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 10:26 Since they also announced AirPlay 2 yesterday, I'm willing to bet that the HomePod supports that. I guess we'll find out more later this year. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-06 10:29 All my devices that are HomeKit compatible can also be controlled by my Echo. And it can controls some that are not HomeKit compatible. So, not sure how "killer" that feature is. Not sure if I would want to use iMessages. After enabling the new messaging feature in the Echo, I turned it off (with Amazon's amazing stupid implementation of only being able to do that by calling them) after I got a notification for a message a 3 am. Amazon definitely jumped the gun on the messaging/calling function...it seems to be a VERY beta status update if not even alpha status. They should have fleshed it out more (the Do Not Disturb is buried in the Alexa app and the requirement to upload ALL of my iPhone contact to Amazon's server as the only option is just stupid...I did not grant permission for that on my iPhone, so after enabling the messaging/calling it was effectively worthless). So, I will be interested to see if Apple's implementation with iMessages is better. And if they do not implement AirPlay or even just Bluetooth, then it is completely worthless to me. As I said, I have no intention of getting an Apple Music subscription. So, the jury is still WAY out for me. Time will tell. I will say it did cause me to think of some "Trash Can, the sequel" jokes however (it does like of look like a perforated, squat Mac Pro). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-06 10:56 I would be a bit surprised if it did not support AirPlay (in the form of AirPlay 2). It would frankly be stupid for it not to support it. But, then Apple does not always do the smart thing, so until I hear them say it or someone I trust hears them say it and reports it, I will remain at least a little skeptical. I would not put it past them to decide "hey, this is a good way to get people to sign up for Apple Music...only have the HomePod play music from Apple Music". It is the "lets lock them in to other services" mentality that Apple has employed in the past, albeit maybe a bit more extreme than past situations if they were to actually do it. Reply Kirby Krieger  2017-06-06 05:30 This appears to be aimed directly at Sonos. Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 10:30 >They’re good at bar trivia questions like who won the Super Bowl in 1956... Seriously? You know there was no Super Bowl before 1967 right? ^_^ I know it was just an example, but it popped me out of the article. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:59 Yeah, it was just a throwaway example in the middle of a marathon 12-hour writing day. Fixed! :-) But in fact, I didn't know that the Super Bowl started in 1967, and when I asked Siri just now, all I got was "Sorry, Adam, I couldn't find any scheduled games or scores matching your request." Clearly Apple should fix that response to say, "Sorry, Adam, but I can't answer that question because the first Super Bowl was in 1967." Interestingly, when I asked Google the same question, it gave me the score for the 1956 NFL championship game. That's pretty good, since the NFL championship was essentially the Super Bowl of the time, since the AFL wasn't formed until 1960, and the Super Bowl was intended to be the AFL/NFL championship game. But I had to research that on my own. Of course, while I find reading about the history of these things somewhat interesting, I can barely remember who won the Super Bowl this year because, well, I just don't care. :-) Personally, now that I try more bar trivia questions, I'm a little offended that Siri doesn't know anything about running. Ask "Who ran the first four-minute mile?" or "What's the world record in the marathon?" and all you get are Web results. Feh! Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 12:44 I should have caught this, since I'm a football fan, but yesterday was a bit of a circus. :-) Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 15:10 I hate when I ask her a question and she gives me the name of a nearby restaurant. Siri! It wasn't even a food related question! Bad Siri! Bad! Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 15:12 Oh! And the more interesting question is "what did they call the Super Bowl trophy in the first few years?" Because it clearly wasn't the Vince Lombardi Trophy since he was still coaching then. But I digress. Reply tom powers  2017-06-06 19:32 From the wikipedia article on "vince lombardi trophy:" Even though [the Superbowl] is a national tournament, the award was initially inscribed with the words "World Professional Football Championship". It was officially renamed in 1970 in memory of NFL head coach Vince Lombardi, after his death from cancer. It was thus presented for the first time as the Vince Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl V when the Baltimore Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16-13. It has also been referred to as the "Tiffany Trophy" after the Tiffany & Co. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 13:25 I'd be interested in this device for playing music off my Mac or my iPhone/iPad to a living room speaker. I don't have/want Apple Music, so I'd be curious if this device will still work for what I'd like to do (AirPlay?). I'm not into any kind of home automation so can this be shut off entirely? Likewise Siri, can I chose to not enable Siri at all on HomePod? Finally, does HomePod use wifi or does it require Bluetooth? I try to keep BT off on all my devices. I'd like to know that I can talk to and use HomePod without having to turn BT on. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:13 I can't answer the other questions, but HomeKit automation is totally optional. You have to purchase and set up devices to use that. HomePod won't suddenly take over your light fixtures and toaster. :-) Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:42 I'd be more worried that by HomePod running HomeKit software (daemon?) it could open ports and listen on them thereby creating a possible vulnerability on my home network. Obviously my toaster from 1972 will always remain just fine. :)) Reply Craig Treleaven  2017-06-06 15:15 So what have we Canadians done that has so deeply offended Apple? We're now late to the party on all sorts of things, HomePod just being the latest. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 16:31 Seriously. Canada has more people than Australia by a good bit, so it must not be based purely on market size. Perhaps Australia is easier due to its proximity to China, where the HomePod will likely be made. Hopefully it will be only a short delay before worldwide release! Reply Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-07 12:44 The delay may have something to do with the radio certification process for wireless devices, which varies from country to country. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:35 Maybe it is to make up for the "released in the fall" bit for High Sierra and iOS 11 that might have offended the Aussies. ;-) Reply Craig Treleaven  2017-06-06 15:21 WWDC has an AirPlay 2 session on Thurs at 4:10 Pacific. Hopefully some questions will be answered there. Wonder if existing Airplay devices will be able to join the AirPlay 2 party with a firmware update or if new hardware is necessary. Would especially suck if the ATV 4 can't. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:11 They confirmed that the Apple TV will act as an AirPlay 2 receiver. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 03:06 I seem to remember it being implied during the keynote that AppleTV would support it. To me, other one is whether or not Airport Express will support it since there is a lot of talk about Apple not continuing with routers. I have used an Airport Express as a cheap option compared to something like a Sonos system for years. I am not too worried about the ability to stream music to multiple speakers directly from my iPhone as in my case, I use the multiroom support of playing from iTunes on my Mac and controlling it with the iTunes Remote app (which it looks like Apple upgraded to 64 bit, so I will be able to keep using it). And that systems works now with my all my AppleTVs (although only one really gets used for this purpose) and the Airport Express without Airplay 2. This is also the reason why I likely won't be too interested in a HomePod. The one AppleTV is hooked to my stereo receiver and its good speakers and the Airport Express is hooked to some rather decent computer speakers. End result is that I have my house fairly well covered for music now. And I already have a "smart home assistant" device covered in the form of an Echo and some Echo Dots. So, I don't have a driving "void" to fill that the HomePod would fit. And that is without even going into the price as a deterrent. Reply Rolando  2017-06-11 12:48 Is there any other connectivity other than Airplay? I'd like to replace an old stereo hooked to the TV? Any mini/digital in ports? Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-13 09:51 As far as I can tell from what Apple has posted, no, it will be AirPlay only. Reply David Stamp  2017-06-13 08:20 Hopefully Apple will include mesh WIFI capability within HomePod units - that way they will really decimate Google Assistant and Amazon Echo sales... Being the main distributed home portal for mesh WIFI means Apple will corner the 'home' market in more ways than one...

Gulati is now a Lead SOC Architect at Google, where he began in May, according to his recently updated LinkedIn profile. Gulati was "instrumental" to the company's efforts to build custom chips for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV, according to the report. Apple's custom silicon ranges from the single-core A4 chip in the original iPad and iPhone 4 to the six-core A10X Fusion chip in the new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At Google, his expertise is expected to help the Mountain View company design custom chips for its own Pixel smartphones. Pixel smartphones are currently powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor, which is the same chip used in several other flagship Android smartphones. But reports claim Google plans to build its own chips, as it takes on the iPhone more directly in the premium smartphone category. Gulati is listed as an inventor on over a dozen Apple patents related to mobile processors and integrated circuity. He has over 20 years of industry experience, including lengthy stints at AMD and Broadcom.

[doublepost=1497366091][/doublepost] I'm sure Apple has a substantial chip design team, but this still sucks for them. Their chip team is one of the best in the world and no other mobile devices can come close to their performance. They're even starting to catch up and in some ways pass Intel's 13" MBP chips with the iPad Pro. It's astounding how far they've come in such a short time. This is a huge hire for Google. I wonder how much money they had to pony up to get this guy as it gives them a big competitive advantage going forward. Wouldn't call it a huge hire.

I'm not saying apple is in trouble or anything like that, but I would absolutely amazed if he isn't able to get others from apple to follow. It's just simply a part of business. I can't tell you how many times when a lead or senior engineer leaves my employer for apple, google, intel, etc. that a few follow him/her. Keep in mind that the architect of the A4 and A5 (or at-least one of the "rockstar" chip designers of our time) Jim Keller left Apple after he worked on those and joined Samsung, AMD and now Tesla. He was instrumental in designing the new Zen architecture for AMD that is giving them a huge resurgence. But the key thing is he left after the A5 and Apple has since created the A6, A7, A8, A9 and A10. All amazing without him being present.

Folks who post about how Apple uniquely poaches others' employees, take note. I don't think anyone says that Apple "uniquely" poaches other employees. Although they are known for sometimes coaxing away all the key members of a small company that won't sell itself to them. In cases like this, though, it's often simply because someone isn't getting to do what they really want, so they jump ship to somewhere they can.

The New York Times reported at the time that that three sources close to the matter confirmed to them that Apple was indeed rethinking Project Titan. "Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. Apple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a 'reboot' of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. In October we did a follow-up report covering Apple's Canadian Office that is focused on developing a carOS with an emphasis on the evolving driverless car market. Today a new report has surfaced regarding Project Titan that sets the record straight.   Apple's CEO Tim Cook finally went on the record about Project Titan. According to Cook, "We're focusing on autonomous systems" as we've been reporting.   Cook further elaborated by stating that "It's a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult A.I. projects actually to work on."   Cook further noted that "There is a major disruption looming there," citing self-driving technology, electric vehicles and ride-hailing. Cook added that "You've got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame."   Cook was also bullish about the prospects for electric vehicles, a market which last week helped Tesla Inc. become the world's fourth-biggest carmaker by market capitalization, even as it ranks well outside the top 10 by unit sales.   Cook lastly noted that "It's a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station." For more on this read the full Bloomberg report here.   Obviously Apple is focused on electric vehicles with his last comment and with Apple's appetitie for driving clean energy, Cook and company will likely have a plan for that sometime down the road as well.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

And for the quiet little village that is the podcast industry, the introduction of an upcoming feature from Apple is likely going to change things forever. In a session about the company’s podcast tools on Friday, Apple announced that it was finally going to provide comprehensive analytics about listener behavior to podcast publishers with the iOS 11 update coming this fall. There are tremendous and wide-reaching implications of this news; in short, we’re nearing a moment of truth, where we’ll finally get to find out if the podcast industry is everything it believes itself to be: uniquely strong in cultivating engaged listeners, capable of driving large amounts of audience, and a legitimate challenge to the radio industry and other content mediums. We’ll also learn whether podcasting really has an ad-skipping problem, as The Wall Street Journal documented last summer, and the degree to which that problem represents an existential threat. The new analytics are something many in the industry, particularly those looking to scale up their businesses and build out media empires, have been seeking for a while now, because such metrics will potentially enable producers to overcome the roadblock that is believed to be preventing more advertising money from flowing into the space: credible measurement accountability, and probably a more reliable general knowability of just how much listening is actually happening within a podcast episode. The story of the podcast business since its inception in 2004 — the first boom (and bust), steady growth over the second half of the aughts, Apple packaging its Podcast app with iOS, and the phenomenon of Serial — has largely been a story of scrappy, hard-fought gains. Much of this has to do with the fact that podcasting has mostly functioned without a level of technological innovation that would have subjected the industry to the modern pressures currently experienced by publishers of other media. And much of that has to do with the fact that Apple, which facilitates the majority of all podcast consumption, hasn’t done much with podcasting since it brought the medium onto its platform more than a decade ago. In the absence of more sophisticated measuring tools during that time, a podcast’s success has chiefly been determined based on the number of downloads — and that’s a problem, or so the story goes, because nobody’s really sure what actually happens to an episode after it’s been downloaded by a listener. That’s been a deal-breaker for bigger advertisers, because they want to know whether people are actually hearing the ads that they’re buying. Instead, podcasting has been able to grow its advertising-driven businesses off the strength of what are called direct-response advertisers: the Mailchimps and Squarespaces and Blue Aprons and all those other companies you’ve probably joked about propping up the podcast space, because they’re able to use promo code conversions to get a sense of whether buying ads in podcasts is working for them. Following Apple’s announcement, the belief is that major brand advertisers are now very much on the table, and that this is the opportunity for the podcast industry to attract Big Money. But some people in the industry are uneasy about what could happen to podcasting, which has thus far behaved like a community hidden in the woods, sheltered from the pressures that accompany steps forward in technological measurability — and, more broadly, the effects of that Big Money. A parallel is being drawn between blogs — often described as once being a weird, free wonderland of creativity and expression — after they began experiencing these types of developments, and what may happen to podcasts and the relatively low-stakes ecosystem they have thus far enjoyed. Such worries include, among others, content and programming being cynically driven by metrics, the introduction of Big Business that would wipe out the freedom and experimentation afforded by the space, and the death of the medium’s independent spirit. Time will tell whether the new efforts by Apple will actually bring podcast companies the fortunes they hope for, and whether, as a result, it will have any sort of adverse effect on the medium. Before this news, the podcast industry was projected to generate about $250 million worth of ad revenue in 2017, a meager sum compared to projections for radio (about $14 billion) this year. If things play out the way industry hopefuls expect, we could see that number — and growth rate — explode. But what happens when a village becomes a city? Things get complicated, the societal structure gets reorganized, and ways of living change forever. There will be a sense of progress — and with it, questions about what progress is supposed to mean.

The largest component in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, Apple fell by more than 6 percent from Thursday's close to Monday's close. That drop took the stock as low as $142.51, after hitting a high of $156.65 in the middle of May. To gauge how much further Apple could fall, one can examine the tech giant's price movement relative to the QQQ, a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, said TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon. "Apple has struggled up around the $156 to $157 resistance levels. It's made a 'double top' over the last two months," Gordon said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." While Apple has appeared to hit resistance in that region, the QQQ has continued to make "higher highs," indicating to Gordon that the stock is a relative underperformer in what has been an up-trending group. "Now, while the uptrend is in question, we'd expect the underperformers — Apple — to lead on the downside despite the heavy action in the [semiconductors] right now," Gordon said. Turning to a chart of Apple itself, Gordon pointed to a line of resistance along the "tops" the stock has made dating back to last fall, from about $120 per share, up to north of $150 per share. Drawing a parallel line of resistance along the stock's low points, thus creating a sort of channel tracking the stock's activity and highlighting the recent angular move down, Gordon determined that "Apple will have a key test of support right around the $140 mark." "Now, it's possible that Apple holds that support level and continues on its merry way. Or else, if we break through $140, that could be a greater issue and this tech sell-off could extend further," he added. Falling along with its tech compatriots on Friday, Apple was under continued pressure on Monday after Mizuho Securities research analyst Abhey Lamba downgraded the stock late Sunday. Lamba cut his rating to neutral from buy, and lowered his price target on the $145 stock to $150 from $160 per share. "The stock has meaningfully outperformed on a YTD basis and we believe enthusiasm around the upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels, with limited upside to estimates from here on out," Lamba wrote. To capitalize on what Gordon sees as a likely move down to the $140 mark, he looks to the options market to buy the July 7 weekly 145-strike puts, and sell the July 7 weekly 140-strike puts, for a total cost of $1.86, or $186 per options contract. If Apple shares were to close above $145 on July 7 expiration, Gordon would lose the premium of $186 he paid for the trade. However, if Apple shares close at or below $140 on July 7 expiration, Gordon would make a maximum profit of $316. The trade breaks even at $143.14. If the trade starts to work against him, Gordon plans to use a "50 percent give-back rule." "If the premium paid gets down about 90 cents, that's going to be half the premium loss," he said, which would lead him to pull out of the trade amid an uptrend that's still intact. "Otherwise, that key test of $140 is what we're shooting for."

Whatever your plans are, cocktails are an essential of summer entertaining: make them easy and breezy, just like the perfect summer evening. To get your party started, NYC mixologist Jaime Rios has created a selection of cocktails containing only three ingredients, including a blast of Alizé Apple, making entertaining this season as easy as flipping the switch to pump your favorite summer beats. Golden Delicious Daiquiri • 2 oz. Alizé Apple • 3/4 oz. Fresh Lime Juice • 1 oz. Pineapple Juice • Shake vigorously for about 10 seconds and strain into martini glass. • Garnish with mist of bitters and a fresh sage leaf. “Alizé Apple has a wonderful fruit-forward sweetness, so there is no need to add sugar to this version of a daiquiri. Lime juice gives tartness for balance, and pineapple juice enhances the apple flavors as well as imparts a touch of frothiness and a velvety texture to the cocktail. Sage and bitters give hints of spice,” says Rios. Bright Nights • 4 oz. Ginger Beer • 2 oz. Alizé Apple • 3/4 oz. Fresh Lime Juice • Add ingredients into highball glass and top with crushed ice. • Swizzle and top with bitters and garnish with candied ginger. Rios explains that in this variation of a Moscow Mule, “the Alizé Apple blends nicely with ginger beer. Fresh lime juice give the drink brightness and the bitters, spice and bite.” La Vie en Vert • 1 1/2 oz. Alizé Apple • 1 oz. Rosé Vermouth • 3 dashes bitters • Combine in a wine glass with ice. Top with sparkling wine of your choice. • Garnish with fresh apples, a fresh rosemary sprig and a lemon twist. “This is your new summer staple. It’s like a refreshing sparkling sangria with the vermouth developing wonderful stone fruit flavors and herbaceous notes, while the bitters lends notes of anise,” says Rios. Each of these cocktails uses the recently released Alizé Apple—available nationwide at $19.99—which is made with premium French vodka and ripe apple flavor. The line’s other flavors include Red Passion, Bleu Passion, Gold Passion and Peach. For more recipes, visit facebook.com/AlizeInColor.

Cook made the comments to Bloomberg in a video interview: "I think there is a major disruption looming there, not only for self driving cars but also the electrification. If you've driven an all electric car it's actually a marvelous experience and it's a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station or gas stations, whatever you call it. Plus, you have ride sharing on top of this, right. So you've got kind of three vectors of change happening generally in the same time frame." "As we look at it, what we're focusing on, what we've talked about focusing on publicly, we're focusing on autonomous systems. Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self driving cars. There are others. We sorta see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on. So autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us and we'll see where it takes us. We're not really saying from a product point of view what we will do but we are being straightforward that it's a core technology that we view as being very important."

Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Ben Geier NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple isn't building its own car after all. At least not in the near future. Instead, CEO Tim Cook says Apple is working on "the mother of all AI projects": self-driving car technology that could establish the company as a major player in the automotive market. Cook discussed Apple's plans in an interview with Bloomberg TV that took place earlier this month but were first reported on Tuesday. It marked the first time that Cook has directly addressed the company's automobile plans, even as rumors have swirled about an "iCar" for much of the past few years. Apple had originally planned on making its own car, according to Bloomberg. But it ultimately changed direction to focus on the artificial intelligence technology that powers driverless cars. Autonomous vehicle systems are a "core technology that we view as very important," Cook said. Meanwhile, Cook remained coy about whether or not Apple would one day produce its own car. "We'll see where it takes us," he said. "We're not really saying from a product point of view what we will do." Driverless cars are not the only major change coming to the auto market. Cook pointed to ride-sharing programs like Uber -- Apple's an investor -- and the electric car revolution as other major pieces of the disruption he said was "looming" over the car industry. "If you've driven an all electric car, it's actually a marvelous experience," he said. "And it's a marvelous experience not to stop at the filling station."

But Tim Cook is finally ready to admit to the world that yes, Apple is working on a self-driving car system. But that doesn’t necessarily mean an Apple automobile is in the works. In an interview with Bloomberg Television following the WWDC keynote, Cook described the autonomous driving system as “a core technology that we view as very important,” but stopped well short of saying Apple was actually building its own car. “We’ll see where it takes us,” he said, coyly. Driving force: Apple’s self-driving car ambition was the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley, so Cook’s revelation here isn’t exactly a major one. But it shows that Apple is serious about autonomous car tech, and let’s face it, Apple has a habit of dominating every field it decides to enter. So Tesla should definitely take notice. Full speed ahead Apple’s car endeavors have been well documented by the rumor mill, with Bloomberg reporting last year that the company cut hundreds of jobs and scaled back its ambitions. At the time, the publication said “hundreds of members of the car team” had been let go or reassigned to other areas of the company, leaving the project somewhat in doubt. However, Bloomberg did report that the project’s new leadership was focusing its efforts on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple “flexibility” to partner with existing carmakers. Based on Cook’s comments, it seems as though that’s exactly what Apple is aiming to do: “We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on,” he said. “So autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us.” Apple According to Tim Cook, Apple's CarPlay platform is just the beginning of its automobile ambitions. Apple entered the car world back in 2014 with CarPlay, an iPhone-powered system that integrates with existing navigation systems to display messages, calls, maps, and music. In iOS 11, a feature called Do Not Disturb While Driving will detect when someone is driving and automatically silence notifications to keep the screen dark and distraction-free. Electric slide Cook is extremely bullish on electric cars, calling the experience “marvelous” and “a major disruption.” In his comments, he extolled the benefits of not having to stop at a gas station and cutting down on the number of vehicles through ridesharing. Electric car maker Tesla, which recently topped BMW to become the fourth most valuable car company in the world, is developing a new ride-sharing platform that will let owners lend their cars to a shared autonomous ride-hailing fleet when they’re not in use. Its upcoming Model 3 compact sedan has received more than 400,000 pre-orders. While Apple’s CEO has said he is doubling down on secrecy when it comes to major product announcements, he isn’t shy about discussing technologies that Apple is investing in. A few months ago he gushed about the possibilities of augmented reality as “a big idea like the smartphone,” only to release an ARKit platform at WWDC.
