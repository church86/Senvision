Powered by cash-cow business models, mature information-technology names such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) offer income investors compelling mixes of historical cash distributions, current yield, and dividend growth potential. These two aren't the only appealing https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/the-2-best-dividend-stocks-in-the-semiconductor-in.aspx?&utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=LeeEnterprises" target="_blank">dividend opportunities in the sector, but let's see what makes them some of the more compelling dividend stocks in IT today. Apple The world's largest technology company has had a capital-return program only since 2012, but its potential for sustained dividend growth is perhaps the most impressive in its industry. The key to Apple's dividend potential lies in its high-margin products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Consider, for example, that research firm Strategy Analytics recently estimated that Apple captured 79.2% of the operating profit in the global smartphone industry in 2016. That means massive cash flows for the Mac maker, and it's part of the reason Apple has accumulated a mind-boggling $158 billion in net cash  as of its most recent quarterly report. Moreover, the launch of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 later this year is likely to trigger an upgrade cycle that should drive record earnings and further fill Apple's coffers. Potential moves into massive global markets, including healthcare,    augmented reality,  virtual reality,  and smart homes,  should serve as future catalysts to drive sustained growth for Apple. So while Apple's shares yield just 1.48% today, the company's winning business model, strong leadership, and globally recognizable brand should facilitate consistent dividend growth for investors well into the future.

Cisco Systems Paying much more than Apple shares today, router giant Cisco Systems  stands well above the S&P 500's 1.9% current yield, with its 3.4% showing. Like the Mac maker, Cisco is in the early stages of its dividend history, but its initial progress has been impressive. Since initiating its cash distributions in 2011, Cisco has raised its annual dividends per share from a $0.24 starting point to $1.04 last year. That progress translates into a compound average growth rate of 28% per annum. The company already increased its quarterly dividend for 2017 by $0.03 per share to $0.29,  further extending the company's perfect streak of consecutive annual increases. Better still, all signs suggest that Cisco will be able to maintain its impressive dividend performance in future years. Cisco's payout ratio currently stands at 54% of net income, and it carries $35.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Those stats alone suggest that Cisco can continue to increase its dividend payments for many years. Being at the heart of one of tech's largest trends should also drive Cisco's results higher in the years to come. Its routers make it a likely beneficiary of the continued rise of the Internet of Things, which the company has estimated should develop into a $19 trillion  market over the next 10 years. But even if that estimate proves to be too optimistic, Cisco has enough going for it that it should still be able to support sustainable dividend growth over the long term.   10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rating:  4.5 Typical Price:  £779.00 Pros:  Best battery life on the market; Gorgeously curved, premium-grade metal and glass design; water and dust proof; lightning-fast processing power; well-optimized and polished software package; superb camera and display; great audio quality Cons:  UI has some missing bits and gimmicks; fingerprint scanner placement not left-hand friendly; lacks higher-tier onboard storage (128GB) model; gorgeous curved glass design can be tricky to hold and may be fragile - a case is recommended, which sort of diminishes the aesthetics Verdict:  A really rather fantastic phone which sets the bar for 2017 very high indeed. It's super expensive, but it's packed with amazing technology and the overall package is highly rewarding to use. Best of all it has unbelievable battery stamina facebook twitter google+ Say what you want about Samsung, but the company sure knows how to design a good-looking phone. Last year’s Galaxy S7 EDGE was a fantastic looking beast. Ditto the Note 7 before that went south. Increasingly, it is Samsung – not Apple – that is leading the pack with respect to overall design and finish. Sure, Apple’s coming back this year with a rejigged design for its iPhone 8 – a design we’ve been waiting three years to see. But will it be enough to stop the double threat of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8? Competition is stiff in the Android space at the moment. LG’s G6 has been making a lot of friends since it first launched, and things will almost certainly get more ferocious in the second half of the year with the release of new Pixel phones, Apple’s iPhones, a new OnePlus release and also updates from HTC and Android’s smaller, bit-part players. Latest Samsung Galaxy S8 deals: As of right now, though, the Galaxy S8 – and Galaxy S8 Plus – are the hottest handsets on the planet. The handsets that are designed to help Samsung retain its number one status as King of The Phone Market in 2017/18. According to a report from Korean publication The Investor, the Samsung Galaxy S8 range has sold five million units worldwide in less than a month. Officially, detailed figures are being kept under wraps, but the paper reports having spoken to a Samsung rep, who said "combined" sales are "going smoothly around the globe" and "are already beyond 5 million units". Combined of course meaning both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+; previously reports indicated there was more or less a 50/50 split in terms of consumer interest in the different size models. New details from The Investor suggest that Samsung is selling Galaxy S8 units at twice the rate it did Galaxy S7 series devices for this time last year, at least according to the word of an unnamed Samsung official the publication spoke to. Essentially, from date of first sales the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 took 75 and 74 days respectively to hit the 10 million landmark sales figure; from the current pace of sales, the Samsung official says the Galaxy S8 should make that goal in half the time. I’ve just spent a little over two weeks with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus now and we're ready to tell you just what it's like to get to grips with day-in, day-out. Hunker down with a cuppa, as this review’s a long one. So without further ado, let's crack on... Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Design & Build Good or bad smartphone visual design is, of course, subjective, and it’s fairly safe to say that anyone who’s been unimpressed by Samsung’s aesthetic to date is probably not going to be swayed by the Galaxy S8+. Likewise, fans of the firm’s prior devices will be just as happy with the latest edition as they were with what came before. The main thing is that the Galaxy S8 series has only become curvier and more streamlined than its already notably curved predecessors; the corners are completely smoothed and rounded, while the curvature of the edge display follows a continuous line from front to back where it meets a perfectly symmetrical rear panel, with only a thin sliver of bodywork separating the two. The top and bottom edges are also curved but it’s not as pronounced and doesn’t curve the display itself along these edges. Holding the phone it’s very apparent that you’re gripping what virtually amounts to a solid piece of curved glass - yes there’s a metal frame holding it together, but it’s barely noticeable. This actually presents the first stumbling block for the Galaxy S8+; in my time with the device I never felt entirely safe holding onto it; it’s slippery as anything and the edges are so wafer thin coupled with the curved slippery glass surface. Samsung allegedly tweaked the edge curvature to improve grip but I don’t really feel this has been successful and I’d strongly recommend some kind of case to improve grip more substantially and prevent drops. That particular gripe aside, the Galaxy S8+ feels incredibly solid in terms of its construction; there is zero wobble or flex in the frame or component panels, and it’s got a nice bit of heft to it without being heavy. You’ve also got the reassurance that it’s an IP-rated water resistant handset, so there’s no fear in taking it near the wet stuff. Aesthetically I rather enjoy the Galaxy S8+ design, it’s still got that quasi-industrial style that is so popular just lately with the punched speaker grille and emphasis on metal and glass, but the added curviness does lend it a certain unique presence that is very futuristic and elegant. Our review unit is the black coloured model, which Samsung has made entirely black; the glass, the metal surround, the fittings and furniture. Everything is black. This again gives it a very sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey obelisk-like appearance. It’s a “stealth” phone, the kind of thing Batman might design. However, the shiny glossy glass does also show up fingerprints a fair bit, particularly on this black model. It won't stay pristine for very long. Of course you can get other colour options which are not quite so extreme and feature metallic trim that’s a bit more visible. Here the detail of the visual design is a bit more apparent. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Display Samsung has been playing the long game as far as display technology is concerned. It started investing heavily in OLED while everyone else was saying it was too complicated or expensive, even though many could see it would outclass LCD if done properly. The firm also started developing flexible OLED way ahead of everyone else and is now starting to reap the benefits of that as a market leader. Rivals such as Apple are now looking to source flexible OLED from Samsung's factories. Samsung’s history with OLED hasn’t always been smooth, there have been some tough learning experiences - early on the firm’s screens came under flak for some instances of poor colour calibration and pixelation due to earlier PenTile technology. But it persevered, and is now the undisputed ruler of the OLED market, which also virtually puts it in position as the dominant force in the display market too - OLED is now widely recognised as superior to LCD, so much so that Apple and many others are jumping on the bandwagon. For anyone who has seen the Galaxy S7 EDGE or the Galaxy S6 EDGE in person, the display of the Galaxy S8+ will be familiar territory. It curves around the edges of the handset just like before, and it has an Always On function so that even when in sleep mode it’ll show the time, date, and some notifications while barely consuming any power at all. However, as the bodywork has expanded on this model, the display size and ratio has also increased. The display is now a 6.2in Super AMOLED - nearly as big as the Galaxy Note - but the screen pushes out to much more of the front fascia, indeed, the phone’s front is virtually all screen with an 84% screen-to-body ratio and an 18:9 aspect ratio. As the screen and aspect ratio has expanded, the resolution has increased accordingly to 1440 x 2960 WQHD+ (3K) at 529 pixels-per-inch (ppi). The image quality is what we’ve come to expect as typical for a Samsung flagship. In a word; superb. It’s incredibly sharp with no pixelation or blurring to be found. Text in particular is very crisp. It also features a full 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, the very same one used on 4K TV sets and certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. In short, if content has been produced for 4K UHD Premium TVs, it’ll look as good on the Galaxy S8+. A new high saturation “Deep Red” OLED display technology Samsung has implemented here means the Native Colour gamut has a wider range too, well over 100% coverage for both DCI-P3 and sRGB. This, together with the excellent brightness levels (as much as 20% brighter than the Galaxy S7 and peak brightness over 1,000 nits) makes outdoor use in bright sunlight a breeze. All of the previous standout features from Samsung’s Galaxy S7 display have returned, including the excellent adaptive brightness and contrast, user-adjustable colour profiles, performance and power saving modes, and the acclaimed personalised auto brightness control feature. The customisable EDGE display features, which allow you to configure quick access shortcuts along the curved screen edges, has also been expanded. It’s quicker and easier to set up, and you can add applications, contacts, and a selection of smart editing tools, all on three customisable and swipe-able panels; it’s a bit like having a whole separate selection of homescreens hidden in the display edge. From using the phone I can certainly say the colour is rich and vibrant, in Samsung’s typical style. Contrast is also fantastic with inky deep blacks and viewing angles are insanely wide. The long and the short of it is this is a gorgeous display with fantastic visual quality and smooth touch input. I can’t really imagine anyone getting tired of ogling or prodding this screen after any length of time, and it’s highly tailorable to your needs as the viewer. You really can have it your way by tweaking the settings however you please. We should note that some users in Korea have complained that the Galaxy S8 has a red hue to the display and tweaking the display colour settings doesn’t seem to fix it. Samsung’s official response so far is to issue the following statement: “It is not a quality problem and it can be adjusted with the phone itself. If the color still appears to be reddish, customers can change it at the service center.” It’s our understanding that this isn’t a problem on every unit, but it is something we’ll be keeping an eye on and will update you with as more info emerges. Update: According to The Korea Herald, Samsung has now acknowledged the red-tint display problem and is working on a fix, the firm issued a statement as follows: "Because there are some complaints about the red-tinted screens, we decided to upgrade the software next week for all Galaxy S8 clients." Samsung also issued instructions to its Service Centres regarding the issue, saying, "There will be an additional update to make color revisions more minutely at the end of April" Samsung has released another statement on the subject of the red-tint OLED display issue while conducting a conference call. The company's statement was reported by Korean source The Investor. Samsung revealed it has undertaken inspections of Galaxy S8 units, presumably red-tinted screen models returned by early adopters in Korea. The firm said thatin light of these inspections it remains confident about the handset quality and its quality control for production. "Due to the nature of Super AMOLED displays, there can be natural differences in color. Users can optimize the color depending on their preferences." In other words, this is just part and parcel of the technology which, using an organic component in the Organic Light-Emitting Diode, seems to have some degree of unpredictability. Samsung further added that the software update it has promised will give the user greater control in calibrating and optimising their colour settings. Hopefully this means you can actively re-configure the screen to remove the red-tint rather than just mitigating it slightly to a lesser degree. As of April 27, Samsung has now begun rolling out the promised update to fix the red-tint screen issue. The update has starting landing in Samsung's home region of South Korea, where the problem was first noticed and where distribution of handsets first began. The firm previously said it would deliver the update before the end of the month, and it seems it is taking the issue and its promised quite seriously. Galaxy S8 owners will see the update prompt for version G950NKSU1AQDG, while Galaxy S8+ units will have version G955NKSU1AQDG. The update adds new features to the Adaptive Display mode menu which give the user finer control of colour calibration and tuning. The Screen mode menu also has a new EDGE colour balance setting as well. "Samsung has apparently promised to replace affected devices if their owners aren't satisfied with their colors after applying this update," reports GSMArena. "Unfortunately the full screen color balance adjustment only works in Adaptive Display mode, so if you want a calibrated setting and the red tint gone, it looks like you're out of luck - so you may want to take advantage of that 'free replacement' promise from Samsung." The update began rolling out in South Korea, but has now landed in Europe as of April 29. Handsets in the UK and Germany have now started receiving the software update, which is sized at  426MB. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Battery Life Long battery life is pretty much the Holy Grail for many smartphone users these days. There are plenty of flagship-grade smartphones which offer relatively good battery life, and a few which offer excellent battery life. It’s not too rare now to find devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note series, the Huawei Mate 8 and 9, the bigger iPhone Plus models, and Google’s Pixel XL which will still see you sitting comfortably at somewhere around the 70%-76% range for the battery charge after watching a two hour movie on full brightness. This sort of usage tends to translate into being able to watch films pretty much for eight hours straight on a single charge. Likewise, you tend to end up with a phone that’ll last days, or even a good chunk of a week if largely left idling, ticking away between 7%-10% per day. But this will probably last a day and a half at most if you’re like most of us and are often giving it a poke for some reason or another throughout your typical day. You can bring that down further again if we’re talking a lot of intensive stuff like gaming. So where does the Galaxy S8+ and its 3,500mAh setup fit into this? Well for the two hour movie test using Mad Max: Fury Road, on full brightness, with the film downloaded to storage, and Wi-Fi and other connectivity switched off, it went from 100% charge to, get this, 86%. Yes you read that right, a two hour film on full brightness only cost 14% of the battery charge. This is madness. I kid you not I have never seen anything quite like this in my time of reviewing smartphones. I reckon upwards of 10 hours of movie playback is not at all unrealistic here. You can easily expect a couple of days of normal smartphone use on a single charge, in some cases perhaps three, and if you leave this phone alone save for a few calls or the occasional email, web browsing session or message, it will last you a good three or four days, possibly more. In short, the Galaxy S8+ has the best battery of any smartphone I have ever tested. It just keeps going. I've pretty much only had to charge it a couple of times since I got hold of it. Granted, I am sure you will still be able to burn through it in a day if you really push things, but let’s be real here, no smartphone will survive on a single charge if you insist on playing Super Mario Run or Star Wars Lego from dawn until dusk, only taking breaks to watch YouTube in between.  But for most standard users this is a dream come true. This is a phone you can rely on to be alive and kicking from when you leave the house in the morning right through to the next day, and you don't have to be too careful with it to achieve this, as long as you don't rinse it like crazy. At the very least this kind of battery usage makes it easier to plan around. I have not been caught short by the Galaxy S8+ leaving me high and dry unexpectedly as so many other phones are liable to do. Latest Samsung Galaxy S8 deals:   Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Camera The much-rumoured dual-lens camera for the Galaxy S8+ hasn't come to pass, sadly, which did leave me wondering how much attention the phone's imaging capabilities would receive. To be clear, however, Samsung camera hardware has impressed me for some time now; the last handful of flagships have always sported very capable cameras which, for me, had the perfect combination of "right stuff". What do I mean by this? Well for one thing Samsung stopped chasing the megapixel rating, instead opting to increase the pixel size, and crucially go for better apertures. It started off with wide f/2.0 but has gradually improved this to where we now stand with an f/1.7 aperture on a 12MP sensor - nice and open, letting in lots of light and detail. But this alone isn't enough to ensure good quality photography. Several iterations of Samsung's hardware have been plenty capable, but with the last generation it introduced what was, at the time, a unique feature; dual-pixel phase detection autofocus. The Samsung Galaxy S8+, like its predecessor, is still one of only a few handsets to use this technology, and it really makes a difference in terms of focusing speed and capture speed. This means the image is captured very quickly after focusing (also very quickly), so that the wide aperture doesn't let in too much light and cause blurring, overexposure, and other undesirable consequences. In other words, the Galaxy S8+ is fine tuned down to fractions of a second so that it's optimised to take a photo in the best way possible. Together with Samsung's wonderfully simple and user-friendly camera UI, this also means it's very easy to use by all comers, not just photography buffs - another pillar of what I'd consider the "right stuff" for a mass-marketed  flagship. It really is easy to just point, click, shoot, and capture amazing quality photos in next to no time. Naturally, there is also the now the required "Pro" mode for experts to fine tune things like exposure, ISO, focus, and white balance, amongst many other settings. So what's the result? Well as you can see the images speak for themselves. The colour is rich and vibrant in Samsung's typical style, but the detail, sharpness, and dynamic range are all fantastic. The handset particularly excels at close-in shots and there's no need to tweak the settings to Macro mode in order to achieve this; standard Auto mode will do it just fine with a quick tap-to-focus on the subject before hitting the shutter button. I'm pretty blown away by how crisp everything is. The Auto features also seem to be very intelligent in adjusting for different lighting conditions; plenty of snaps in less-than-ideal light, which on any other phone might come out a bit dull or far too over-exposed, seemed to adjust and get things just right to make a fantastic, crisp photo with excellent range and colours which pop. This also means the phone excels in low-light and night-time shooting. The sunset shots below show this in an outdoor scenario, but the photo of the wine bottles was taken indoors, in the evening, in a hallway with no windows; I was to all intents and purposes, in the dark while taking it. What's more, even with the flash on Auto, the phone didn't bother to use it, and it obviously knew it didn't need to - despite all this the photo looks like a perfectly normal daytime shot in a reasonably well-lit room. In truth, I am not sure I've seen a phone that handles low-light and night-time shooting this well before. It's much, much better than the Huawei Mate 9's dual-camera which I've been using on my holiday, and which was rather disappointing in low-light. The front camera - the first in the world to feature autofocus - is plenty capable too, and also excels at close-ups. Check out the lion statue below which was taken on the 8MP front snapper, which also features the same f/1.7 aperture as its rear-mounted sibling. Naturally things aren't quite as sharp as the main sensor, but they're still damn impressive and should offer you some of the most detailed selfies available. Maybe too detailed, as you won't be able to hide any blemishes quite so easily without heavy use of filters and post-processing! Overall I'm tremendously impressed with the Galaxy S8+ camera. I wasn't expecting big changes from Samsung with the dual-camera being axed, and in truth, it has not changed the setup extensively from its predecessor. However, what small tweaks that have been performed have been very careful and precise, and they've made a huge difference to the overall quality and shooting experience. Top marks here. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Hardware Our review unit is the international SM-G955F Galaxy S8+ model, which is the edition powered by Samsung's 64-bit Exynos 9 8895 octa-core processor. This CPU features four 2.3GHz  Exynos M2 "Mongoose" cores and four 1.7GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores, under ARMv8 microarchitecture on 10nm FinFET semiconductor fabrication. It also packs  a Mali-G71 MP20 GPU clocked at 546MHz and 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All of those fancy words and numbers boil down to the fact that it's equipped with one of the top three mobile processor designs in the world at time of launch. Some reports from the states suggest that the US model, running a 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, is getting slightly higher performance results. But after a certain point of high-end hardware and the extensive software optimisation we've seen in recent years, it seems to stop making much of a difference; at least as far as the end user experience is concerned. Indeed, this is the reason that Apple has stopped revealing much of what it does to its processors between new iPhone models - as long as it maintains the same high standards of software performance, consumers don't seem to care. Other OEMs appear to be catching on too. There were similar apparent disparities in performance between the Galaxy S7's various processor variants, again both Exynos and Snapdragon editions. However, extensive testing by various online experts and pundits ended up with a general consensus that there wasn't much in it. I suspect the same may turn out to be true here, though naturally I should temper this by recognizing it as an assumption, and pointing out the fact that I haven't had a go with a Snapdragon 835-based model; and probably won't have the opportunity to do so with it being a US-exclusive. All that said, the long and the short of it, which I must boil things down to, is this; does this phone's performance behave in a way I'd expect of a brand new Samsung flagship, in 2017, based on the latest processing hardware? Does it feel as fast and responsive as it should, as per what we've come to expect from the brand? And to these questions, the answer is yes.  Android 7.0 Nougat is overlaid with Samsung's newest UI and it's clear that an immense amount of effort has been made here to ensure the smoothest and most fluid experience possible. You won't find any snagging or stuttering at all, and app load speeds are incredibly quick, near-instantaneous; quicker for those which don't immediately ping for data from the internet. It is one of the fastest and most responsive handsets I've used for some time, in particular the touch input feels significantly more refined than most rivals. It doesn't balk at multitasking either, happily racking up app after app in the background, and the memory seems intelligent enough to keep switching smooth when restoring a hibernating app. One of the more intensive things you can ask of a phone is gaming. Let's face it, these days the flashiest games with the best graphics are generally shameless brand cash-ins and/or massive pay-to-win micro-transaction farms with very little substance. The fun and innovative titles tend to lean more to the simple, retro, artistic or even pixel-based graphics and aren't really that demanding anyway. But I digress. I tried out a handful of titles of varying levels of graphical intensity; CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars, Nonstop Chuck Norris, Ninja Arashi, and Dawn of Titans. Most of these ran like a charm with no hiccuping, and unlike older phones on less efficient CPUs there was very little heat on the back panel. However, I should point out that Dawn of Titans was the most graphically demanding title and the only one the phone struggled with, both in loading times and in some snagging during play. It wasn't clear whether this was an issue with the phone or possibly poor optimization on the part of the game developer, an all too common problem. So I got hold of a few more demanding games to test the theory; CoverFire and Gangstar Vegas ran much smoother but were not quite as heavy on the high-end textures, particles and post-processing effects. Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf, Star Wars: Force Arena and N.O.V.A Legacy, on the other hand, were a bit more flashy and ran perfectly fine. N.O.V.A Legacy in particular was buttery smooth and just as impressive graphically as Dawn of Titans, which put my concerns about performance started by the latter to rest once and for all. As a final note, you can see from running Geekbench benchmarking tests the Galaxy S8+ outpaces a lot of the competition... Moving away from the CPU, the phone's audio via the speakers is quite impressive in quality and maintaining this at high volumes. I also found the off-centre positioning of the rear fingerprint scanner has finally brought me round to the back panel position which I'd previously hated. It is definitely a natural place for the forefinger to rest, though I should mention this is as a right-handed user; I doubt the same could be said for lefties as your finger must cross the camera lens and it's a bit of a stretch. The Type-C USB port is a welcome sight to make charging a bit less fussy, but the charging speed is also noteworthy as it's pretty damn quick. It also seemed to me that the dual-band Wi-Fi onboard was particularly robust in terms of connection quality. The handset also has full GPS connectivity, 4G LTE, NFC, and Bluetooth 5.0. For onboard storage 64GB is decent, but I can understand some power users wondering where the 128GB edition is considering the size of some apps and content these days - it's in China, matter of fact, along with 6GB of RAM. Expansion is welcome via microSD with support for up to 256GB, which is great for content that is supported this way on Android, but it's not a one-size-fits-all fix for people who'll find 64GB lacking. Update: We're now seeing news that Samsung will soon launch a new edition of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ in India - this is the 6GB RAM, 128GB storage variant already released as an exclusive in China and South Korea. Aside from the RAM and storage this is identical to the existing international model and still uses the Exynos processor. Until now, Samsung has consistently launched these larger storage and higher RAM capacity models only in South Korea and China, both for the Galaxy S7 series and the Galaxy Note 7, so this is the first time it's also been extended to India. While we'd like to think the 128GB Galaxy S8+ will make its way to Europe too. This is by no means a done deal, however, it is nice to see that Samsung is open to expanding the distribution, so it is a possibility, however remote. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Software & UI As I outlined above, the performance here is great, this is an incredibly well optimised software package and runs about as well as stock Android Nougat does on the Pixel series. ---------------------------- Update: Samsung has begun issuing an urgent update over-the-air to Galaxy S8 series handsets. The update aims to fix a DQA issue (Device Quality Agent) which is affecting handsets in the US and Canada following the day-one software update. The issue means that users are constantly fending off pop-up warnings between a minute and 30 seconds apart which state "DQA keeps stopping". You can manually update via the Galaxy App Store too. Another update is now being rolled out as of May 25, this one to address the Bluetooth connectivity issues some users have been experiencing. The rollout has started in the UAE but it will expand to other regions in short order. "The update fixes a bug that caused the devices to reboot while controlling music playing through a wireless speaker," reports GSMArena. "In addition, the update also includes some SD card-related fixes, as well as the Android security patch for May." The above Bluetooth fix update is now rolling out in the UK; the 620MB file is available over-the-air to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ handsets. In addition, the update kills a big which caused the Galaxy S8 to reboot when controlling music through a wireless speaker. Some changes have been made to microSD support and the May Security Patch is bundled-in too. ---------------------------- But it's not just the performance that impresses, I'll cover the other good stuff before getting on to my gripes and grumbles. A lot of the positive points are returning features; things like the Always-On display showing notifications, and the date and time even when the phone sleeps; and it really doesn't sap your battery life in a noticable way at all. Likewise, the multitasking is what we've come to expect from the most recent iterations of Android with very clear and smooth functionality, but Samsung's addition of split-screen applications also makes a welcome return and works brilliantly. As an aside, I rather like the fact that the screenshot capture has automatic sharing and editing features built-in to a pop-up. By default the Samsung UI has the traditional app drawer shortcut in the low bar switched off, which is kind of annoying, but it's easy enough to go into Settings and toggle it back on. It does, however, appear to be fixed in the lower right corner. The notifications drop down has all the best Android bells and whistles, whether in the homescreen or lock screen; that means full expandable notifications functionality, something still sorely missing from many other Android handsets and UI overlays. In the main homescreen mode it also has a full set of quick settings shortcuts with multiple swipable screens that are customisable. Because Samsung has added more and more functionality with every successive phone, the Galaxy S8's Settings menu is pretty vast, but this is undoubtedly one of the cleanest and tidiest Settings screens I've seen for some time with a white background, a sharp, thin font, and simple colour-coded icons with neat and succinct little summaries for each sub-menu. While many busy Settings screens, even some of Samsung's in the past, have made it very easy to get lost and confused, it's not really an issue here. On top of that, Samsung has added a bunch of prompts at the bottom of the menu screens where you can get help and guidance if you are struggling to find what you need. The Samsung UI is highly customisable via the use of themes, and Samsung has its own Theme store embedded inside Bixby, including static wallpapers alongside the animtated ones which move with your phone, like the default "Galaxy" one. However, at this stage some of the themes aren't optimised for the "Infinity Mode" of Samsung's new display, so they won't necessarily look their best. Right, now, let's talk about Bixby. Ahead of our review we had this notification from a Samsung spokesperson: "All Bixby functionality, bar Voice, will be available at launch. This includes Home, Reminder and Vision. Bixby Voice will be available in Korean and U.S English later this spring, and will expand to more languages globally over time." So in other words, here in the UK we don't have the Voice component of the Bixby assistant and we don't know when it will be added.  Bixby is continuously present and can be accessed either via the dedicated Bixby button or by swiping from the left of the homescreen. In its current state it's rather a lot like the old Samsung news feed but with an array of widgets and a few added extra bits for the reminders and calendar stuff. If you want voice control, however, you're going to have to resort to Google Assistant, which is already onboard and can be accessed via a long press of the Home key. Once set up it also works via the "OK Google," voice command. Bixby Vision is also usable, although it seems somewhat hit and miss. I tried getting the handset to recognise a couple of other phones I had lying around and it didn't really catch on. A copy of a Hellboy graphic novel did manage to get the phone to point me to several online shopping vendors where I could buy it, however. So far my only grumbles are as follows: The "EDGE" functionality is welcome, but does still feel a bit gimmicky. I like having the extra shortcuts overlay, but you don't really leverage the curvature of the screen to do this, it could just as easily come from another gesture swipe from the edge of a flat display. What's more, it only uses one side of the screen, the other one is dedicated to Bixby. Lastly on this subject, nothing is really displayed along the curved EDGE like the time or date or any of the app shortcuts. There doesn't appear to be that "bedside" functionality. Bixby, without voice, is kind of redundant. While this is undoubtedly the cleanest, most Android-y, and best optimised Samsung UI to date, there is still an element of Samsung stamping its stamp on things somewhat arbitrarily. I mean in the sense that so much of the UI is based around swishy fancy-pants gestures rather than straightforward control familiar to the average user. Even things like the default setup hiding the app drawer smacks of a Huawei-style move of reminding you you're on a brand device at the expense of making the UI as streamlined and accessible as possible, and this is something that plays out in a broader sense too. It's easily possible to whittle away these layers down to a much purer Android experience, so on the whole I like the Samsung UI, but to get there you have to know what you're doing, and not every buyer necessarily will, and may end up frustrated or not having the most optimised user experience for themselves. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Verdict Having said the immediately above, those few bullet-pointed gripes at the end of the UI section are just about my only dislikes with the Galaxy S8+, and they are minor, somewhat nitpicky I'll readily admit, and oh so easily looked past in practice when using this phone on the daily. By now you may have gathered I'm rather fond of this phone. My overall impression is very positive. I liked using it, I found it easy and seamless, rather refreshing really. It feels thoughtful and clever, though one or two bits are still glaringly missing, we are promised they'll be patched in later. From a hardware perspective it's an absolute diamond. The camera is incredible and you really must try this, even if you've no intention of buying this phone I heartily encourage you to get down to a showroom and try the camera out if only to show you what's possible and what we should be expecting of future flagships as some kind of baseline. Meanwhile, on the display and processor front, Samsung continues to push boundaries and deliver excellent quality. And on the subject of design and build, well, it's a matter of taste but I think Samsung has gone from strength to strength and here has delivered something very refined indeed. The real icing on the cake, however, is that battery life. It's just phenomenal. This is easily the best phone on the market when it comes to battery life, so if you're looking for a handset that will go the distance - look no further.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 Top Dividend Stocks in Information Technology Singing the income-investing praises of IT stocks Apple and Cisco Systems. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Jun 2, 2017 at 4:58PM Though dividends are more associated with growth companies, the tech industry has seen a number of its largest players become dividend dynamos in recent decades. Powered by cash-cow business models, mature information-technology names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) offer income investors compelling mixes of historical cash distributions, current yield, and dividend growth potential. These two aren't the only appealing dividend opportunities in the sector, but let's see what makes them some of the more compelling dividend stocks in IT today. Apple The world's largest technology company has had a capital-return program only since 2012, but its potential for sustained dividend growth is perhaps the most impressive in its industry. The key to Apple's dividend potential lies in its high-margin products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Consider, for example, that research firm Strategy Analytics recently estimated that Apple captured 79.2% of the operating profit in the global smartphone industry in 2016. That means massive cash flows for the Mac maker, and it's part of the reason Apple has accumulated a mind-boggling $158 billion in net cash  as of its most recent quarterly report. Moreover, the launch of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 later this year is likely to trigger an upgrade cycle that should drive record earnings and further fill Apple's coffers. Potential moves into massive global markets, including healthcare,    augmented reality,  virtual reality,  and smart homes,  should serve as future catalysts to drive sustained growth for Apple. So while Apple's shares yield just 1.48% today, the company's winning business model, strong leadership, and globally recognizable brand should facilitate consistent dividend growth for investors well into the future. Image source: Getty Images. Cisco Systems Paying much more than Apple shares today, router giant Cisco Systems  stands well above the S&P 500's 1.9% current yield, with its 3.4% showing. Like the Mac maker, Cisco is in the early stages of its dividend history, but its initial progress has been impressive. Since initiating its cash distributions in 2011, Cisco has raised its annual dividends per share from a $0.24 starting point to $1.04 last year. That progress translates into a compound average growth rate of 28% per annum. The company already increased its quarterly dividend for 2017 by $0.03 per share to $0.29,  further extending the company's perfect streak of consecutive annual increases. Better still, all signs suggest that Cisco will be able to maintain its impressive dividend performance in future years. Cisco's payout ratio currently stands at 54% of net income, and it carries $35.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Those stats alone suggest that Cisco can continue to increase its dividend payments for many years. Being at the heart of one of tech's largest trends should also drive Cisco's results higher in the years to come. Its routers make it a likely beneficiary of the continued rise of the Internet of Things, which the company has estimated should develop into a $19 trillion  market over the next 10 years. But even if that estimate proves to be too optimistic, Cisco has enough going for it that it should still be able to support sustainable dividend growth over the long term.   Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

Tech stocks paved the path for the major market indexes, with shares of big-caps Microsoft and Apple leading the charge.

It seems HTC agreed, because its new flagship, the HTC U11, is here and it's better in almost every way. Priced at $649, the HTC U11 features a big, bright, 5.5-inch screen; markedly faster performance; and a camera that rivals the best from Samsung and Apple, all while sporting a gorgeous, gem-like design. But the highlights don't stop there, because the U11 packs a total of four microphones, two voice assistants (with a third on the way) and built-in pressure sensors that let you open apps by squeezing the sides of the phone. After HTC produced a string of middling devices, the U11 is exactly what the company needed to remind people that it's still alive.  Availability In stores, the U11 is exclusive to Sprint. However, if you buy online, you can get this phone unlocked. There are carrier-specific versions of the U11 for all the big providers on Amazon or directly from HTC.com. Design: A symphony in glass There's no shortage of glass-backed phones nowadays, but I defy you to you find one (aside from the U Ultra) that looks like the U11. For the U11's back, HTC started with a single flat sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 and squashed it into progressively curvier molds to form a smooth, rounded back that looks more like sci-fi jewel scarab than a piece of consumer tech.  Below the display, you get a combo fingerprint sensor that also doubles as a capacitive-touch home button, along with two more touch buttons on either side, for Back and Recent Apps. The lock button on the right side sports a jagged texture, so you can recognize it by feel, while the smooth volume rocker sits above that. The U11's top edge features a removable SIM tray with space for a microSD card when you want to add some additional capacity to the U11's built-in 64GB of storage. Some folks may take issue with the U11's sizable bezels on top and bottom now that we live in an age of super-skinny smartphone designs. But for me, the bigger issue is that the bezels on top and bottom are different widths. Had they been the same, the phone would look a little more balanced and a bit less bulky, though with its 5.5-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio, the U11 was never going to be a truly compact device.  Measuring 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31-inches and weighing 5.96 ounces, the HTC U11 is practically the same size as the Google Pixel XL (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches and 5.93 ounces). However, compare the U11 to the Galaxy S8 (5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches and 5.47 ounces), and Samsung's flagship feels significantly smaller and sleeker. That's despite the S8 having a total screen area that's actually slightly larger, thanks to its 18.5:9 aspect-ratio display. A simple squeeze of the U11's sides can open an app or even take a picture. Like any good flagship smartphone in 2017, the U11 boasts IP67 water resistance, so you won't have to worry about any spills or dips in the sink trashing your device.  Edge Sense: Do we really need a squeezable phone? Moto has its Moto Actions gesture commands, and Huawei has its Knuckle Sense shortcuts. But with Edge Sense, HTC might have the weirdest motion controls of them all. You don't make movements with your hands or draw letters on the screen; instead, the U11 features pressure sensors built into the sides of the phone, so a simple squeeze can open an app or even take a picture. By default, Edge Sense is set to open the camera when you squeeze the phone, but you can reprogram the feature to open pretty much any app on the device or toggle functions like the flashlight or Wi-Fi. Depending on what you choose, Edge Sense even has a bit of contextual smarts, letting you perform different tasks with the same simple action. For instance, you can open the camera on the first squeeze and then snap a pic on the second. Edge Sense's advanced settings will also let you add a second function for when you squeeze and hold the phone. The 5.5-inch QHD display delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. The best use of Edge Sense is probably for taking a selfie, since your hands will likely be in the correct position to give the phone a little hand hug. However, I've found that even when Edge Sense's was set to its most sensitive pressure setting, trying to squeeze the phone while posing for a shot caused the device to shake more than if I had just tapped on the screen. In fact, the action of squeezing the U11 makes holding the phone that much trickier. While it didn't happen to me, because I went out of my way to be super careful, I wouldn't be surprised to hear about people dropping the U11 while trying to squeeze it.  MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market Now Display: Big and bright The 5.5-inch QHD display on the HTC U11 keeps things simple and delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. You don't get pure blacks like you would on a phone with an OLED display (such as the Pixel or Galaxy S8), but the U11 still offers pretty solid contrast. Initially, the U11 had a somewhat cool color casting that accentuated blues and downplayed warmer tones, but a quick trip to the phone's color-temperature setting makes it easy to adjust the screen however you want. In practically no time, I had the crimson and neon green blaster bolts shooting out from the X-wings and TIE fighters in The Last Jedi trailer looking exactly how I wanted. That's a nice bit of customizability that not every phone offers.  With the adaptive brightness on, we got the HTC U11 to hit a peak output of 512 nits. That puts it a fair bit ahead the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL, which hit 437 nits and 396 nits, respectively. With its stereo BoomSound speakers and noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. The U11 also earned some of the highest marks for color accuracy we've seen in recent history, as it notched a Delta-E rating of 0.34 (numbers closer to zero are better). The S8 was equally as good, with a rating of 0.36, while the Pixel was pretty far off, at 5.88.  As for color range, the U11's LCD display didn't fare quite as well as some of its AMOLED-equipped competition. Still, with a gamut that covered 166 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the U11 wasn't that far off the respective 183 percent and 191 percent tallies of the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL. Audio: Punchy stereo speakers, but no headphone jack With its stereo BoomSound speakers and included noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. But there's one big downer: Like other recent HTC phones, the U11 lacks a headphone jack.  The U11's BoomSound setup uses the bottom-firing speaker in tandem with the earpiece to put out a truly impressive amount of sound. The feature makes phones with single-speaker setups, like the Galaxy S8, sound embarrassingly bad, and when you put the U11 up against phones, like the iPhone 7, with similar two-speaker arrangements, the U11 stills wins on both volume and sound quality. MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones When you want to listen to things a bit more privately, HTC includes a pair of special USB-C earbuds that automatically create a personalized audio profile specifically tuned for your ears. On top of that, HTC uses the tiny mics built into the earbuds to provide true noise cancellation, which should be a big boon to anyone listening to music on a plane or train. I also appreciate how HTC includes three different size tips for its earbuds to help ensure a better fit.  The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with camera phones from Apple, Google and Samsung. But there's a downside: Even though HTC has thoughtfully included a dongle so you can still use your old-school headphones, the adaptive audio and noise-cancelling tech needs both the USB-C audio processing and HTC's custom earbuds to function. In other words, those special features won't work on third-party headphones. Cameras: New heights for HTC It seems like HTC has been promising big things from its Ultrapixel cameras forever, and on the U11, the company has really delivered. The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with phone cameras from Apple, Google and Samsung. I especially liked some of the low-light shots I got, which looked noticeably brighter and less grainy compared to images from the S8.  During the daytime, the U11 also wowed, offering a more restrained counterpoint to the super-rich and saturated shots captured by the Galaxy S8. On the front, though, the U11's 16-MP selfie cam was less compelling than I hoped. The Flower Shot A picture of a flower can tell you a lot of things about a camera, and while neither the Galaxy S8 nor the U11 nailed it 100 percent, HTC's phone still impressed. This comparison exposes the S8's tendency to oversaturate colors, which resulted in unnaturally vivid magenta petals instead of the softer pink tones you see from the U11. The S8's picture is just a tad sharper, though a few areas could be called oversharp. The Food Shot In the contest to see which phone shoots a better burger, the U11 came out on top. It's close, but the U11's pic looks warmer; features more-accurate colors; offers better details in the bun, bacon and onion rings; and simply made the sandwich look more delicious. In fact, when I asked my co-workers to pick which phone's photo they prefered, every single person chose the U11's pic. The Outdoors Shot In the last of the daylight comparisons, the S8 hit back hard with a shot that beat the U11's pic in almost every aspect: color, sharpness, detail, you name it. The S8's pic even did a better job of preserving the baby blue sky in the background. The Low-Light Close-Up Shot At night, when I took a minute to snap my growing family of plushies, the U11 showed some serious low-light skills, producing a better-exposed, less grainy picture than the Galaxy S8 did. Meanwhile, the S8's shot looked overly yellow, and without the S8's pic as a comparison, you might not even know this was a low-light shot at all. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Camera Shootout: Samsung Has the Edge The Outdoors Low-Light Shot In even less light, the U11 once again wowed, with a nighttime shot that's noticeably brighter and less noisy than the S8's photo. In the S8's image, you lose a lot of detail in the darker sections in the foreground, and the overly yellow white balance give the plants a sickly, unpleasant appearance.   In general, I found that the U11 outperforms the S8 is many low-light scenarios, though results can vary. When I walked just a bit farther and took a shot of a nearby pool, the S8's shot was clearly superior, as the U11's photo showed worse exposure and white balance. Selfies With a 16-MP front cam that captures double the resolution of the Galaxy S8, you might expect the U11 to come out firmly ahead. However, that wasn't the case. Quite often, the S8's front camera produced sharper, more-detailed photos than the U11 did. Yes, the background in the U11's pic is better-exposed, but if you look at things like my hair or shirt, it's clear how much better the S8's pic is. Performance: As fast as it gets When you combine Qualcomm's powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, you get some of the best performance on a smartphone available right now. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the U11 posted a score of 6,493; that's slightly higher than what we got from the Samsung Galaxy S8 (6,124). Meanwhile, Google's Pixel XL and its Snapdragon 821 processor performed 35 percent worse, with a score of 4,146.  It was the same story for web performance, where the U11 scored 70.52 on the JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. The Galaxy S8 was only slightly behind, with a score of 67.5, while the Google Pixel XL was pretty far back, with a score of 55.93. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7: Which Phone Is Really the Fastest? The U11's graphics performance was also quite impressive. On 3DMark's IceStorm Unlimited test, the U11 hit 40,946, versus 35,903 for the Galaxy S8, and just 28,182 for the Pixel XL.  Software: Two digital assistants with one more on the way HTC has maintained a pretty light touch on Android 7.1, so that its Sense UI will look instantly familiar to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of Google's mobile OS. Some small differences include the BlinkFeed news app that appears when you swipe right from the home screen; that's normally where Google Now cards live. The HTC U11 also features a more traditional icon for the app drawer instead of the minimalist app launcher you'd get on a Pixel. The one big addition HTC tacks on is its Sense Companion, which is another digital assistant that works alongside the built-in Google Assistant. The two assistants have a lot of overlapping features, including the ability to set reminders or notify you when you're near a place of interest, but Google's assistant still has the clear lead in search and answering questions.  The Sense Companion is actually more like a digital secretary, as it may remind you to recharge your phone in the afternoon so you won't run low while attending meetings at night. Or it may tell you that you need to step up your activity, after noticing a lower-than-normal step count earlier in the day. In practice, I found that just letting the Sense Companion do its thing was a helpful but not essential tool for better personal and device management. But when I had a question I needed answering, Google is still the one I asked for by name.  Coming sometime this summer (think early July), Alexa will also make an appearance on the U11. Unlike with half-baked attempts to incorporate Amazon's voice assistant into other phones, which require you to physically open an app before voicing your request, using Alexa on the U11 should be exactly the same as talking to an Amazon Echo or Dot. However, since Alexa wasn't available on our review unit, we're not sure how the assistant will perform. Battery Life: Pretty good but not great The U11 has more than enough battery life to last a full workday. However, as battery life on smartphones continues to improve across the board, the U11's longevity doesn't really stand out.  On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing using Sprint 4G LTE), the U11 lasted 9 hours and 38 minutes. That's just marginally better than the 9:32 smartphone average and an hour to an hour-and-a-half less than the times for competing flagships, such as the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and the Google Pixel XL (11:11). MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life When it comes time to recharge the phone, the U11 features Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, which can recharge the phone to over 50 percent in 30 minutes. Strangely though, the U11 doesn't have support for Quick Charge 4.0, even though all Snapdragon 835 devices should have support for Qualcomm's newer charging standard. Unfortunately, for those who don't want to deal with wires, the U11, does not support wireless charging.  Bottom Line HTC can keep its Sense Companion and its squeezable Edge Sense controls. Those features work as advertised, but I don't need 'em. The things that really makes the U11 stand out are its unique jewel-like design, thumping BoomSound speakers, superb performance and a rear camera that can keep pace with the best from Apple, Google and Samsung. However, even though the Galaxy S8 costs $100 more, I still have to give a slight edge to that phone, due to its more one-hand-friendly design, better display and longer battery life. The S8's headphone jack is nice, too. Still, it's a close call, made even closer by features like the U11's noise-cancelling earbuds and forthcoming Alexa integration, which could both convince you to side with the U11. And if they did, you'd be making a solid choice, because the U11 is the best phone HTC has made in the last five years. Photo credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide. Comparisons: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide. 8/10 Quick Take The U11 is the best phone HTC's offered in years, and the device's camera matches up nicely with that of the more expensive Galaxy S8. Still, Samsung's phone lasts longer on a charge and offers both a better design and display. $649.00 Amazon About the author Sam Rutherford @samrutherford Sam Rutherford is a senior product reviews analyst at Tom's Guide who covers smartphones, car tech and cameras.

Analysts were especially intrigued by what Broadcom is suggesting is a big jump up in the amount of revenue it will get from Apple's next iPhone. And Broadcom calmed concerns that it is looking to spend billions buying the NAND chip division of Toshiba. By Tiernan Ray June 2, 2017 6:28 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of chip giant Broadcom (AVGO) closed up $19.94, or almost 9%, at $254.53, after the company yesterday afternoon beat analysts’ fiscal Q2 expectations, and forecast this quarter’s revenue higher as well. There are no ratings changes today, that I can see, but price targets and estimates are zooming higher. Among the highlights of the conference call last night was chief executive Hock Tan appearing to dispel rumors that his company was interested in bidding on the NAND flash memory-chip operations of Toshiba (6502JP). Speculation that Broadcom wanted to buy the unit was apparently one cause of friction between Toshiba and its memory-chip partner, Western Digital (WDC). When one analyst asked about the rumors, Tan said “Bottom line, do’t believe everything you read out there, please." The company’s dominant position in chips for both Samsung Electronics’s (005930KS) “Galaxy S8” and Apple’s (AAPL) presumed forthcoming "iPhone 8,” is very pleasing to the Street. John Vinh of Pacific Crest reiterates an Overweight rating, and raises his price target to $280 from $260. He notes that Broadcom is corroborating rumors of a delay in Apple’s iPhone 8, but that it’s okay because the company is poised ultimately to sell more chips into this model: Broadcom expects a below-seasonal ramp of the iPhone 8 (10% vs. 3-year seasonal average of 12.7% q/q), but anticipates better-than-seasonal growth in F4Q. This is consistent with other Apple suppliers and our concerns associated with an OLED iPhone delay. Additionally, content is expected to increase 40% driven by 8 chips in the phone. Broadcom also addressed concerns regarding competition from Qorvo in BAW filters. The Company is confident in its competitive position and expects continuous investment will lengthen its leadership in BAW filters. Canaccord Genuity’s Mike Walkley reiterates a Buy rating, and hikes his target to $272 from $250, writing that the Q2 results showed better-than-expected results for the wireless business thanks to “content gains” in Samsung’s S8. There’s more cost-chopping, less M&A ahead, he writes: "Following the completion of the Brocade acquisition likely to close by July 31, we anticipate a continued focus on improving margins and cash flows and less of a focus on new M&A." Walkley raised his estimates for this fiscal year to $17.57 billion in revenue and $15.69 in EPS, up from $16.73 billion and $14.52 per share. Mizuho’s Vijay Rakesh reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his target to $275 from $265, also clearly preoccupied with the iPhone 8 prospects. "AVGO noted a 40% y/y content increase as it ships 8 separate components to (we believe) the new iPhone, driving a significantly accelerating wireless segment into OctQ,” he writes. But it’s not just iPhone. He also notes that networking is chugging along, with "continued ramp on Cisco and hyperscale with Arista and others on 9000 Series and Hyperflex solutions positions AVGO well." Rakesh raises his 2017 estimates to $17.58 billion in revenue and $15.76 in EPS from a prior $17 billion and $14.69 per share.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish New Galaxy S8 And LG G6 Variants Reportedly Inspired By iPhone 8 By Tyler Lee on 06/02/2017 16:02 PDT It is not a secret that Apple’s iPhone has influenced a lot of smartphone makers when it comes to introducing features and design, and we guess the opposite can also be said where Apple does “copy” design and features found on other devices and software. However could Apple’s influence be so great to prompt smartphone makers to launch new variants? According to a report out of Korea via The Investor, it seems that both Samsung and LG are apparently working on variants of their current flagship handsets. With Samsung, the company is rumored to launch new color variants for its Galaxy S8 lineup, one of which is apparently “Rose Gold”. As for LG, apparently the company is planning on launching new LG G6 versions with different storage capacities in 32GB and 128GB options. Now it could be coincidental since introducing new color options and storage options aren’t exactly out of place for either company, although it is possible that the new color/storage options could be a way for these companies to keep their devices relevant and maybe attract new customers in the face of the iPhone 8. Analysts are predicting that Apple will be experiencing a super cycle in terms of sales with the iPhone 8 and that it could beat out the iPhone 6’s sales. So far sales of Apple’s iPhones have been on the decline but many believe that the iPhone 8 could turn things around. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

Apple also stated that in the past 12 months, downloads have grown over 70 percent. Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said: “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers. Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” Upon hearing that Apple has paid out $70 billion, our minds may initially turn to the initial costs of an app. One important source that contributed to the total figure was app subscriptions. Subscriptions are available to developers making apps for all 25 available categories. Apple reports that the active paid subscriptions are up 58 percent year over year. Apple said that apps in the Gaming and Entertainment categories bring in the most revenue, with hit games helping with the revenue figure. Most games are free to download but then make money from in-game perks which help the player progress through the game.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Access Your iCloud Calendar with Alexa By Jason Fitzpatrick on June 2nd, 2017 Thanks to a recent Alexa update, you can now access your iCloud calendar through your Amazon Echo, other Alexa-enabled devices, and the Alexa app. To do so, however, you’ll need to do a little tweaking behind the scenes. RELATED ARTICLE How to Link Your Google Calendar to Your Amazon Echo We’ve shown you how to link your Google Calendar to Alexa, but now we’re back to help iCloud users get the same functionality. In order to use your iCloud calendar with Alexa, you need three things: two-factor authentication enabled on your Apple account, an iCloud app-specific password just for Alexa, and, naturally, your Alexa device to accept the voice input. Step One: Create an App-Specific Password for Your Apple ID RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for Your Apple ID We won’t run through setting up two-factor authentication on your Apple account, but we do have a detailed guide on doing so here for those of you who haven’t enabled it already. Instead, let’s jump right into creating that app-specific password. Log into your Apple account at appleid.apple.com. Confirm your login by entering the two-factor identification code sent to your primary device. Once logged in, look for the section in your Apple ID control panel labeled “Security” and click on “Generate Password” as seen below. When prompted, label the app-specific password “Alexa” and click “Create”. Apple will provide you with a randomly generated alphanumeric string in the format xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx. Highlight and copy the password as we’ll be entering it in the next step of the tutorial. Step Two: Link Your iCloud Calendar to Alexa App-specific password in hand, it’s time to add your iCloud Calendar to Alexa. To do so you can either open up the Alexa app on your mobile device or you can visit alexa.amazon.com while logged into your Amazon account to access the Alexa dashboard from any web browser. (The latter is easier, since we’ll have to paste that password from step one.) Once logged into the dashboard, select “Settings” from the left-hand sidebar and then select “Calendar”. Within the Calendar menu, select the entry for Apple/iCloud. You’ll be prompted to enable two-factor authentication if you have not already done so, and to create an app-specific password. Because we’re already two steps ahead of the game, just click “Continue” to move forward. When prompted enter your Apple ID and your app-specific password and then click “Sign In”. After signing in you’ll see all your iCloud calendars, checked by default. Step Three: Configure Your Calendars, If Necessary If you’d prefer not to use certain calendars with Alexa, you can uncheck them now. Next, click on Settings > Calendar to return to the previous Calendars menu. Here, we need to make once final selection. In the drop down menu under “Alexa will add new events to this calendar:” select which of your iCloud calendars you want Alexa to use by default for any commands that add events. With that last detail squared away, we can start using Alexa with iCloud. Control iCloud Calendar by Voice Command RELATED ARTICLE How to Listen to Podcasts on Your Amazon Echo Now that the setup is behind us, it’s smooth sailing. You can access your iCloud calendar using natural language commands like you would any other Alexa function (like spooling up a podcast). While the calendar commands could definitely benefit from some flexibility (Alexa can’t answer the question “Alexa, is my weekend free?” for example), there are still plenty of things it can do. You, however, use commands like: “What’s on my calendar?” or “What’s my next event” to hear what the next scheduled event is. “What’s on my calendar tomorrow at [time]?” or “What’s on my calendar on [day]?” to get an overview of that time slot. “Add [event] to my calendar for [day] at [time].” to create an entry like “Add charity jog to my calendar for Tuesday at 2 PM.” Although the functionality is basic, it gets the job done, and allows you to check (and add to) your calendar using only voice commands.

Apple has begun production of a high-end speaker with Siri-based digital assistant technology to compete directly with Amazon's Alexa-based Echo speakers and the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Production is in the early stages, but the device could be unveiled as early as next week at WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference, according to the report. That would position the company to begin shipping in time for the winter holiday season. Inventec, which manufactures Apple AirPods, reportedly has landed the deal to build the intelligent speakers, and has begun expanding plant capacity to handle the demand. Apple aims to position its speaker not only as a digital assistant for the home, but also as a high-end audio device that will compete with Sonos and other leading speaker manufacturers, according to some reports. Apple already is a dominant player in the digital music arena with its iTunes music and video library. The device currently in production will have virtual surround sound technology and possibly will include sensors that automatically adjust volume based on the acoustics where the speakers are being used, according to the Bloomberg report. It also may use the company's HomeKit, which already works with Siri technology to automate the home, to act as a hub for home appliances, lights and other devices. Street Talk Speculation about the launch of a Siri-based speaker has heated up in recent weeks, following last month's report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who said there was a greater than 50 percent chance that Apple would unveil such a device at WWDC, which would give developers time to write new apps for it in time for the holiday shopping season. Apple had an installed base of 136 million iPhones in use in the U.S. as of March 31, plus another few million iPads and Apple computers. Most of the company's customers owned more than one Apple product, according to Michael Levin, a partner and analyst at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "It has also created a decent Home software suite that would allow whatever gadget they create to integrate its various hardware products -- smartphone, tablet, watch, computers, etc. -- into a home control system," he told the E-Commerce Times. "We expect that over time, at least a few million U.S. users would try out its new service and become a competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices." Apple TV Groundwork Apple currently has some of same type of capability found in smart speakers built into its Apple TV box, noted Michael Jude, a research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "This would likely be an adjunct device that would network to the existing Apple Home capabilities," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple has been angling towards a connected home capability for some time," Jude remarked. "Apple TV was sort of the opening salvo, but had a hard time getting traction because of its dependence on resolving content ownership issues," he explained. The rumored Siri-powered speaker "will extend Apple's capabilities, but will still be a less capable offering than Amazon's since it will lack the retail connections that Amazon can deliver," Jude said. "It will, however, put it at parity with Google -- perhaps ahead a little, since it will deliver iTunes and other content sources. Third Parties Key The strength of the Apple brand alone would provide the company with a competitive advantage with fans of the company, noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. However, unless the company were willing to open the platform up to third-party developers and hardware providers, it would lag Amazon and Google, he pointed out. "While being first to market with a home speaker device -- the Echo -- was a plus for Amazon, its real success is coming from all the third-parties that are looking at using Alexa on everything from smoke detectors to cars," McGregor told the E-Commerce Times. "Amazon also has a vast music library, book library and other retail ties to customers," he pointed out. "I would not bet against Amazon." Maturing Market Apple's move comes at a time when the core iPhone market has begun to mature. At the same time, Amazon and Google have taken a big bite out of the red hot digital assistant market. The Echo has propelled Amazon to record revenue and profits over the last couple of years, spinning off an entire new ecosystem of products that use its Alexa-based digital assistant technology. Google launched its own ecosystem of products and services anchored by the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker. It has a treasure trove of consumer search data and natural language capabilities to drive the use of Android-based mobile phones and other products based on its advanced development of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant may release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year. If reports of a Siri home speaker are correct, Apple will be entering a growing smart home market with a closing window of opportunity. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home proved to be commercial successes. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced more features to its Home speaker, including the ability to place free calls, connect with Bluetooth and control more apps like HBO Now and Hulu. Apple’s Siri speaker reportedly comes with a virtual surround sound technology that give it an edge in sound quality over its competitors, according to Bloomberg. But the biggest draw may be its compatibility with other Apple devices and services.

Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier.

Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call.

Of course, no one can know the future. And there have been some spectacular flubs when it comes to predicting the elements of the WWDC keynote. So why do we journalists bother? The authors of the book The Cluetrain Manifesto point out that “markets are conversations.” When informed, expert journalists talk about what Apple might discuss at the keynote, they’re not padding themselves on the back with their acumen at prognostication. Instead, as I wrote this week, they’re building on a collective, community knowledge base about what they and their readers would like to see from Apple. Sometimes those wishes are self-serving in that they tantalize the reader with a juicy headline. The conceit that the reader may find out something delicious about Apple’s plans is a powerful one. In practice, we know better. In general, the predictions by expert journalists is mostly a reflection of what they’ve learned from their readers and perhaps podcast guests since the last WWDC. This conversation can contain valuable insights for Apple, if it has a mind to listen. Of course, the other side of that coin is the legacy of Steve Jobs. We are also fond of the notion that Apple knows what we need before we know it ourselves. When the One More Thing is revealed, we gasp and declare: “Of course! Wow!” But we must also recall that the One More Thing surprise was one method Steve Jobs used to bring a company back from the dead. Today, Apple is thriving and successful. It has entered a mature stage. And, in that maturity, it’s also important for Apple to listen to customer needs even as it relentlessly moves technology forward. So when you read really great articles like “WWDC 2017: Apple Has a Lot to Talk About This Year,” by Jonny Evans and “Here’s What to Expect at Apple’s WWDC 2017 Keynote,” by Jeff Gamet, don’t focus on how wrong they might be. Instead, take these thoughts as inspiration to help you formulate your own directions and needs. And then see how those personal reflections fit with Apple’s actual keynote. In some cases, Apple will surprise. In some cases, it will disappoint. But our wisdom and perspectives evolve in the process. Next Page: The News Debris For The Week Of May 29th.

True, pundits and fans alike, when engaged in product prediction, are having an important conversation about what they would like, and Apple no doubt scans those discussions, although what they do with them is another matter. Given the long tail of product development, I don’t see Apple adjusting their rollout based on this chatter, but rather bracing themselves for impact when they observe a profound disconnect and having internal discussions about addressing those needs in future within the scope of their development pipeline (e.g. ‘No on the netbook; but how about an iPad?’). Expectations will vary across the spectrum, and some simply aren’t worth a moment’s reflection by a serious company. For example, were yours truly to express his real wish for the laptop of choice…(buckle up) it would be for a quantum device, supported by a Siri or AI interface, that is truly anticipatory. I could say, ‘Okay Siri, let’s write a grant proposal’; and she would say, ‘What shall we write about today?’, to which I would respond, ‘A proposal on phase 2 of project X’. Siri would scan my database across all hardware devices and cloud storage sites, and, nanoseconds later, reply ‘Ready’. With but a few opening keystrokes or dictated words, Siri would clue into where I’m going with this, and just like word suggestion on the iPhone – but on Incredible Hulk – busting steroids, respond with whole thought streams fit into paragraphs of prose, drawing from either my actual previous writings, works or recorded thoughts, or simply my writing style. Siri would provide me with whole thought-stream options at breakpoints; ‘Shall we go with thought option A or B?’ allowing me to select the next thought sequence, and by simply following where my eye alights and my pupil dilates with acceptance, chooses that option, and again, whole paragraphs of perfect text appear. If Siri detects stress, such as elevated blood pressure or heart rate on my Apple watch, or the release of stress hormones, she could pause and query for refinement. Moving on, my and my colleagues’ CVs are updated with our latest activities and publications, and fitted into the correct format for the application. Budgets, with my mere specification of categories and costs, auto-populate with running tallies of costs and overhead. Oh my! And by the time my coffee cools or I’m ready for lunch, whichever comes first, my proposal is done, and I can be ready for the next feat to the day. That’s my machine of choice. Now, let me put down the peyote and the opium pipe and come back to reality and the discussion at hand. You’ve rightly addressed the issue of managing expectations. To this, let me add, when it comes to Apple and anticipated products and services, we should consider two things in order to manage our expectations: trends and context. What do these mean? The first, trends, suggests that we look at the trajectory, pace, features and capabilities of a given product, and adjust expectations to the next likely step in extending those capabilities, but in keeping with precedent as to both consumer need and Apple’s history with respect to adopting newer capability. Specifically, bearing in mind that Apple practically never adopt a technology that cannot provide a consistent user experience, and is secure, however attractive it might be. Another historical precedent is that Apple are not likely to adopt a technology that will dramatically lessen battery life or performance speed. And finally, that technology must meet or beat Apple’s current security standards, without compromising that of the ecosystem. As for platform enrichment, this is the context in which evolving or new products and services are rolled out. The Apple Watch, for example, is meant to be Apple’s most personal product. It is reasonable to expect that Apple will extend the AW’s personal monitoring capability (e.g. Personal health indicators like blood glucose, specific proteins and by-products related to acute and chronic life threatening conditions), but not reasonable to expect Apple to add a new tech feature, like video recording, which could impair battery life and increase size, simply because a competitor might do so. Another example might be an emerging or unmet consumer need; like more powerful AI capability at the point of maximum impact or usefulness. Anticipate greater Siri capability and function on devices like the AW or the iPhone – devices that the user is likely to nearly always have available, but whose power and capability can be greatly extended by a more powerful but secure AI. In my view, and according to my observational experience, these two qualifiers, trend and context, allow one to not simply manage expectations, but when inevitably greeted with the unexpected, provide a rational reference frame from which to assess which consumer need has been addressed, objectively weigh its value proposition, and then make an evidence-based determination as to whether that need has been satisfactorily met, even if not in the way one might have expected. And in the last analysis, be ready to actually see, touch and play with it before declaring it to be a failure, and a portent of Apple’s impending doom.

We all need to do that in our work.” Yep, not just in work, but in many, if not all, parts of our life. — By the way, good comments by wab95, especially the last 2 paragraphs. But it seems that 95% of those “reporting news and views” online regularly neglect to do that. They zoom past any possible conceptual flaw that may have driven larger screens and accompany bigger batteries—like fires that burn down cars, houses or divert flights.

By Emily Bary June 2, 2017 3:50 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Get ready to hear about what's to come with Apple's newest mobile operating system. Illustration: Sean Gallup/Getty Images Apple is about ready to kick off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which is basically like summer camp for Apple geeks. The weeklong event begins Monday, and, as its name suggests, the conference is mainly geared toward software developers. But ordinary Apple fans and lots of reporters will be tuning in Monday at 1 p.m. ET for the big keynote address, when Apple is likely to make software and hardware announcements -- one of which could be an entirely new product. For Apple fans, the hope is the news will be enough to tide them over until Apple releases the next iPhone in the fall. Here’s a look at what’s likely to come out of the event. More from Barron’s Next Android vs. iOS: Are iPhones Really Safer? You Won’t Have to Wait for That iPhone 8 China’s Waning Loyalty to the iPhone A Siri-controlled speaker: Apple has so far missed the boat on digital home assistants, but the company might still want a shot at the market. If Apple does indeed announce a speaker on Monday, the product will not have been a well-kept secret. There have been a swirl of reports about the device lately, including one from Bloomberg yesterday, which said that while Apple might debut a home assistant at WWDC, it won’t be ready to ship them out until later in the year. Amazon’s Echo has become the market leader in the voice assistant world, though the Google Home has its fans too. Apple has a history of being late to the game and still finding a way to take over the market -- iPods and iPhones are good examples. New software: Expect to see what’s in store for iOS 11, Apple’s upcoming mobile operating system, as well as what’s to come for macOS, the Mac operating system. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani predicts that the iOS 11 will bring “a redesigned OS interface that better accommodates features of the iPhone 8 (no physical home button, etc.).” The question is how much Apple will reveal about such elements of the software, without tipping its hat too much about upcoming hardware features. (There’s been much speculation about those, as well.) New MacBooks: Those who bought the latest MacBook Pros when they arrived last fall likely weren’t expecting that a new model would come out so soon. But alas, Bloomberg reported a few weeks back that Apple would unveil a MacBook Pro with a faster processor during WWDC. In addition, the company could come out with a new MacBook and MacBook Air, as well as an iPad upgrade.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley doesn't want you to read the fine print Friday Jun 2, 2017 at 2:56 PM Jun 2, 2017 at 2:56 PM By Bryen Wright The great Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result. I’ve read all the information from both sides of the Measure F debate, and have concluded that voting No is best for my family and Apple Valley. The first thing I did was read the official materials put out by the town. “The estimated cost of the acquisition of the Apple Valley Water System could amount to $150 million.” Isn’t this amount nearly three times more than what government officials told their constituents when this started? And what do they have in mind with money they think will be left over? Save themselves from more deficit spending, the kind of thing a municipality with substandard financial management does? Sort of like in Flint, Michigan and Apple Valley? Next, the official documents state: “The maximum rate of interest to be paid on said indebtedness ($150 million) shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law, to wit, twelve percent (12%) per year. The actual rate or rates on said debt to be determined at or prior to the time it is incurred.” The town keeps telling us that this isn’t real because rates today are lower, but their language says the only date that matters is when the borrowing happens. Even if they are successful at winning an eminent domain verdict, that won’t be for at least two or three years, and interest rates are already going up. Voters should look closely at the Measure F fine print because that is the contract we all are signing if they agree to repay $150 million in debt by voting Yes. All the promises by town management stating publicly they will invest in lowering the bills "or" capital improvements. Which is it? Anyone would interpret this means either or. The problem with being so vague is currently we have surrounding cities not properly managing their water systems dealing with brown water, excessive pipe breakage, skimping on water testing, hidden fees/cost that residents don't see or think of and many more issues that Apple Valley residents don't have to deal with. Translating official ballot language into plain Apple Valley English, here’s what Measure F is: Measure F lets government borrow up to $150 million. Bonds would be repaid, plus interest, by ratepayers, through a new debt service fee added to your water bill. It allows government to force you to pay up to 12 percent interest (even though it should be much lower is still 100s of millions of dollars of interest only) on the $150 million, “daily, weekly, monthly or semi-annually.” Buried in the fine print is language that allows government to raid public funds, unrelated to water, to repay principal and interest. Apple Valley documents state they’re planning to charge expensive new water connection fees, increasing new home prices by tens of thousands of dollars. The town says there will be no tax increases, but that is just a smoke screen. No, it is not a tax. But it is a fee each customer will have to pay — sort of like a 30-year Mello Roos that will cost each customer between $15,000 and $18,000 over the life of the bond. Money out of our pockets. This information surprised me, because nothing coming from the supporters of Measure F discloses these facts. I then looked at research conducted by economic experts to see what they say about Measure F. I found two separate studies and read them from beginning to end. The first one was by Dr. John Husing, a local economist who has been recognized by the Town of Apple Valley as an “industry expert.” He’s been doing research here since 1962. Dr. Husing came to the following conclusion: “A look at the possible water costs for each customer from a revenue bond given these circumstances shows a high probability for significant rate increases. Even if the $150 million Measure F bond level is sufficient, it could cost customers an extra $502 or $620 per year equal to $84 or $103 per bi-monthly bill. Voters should be hesitant to take such a risk.” Then, I read a second study, conducted by Dr. Rodney T. Smith, a former professor at Claremont McKenna College, who specializes in the economics, finance and public policy of water resources. He wrote, “The data set forth in this paper demonstrate that if the town condemns Liberty Utilities Apple Valley by eminent domain, higher water rates for town residents are a virtual certainty for decades to come. If the goal of acquiring Liberty Utilities Apple Valley is to charge lower water rates, then the effort should be abandoned because that goal is not a feasible outcome.” Dr. Smith concluded that customer water bills would increase by $538 annually if Measure F passes. Remember my point about insanity? The reality is that every economic expert who has looked at Measure F agrees that it will cost Apple Valley families a lot more money and that the debt will be passed on to our children and grandchildren. I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot of campaign rhetoric between now and Election Day, but none of it changes what Measure F actually does. If you vote Yes, you’re agreeing to pay at least $500 more every year on your water bill to repay $150 million in debt. That’s why our family is voting No. Measure F is debt Apple Valley doesn’t need and a debt that we cannot afford. Bryen Wright is an Apple Valley resident who ran for Town Council in 2016.

Advertisement The pace at which companies are adopting circular economy business models has been accelerating for the last two decades—and it has evolved from a specialist concept to a mainstream business strategy. Accenture Strategy recently surveyed more than 500 manufacturing companies with revenues greater than $1 billion, and found that more than 90% said they are implementing circular business models. And nearly all larger product-based companies say they’ve put in place circular supply chains for material recovery and recycling. But too often, programs remain “skin deep.” The vast majority of companies are utilizing circularity in principle, but they are failing to capture the full potential of the approach. As we look ahead to the next wave of circular business models, and as innovation continues to uncover brand-new opportunities to act sustainably and responsibly, it’s time to come full circle—transform supply chain operations and company cultures to build a network of partners, suppliers and markets that fully capitalize on circularity.   Circling Success Accenture Strategy research found that, when it comes to the elements of circular supply chains that companies are prioritizing, recycling comes out on top. But while recycling wasted materials across a company’s operations is certainly a step in the right direction, it is low-hanging fruit that only scratches the surface when it comes to squeezing value out of the circular economy. When looking at the adoption of deeper circular economy strategies—where companies are reusing or refurbishing materials they’ve recaptured at the end of life—there is significant room for improvement. While nearly all companies report products are returned for reuse or refurbishing, 75% ultimately destroy 45-75% of the recaptured products—losing all the embedded value.  And while 92% of companies surveyed say they are geared up for product life extension, only 30% to 40% are actually doing it. The survey reveals that many companies are adopting circular economy strategies because of competitive pressure, such as if a low-cost rival offers a similar part, or due to warranty issues—not with the intention of bringing large-scale change to the business by putting circularity at the forefront of supply chain operations. So most efforts don’t decouple production from primary resource use. Not only is this leading to sizable losses in cost savings and efficiencies, but it is also resulting in missed opportunities to unleash growth and profitability across the business.   First Movers Reap Significant Value Meanwhile, success stories show that first movers who go beyond basic recycling in favor of deeper, strategic approaches are achieving significant business value. For instance, Apple took quick action when it found that a number of low-cost competitors were refurbishing their iPhone products and reselling them in Asia. Rather than give up this market segment, Apple jumped right on board, refurbishing their products (even the iPhone 7) and selling them at a lower price to Asian consumers. Other recent company initiatives also reveal a promising path ahead for circular models—and underscore that the opportunity to replicate these models elsewhere is now unprecedented. More and more, companies are announcing zero waste goals—and changes to the entire supply chain function rather than just individual projects. One company that has successfully embraced the full circle approach to waste elimination in its supply chain is Dell. Dell manufactures products from plastics recovered from its own computer products—recapturing plastics in a closed-loop fashion to use in the production of new products. This results in a smaller carbon footprint and a reduction in manufacturing costs. Caterpillar’s Cat Reman program is another bright star in the full circle approach. The program offers customers the option of buying parts that have been refurbished from existing equipment to a “same as new” standard. And this means that the environment also wins. CAT recycles 134 million pounds of material annually and is approaching “zero landfill” status. There is other promising news in store—traditional barriers to adopting circular as a business strategy are quickly falling. That’s in large part thanks to digital technologies such as analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, which are helping to eliminate hurdles in operational issues such as sorting materials and recapturing them. Materials can be traced, while loops can be closed. Accenture Strategy research found that 90% of companies believe digital technology has facilitated their ability to implement operational changes to deliver circular supply chains, product life extension or waste-to-value capabilities. In short, digital has eradicated any “excuses” for not acting.   Coming Full Circle To capture the full potential of the circular economy in supply chain operations, companies need to pursue higher—and often more complex—value initiatives. To do that, successful companies should follow these four steps: 1. Focus on driving circular business models to capture the full value of the opportunity. At any given point in time, $7 trillion worth of passenger cars are unused around the world. It’s a staggering opportunity—one that was recognized by Daimler through its subsidiary car2go. To act on something this big, it takes an expanded vision of circular that goes beyond recycling and prioritizes quantifying the full value of the opportunity for a circular transformation. 2. Break down silos. Circularity can be disruptive to any organization – requiring both strategic collaboration with suppliers and across functions such as R&D, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing and marketing. Corporate barriers are the reason why too many companies stop at recycling, which can be accomplished within a single functional silo. Companies that will gain the greatest value from circular will be those that look for opportunities that impact the very core of their operating models as well as seek to build a network of partners—both inside and outside of the company. 3. Start the circle from the top. Leadership at the very top of the company must create business imperatives, cultural changes and governance to promote circular objectives—as well as integrated goals and metrics. That requires taking traditional metrics—such as EBITDA and gross margin—and blending them with new metrics aimed at measuring the effectiveness of circularity. These include take-back quantities, the degree to which materials were effectively refurbished or reused, and resource productivity. 4. Leverage digital. Technologies, such as the IoT, radio-frequency identification (RFID) and analytics, are critical for embedding circularity across operations and company networks to increase the ability to track resources, and to monitor things like utilization and waste capacity. Digital allows companies to have a much more granular understanding of the value of materials, and to gauge the condition of assets and products—determining when they’ll need service or replacement, for example. Gaining these capabilities is quickly becoming “table stakes” to engage in a fuller circular economy supply chain. The circular economy is gaining real traction in the supply chains of most major product-based companies. Leaders in circularity spanning Apple, Caterpillar and Dell are showing first-hand the tremendous value that can be gained from making circularity a core tenet of business strategy. Once companies move beyond low-hanging fruit and adopt deeper circular business models through the four strategies outlined above, they’ll find unexpected benefits.   Sudipta Ghosh is a managing director focused on operations strategy at global consulting firm Accenture Strategy.

Apple is finding those folks through a platform called TryRating. According to the report, the freelancers are able to complete up to 600 tasks a week, as long as it doesn’t exceed 20 hours of work. Apple Maps has improved dramatically since its calamitous debut back in 2012 with iOS 6, when it, among other things, directed drivers onto runways and lost the Statue of Liberty. However, Google Maps is still seen as as the best on the block. Speaking of Google, it's the second time this week one of its rivals is offering money to assist in the catch-up effort. Earlier on Friday we reported Microsoft is paying people to frequent its Bing search engine instead of Google. The program, which pays out through Microsoft Bing Rewards, has now been expanded to the UK. It enables participants to earn points that can be spent on Skype credit, Groove Subscriptions and Xbox gift cards. iPhone users, do you prefer Apple Maps or Google Maps?

world yesterday and withdrew the United States from the Paris Accord, a global agreement to combat climate change. The agreement had nearly universal support, but Trump said withdrawing is good for American business. But American business leaders disagree. President Donald Trump demonstrates for the cameras how little thought he gave to withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) CEOs from companies in practically every sector of American life issued statements yesterday denouncing Trump's decision. Business leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger even signalled that this was the last straw, and announced that they'd no longer act as advisers to the US president. Even before Trump's decision yesterday, the Paris Accord had broad support in the business community. On 26 April 2017 a group of companies wrote an open letter to the president, asking him to stay in the agreement. Companies as diverse as Walmart and DuPont and Intel all signed the letter. Even energy companies like ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron also implored Trump not to drop the Paris Accord in the lead up to yesterday's announcement from the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't listen.

We can only imagine that this list will continue to grow in the coming weeks. Twenty years from now, we have no idea what the defining moment of Trump's shameful presidency will be. But with climate change already impacting the world in disastrous ways, his decision to needlessly shun the environment should at least crack the top 10. But who knows? Trump still has so much time to inflict very real damage on both the United States and the rest of the world — a world that increasingly sees America as a joke that elected a neo-fascist reality TV star as its president.

"We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more."

"If the US exits international accords like the Paris agreement it will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment and relationships among the world community."

Comments lee978 @978lee Jun 3, 2017, 7:32am Where does Trump get his facts about economic benefits vs costs of responding to climate change? How is this even "costing" the economy anything as there are clearly benefits in jobs, manufacturing and HUGE export potential. It's one thing to deny science but now economics too. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Jun 3, 2017, 10:16am So all these successful business leaders can see that the Paris Accords are a good thing but the failed business leader can't? Why is that not surprising? All you need to know about Trump's business acumen is that he sent a successful Casino into bankruptcy. Reply 0 thelovedog @thelovedog Jun 3, 2017, 1:15pm Editors, Reading your ABOUT page title states, "Gizmodo loves technology + entertainment" and goes further to explain what the website is about, "We're obsessed with the gadgets, car tech, science and geek culture that change the way we live. Gizmodo covers Australian science and entertainment news with a team of award-winning journalists — and localises the best posts from the US + UK editions." All well and good, so in light of this information, why are you publishing poilitical news about Trump, surely this would be better off in the BUSINESS INSIDER arm of your publications. I come to GIZMODO to read about TECHNOLOGY and ENTERTAINMENT, not about poilitics. Regards. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jun 4, 2017, 11:19pm If you dislike these articles. THEN DONT READ AND COMMENT ON THEM. Reply 0 steve f. Guest Jun 3, 2017, 2:28pm Because all these mega millionaires and their companies really, really deeply care about ordinary people like you. Ha.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Latest iPhone 8 leak looks like crap Harrison Weber@harrisonweber June 2, 2017 1:39 PM We don’t know how Apple plans to redesign the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, or whatever Apple plans to call its next two (or three) phones. But there is an eclectic assortment of hints to go on just three days before Apple’s annual developer conference. Let’s review: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is the flagship investors have pined for. It’s apparently tailor-made for augmented reality. There will be a slimmer bezel — but how slim? It’s coming in June — or this fall, or even 2018. It’s gonna be totally clear — no, no, no. It could charge wirelessly? And most pressing: Apple magically slipped its Touch ID fingerprint scanner beneath the glass, under the screen itself — very cool! Or maybe not: A new leak suggests otherwise. Images from iPhoneros reinforce an earlier rumor that Apple has totally given up and decided to slap its fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 8’s butt. Let’s rephrase that statement as a question: Is Jony Ive trying to get fired? As 9to5Mac reports, this may just be one of many design variations Apple has tested recently, while the company figures out its production plans for the device. Apple, please don’t let this be your big update after three whole years. Let it be a fake. Just, no.

By Crystal Kim June 2, 2017 3:38 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn appeared on Bloomberg TV to talk about General Motors (GM) and his plan to unlock shareholder value, yet again. Makes sense given the auto company is holding its annual meeting next week Tuesday. We'll all find out soon enough if Einhorn's proposed dual-class share will take a step forward or go by the way of his iPrefs idea for Apple (AAPL). David Einhorn, President of Greenlight Capitol Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images Bloomberg TV provided Barrons.com with a transcript of the video that can be seen here. Here are the highlights from Einhorn's discussion with David Westin:  How the dual-class share will unlock value It has to do with choice.  Think of it as an ice cream stand that sells just vanilla chocolate swirl.  There's some people who like vanilla chocolate swirl, and we'll call those the GM shareholders.  But if chocolate is the dividend and vanilla is the rest of the operation, imagine if you sold chocolate, vanilla, or swirl, in any combination that you want.  That ice cream stand would attract more customers. So there's people who'd be interested in the income feature of the dividends.  They would buy the dividend shares.  And those would be new participants in the market that would come in, and they would get them, we think to a seven to nine percent yield.  And similarly, there are people who are not that interested in a dividend but want just to see the stock go up.  They would buy the growth shares, the capital appreciation shares, and we think that that would trade at about the same PE as you have right now. How GM is like Apple Look, with Apple, they had a problem with capital allocation.  They were storing lots and lots of cash.  They were returning none of it to shareholders... But instead, what they did was they changed their constraint. They previously said, we're not buying back stock, and since then, they've borrowed $100 billion. They've bought back a quarter of the stock, at less than $100.  The PE net of cash has expanded from 7 to 13, in part because Apple has a better capital allocation policy today than it did before we came in. Now GM has a similar inefficient balance sheet.  They've said that there's these constraints because they want to retain all of this money for a potential rainy day.  There's several ways to get at it.  Our purpose in electing directors is to get at that problem. Why he's short Tesla Tesla is one of many things we have in what we so call our bubble basket of stocks that we just think are mispriced and are mispriced by huge, huge amounts.  And they're sized in a way that gives us the ability to wait a fair amount of time to be proven right or wrong.  I think eventually, the mood of the market will change.  Eventually, the company will be called into account to demonstrate profitability.  I don't know when that will happen.  And the portfolio's positioned properly relative to the risk and the reward there.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Computer Stocks to Buy in 2017 Investors looking for a play on computers -- as well as their software and hardware -- should consider these three companies this year. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Jun 2, 2017 at 3:09PM In the first quarter of 2017 the PC market reported its first growth in the past five quarters, but just barely. PC sales, which include desktops, notebooks, and workstations, hit 60.3 million units in the first quarter, up 0.6% year over year according to research from IDC.  Despite this snail-like growth, there are still several solid opportunities for investors looking to snatch up the best computer stocks this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are all longtime players in the computer market, and each is poised to benefit in its respective segment this year.  Image source: Apple. Apple Apple reported Mac unit sales of 4.2 million in its fiscal second quarter 2017, an increase of 4% year over year, and said the net revenue from those sales hit $5.8 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple's PC sales pale in comparison to its iPhone business, but that doesn't mean Apple should be written off as a solid computer investment.  Image source: Apple. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that its new Macbook Pro helped spur Mac revenues in the quarter, and that Mac business has generated over $25 billion of revenue over the past four quarters. "We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform," Cook added.  Apple will likely keep the good times rolling for its Macs this year when it releases updates to both the Pro and regular Macbook lineups next month. The company is expected to bring new, 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chips into both the Macbook and Macbook Pro lineups, which should boost processing speeds and increase battery life. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor in the world. It just raised it's dividend by 10.5% in the second quarter, and continues to prove that incremental upgrades to its Macs and other devices are more than enough to drive more growth from this longtime computer stock.  Abobe Pivoting to the software side of computer stocks, Adobe is a great example of a company transitioning from one-time software sales to recurring revenue through a subscription-based model -- and it's paying off enormously for the company.  Adobe just reported its strongest first quarter ever, with revenue up 21.6% year over year to $1.68 billion and GAAP net income jumping 56.7% to $254.3 million. The company's Digital-media segment, driven by subscriptions to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, deserve most of the credit for the stellar quarter, as it grew 22% year over year.  Image source: Adobe. Even with sales of PCs slowing down, Abobe is proving there is still substantial need for creative software that users are willing to pay for on an ongoing basis. Adobe CFO Mark Garrett indicated in a press release that there's likely more for investors to look forward to this year as well. Our solid execution and business momentum combined with strong market tailwinds give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong financial results. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of 2017 and beyond. NVIDIA NVIDIA may not be what you consider a traditional computer stock, but the company makes the vast majority of its revenue -- about 53% -- from sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into PCs, which, I think, is a solid computer stock bonafide. NVIDIA has caught the attention of investors for its growing opportunities in driverless cars and virtual reality, but the company's GPUs are also being used to power complex data centers for artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.  Image source: NVIDIA. Intel may dominate the server business right now, but NVIDIA's chips are already helping Facebook, Alphabet, and others take the next step into visual computing and neural network learning. NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer is a prime example of this -- it can learn 12 times faster than the company's previous machine learning computers.  Aside from AI computing, NVIDIA's GPUs are the go-to choice for PC makers' graphics processing needs for gaming and virtual reality. That bodes very well for NVIDIA, as IDC has noted that PC gaming growth is helping to stabilize the broader PC market and VR is shaping up to be a nearly $34 billion business by 2022.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology The Essential Phone vs. iPhone 7 Will Shanklin June 2, 2017 How does Andy Rubin's Essential Phone compare to the iPhone 7? View gallery - 20 images Android co-founder Andy Rubin's The Essential Phone joins a crowded field of smartphones competing for the same Android enthusiast base of customers. Let's see how the Essential Phone compares to Apple's behemoth across the aisle, the iPhone 7. Size NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Sizes aren't dramatically different, with the Essential Phone measuring 3-percent taller, 6-percent wider and 10-percent thicker. Weight The Essential Phone does, however, tip the scales at 34-percent heavier. Build Rubin says the Essential Phone is sturdier than aluminum rivals like the iPhone, with its titanium frame and ceramic back. Water resistance Even if the Essential Phone can survive drops without the use of a case, it isn't designed to withstand exposure to water. Display size The Essential Phone joins a soon-to-be-crowded group of phones with minimal bezels. Apple will join that club later this year, but for now the iPhone 7 has plenty of bezel surrounding its screen – and an inferior screen-size-to-phone-size ratio. Display resolution The Essential Phone's QHD+ screen packs in the pixels much tighter, though Apple's focus on other details (contrast, white balance, brightness) makes iPhone screen quality often transcend by a wide margin what you'd expect from their pixel counts. Processor The Essential Phone runs Qualcomm's 2017 flagship chip, the Snapdragon 835. RAM The Essential Phone doubles the iPhone's RAM, but Apple is known for doing more with less in the RAM department (in terms of how specs translate into real-world performance). Battery The Essential Phone has a much bigger battery, but with many other factors weighing into actual battery life, you can only glean so much from this. Fast charging Apple had better include fast charging in its 2017 flagships: iPhones have fallen way behind in this respect. Camera megapixels Camera quality is also impossible to determine entirely from a spec sheet; this too will need to wait for reviews. Camera aperture (rear) Apertures, which can determine the quality of low-lit shots, are very similar. Storage Apple offers three different storage tiers, while Essential sticks with one generous 128 GB option. microSD Neither has expandable storage. Fingerprint sensor Essential Phone has a fingerprint sensor on its back, while the iPhone's lives inside its home button. Headphone jack Like Apple, Essential sees the 3.5-mm headphone jack as a relic from the past. Software The Essential Phone is supposed to launch with the latest version of Android Nougat – and apparently without the custom manufacturer skins often associated with non-Pixel/Nexus Android handsets. Release You can reserve an Essential Phone pre-order now, with the first shipments scheduled to start in June. Starting price (full retail) At least on paper, the Essential Phone looks like a solid value compared to the iPhone 7 – with a much bigger screen, supposedly sturdier build and modular potential (which, right now, only includes a 360° camera). On the other hand, it's joining a group of phones already including the Google Pixel and OnePlus series that's targeting the same base of Android-enthusiast customers. And if you're invested in Apple's ecosystem and like the company's hardware-software synchronicity, it's hard to see the Essential Phone being enough to pry you away.

Photo Credit: Noah K. Murray advertisement | advertise on newsday Eli Apple didn’t know the old Landon Collins. He wasn’t around when Collins was a rookie, at times looking overwhelmed and overmatched as a starting safety in a patchwork secondary. The only Collins he saw up close was the All-Pro version that emerged last season to become a force for the Giants’ defense while Apple himself was going through his sometimes bumpy rookie year. That doesn’t mean that Apple was unaware of the jump Collins made from his first to second year in the NFL. Latest Giants stories Pierce mentoring Giants’ young LB Goodson Tye embraces underdog role in fight for job Glauber: Enunwa a shining light from dark Idzik era Right tackle Hart dedicated to stepping up game Giants add WR Jerome Lane “It was tough not to pay attention to it because that’s what everybody was talking about last year,” Apple told Newsday after the Giants’ organized team activities Friday. This year, Apple would like to follow Collins’ trajectory with his own sophomore surge. He’d like to leap from a solid but unspectacular rookie campaign to become a standard-bearer for the defense. And he’s using Collins as a bit of a road map. “You have to take a more serious approach about everything, you have to be able to be a grown man about things,” Apple said. “Landon, he does a lot of things for himself outside of football. That means getting his body right, working on recovery and stuff. That’s something I need to work on and something I’m working on now.” GiantsGiants OTAs 2017 And something he’s been working on all offseason. Training in Arizona, Apple put on nearly 10 pounds of muscle since last season ended. He was at 195 throughout college and for most of last year but now weighs 204. And while that strength will help him be a better, more physical tackler and allow him to contend with big-bodied receivers at the line of scrimmage, it has not had an adverse effect on his speed. Last week, in fact, he said the GPS chip the Giants use to track players during practices registered that he’d never been faster since joining the team as last year’s first-round pick. advertisement | advertise on newsday “It’s the truth,” he said with a grin when challenged about the reading. It was during that pace-setting practice on May 25 when Apple tweaked his hamstring, and he hasn’t been on the field with the team for any important activities since. He said he hopes to be back on the field before the offseason program ends in two weeks. Even if he’s not, his mental comfort with the defense is improving each day. “I’m 10 times ahead of where I was last year,” he said. The physical alteration, though, is what’s most noticeable at first glance. He credited the change to hard work and diet, getting rid of the junk food and telling his mother to make less fried chicken for him. But he also took it upon himself to learn how to cook a bit, took more responsibility for his actions and decisions and, as he said of Collins, tried to become “a grown man.” Apple’s physical transformation during his first offseason in the NFL also rings of Collins, although the safety lost weight instead of gaining it to come back sleeker and more agile. Giants videos None of this means that Apple automatically will follow Collins’ ascension. And he knows that. “You have to be your own self,” Apple said. “You can’t just look at one guy and be like, ‘This is how it’s going to work for me.’ But you can try to take little things that you learned from his jump and try to implement them into what you have going on.” And hopefully, Apple said, even if the paths are different, the results will be similar.

With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it’s Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some say Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant might release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the internet. The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5,000 developers – who each paid $1,599 after winning a lottery – is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech Monday morning. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable – Google identifies itself as an AI first company – as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year.

With iDropLinks you can easily deploy your work and files to your colleagues, friends or acquaintances by sending a download link – and the recipient user does not even need to be a iCloud Drive-user. Within this newest version of iDropLinks it’s possible to share folders from iCloud Drive and you can even protect your generated link with a password. How does sharing work? iDropLinks will ask the specific Download-Links from Apple in fractions of a second and will save them to your iDropLinks account, secured on German servers. Your shared files stay in the iCloud Drive and will not be moved to our servers. iDropLinks for iOS also includes an intuitive link-shortener, which shortens your links intelligently to a minimum. You can use the link-shortener universally in other apps, too (Extension). The app generates the download links rapidly, encrypts and stores it in your idroplinks-account, secured on German servers. iDropLinks offers the opportunity to share each created download link via dozens of interfaces, such as iMessage, Email, WhatsApp. You can resend and open links at anstimme. There is no limitation of filesize. Create groups to send links quickly and easily with just one click to your work group, your family or your company employees.

Can’t rest until you know which summer blockbuster your pals enjoyed most? If you love finding out your friends’ opinions, I have good news: you don’t have to go around asking them individually. Thanks to the power of social media polls, you can quiz your friends and get responses in real-time. Next time you have to know whether vanilla or chocolate is more popular, here’s how to collect the thoughts of those closest to you. Twitter Polls In 2015, Twitter rolled out native support for polls, and they couldn’t be simpler. Just create a new tweet on the web or mobile versions of Twitter, and click the small Poll icon at the bottom of the tweet draft. You’ll have the standard 140 characters to type out a question, and can add up to four choices for readers to respond with. Finally, you can select the amount of time the poll stays alive for. The default is one day, but you can run a poll for a few minutes or an entire week. Which of these @MakeUseOf sections is your favorite? — Ben Stegner (@stegnersaurus) May 30, 2017 Obviously, your Twitter poll will only reach your followers to start, so the amount of responses you get will depend on how large your following is 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know Read More . As long as your Twitter account isn’t private, anyone can retweet the poll just like any other tweet. If you start a poll about a hot topic, it could quickly spread beyond your sphere. To share the poll with more people, you can also embed it like you would a normal tweet. Pasting the URL to the tweet or using the embed code will let you add it to your blog or share on other social networks. Users must be signed into Twitter to vote, however. New poll!

Check out our tips on making better Twitter polls Twitter Polls: Everything You Need to Know Twitter Polls: Everything You Need to Know Can't decide whether to order Chinese or pizza tonight? Ask! Twitter has finally launched a built-in option to conduct public polls. It's completely free and works on both mobile and desktop. Read More to improve yours. Straw Polls Don’t use Twitter? Or want to share your polls across more services? The ultra-simple site Straw Poll is for you. It doesn’t require any sign-up or authentication. Simply type a question for your social media poll, enter as many choices as you need, and you’ve got a link you can share with your friends anywhere. Once a user completes it, they can view the results or share it with their friends via social links. To prevent spam and duplicate answers, Straw Poll offers a few extra options. The drop-down box below the poll offers three choices for blocking duplication: IP Duplication Checking — Users can’t vote from the same IP address multiple times. This will prevent two people living in the same house from both voting. Browser Cookie Duplication Checking — Instead of checking the IP address, Straw Poll will check the user’s browser cookies to see if they’ve voted yet. This allows two people in the same house to each vote, but if someone cleared their cookies What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous? What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous?

No Duplication Checking — The poll does not check for duplicate votes, so somebody could vote as many times as they wanted to. You’ll find two additional options when creating polls. Improve spam prevention will add a CAPTCHA to your poll, requiring users to solve a quick puzzle to prove they aren’t robots. If you select Allow multiple poll answers, users can check as many options as they want. This service doesn’t offer an option to end polls after a certain time. Overall, Straw Poll is the easiest way to create a quick social media poll that you can share anywhere. It doesn’t require your friends to sign up, works great on mobile, and collects the data you want in a simple form.

Google Forms If you’re running an official quiz for a class assignment or something similar, you might need more flexible options and actionable data than a Twitter poll or Straw Poll provides. That’s where Google Forms comes in. This tool in the free Google Docs suite lets you create polls with different types of questions, add multiple pages, and send all the data to a spreadsheet for analysis. Head to Google Forms to get started. Like other Google tools, you can start with a blank form and build your own or use a template for common events like an RSVP, t-shirt ordering, or contact info. Question forms include: Short answer — Let someone type a sentence or two, like their name or a brief thought on a topic. Multiple choice — Standard question with multiple answers, only one of which the user can select. You can also add an Other option here. Checkboxes — You provide multiple answers and the respondent can select as many as apply. Linear scale — Set a numbered scale and ask the user to rate how often they do something or how strongly they feel on a question. Forms Options To add some flow to your poll, you can add images and YouTube videos using the right sidebar. You could ask how a particular image makes someone feel, or if they laughed at a YouTube video, for instance. Dividing your poll into sections will break it into multiple pages, and you can send users to these sections based on their answers. For instance, if you’re creating a poll to see which iPhone apps people use most often, your first page could simply ask Do you own an iPhone? If the user said No, you can specify that choosing that answer sends them to the end of the poll. This lets you ask completely different sets of questions How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow Google Forms is the office workflow interface you didn't know you needed. Use Google Forms to collect information and in the next step add details or trigger a process. Read More depending on how earlier ones are answered. If surprise is a key factor in your poll, you can even shuffle the question order. To make your form a true quiz, click the Settings gear in the upper-right corner, then select the Quizzes tab. This lets you assign point values to questions. Forms will automatically grade them and show the respondent their score. Once your poll is all set, click the Send button to get a shareable link or send via email. After some people have answered, switching to the Responses tab lets you see how they responded. This also neatly formats the data into graphs and charts for easy analysis. Forms will import the responses into a new Google Sheets spreadsheet, so you can use that data elsewhere if you like.

I wonder why I'm always sleepy at work and here I am at 1am trying to find out what kind of fruit I am from Facebook quizzes — Manpreet Sandhu (@manpreettier) May 30, 2017 This type of social media quiz doesn’t require much. Just head on over to Facebook and make up a list of questions in your status. Try some questions like these to get started: What was my first concert?

What band do I never get tired of, and why? How many times did I lie last week? Silly, trivial bits of information like this are fun to share.

While telling your friends small bits of info like your first concert might seem trivial, this information could also be used against you.

Credit: Apple More like this iPhone 8 rumors: Delayed production schedule could result in blockbuster... WWDC 2017 wish list: iOS 11 features that would take the iPhone and iPad to... Should Apple dump Lightning from the iPhone 8? The cases for and against Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions It’s the week before the kick-off of Apple’s product year at WWDC in San Jose. This is a week full of wish lists, rumors, speculation, and wild ideas. Next week all of that will collapse into one single truth: the reality of what’s unveiled on stage in San Jose. Gamblers know this feeling. Once the result is known, all of the probabilities collapse to the cold, hard truth of winners and losers. With that theme in mind, this is not another WWDC Wish List. Rather, consider this a report on the current odds of various WWDC predictions coming true. This is all in fun, ladies and gentlemen, so please: no wagering! Sure bets The surest bet at any WWDC is that Apple will unveil the next generation of all of its operating systems, due to ship in the fall. Yes, it’s a near certainty that Apple will announce details about the next versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Another near-certainty: Apple likes to please its audience, and at WWDC (unlike the invite-only media events Apple holds the rest of the year), the audience is primarily Apple developers. So you can count on Apple making some announcements that are focused on getting whoops of applause from the assembled developers. That will likely come in a verbal commitment to professional Mac users—and pretty much every developer for Apple’s platforms uses a Mac to get their job done. Apple Expect to hear a lot about Apple services like iCloud. Apple has been hyping the growth of its Services revenue line with Wall Street a lot recently. Services are a major growth area for Apple, and while it’s easy to lose sight of them when we’re all hyped up for new hardware and software announcements, it’s hard to imagine that Apple’s various services won’t be a recurring theme of the keynote. We’ll hear about iCloud, iCloud Photo Library, and Apple Music... a lot. If you’ve been paying attention to the last couple of years of tech-industry stage events, it’s clear that the large tech companies (especially Apple) have heard the criticism that their stage presenters are overwhelmingly white and male. Apple has been slowly changing the mix of their presenters, bringing in new faces including more women and people of color. The usual suspects will be on stage, of course, but it’s not much of a bet to predict that we’ll see a bunch of new faces on stage as well. Finally, I’m not going to accept any bets about the fact that Apple will continue something it’s been doing at most of its major events for the past two years: defining what Apple Watch is good at. Since the first what-doesn’t-it-do event in September of 2014, Apple has been working to give the product more definition. Health and fitness have both been areas of focus, and I expect to see those enhanced, perhaps joined by one or two more. Apple is still in the process of defining the Apple Watch, and that process will continue. Informed speculation Go to the race track and you’ll find someone who thinks they have a hot tip or inside information about what’s to come. (Disclosure: I’ve never been to a race track, but I’ve seen “Seabiscuit” and “The Killing”—that’s good enough, right?) Rumors serve the same purpose for laying WWDC odds. Some rumors are always right, but all rumors are never right. The trick is knowing which rumors are more likely to come true. Adam Patrick Murray A new iPad Pro announcement? Seems likely. Lately the rumor mill has been bubbling about the possibility of Apple unveiling a new iPad Pro at WWDC, a replacement for the existing 9.7-inch model, with a higher-resolution screen. Normally I’d be skeptical of such claims, but the iPad Pro hasn’t been updated in more than a year and these rumors suggest this product has been ready to go for some time now. Meanwhile, fans of the iPad Pro have been restless, since the major additions of pro features in iOS 9 were followed by almost no new pro features in iOS 10. It makes sense for Apple to introduce a new iPad Pro at the same time as trumpeting its commitment to the iPad via a bunch of major new pro features in iOS 11. That’s why I think this rumor is fairly likely to come true. A bunch of laptop updates are also thick in the rumor mill, and it’s true that the MacBook is in need of an update. But the rumors also suggest that Apple might put new chips in the existing MacBook Pro models, which were just released last fall. That seems surprising—but it does fit with one of my sure-thing themes of the event, which is Apple showing a bigger commitment to its professional users, especially developers. Telling a crowd of developers that Apple is rapidly updating its pro laptops is a demonstration of Apple’s commitment, and would be met with cheers. IDG An Amazon TV deal with Apple has made the rumor mill, but is it worth mentioning during the WWDC keynote? At these events Apple loves to talk about amazing entertainment deals it’s made. The trick is, even if Apple’s willing, are its partners? It would make sense that Apple would trumpet some coup on stage, whether it’s related to its original TV series efforts, a deal with Amazon to return to the Apple TV, or a content deal in the music or video spheres. Rumor has it that the Amazon deal is a go; it just gives me pause to consider that the relationship between the two companies has been repaired to the point where Apple promotes it on stage at a keynote. Finally, there are lots of rumblings out there that a Siri Speaker might be in the offing at last. I’m lukewarm on this rumor—it could happen, but Apple could also hold off until fall, when the product is rumored to be ready to ship. But given the heat around voice assistants in general, it seems highly likely that Siri will be a star of the show. Apple can extend the SiriKit extensions it added last year that give developers direct integration with Siri, improve Siri on the Mac, and disclose new Siri features it’s been working on. If there’s a hardware tease on top of that, all the better. Tough calls It would seem like an easy call to predict that many of the features Apple introduced in the past year—dual-camera support, the Touch Bar, Messages stickers and apps—will be improved. Sometimes Apple keeps moving new technology forward—and other times it walks away for a while. A good example is iPad multitasking, which was launched with iOS 9 and was unchanged in iOS 10, and might get some work in iOS 11, or might not. Predicting that last year’s introductions will be this year’s improvements is a risky game. Adam Patrick Murray Will there be time in the keynote to introduce a new standalone keyboard with a TouchBar? I’ve seen predictions of new Apple input devices, most notably a Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar or Touch ID support. It sounds like a good idea to me, but there’s already so much hardware rumored for WWDC that it’s hard to see this as being a product Apple would devote keynote time to. The longshots Then there are the longshots. Every year something outlandish, something we would never have predicted, ends up coming true. But most of these predictions end up dead and forgotten—or filed away for predictions at a future Apple event. Without going into detail, here are my longshots for WWDC 2017. I don’t think they’re going to happen, but they could! Apple skips a cycle for one or more of its platforms, rather than incrementing its version number and declaring it a new feature. No new watchOS update, perhaps, or tvOS. This would seem to be inconsistent with Apple’s behavior, but Apple’s been doing a lot of zagging where it used to zig. macOS drops the California placenames and joins iOS in lockstep at version 11. I have a hard time seeing Apple do this, but does anyone really need to use macOS 10.13 Joshua Tree? “iOS 11 and macOS 11” sounds a lot better. This year’s the year, though. Forlorn Apple hardware gets some love. Would the Mac mini get an update? Would the Apple TV get upgraded to 4K? Would the Mac Pro, which is coming back next year, get a mention? It’s all possible, but not likely. Hints of VR or AR functionality. This stuff seems a long way off, but could Apple wrap some augmented-reality-like feature into the iPhone Camera app and show it off knowing that it’s really dipping its toe into AR? Or what about a VR strategy based around the iPhone, somehow? Unlikely, but never say never. Major new Mac features. Most macOS updates these days are about keeping the Mac platform in sync with Apple’s others.

NBA June 2, 2017 2:30pm EDT June 2, 2017 2:30pm EDT Basketball, Golden State Warriors, English, NBA Rihanna fans are upset at an Apple executive because he appeared to tell the singer to sit down. Rihanna (Getty Images) Jordan Heck Omnisport @jordanheckff Published on Jun. 2, 2017 Jun. 2, 2017 Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue is a big-time Warriors fan and had courtside seats located near Rihanna during Game 1 of the NBA Finals. At one point in the game, however, it appeared Cue told the popular singer to sit down when she gave a bow to LeBron James.  Naturally, after video spread of Cue appearing to tell her to sit down, her fans sent angry tweets at him. Some have speculated he uttered the phrase, "Tell that b— to sit down" which is why there's been such a strong response to the incident. Not everyone recognized the tech guru, but several did, and some apparently plan to boycott Apple products as a result. Oh cancelling my Apple Music subscription @cue - no one yells at Rihanna, especially not a grown white man telling her to "sit down" — Eileen Carey (@eileenmcarey) June 2, 2017 After feeling the wrath of Rihanna's fans, Cue responded to a critic about the incident. He claims he wasn't upset at Rihanna and that whatever message he was trying to relay was actually intended for someone he knows. Apple also reportedly said he "was talking to someone he knew between him and [Rihanna]. He wasn't telling her to sit down." Nothing but love for Rihanna (and KD, too!) As usual I was excited about our lead and actually talking to Marissa, 8 seats to my right. — Eddy Cue (@cue) June 2, 2017 Case solved? Not exactly. Rihanna's fans aren't buying the excuse, and are demanding an apology.  Nah you disrespected a beautiful woman and thought nobody would see it!

(@clapbackanna) June 2, 2017 If @cue doesn't apologize for his recent misogynist outburst towards @Rihanna I'm cancelling my subscription @AppleMusic — STAUNCH (@KammBe) June 2, 2017 A different angle of the incident doesn't look like he's speaking to anyone else directly. He mentioned the intended recipient was eight seats to his right, but the person eight seats to his right appears to be a gentleman in a blue shirt. Now there is a woman in a yelllow shirt sitting close to Rihanna who is also standing, so it's possible Cue just miscounted the number of seats. There's likely no way of knowing for sure what the intention here was. Cue is obviously going to defend himself by saying he wasn't directing his language toward her, and Rihanna is probably too busy doing Rihanna things to let this affect her day.  NBA Draft mistakes: Every team's ugliest, most painful regret NBA coaching rumors: Which college coaches could be ready to turn pro?

The move has led to messages from a number of tech CEOs, who have expressed their disappointment at the move. “We are getting out,” Trump said. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine." Unlike Nicaragua, which believes the accord doesn’t do enough to protect the environment, and Syria, whose government struggles to take part because of sanctions, Trump's reason for withdrawing from the agreement is to “protect America and its citizens.” He says it's "very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States," and would impose "draconian financial and economic burdens." As reported yesterday, the decision has led to Elon Musk leaving the presidential councils. Not long after Trump finished his speech, the Tesla boss tweeted: “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” He was joined by Disney CEO Robert Iger, who also resigned from the council “as a matter of principle.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, however, will remain on Trump’s business advisory council. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Other leaders from the tech world also took to Twitter opposing the move. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday to try and convince him to remain, wrote: “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Cook also sent an internal note to his employees. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” it read. “Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” 25 firms including Microsoft, Intel, Apple, and Google, took out a last-minute full-page ad in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal yesterday, promoting the benefits of the agreement. Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and many more used social media to attack the President’s decision. Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o — jack (@jack) June 1, 2017 The last time CEOs rallied against Trump like this was after he introduced the immigration ban. With people now leaving his councils, and virtually every company condemning the withdrawal, the relationship between the President and the tech industry has hit a low point. It will, however, take years to fully exit the pact; November 4, 2020 – the day after the next presidential election – to be exact Related Reads Elon Musk says he will leave advisory councils if Trump withdraws from Paris agreement Donald Trump meets with the tech elite, offers a helping hand Donald Trump is holding a meeting with tech industry leaders next week 42 comments 259 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Elon Musk says he'll leave advisory councils if Trump withdraws from Paris agreement Supreme Court makes it harder for patent trolls to hand-pick battlegrounds Bitcoin valuation tops $2,000 for the first time ever Popular TechSpot Best of Computex 2017 Five Years Without Facebook 16 comments Ryzen 7 series get first price cut as we wait for Threadripper 32 comments Intel Core X vs. AMD Ryzen Threadripper: What we know so far 42 comments Tech leaders denounce Trump's decision to leave Paris agreement Load Comments 42 ...

Tops of skyscrapers are barely peeking out of the murky water, streets have been transformed into flowing rivers and what was once home to 8.4 million people, is depicted as a ghost town in the shocking footage.

'We are concerned with global warming, and the rising waters is only one representation among others of global warming,' Max told DailyMail.com in an email.

WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT? The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.  The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by.  Counties, instead, put forward their best efforts through 'nationally determined contributions.'   The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.  The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. The nearly four minute video begins with an image of New York City that may be unsettling – the water has risen so high that many of its monstrous skyscrapers are barely peaking up from a watery grave. Fifth Avenue, Wall Street and Time Square, all of which used to be filled with hundreds of people on any given day, are shown completely empty and submerged in water. And Grand Central Station, which attracts people from all over the world, looks more like a large watering hole instead of a busy train station. Tops of skyscrapers are barely peeking out of the murky water, streets have been transformed into flowing rivers and what was once home to 8.4 million people, is depicted as a ghost town Now, a video has surfaced online that has revealed the catastrophic effects of climate change on the massive city, which could become a reality over the next 60 to 80 years. Fifth Avenue (pictured), Wall Street and Time Square, all of which used to be filled with hundreds of people on any given day, are shown completely empty and submerged in water. The video continues to show different areas of New York, all of which tell the same story, but what may be one of the most unsettling aspects is that a city that has 8.4 million residents and 50 million people visiting each year is completely empty. 'Climate change is a new marker in our history. Man can now affect the climate, we are now in the anthropocene era,' said Max. 'Fortunately we have become aware of it and we must put all possible means to ensure that future generations enjoy a better environment. 'Antoine de St Exupery said :' We do not inherit the land of our parents, we borrow it from our children.' The video entitled, ' Two ° C ' was created by to film makers 'Claire&Max' Countour, who wanted to highlight what New York City would 'look like if there was a rise in water Wall Street (pictured), located in lower Manhattan, is also predicted to be underwater.  'We considered this video as an alert so that people become even more aware of the danger,' the creators of the video shared. 'The Paris Agreement limited to 2 degrees : these 2 degrees were already dangerous, but the recent US withdrawal is unconscious.' It may be unsettling to see the once populated Time Square (pictured) completely empty and flooded  'The video was done with 2 steps : first, we deleted the people of the streets (like our precedent work in Pairs 'Hypocentre') and then we add the water,' he continued. 'The water is a 3D modelization. We choose NYC because like Paris, NYC is our 'laboratory' for our experimental films.' 'We are fortunate to be able to come regularly to NYC and we love deeply NYC.  The title of the clip, 'Two ° C', was inspired by a recent study from a team of American researchers that noted 2 ◦C global warming is dangerous and could have catastrophic effects on our world over the next couple of decades. Grand Central Station (pictured), which attracts people from all over the world, looks more like a large watering hole instead of a busy train station The video was done with 2 steps : first, the deleted the people of the streets using Photoshop and then water was added using 3D simulation software  'The IPCC , an intergovernmental panel of experts on climate change, predicted an average increase of 1 meter by 2100: their model underestimated the melting of the ice,' Claire and Max shared in a blog post. 'For James Hansen [one of the American researchers], these 2 ° would still remain dangerous because it integrates in its recent models the melting of the ice: it estimates an increase of 5 to 9m by 2080.' The video was shared online two days prior to Donald Trump making the announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris agreement – citing it was bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Time-lapse shows Jupiter in beautiful detail during Juno fly-over Watch video Scientists develop amazing new battery that recharges INSTANTLY Watch video Man assaults wife and lover after catching them in the act Watch video CCTV footage of men leading away woman before raping her Watch video This cat wants out!

India is hinging its participation on billions of dollars of foreign aid. 'The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,' he said. He argued later, 'The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.' The video was shared online two days prior to Donald Trump making the announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris agreement – citing it was bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. But the video has painted a different picture and it seems to be a disaster  'This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,' he contended. Trump said he would end the United States' participation in the United Nations' Green Climate Fund for the same reason. Although the US president listed multiple reasons to why the nation should and is leaving the agreement, many Americans are not on board with the decision and are worried what the future holds for not just their country, but for the entire world. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Time-lapse shows Jupiter in beautiful detail during Juno fly-over Watch video Scientists develop amazing new battery that recharges INSTANTLY Watch video CCTV footage of men leading away woman before raping her Watch video Man assaults wife and lover after catching them in the act Watch video This cat wants out!

(Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Apple’s (AAPL) massive Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, June 5 at 1 p.m. E.T., and we’re expecting a host of new announcements. These announcements will give us a view into what the company has been working on over the past year, as well as what we can expect with its upcoming iPhone 8. Apple is known for using WWDC to showcase its newest software updates. That means we’ll likely see the latest versions of the company’s iOS for the iPhone and iPad, as well as macOS for Mac desktops and laptops. Apple should also announce improvements to its watchOS and tvOS systems, and could even roll out its very own Siri speaker to compete with the likes of Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo and Google’s (GOOGL, GOOG) Home. iOS 11 Apple regularly debuts the latest version of its iOS operating system at WWDC, and this year’s event should be no different. Interestingly, while hardware leaks are the norm for Apple’s devices now, we hardly see as many software leaks hit the web. That means we don’t know very much about iOS 11 quite yet. So far, the big rumors point to major updates to Apple’s Siri voice assistant, which first landed on the iPhone in 2011. While Siri has seen a slew of updates since then, it still can’t quite match the power of Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant apps. Apple’s iOS 11 will bring updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and some hints as to what we might see in the iPhone 8. With iOS 11, Apple could change that by bringing Siri more in line with what modern voice assistants have to offer such as expanded voice capabilities and improved language understanding. According to The Verifier, Apple could also add group calling to its FaceTime app, which would bring it in line with Google’s Hangouts and Microsoft’s Skype offerings. Whatever updates we see for iOS 11, it’s important to keep on eye on even the smallest changes, as they could provide a hint of what the iPhone 8 has to offer. Siri speaker Outside of iOS 11, Apple’s biggest potential announcement at WWDC is the Siri speaker. There haven’t been any leaked images of the speaker, which would compete directly with Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home and Microsoft’s (MSFT) upcoming Cortana-enabled offerings. MacRumors says that Apple device will likely include facial-recognition technology and run off of the company’s iOS operating system.Bloomberg reports that Apple has already begun manufacturing the speaker, which means it could go on sale in the relatively near future. It will be interesting to see if Apple is capable of producing a product as powerful as Amazon’s Echo, especially since the Echo allows you to purchase items directly through Amazon using only your voice. macOS The software behind Apple’s Mac laptops and desktops, macOS is also expected to see some improvements at WWD. Little is known about the next major update to macOS, though if Apple sticks to recent patterns, it will likely throw in more iOS compatibility features to ensure iPhone users and Mac users stay within Apple’s product ecosystem. watchOS and tvOS As with Apple’s macOS, it’s still not clear what updates are coming to watchOS and tvOS.As CNET notes, Apple could begin offering a glucose monitor for the Apple Watch that would help diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels.CNBC reported in March that Apple CEO Tim Cook was seen walking around the company’s campus with a device connected to his watch that monitored his glucose. MacBook updates and a new iPad These rumors are a bit of a stretch, as Apple doesn’t usually announce much hardware at WWDC: But the mill keeps pointing to the potential for updated MacBooks and a new iPad debuting at the big show. According to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out three new MacBooks including a new version of the super-slim MacBook with a more powerful Intel processor, an upgraded MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with a new CPU. Read More Apple’s insanely thin and light MacBook is rumored to be getting an update at WWDC. It sounds like these MacBooks will only get improved internals, so don’t expect them to sport any new designs. The new iPad, meanwhile, is said to sport a 10.5-inch display and offer stylus support.9to5Mac says the iPad will manage to pack its large screen into a body that’s not much larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad. We’ll be on the ground in San Jose, California, and in our New York offices covering the day’s events as they happen. And don’t forget to follow all of the news as it happens via our live blog.

Video from Thursday night's game in Oakland shows Rihanna, a Cleveland Cavaliers fan, standing up to bow to star player Lebron James after a major play. A man wearing a Warriors shirt a few seats down is then seen in the background looking angry as he appears to motion towards the pop princess to take a seat.  That man was later identified as Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, who is in charge of the company's Internet Software and Services division. That division includes the tech company's streaming service, Apple Music, which offers Rihanna's music. Scroll down for video  The man who allegedly yelled at Rihanna to sit down after she stood up to bow to Lebron James during last night's NBA Finals has been identified as an Apple senior vice president  A clip from the game shows Apple SVP Eddy Cue (right) appearing to motion to the pop princess to sit down  Cue runs a division that includes Apple Music, the company's streaming service which features music from Rihanna  Rihanna didn't appear to hear the Apple VP when she went back to talking with friends on the sidelines  In a tweet, Cue said that he had 'nothing but love for Rihanna' and wasn't talking to her in the clip  Rihanna fans were quick to express their outrage on Twitter, threatening to boycott Apple Music if Cue didn't apologize or if the company didn't fire him.  'I won't re-up my subscription until Rihanna gets a FULL & sincere apology from your sexist employee,' one fan wrote. Some of the Twitter users even claimed to hear Cue say 'Tell that b**** to sit down,' though DailyMail.com has not been able to confirm those reports. Cue has worked at Apple since 1989 and reports to CEO Tim Cook RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Rude boy! Warriors star Kevin Durant appears to stare down...

Share this article Share 1.1k shares Cue responded to the criticisms with a tweet of his own, saying he has 'nothing but love for Rihanna' and wasn't talking to her in the first place.  'As usual I was excited about our lead and actually talking to Marissa, 8 seats to my right,' he said.  It's unclear who the Marissa that Cue mentioned is.  Cue has worked at Apple since 1989 and reports to CEO Tim Cook. According to his online bio, Cue was 'instrumental' in creating the iTunes and App stores.  Fans of Rihanna were quick to threaten a boycott of Apple Music if she didn't get a proper apology or if Cue wasn't fired The Cavs lost to the Warriors in a blow-out during Game 1, but Rihanna was nonetheless a proud cheerleader for her Cavs.  At one point, she was even heard yelling 'Briiiiiick!' as Kevin Durant tried to shoot a three-pointer.   As he passed her after successfully scoring the basket, Durant seemed to glare at the 29-year-old singer.  Lady in black: Rihanna cheered on the Cleveland Cavaliers and her favorite player LeBron James on Thursday during Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Oakland, California Cheering section: The singer and her personal assistant were rooting for the Cavaliers during the match Kevin Durant literally shot his shot for Rihanna pic.twitter.com/EX1PUaGXJM— justin lew block (@JBlock49) June 2, 2017 But Durant, 28, refused to be drawn on it after the game. He was asked during a post-game press conference with teammate Steph Curry if he stared the singer down on purpose. 'I don't even remember that,' Durant answered. The reporter then told Durant the exchange was blowing up on social media. 'Don't get in that trap,' Curry advised. Stare down: Golden State Warriors player Kevin Durant seemingly stared down Rihanna after drilling a three-point shot late in the game Not impressed: The singer looked on as Warriors star Durant ran past her courtside seat 'Yeah, I won't get into that. I'm cool. Have fun with that,' Durant said. Rihanna and her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales took their courtside seats with under three minutes left in the first quarter. The Diamonds singer arrived as the game was tied 24-24 after her favorite player LeBron James, 32, unleashed a furious dunk over Warriors player JaVale McGee.  ABC announcers were commenting on the dunk, but color commentator Jeff Van Gundy, 55, admitted he was distracted.  No memory: Durant insisted that he did not remember staring down Rihanna Super fan: Rihanna stood up and cheered for the Cavs while surround by fans of the home team Warriors Personal assistant: Rihanna's personal assistant Jennifer Rosales joined her for the game In the bag: The Stay singer peered into her purse during the game Easily distracted: The Diamonds singer arrived as the game was tied 24-24 and ABC commentator Jeff Van Gundy admitted his mind was away from the action 'I don't know about that but Rihanna just walked in front of me! Are you kidding me?!,' Jeff Van Gundy said. Fellow analyst Mark Jackson then told Van Gundy to keep his focus on the game. 'Come on, tell the truth, when she walked by she was stunning,' Van Gundy replied. The Bajan beauty wore an all-black ensemble that included a jacket with plunging neckline. She made her loyalty clear as she contrasted with most of the home team's fans who wore yellow T-shirts. Favorite player: James is shown bring the ball up the court while defended by Durant The Warriors cruised home to victory, beating the Cavs 113-91 but Rihanna remained steadfast in her support.  Durant finished with 38 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Teammate Curry scored 28 points with six 3-pointers and 10 assists.  She was heckled by Warriors fans after the game while walking past the Cavaliers locker room. 'It doesn't matter, b****. The King is still the King,' she said.

Yeah, they don't. They're fakes.  That's the word from one of the sources of the leaked photos, self-proclaimed gadgets leaker Benjamin Geskin. After originally posting the the pictures early Friday Eastern Time, Geskin, about an hour later, dubbed them "fake."  Chinese #iPhone8 "Clone". Not going to happen. Not real Apple design. This phone does not exist. Don't worry. https://t.co/COJtfdFUL8 — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 Instead, Geskin believes this is what Apple's upcoming "special" iPhone will look like. Note that unlike the one in the fake photos, this supposedly real design doesn't have Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. Clone is wrong! This is how its going to look like. #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/U7sY9hqm5S — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 There have been lots of rumors and supposed pictures circulating of the upcoming device, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The fake photos Geskin posted — which were also shared by Spanish language tech site iPhoneros — were intriguing because they seemed to affirm some of the reports about the iPhone 8 while challenging others. iphone 8 leak iphonerosMore (Not the real iPhone 8.iPhoneros) Like the phone in the debunked photos, other supposed pictures of the upcoming device indicate it will have a vertically-oriented dual-lens camera. But most reports indicate the iPhone 8 will have thinner borders around its screen than the phone shown in the fake photos.  Geskin's debunking of one leak and affirmations of another, goes to show how leaks and rumors never truly reveal the final details of any product before its announced. Even if someone obtained a photo of an iPhone 8 from a verifiable Apple employee, it ought to be treated skeptically until Apple actually unveils the real thing.  Keep a handy grain of salt with you at all times, people, and be ready to throw it at rumors.   NOW WATCH: Here's everything Apple is rumored to be launching in 2017 More From Business Insider These secret codes let you access hidden iPhone features Apple is stepping up its war to steal Android customers Here's everything Apple is rumored to be launching in 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)    ‘It Wasn’t Enough’: Apple CEO Sends Mournful Message To Staff About Paris Deal Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 2:00 PM 06/02/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple CEO Tim Cook sent a mournful email to staff Thursday expressing his deep displeasure in President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal. The tech leader said he did all he could to try to stop Trump from making the move. “I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement,” Cook wrote, according to Axios. “I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough.” (RELATED: Apple CEO Sends Consoling Letter To All Employees After Trump Win) The White House said that the Paris Agreement was poorly negotiated by the previous administration and that it will cost American jobs at the expense of negligible, if any, ecological benefit. Other advocates against the international accord told The Daily Caller News Foundation that there were many other disadvantages of the deal, including it undermining Trump’s deregulatory efforts. Cook, and several other tech executives like Tesla’s Elon Musk, disagree with Trump’s choice mainly for environmental reasons (rather than diplomatic ones), saying the accord is critical to help foster the creation of clean energy. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it,” Cook said in the email. “I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment.” Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Opinion ProBeat: Google’s Chrome ad blocker initiative makes Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla look incompetent Emil Protalinski@EPro June 2, 2017 10:30 AM Google yesterday confirmed that Chrome is getting a built-in ad blocker that will block all the ads on a site (including Google’s own ads) if just one ad doesn’t meet certain standards. That’s right: Google, the company that makes the majority of its money from advertising, is building an ad blocker. This alone is crazy. Google already has the world’s most popular browser and it’s plowing ahead building arguably the only feature that would really differentiate other browsers. I find it astounding that none of the other major browser makers managed to beat Google to the punch. There is still time for Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla to act. Google’s solution isn’t coming to Chrome until “early 2018,” a timeframe that could easily slip. Delivering an ad blocker directly in Safari, Edge, or Firefox this year could help these browsers in their fight with Chrome. And yet, I don’t expect any of these companies to do anything but eventually follow in Google’s footsteps. Apple moves way too slowly with Safari updates. Some have even gone as far to call Safari the new IE. Still, Apple loves playing up the security and privacy features of its macOS and iOS devices, slamming Google at every opportunity. It makes plenty of sense for Safari to have some sort of built-in ad blocker that not only protects users but also hurts Google’s bottom line. I also don’t really expect Microsoft will do anything in time, despite the rumor of a native ad blocker in Edge back in March 2016. The company has certainly sped up its browser development compared to the IE days, but Edge is still only updated twice a year along with Windows 10. And the features in this year’s second release, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, have already been announced. Firefox Tracking Protection That leaves Mozilla, the only company I can feasibly see not only getting something ready in time, but making sure it’s superior to what Chrome will have. Firefox could indeed steal Chrome’s thunder with a native ad blocker. Like Google, Mozilla updates its browser every six weeks or so. The firm also likes to regularly point out it develops the only independent browser — meaning it’s not tied to a tech company that has priorities which often don’t align with the web. Furthermore, Firefox has already offered a feature called Tracking Protection since November 2015. Just like how Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads (if a site doesn’t have any low-quality ads, they all get shown), Firefox’s Tracking Protection also lets certain ads through. With Tracking Protection turned on, Firefox blocks website elements (ads, analytics trackers, and social share buttons) that could track you while you’re surfing the web, meaning it’s similar to add-ons like Ghostery and Privacy Badger. The problem is that Mozilla only offers Tracking Protection in Firefox’s Private Browsing mode (akin to Chrome’s Incognito or Edge’s InPrivate). If Mozilla really wanted to one-up Google, it would bring Tracking Protection to the forefront of Firefox. In fact, Mozilla ran an experiment that enabled Tracking Protection outside of Private Browsing mode. While the company identified websites that didn’t function properly with the feature on, and identified domains which have been incorrectly classified as trackers, it ended the experiment and didn’t pull the trigger on bringing it to Firefox users. “Making Tracking Protection available in Firefox outside of Private Browsing is certainly under consideration,” a Mozilla spokesperson told me a few months ago. “However, there are some websites which do not function properly when trackers are blocked.” In other words, Mozilla is being a coward. Its reluctance and inaction have given Google the perfect opening to let Chrome further pound Firefox into the ground. The feature wouldn’t even have to be enabled by default; Firefox could simply inform users about Tracking Protection and let them easily turn it on or off. The last step would be proper marketing: Firefox takes your privacy so seriously that it blocks ads and trackers more thoroughly than the ad blocker only coming to Chrome next year. Unless Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla act quickly, you can bet Chrome’s stranglehold on the browser market will tighten. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week.

But for the people who make the apps, AR isn’t quite as simple, particularly when the apps they’re building involve 3D or “volumetric” objects — stuff you can walk around and interact with through the screen of the phone. Which is why Apple should start making that process a whole lot easier — especially if it is planning to release AR glasses in the future, ones that will need some sort of “killer app” or group of apps to justify their existence. Other companies, like Facebook, have now taken steps to let developers build AR experiences into their in-app cameras. You might not normally think of Facebook and Apple as direct competitors, but by doing this, Facebook has essentially set the stage for what is going to become an AR platform war on the phone. And Google already has its own AR platform, Tango. Amid the iOS, macOS, and potential Siri speaker reveals at WWDC next week, Apple needs to give due attention to AR. Augmented reality refers to any kind of computer-generated image that appears on top of a view of the real world. For the sake of this argument, however, let’s focus on smartphones. There are 2D AR apps: ones that do a pretty basic job of slapping a flat, non-dynamic digital image over the stuff you’re seeing through your camera lens. Developers say this is the easiest kind of AR mobile app to build. True 3D AR apps on mobile require sophisticated engineering right now Then there are 3D AR apps, which usually require more advanced software development and image processing. Think: Snapchat’s filters like the digital flower crown hovering over your head as you move around in real time, or the virtual furniture you can examine and walk around in home-renovation app Houzz. These may seem like lightweight (or lighthearted) applications, but Snapchat’s lenses require a serious amount of engineering, and the Houzz 3D AR feature took months to build. Another home-renovation platform that offers 3D imaging, Modsy, does most of its image processing after you’ve taken smartphone photos, which can take anywhere from five minutes to several hours. Afterward, it sends the rendered 3D images back to you. There’s another way to experience “true 3D” AR apps on a smartphone, and it’s a combo hardware-and-software solution. Google’s augmented reality computing platform, Tango, runs on smartphones that have a specific set of camera, infrared, and depth sensors. But right now there’s exactly one Tango phone model on the market. And some of the Tango apps are slow and low resolution. Since we’re not expecting any sort of hardware update to the iPhone lineup for the next four months at least — no new cameras or depth sensors that would enable 3D AR — that means any Apple advancements around AR in the near term will come from the software side. Some have speculated that Apple could announce “ARkit,” a kind of framework that would integrate parts of the existing camera with new software in a way that would allow developers to gather more information from the camera. Given that Apple chief executive Tim Cook has spoken so enthusiastically about AR in recent months, saying it’s a “big idea, like the smartphone,” this kind of framework makes a lot of sense. Currently, Apple doesn’t offer a specific API for virtual reality or augmented reality. There’s something called SceneKit, a kind of 3D-rendering engine for games, but no API for real-time object tracking. One developer, who spoke on background because of a pending AR app launch, told me that the one thing he has been hoping for is the ability to “hook into” the iPhone’s camera sensors and directly access the hardware in a way that developers currently can’t. Plus, if Apple really does plan to introduce AR glasses at some point in the future (something that has been rumored, but not confirmed), it will need a healthy ecosystem of app developers who know how to make or have already embraced augmented reality apps. Releasing a suite of developer tools for AR on the phone will presumably make it easier to move those apps over to future AR hardware products Apple could make. If Apple does eventually launch AR glasses, it’s going to need killer apps to prove that they’re useful, not awkward The last major pair of AR glasses to hit the market was the ill-fated Google Glass. Google Glass was awkward, made people uncomfortable in public, and even spawned the term “Glassholes.” But all of that may have been forgiven had the actual experience of having contextual information put right in front of your eyes been awesome. In other words: AR glasses are going to need apps so good and so useful that they justify whatever social awkwardness wearing a computer on your face creates. Will Apple be able to get major app developers to build AR apps for glasses, if and when it gets into glasses? Of course. But there’s also the very real possibility that the breakout app or surprise app for AR glasses would come from a less-established developer, one who wouldn’t have the resources to invest in true 3D AR if it’s as technically complicated as it is now. Apple has had a long-standing tradition of waiting to jump into a market because of the premise that it will do it — whatever it may be — better. But the company shouldn’t wait any longer to show the world that it’s serious about AR as a platform.

The images, which could be a prototype of Apple, were leaked by a source in China, the site said. iPhoneros said the source has previously sent over images that were proved accurate on multiple occasions, adding the individual has never sent them false information. The iPhone 8 is expected to  be unveiled in September, as usual, but may face release date delays due to the nature of these new designs.  Read: iPhone 8 Price, Rumors: Goldman Sachs Predicts New iPhone Will Cost $1K, Have 3D Sensing, No Home Button Meanwhile, leaker Benjamin Geskin also shared the images and said they were fake.   There have been previous rumors and leaked images that show a Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8. Last week, images posted on Chinese social platform Weibo showed the button on the rear of the device, also underneath the Apple logo. A schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked in April by Sonny Dickson shows a circular hole underneath the Apple logo, which suggests the device could come with a Touch ID placement on the back of the device, like it’s placed on Samsung’s recently released Galaxy S8. Other reports claim the iPhone 8 will come with an edge-to-edge screen display with an embedded Touch ID on the front of the device. Apple was granted a patent for an edge-to-edge display and another patent for a Touch ID embedded in the display screen, it was discovered last month. Also in May, leaked images of alleged iPhone 8 molds suggested the device will not come with a Touch ID on the back. However, it seems like Apple is struggling with the feature. An analyst from Cowen and Co. previously said in April the embedded Touch ID was the feature Apple was having the most trouble. The analyst, Timothy Arcuri, gave three possible solutions Apple could take to address the problem: ditch the Touch ID and rely on face recognition technology, move the Touch ID to the back of the phone, or delay production of the iPhone 8 but still announce it this fall alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The leaked iPhone 8 images also show a vertically-aligned dual-camera system on the back of the phone, which has been previously rumored before. The new look would differ from the current horizontal placement on the iPhone 7 Plus. Read: Apple Making iPhone 8 Bigger Than iPhone 7? Dimensions Leaked In New Renders Apple’s 10th-anniversary phone, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is also rumored to come with a 3D-sensing front camera and wireless charging. The phone is expected to feature an OLED display. Apple was said to have placed orders for OLED panels from Samsung for the iPhone 8. Previous reports have said iPhone 8 price will set you back more than $1,000. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Alongside a new version of iOS and other assorted goodies, the company is expected to wow attendees with the latest iteration of its desktop operating system, macOS 10.13. But what can we expect from the new software? We've run down the potential new features, as well as the release date and possible names. See related  iOS 11 release date, features and rumours WWDC 2017 dates, news and rumours: What to look out for at WWDC macOS Sierra UK release date, price, features: Night Shift mode returns with macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 8 Features Rumours about what features Apple will include with the next version of macOS have been somewhat thin on the ground, but we can make some educated guesses as to what it's likely to feature. Following on from last year's conference, deeper integrations between the company's mobile and desktop operating systems are a fairly safe bet, helping the company to bolster its ecosystem and inject some more life into its services and subscriptions business. Another strong contender for inclusion in macOS 10.13 is the Apple File System (APFS). Introduced at WWDC 2016, the system is designed to improve space efficiency, encryption, and backups, and is optimised specifically for flash and SSD storage. The technology has been rolled out on iOS, but has yet to reach Apple's desktops, so it's a strong possibility that this could be the year it makes the jump. Design tweaks and changes are also a possibility, but given that macOS and iOS seem to be in sync from a design perspective, we're not anticipating any drastic visual changes. Name Ever since 2013, Apple has named its macOS releases after locations and landmarks in its home state of California. We've already had Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite and Mavericks, but the next in the series is yet to be confirmed. Luckily, Apple has given us a couple of clues, in the form of a list of names that the company trademarked in 2014. Among the list are well-known Californian cities, animals, mountain ranges and deserts, including Ventura, Skyline, Pacific and Condor. Rumours are currently suggesting that the name of the next version macOS will start with an 'm', and that it won't be named after a mountain range or national park. With that in mind, our guess is that Apple is going to go with 'Mojave' - another entry in the list of trademarked names. Other options include Monterey, Mammoth and Miramar. Release date Apple's usual pattern is to unveil the next version of its desktop OS at its annual developer conference, and we're not expecting this to change for the latest release. macOS 10.13 will likely be shown off as part of the opening keynote on 5 June. Following the initial reveal, a developer preview will be made available shortly thereafter, with a public beta following a few months after that. The software won't hit general availability until this Autumn, however - most likely in September.

Here we round up all the latest news and rumours about watchOS 4, and break down its key features. Apple watchOS 4 At-a-glance Expected to feature at this year's WWDC in June Anticipated to be in beta for the next several months Likely to have fleshed out activity and health trackers and a host of new apps Jump to: Apple watchOS 4: release date and pricing Apple watchOS 4: features See related  iPhone 8 release date, features, and specs: Apple's legal feud is great for Intel, bad for the iPhone 8 WWDC 2017 dates, news and rumours: What to look out for at WWDC Apple watchOS 4: release date and pricing We will almost certainly see Apple's latest software iteration at this year's WWDC on 5 June. It's likely Apple will follow the same format as the launch of watchOS 3 last year, which saw the release of a beta test phase immediately following the presentation. The OS should be generally available to the public around September 2017.  As with other OS releases, watchOS 4 will be a free update to all users. Apple watchOS 4: features New apps The new OS generation should mean a richer set of supported apps, but there are a few in particular that users are craving for the Apple Watch. The Notes app, for example, would be a welcome addition, at least as a means to view existing lists, as it lends itself perfectly to a device that you carry with you at all times. Activity tracking Apple is likely to bring a swathe of new functionalities for fitness and activity tracking, including adding new sports such as skiing and snowboarding to the Activities app. Health will also be a priority; particularly following recent sightings of Tim Cook sporting a prototype Apple Watch with a blood sugar tracker, and similar reports suggesting the company was looking to sell a glucose sensor to help those with diabetes. Users will also be hoping for improvements to tracking statistics, making it easier to share a wider set of stats among friends and on social media. Some quality of life changes to fix buggy app syncing wouldn't go a miss either. Sleep tracking Native sleep tracking software has so far been missing on the Apple Watch range, despite its popularity among rival devices. Reports have claimed that Apple is working on its own sleep tracking software suite, which seems to be corroborated by its recent acquisition of sleep tracking firm Beddit in May. The main issues is that in order to track sleep the watch would need to have enough charge to last the night, which is normally when users plug it in to recharge. New watch faces and always-on displays The new software could bring some new, more elaborate watch faces, as well as the ability to set the watch face to always display the time. These have been highly requested features for a while, but limitations with battery life have likely meant these fancier functions have been pushed back. The new Apple Watch 3, likely to appear later this year, may be able to bring enough hardware improvements to afford an always-on display.

The singer’s fan base took to Twitter Friday to destroy Eddy Cue, the senior vice president of Internet Software and Services at Apple, after he reportedly told her to “sit down” at Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Oakland, California, on Thursday as the Golden Gate Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 113-91 victory. “@cue don't you ever fix your nonexistent lips to disrespect Rihanna ever again in your life,” netizen @clapbackanna wrote. @cue don't you ever fix your non existent lips to disrespect Rihanna ever again in your life. pic.twitter.com/jLCnYjXaMy — karlie jenner.

I want a public apology not just for Rihanna but for my children as well @cue,” the internet user said. Shara Tibken, a senior reporter for CNET and CBSI who covers Apple and Samsung, said Apple denied Cue told Rihanna to sit down. “.@Apple says @Cue was talking to someone he knew between him and @rihanna. He wasn't telling her to sit down,” she tweeted Friday. You're OVER. @cue pic.twitter.com/ptOaiyKIEt — Chantell (@ChantellHayden) June 2, 2017 The controversy around Cue broke out after Tibken identified “this man” as Cue to the internet. “LOL.

When naysayers heckled her about James, she said, “It doesn't matter b----, the King was still the King.” Being told to “sit down” wasn’t the only time Rihanna was criticized. She was accused of putting on weight after blogger Chris “Spags” Spagnuolo wrote a Wednesday article for the website Barstool Sports titled, “Is Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?” In the story, he talked about her “high key thickness.” Ok, @cue telling @rihanna to sit down after she bows to @KingJames is the best! pic.twitter.com/9JQz48kLSh — Konrad Siemek (@ksiemek) June 2, 2017 The story was deleted, with the website’s founder Dave Portnoy issuing a semi-apology. “We have an extremely minor controversy going on with this fat shaming blog that Spags wrote. Lots of feminists not happy about it,” he said. “I don’t think the blog was as bad as many are making it out to be, but I’ll tell you this.

The images come from Chinese site iPhoneros and are the clearest look yet at a design that has seemingly been at least prototyped by Apple… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover One iPhone 8 aspect that continues to lack consensus is where Apple will place the Touch ID sensor. Some reports have claimed that Touch ID will be located beneath the iPhone 8’s display, while others have said it will be placed on the back due to manufacturing difficulties. Today’s images show the Touch ID sensor placed on the back of the device, directly below the Apple logo. The placement matches earlier leaked CAD drawings, showing the vertical camera design, camera flash placement, and more. Some have claimed in the past that such a design on the back could actually be for wireless charging connections, though these images seem to make it pretty clear that it is indeed for Touch ID. Building on the images shared by iPhoneros, Twitter leaker Benjamin Geskin has shared a separate image showing the front of the device, including a nearly bezel-less design. While some concepts and leaks have depicted the screen wrapping around the speaker and front camera, this leak shows there still being a small top bezel housing those cutouts. As for the legitimacy of these leaks, iPhoneros claims that the pictures come from a Chinese source that has provided correct images in the past and “never sent us false information.” Meanwhile, Geskin casts doubt as to the legitimacy of the leak. Either way, it seems likely that this is at least one design Apple has tested, though it’s unclear if it’s the design that will ship to the public later this fall. iPhone 8 leaks have been coming rapidly recently, with the main discrepancy between each one being the placement of Touch ID. In a poll we ran last month, readers were split between whether or not they would buy the iPhone 8 if it didn’t feature in-display Touch ID. 44% said they will buy the device either way, while 43% said they would wait for a later model.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | June 2, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Apple (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) All eyes will be on Apple as the week-long WWDC 2017 kicks off with the keynote speech. And while Apple fans will be salivating over iOS and macOS updates, along with whatever shiny new hardware is unveiled, it's Siri that will make or break the event. See also : Surface Pro (2017) vs. Surface Pro 4: Tech specs and key differences This year's WWDC will be an interesting time for Apple. For well over a decade the keynote has been a time when Apple could boast to the world -- and more importantly, other tech companies -- about how far ahead of the game it was, and how they had little hope of catching up. But this time is different. Apple is under pressure from multiple fronts. iPhone sales are teetering on the brink of a downturn, while iPad sales have crashed through the floor. And the company is lagging behind Microsoft when it comes to notebook innovation, trailing behind Amazon when it comes to getting hardware into the living room, and dawdling far behind Google and Facebook when it comes to AR and AI. iPhone 8: Everything we think we know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV No matter what sort of face Tim Cook and the gang put on when they're on-stage Monday, Apple is on the back foot, and it knows it. But there's one Apple product that could change all that -- Siri. It's easy to look at Apple and think of it as a hardware company. After all, when most people think "Apple," they think about the iPhone, Macs, iPads, and such. But the hardware is only part of the equation. In fact, building hardware isn't hard -- just look at how crowded the Android market is with devices ranging from treasures to total trash. Anyone with money can go to an ODM -- Original Design Manufacturer -- and get something drawn up and made. What really sets Apple hardware apart is the massive software ecosystem at the back end. Everything from iCloud to the App Store and the wider ecosystem, it's all about the software. And part of that software ecosystem is Siri. More apple iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for Here's why you must back up your iPhone and iPad before upgrading to iOS 10.3 Apple to iPhone owners: We're working fast to block CIA's iOS hacks Is Apple's 'next big thing' the iPhone Pro? 10 things Steve Jobs would hate about Apple today Apple's been playing it slow and carefully with Siri. Apple acquired the technology back in April 2010 and baked it into iOS 5 in 2011, and since then the technology has spread across Apple's platforms to include macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. But with Amazon and Google carrying out a full-on assault on the living room with speakers and smart devices, it's time for Apple to push back. Because if it doesn't, these players will slowly start to chip away at and erode Apple's currently dominant ecosystem. After all, not only is someone who's purchased a smart device from Google or Amazon less likely to buy a similar Apple device, but they're also going to be looking at what else Google and Amazon have to offer, further weakening the ecosystem. Now some might say that Apple already owns the living room, kitchen, and bedroom, because it owns the smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch market, and people take these devices with them as they move about the house. But this is a weak argument. With the exception of Apple TV, Apple's hardware is aimed at a single user, and that makes it unsuited to home use. If your home automation setup is based around Apple, then you better make sure that everyone has iPhones and iPads, because it's not like you can pick up someone else's device to start controlling things. And this is where devices such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home really come into play. They're devices that are aimed at the family, not the individual, and that means they're far more convenient to use in a communal setting. I've noticed it myself. While I used to have to turn to my iPhone to control the lights or some other bit of IoT kit, it's far quicker and easier to bark a command at a nearby Echo or Dot than it is to whip out my iPhone and activate Siri. And remember to factor in how cheap Echo Dots are compared to Apple products. At $49 they're less than the price of two 2-meter Lightning cables from Apple. But Siri is the tool that will let Apple keep up with Google and Amazon, because it allows the company to create an interface-free device that people can interact with semi-naturally (I say semi-naturally because none of the voice assistants are currently up to the task of dealing with natural language, and some form of linguistic gymnastics are always required, despite what you might see in the on-stage demos). So, with all that said, here are my WWDC 2017 Siri-related predictions: A much-needed boost to Siri's AI (essentially new sets of questions and commands it can respond to) Siri will be able to recognize users based on their voice (this would be a killer feature for a communal device) A new Siri-powered device, likely a speaker, think Apple TV, but for music (given Apple's association with music, and the fact that it owns Beats) Text-based chatbot-style Siri (think along the lines of a smart search box) Make Siri able to work across devices (so, for example, Siri on the iPhone would be able to understand a command such as "open Numbers on my MacBook.")

This year the event runs from June 5-9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost-but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors , Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 percent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Sponsored Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker." Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's ( currently underdeveloped ) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. Advertisement It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out , the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it founds a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop . The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg . Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a " completely rethought " Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year" meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac , could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph . This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-9 for more info about the latest updates, and we'll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

The App Store, home to the most innovative apps in the world, has seen downloads grow over 70% in the past 12 months alone. From breakout hits like Pokémon GO and Super Mario Run to other standout launches such as CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly, customers discover and experience new apps and games every day on the App Store. “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” With the recently introduced iOS 10, app users are able to connect and collaborate in exciting new ways, such as on a fashion sketch with Prêt à Template. Since the release of iOS 10 last fall, iPhone and iPad users have also experienced new engaging and creative ways to connect, such as giving a friend a Starbucks gift card using Apple Pay, collaborating on a fashion design sketch using Prêt à Template or making someone smile with an endless assortment of stickers. The subscription business model is now available across every app category — Tastemade is a mobile-first cooking network that has its own app. With the subscription business model now available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store’s active paid subscriptions are up 58% year over year. Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including longtime favorites such as Netflix and Hulu as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight. App Store developers from around the world create apps for customers in 155 countries that improve lives, rethink industries and shape culture. Gaming and Entertainment are top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps as well as Health and Fitness have experienced over 70% growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90% growth.

By 2009, 40 percent of the company’s 386,000 employees no longer needed to turn up to an office each day. Forward to 2017, and IBM is traveling back in time. Thousands of employees are being told they have to start working from set locations, or wave goodbye to their jobs. The irony is hard to ignore. Just this year, an IBM panel discussion mirrored the findings of a 2014 whitepaper from IBM’s own Smarter Workplace Institute: “The remote workers in this research were highly engaged, more likely to consider their workplaces as innovative, happier about their job prospects and less stressed than their more traditional, office-bound colleagues.” Other research agrees, showing remote workers to log more hours and do better work. Image Credit: Steven Zwerink via Flickr Some say that 19 consecutive quarters of falling sales have left IMB looking to trim the workforce without resorting to layoffs. Whatever the reason, in cases like these, the best talent will find other jobs — jobs that take employees’ work-life balance seriously. Just look at how a similar move by Yahoo  in 2013 ended with the company selling to Verizon for less than 5 percent of its peak price. Remote Work Is the Future According to recent findings by Gallup, 43 percent of the American workforce already spends some of its time working remotely. The report states, “Flexible scheduling and work-from-home opportunities play a major role in an employee’s decision to take or leave a job.” With that in mind, many of IMB’s employees are looking for other opportunities. And so are employees of other companies who are being forced fo endure outdated ways of working. Cubicles suck, after all. Thankfully, there’s a huge (and growing) number of respectable employers happy to take on remote workers Working Remotely Is The Future!

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Electrical fire leads to discovery of large indoor marijuana grow in Apple Valley Friday Jun 2, 2017 at 9:06 AM Jun 2, 2017 at 9:21 AM Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A small fire behind a residence believed to have been caused by a power line malfunctioning led authorities to uncover a large marijuana grow inside a home Thursday. San Bernardino County Sheriff's Apple Valley Station deputies responded to a home in the 11000 block of Saratoga Road at 9:20 a.m. to assist firefighters who had received reports of a fire at the residence, authorities said. The firefighters discovered the fire was likely caused by a main power line malfunctioning and melting, eventually falling into some shrubbery in the backyard and sparking a fire. Due to the circumstances, fire officials determined there was a significant concern that the remaining electrical lines inside the home may also fail and ignite a blaze in the home. According to authorities, upon entering the home to ensure no one was inside and that there was no damage to any property, the firefighters discovered an indoor marijuana grow with several hundred plants. Sheriff's Marijuana Enforcement Team personnel served a search warrant at the home and found a large-scale grow inside the house — with more than 750 plants in various growth stages — and the use of advanced lighting, fans, exhaust blowers and an air-filtering system to control both the climate and the odor, authorities said. Further investigation found the suspects responsible for the marijuana grow were stealing electricity to facilitate the operation by bypassing the electrical meter. Loss Prevention investigators with Southern California Edison responded to assist in the electrical theft investigation. The fire is believed to have been caused by the overload of electricity passing through the power lines, according to authorities. Investigators are in the process of identifying the suspects involved and once identified, the investigation will be completed and sent to the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Officer for a criminal complaint against them. Anyone with information regarding this investigation is urged to contact the Sheriff's Gangs/Narcotics Division at 909-387-8400.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze | Main | AI-Industry Insiders: Apple's new Siri Device will take a Different Path to Market than Amazon's Alexa » June 02, 2017 In an Effort to hurt iPhone 8 Sales in Korea, Samsung Plans to Flood the Local market with Refurbished Note 7s   In February Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung Backtracks and is Reportedly Planning to Sell Refurbished Note 7 Smartphones in Q3." Samsung's President of Mobile Communications, D.J. Koh, announced during a special presentation surrounding the findings of the Note 7 fires by independent sources, that 4.7 million Note 7 smartphones were produced and that 96% of them had been returned to them. Samsung further noted that they would sell refurbished Note 7s at a later date.   At the time the rumors were that Samsung would use the refurbished Note 7's to excite sales in emerging markets with cheap Note 7s. But Samsung really had a much more detailed plan than that.   With the iPhone 8 capturing the imagination of global consumers as they delay the purchase of a smartphone this year until they see what innovation Apple could be bringing to market, Samsung has decided that they would sell the refurbished Note 7's just prior to the release of the iPhone 8 in order to hurt sales of the iPhone 8.   It's a strategy designed to say that the Korean market didn't think much of the iPhone 8. It's devious considering the volume of business Apple throws their way and are seeking to win Apple back for their processor business. But they can't help themselves. Their hatred for Apple runs so deep as Apple fans know. Samsung continues to this day to fight Apple's patent infringement victory going back to 2012.   Today a Korea Herald report confirms that "Samsung is gearing up for the upcoming launch of Apple's new iPhone, tentatively called iPhone 8, in September." Samsung will launch a refurbished version of the Note 7, dubbed Galaxy Note FE, or Fandom Edition, at about US$625.30 in South Korea. They already have 15,000 preorders for the devices.   The report further noted that Samsung would add color options of gold and rose for the Galaxy S8 line-up in August and believe that this move could also sway more consumers their way instead of the iPhone 8. This is kindergarten thinking that this would have any effect over the advanced iPhone 8. But their grasping at straws at this point. It's nice to know that the level of fear they have concerning Apple is still alive and well. .

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Events WWDC 2017: Everything Apple is expected to announce on Monday Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 2nd, 2017 at 11:38 AM Share Tweet Andy Williams actually got it wrong. The most wonderful time of the year isn’t Christmas; it’s the two weeks around the end of May when Apple holds its annual developer conference. In one speech, we normally get a mix of new hardware and software updates, and Apple lays out the direction it’s going to take for the next 12 months. This year, we’re expecting a big one when WWDC 2017 starts on Monday at 1:00PM Eastern. In this post, we’ll roundup all of the most notable WWDC 2017 rumors so you know what to expect during Apple’s big WWDC keynote next week. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again New MacBooks Right now, the safest best for new hardware at WWDC 2017 is an update to the MacBook lineup. It might be a little odd, considering Apple just launched an all-new MacBook Pro back in November, but all the leaks, rumors and retail supply chain leaks have pointed towards some kind of new model. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we’re probably not going to see a new MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a few more ports. Instead, the smart money is on the current MacBook range getting a spec bump on the inside, most likely with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. Improvements have also been made to the graphics cards for portable machines, so you could also expect the MacBook Pro to get a graphics bump. Siri Speaker We’re also expecting to see a new Siri-powered home speaker to pop up looking a lot like the Amazon Echo. Smart speakers have emerged as the obvious portal for controlling the smart home, so Apple can’t let Amazon and Google run away with the prize. It’s challenging to innovate on the concept of “kitchen speaker with an AI and a microphone built in,” so Apple has two options here: launch a keep-up-with-the-Joneses product that demonstrates its commitment to the product and lays the groundwork for something revolutionary to come; or try the classic Apple move, and make a much more expensive version to capture the high end of the market. It’s unclear what a “high-end” home speaker would look like, but a focus on audio quality using Beats branding isn’t out of the question. New iMacs Just like the new MacBooks, it’s possible that we’ll see a spec bump for the iMac. Intel’s new processors sure would look good inside, and it would lessen some of the cries we’ve been hearing that Apple doesn’t produce ‘“pro” computers any more. New iPads Finally, there’s rumors going around that we’ll see a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It likely won’t be a “new” form-factor, as there’s already a 9.7-inch iPad Pro on the market (and it recently went on sale!) Instead, look for much thinner bezels enabling a bigger screen in the existing body. Software iOS 11 Apple uses WWDC to show off the newest version of iOS every year like clockwork, and there’s zero reason to imagine that this year will be different. Bloomberg rumors suggest that iOS 11 will see a design overhaul, not as severe as the iOS 7 update that scrapped skeuomorphic design, but still significant. One of the biggest new features could be the introduction of a “dark” mode across the entire OS, something that jailbreakers have been doing for years. It’s a quick and easy way to save a little battery life and appease some of the more hardcore fans. We’re also expecting updates to apps, including a possible peer-to-peer payment function in Apple Pay, and more videos in Apple Music to tie in with Apple’s first original series launching soon. One thing we haven’t heard much about are updates to Siri. Google’s recent developer conference focused heavily on the Google Assistant, and how it’s finding its way across the entire platform. If Apple is expecting the Siri Speaker to do anything well, Siri’s going to need some major updates, and fast. One of the big interface differences between the Assistant and Siri is the ability to have written conversations and type queries; it’s quite possible that Apple builds that functionality right into iOS 11. macOS Of course, we’re expecting to see a new version of macOS, but it’s unlikely to be anything big. We said above that Siri needs to be a focus of WWDC overall this year, so that’s one obvious thing for Apple to focus on for the Macs. Siri found its way to the desktop at WWDC last year, so some new features could be in order. “Hey Siri” functionality could be expanded, and third-party features don’t currently work for Siri on MacOS. What we won’t see Some bad news: we almost definitely won’t see a new iPhone. Although the iPhone SE is technically due an update, the timing would be terrible. Apple is expected to announce three new phones of some kind this fall; the last thing it needs is a new cheap iPhone undercutting the “super-cycle” of people upgrading to the iPhone 8. A new Mac Pro is also probably off the table. Although the timing for a preview announcement makes sense, Apple execs previously hinted that a new Mac Pro would come by the end of the year. That also gives Apple time to integrate Intel’s newly-announced Core i9 chips, which are an obvious thing for Apple to stick inside its premiere video-editing machine.

While both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have a history of revising their flagship smartphone series, that practice is likely directly connected to Apple’s mobile release schedule, with the Cupertino, California-based tech giant traditionally launching new iPhone models in September. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone and Apple is reportedly looking to go all out with its latest iOS flagship, which is what reportedly prompted both Samsung and LG to refresh their latest product lineups in an effort to not lose customers to the most profitable handset manufacturer on the planet. Samsung is said to be adding at least one new color variant of the Galaxy S8 that’s called Rose Gold, sources with knowledge of the matter said today. While the same model was already leaked yesterday, the latest report indicates that the Seoul-based consumer electronics manufacturer will be retailing Rose Gold variations of both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, with previous leaks hinting that only the latter will be available in a new color. Apart from a new variant of its latest flagship, Samsung may also try to slow down the sales of the iPhone 8 by releasing a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 that will ship with a smaller, 3,200mAh battery and otherwise be identical to the discontinued flagship. While the Galaxy Note FE (Fandom Edition) — that’s expected to be marketed as the Galaxy Note 7R in China — will only be available in limited quantities in select Asian countries, Samsung may be hoping that the device will still be able to affect the sales of Apple’s upcoming handset. According to recent reports, LG is preparing to launch two new models of the G6 – the G6 Plus and G6 Pro. The former is expected to be a somewhat more premium variant of the original device while the later should be a slightly downgraded version, though both will primarily differ in terms of internal flash memory and wireless charging support, industry insiders previously said. Later this year, Samsung and LG are expected to take on Apple more directly by releasing the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30, with both devices being predicted to hit the market around September.

The iOS 10.3.3 update is currently in beta and it looks like it will be another small release aimed at fixing bugs and improving security on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It should also bring some new wallpapers to the iPad. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.3 release date but the company recently released a new beta update, a sign that it’s making progress behind the scenes. With the iOS 10.3.3 release date possibly on the way in June, we want to help make your transition from iOS 10.3.2 to iOS 10.3.3 as smooth as possible. When to Check for the iOS 10.3.3 Release The iOS 10.3.3 update is shaping up to be a small release with under-the-hood improvements and security patches. It’s not as exciting as iOS 10.3 but iOS 10.3.3 could be an important update for your device, particularly if you’re struggling with iOS 10 problems. While you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the iOS 10.3.3 update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3.3 release date (though we do expect it to arrive soon) but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3.3 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3.3 release date. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3.3 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. This release time applies to iOS 10.3.3 beta releases as well. Betas typically come every 1-2 weeks, usually on Monday. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3.3 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait a few hours, a few days, or longer. Don’t Install the iOS 10.3.3 Beta Unless You Really Want To Given what’s on board (bugs and little else), you should only try the iOS 10.3.3 beta if you really want to help Apple squash problems, if you’re a developer, or if you really, really want to test the update’s performance on your device ahead of the official release. Furthermore, you can download the iOS 10.3.3 update’s iPad Pro wallpapers right now if you want. You don’t need to be on the beta to get access to them. Most of you should avoid the early version of iOS 10.3.3, especially if you’re having an outstanding experience on your version of iOS. Apple could add some more meat to the iOS 10.3.3 update in the future but that would be surprising. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.3 beta, take a look at our guide. Start Prepping Your iPhone, iPad or iPod Now It’s never too early to start preparing for an iOS update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the iOS 10.3.3 release date: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. If you want to download iOS 10.3.3 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3.3 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit coming with your version of iOS 10.3.3. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3.3 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Dig Into Older Updates If You Need To If you failed to download iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 and you plan to skip Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update, make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3.3 update on your phone. If you skipped iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 and don’t have plans to download iOS 10.3.2, you’ll get the changes from those updates baked into your iOS 10.3.3 update. (Note: You’ll also get the features and fixes from any other iOS updates you missed.) If you plan on downloading iOS 10.3.3, you’ll want to get familiar with their changes ahead of the update’s release. Prepare For & Report iOS 10.3.3 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3.3 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. Sometimes it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3.3, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3.3 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can “Test” iOS 10.3.3 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3.3 beta, you can take the official version of iOS 10.3.3 for a test drive, provided you’re already on iOS 10.3.2 when it arrives. For a short time, Apple will allow you to downgrade from iOS 10.3.3 to iOS 10.3.2. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 so you won’t be able to drop back to either of those. Most of you will probably choose to remain on iOS 10.3.3 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. It could help improve your device’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity, and speed. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time to get familiar with it. How to Get Off iOS 10.3.3 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3.3 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta, you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3.3 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how you’ll do that: Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3.3. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3.3 beta and the new watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3.3 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use iOS beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. Avoid iOS 10.3.3 If You’re Jailbroken Do not, we repeat, do not upgrade to the iOS 10.3.3 update on release day if you’re jailbroken. Jailbreak developers have reportedly cracked the iOS 10.3.1 update. A proof of concept video has surfaced and we could see an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak released to the public in the near future. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen a proof of concept for iOS 10.3.2 or iOS 10.3.3. Developers could certainly surprise us with an iOS 10.3.3 jailbreak release on release day but you’ll want to avoid iOS 10.3.3 when it arrives just to be safe. If you do happen to download iOS 10.3.3 on your device and developers do release a working iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak, you should be able to downgrade in order to take advantage of the tool. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.2 & 10 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 14 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.2 brings (by our count) 23 security patches for a potential exploits. That's a ton for a small maintenance update and a great reason to install iOS 10.3.2 in the near future. Your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring even more security features if you failed to download previous versions of iOS. If you skipped iOS 10.3.1, your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring its security patch. If you skipped iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.2 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device.    1 / 14 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 7 Things to Know About the iPhone 5s iOS 10.3.2 Update We’ve been taking a close look at Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update and today we want … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 Update The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update is a small but important release for the former flagship. … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPad iOS 10.3.2 Update Its been a little over two weeks since the iOS 10.3.2 update release for the iPad, iPad Ai… 06/02/2017 6 min read Load More In Apple 2 Comments 2 Comments James Burton 03/25/2017 at 10:36 pm Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support Reply Chile 04/18/2017 at 9:51 am DellLundg Slovakien NicholRan SherrillH Elfenbenskusten CaroleSch JacquieDe Schweiz ValorieHi BonnyMgrx Osterrike WindyChid OrvalGoul Nederlanderna MarthaSpa GabrieleC Everton SKKRalfgc GlendaXvr Spanien DakotaCam BrainBole Rumanien GeorginaE NoellaEll Valencia EstelleNe TerranceR Wales StaceyThe Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Courtesy photo Brenda Tullis Special to Valley News Students and teachers gathered at a local church Sunday, May 7, at an event directed by students to recognize and show appreciation for local teachers and to gift a sole teacher from each Temecula high school a student-honored teacher’s award. English teacher Gayle Trout of Chaparral High School, math teacher Steve Maxey of Great Oak High School and biology teacher Toby Brannon of Temecula Valley High School were awarded the Crystal Apple in appreciation for their work and influence in their students’ lives. The 13th annual Crystal Apple Awards ceremony was led by students from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from Temecula Valley, Chaparral and Great Oak high schools and honored more than 130 exemplary teachers. Over 200 students individually nominated a teacher to receive a Crystal Apple award, and ultimately one teacher from each high school was awarded with the esteemed Crystal Apple. City and school officials attending included Temecula City Council member James Stewart, Temecula Valley Unified School District Superintendent Tim Ritter, TVUSD school board President Sandy Hinkson, school board member Julie Farnbach, Temecula Valley Educators Association President Jeff Kingsberg, CHS Principal Nicole Dayus, GOHS Principal Aimee Ricken and TVHS Principal Allen Williams. Explaining why the Crystal Apple nomination process of awarding recipients was important, Master of Ceremony and Public Affairs director for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Suzette Jacobsen quoted Carnegie Mellon University Professor Randy Pausch in her opening remarks. “Showing gratitude is one of the simplest yet most powerful things humans can do for each other,” she said. The other finalists for the Crystal Apple awards included CHS swim coach and history teacher Craig Winger and English teacher Barbara Mueller, GOHS economics teacher and football coach, Herschel Ramirez and Spanish teacher Crystal Parry as well as TVHS orchestra teacher Leanne Lugo and retiring ROTC leader, Lt. Col. Phil Byrd. Trout received her undergraduate at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1991 and later graduated from University of California Riverside. She has taught school for 25 years. Trout is teaches English to seniors at Chaparral in the Chaparral Senior Expository Reading and Writing course and Mt. San Jacinto College dual enrollment English 101 and 103 courses. “Mrs. Trout is one of the most caring people I know,” CHS senior Lauren Paulson, who nominated Trout for the award, said. “She truly has a special gift in connecting with each of her students.” Trout estimates that she has taught approximately 4,000 students over the past 25 years. Mother of three children, she is married to Rancho Vista High School teacher Noel Trout. “This is the best and most meaningful award I have ever received because it is student driven,” she said. “The students are the ones with whom I interact every day, and to have them say to me, `Mrs. Trout, we recognize that you care about us and our education; you’re a good role model, and we appreciate you.’ That’s gold. They are affirming that I am the kind of teacher I set out to become.” Trout said that she was born to teach. “It’s my gift, talent and passion,” she said. “When I was in ninth grade, I had an English teacher who was not only a great teacher, but he was also someone who genuinely loved teenagers. He treated them with such dignity and respect, and I wanted to be that same kind of person and teacher.” She thanked the parents at the event for raising amazing children. “They do live true to your values,” she said. “They’re kind and generous; they’re respectful and responsible; they’re trustworthy.” Trout said that she thoroughly loved to stand and teach children, speaking wisdom into their lives every single school day. “I know that the LDS community sets a high standard for themselves and their children,” she said. “Being recognized as a person of integrity and good character by a community that upholds those same characteristics means a lot to me.” Junior Alexis Arnold introduced Great Oak math teacher Steve Maxey. “Mr. Maxey has been such a great influence on me and the people around me,” she said. “He always manages to have a positive attitude. His class is one of those classes that you’re actually not looking at the clock to see when it’s going to end.” Maxey graduated from Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa, in 1999, later receiving his master’s degree at California State University San Marcos in 2012. He has been teaching for 15 years. He is married to Kelly Maxey who teaches Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math courses at Vail Ranch Middle School. He said she has been teaching 25 years to his 15 years, but that he took off five great years to raise his three children, Jack, Claire and Pete, who are now 12 years, 12 years and 10 years old, respectively. Beginning his teaching career in 1999, Maxey is in his fifth-year teaching in the Temecula Valley school district, and he estimates that he’s taught approximately 2,500 children since becoming a teacher. “I teach because I love it,” he said. “Every day I get to teach the subject I love— to children who care.” Maxey admits that he was taken aback and humbled when he learned that he would be the recipient of the Crystal Apple award. “The thing that affected me the most was that my students felt that highly of me,” he said. “They’re phenomenal students.” Later he spoke to the students directly and said, “You have made this job great.” Maxey thanked the administration at Great Oak for hiring him. “It’s so nice to belong to a school where you know the administration believes in you,” he said. “There are so many fantastic teachers at my school, and I owe so much to all of them for giving me the guidance and support to be where I am today.” Student and nominator C. Robert Graff introduced biology teacher Toby Brannon from Temecula Valley High School. “This guy knows biology,” he said. “He’s a true stallion of biology. He can run on and on about biology and go so deep that my mind would just blow up.” Graff also said that Brannon’s class is a fun class. “He’s such a funny and awesome guy,” Graff said. “He connects with students either directly or indirectly. I feel he is one of the teachers on campus that I and others can go to for sound advice and counsel.” Graduating from University of California Irvine in 1995, Brannon began teaching in 1997 and has been teaching for 20 years now. He said he would not even venture to guess how many students he’s taught over the years. He finally decided upon a rounded-up number. “A lot,” he said. At the ceremony, he said that it was a tremendous honor to be there. “We [teachers] don’t get into this gig for public applause or pats on the back but this is nice,” he said. Speaking directly to the students in the back of the auditorium, he said, “When we get the envelopes with your comments, those are the things that sustain us. We need just a little bit of fuel to get through the next year and those little tiny comments make a huge difference.” Brannon encouraged the children at the event to pursue the things that they found interesting in life, to go for it. “When you get to a point that you have to figure out what to do with it, teaching’s not a bad gig. Consider it,” he said. “You get to teach the topic you truly love and you get to make a very real impact on your community.” Temecula Valley Principal Allen Williams summed up the general feeling of thankfulness from all the teachers and administrators in the room. “We recognize our teachers at Temecula Valley High School in different ways,” TVHS principal Allen Williams said. “But it’s really nice when an outside organization looks at our school and looks at our teachers across the district and says, ‘We value you. We affirm what you’re doing. We have confidence in you.’” Williams said that he wanted to thank The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for doing exactly that for teachers in the Temecula community. “Thank you,” he said. “It’s so appreciated. It makes us feel like champions.” Share this: Tweet More Share on Tumblr Print Email Related Crystal Apple awards, Gayle Trout, Steve Maxey, teachers, Toby Brannon Crystal Apple awards bestowed on three well-deserving teachers  added by Newsroom on June 2, 2017 View all posts by Newsroom → Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

In an internal memo obtained by Buzzfeed News, Cook told employees that he “spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough.” Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Following the email sent out within Apple, Cook later also publicly tweeted on the matter, stating pointedly that he considers the decision “wrong for our planet” and reiterating Apple’s unwavering commitment to fighting climate change. In the internal e-mail, Cook reassured employees that President Trump’s decision will have “no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” emphasizing the company’s significant efforts in powering all of its operations with renewable energy, which as Cook says is not only good for the planet, but “makes good business sense as well.” Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. Cook also promised to keep working toward the “ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain,” that were outlined in the company’s Environmental Responsibility Report released last month.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide What to Expect From Apple WWDC 2017: iOS, Siri Speaker, MacBooks, and More Michael NunezFriday 11:00am Filed to: Apple WWDC WWDC 2017 MacBook MacBook Air iOS 11 macOS Siri 32 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Apple On Monday, Apple’s annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off, and that means we will soon learn more about the company’s newest and most exciting products. This year, the event runs from June 5-June 9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We’ll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There’s plenty to be excited about this year, so let’s dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we’re expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there’s a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year’s conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There’s no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost—but there’s a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn’t the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is “over [a] 50 percent chance” that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple “started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker.” Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple’s (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple’s walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo’s research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we’ll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement Sponsored In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft’s striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren’t expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a “completely rethought” Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros “will not ship this year,” meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don’t get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren’t coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple’s new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don’t know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we’re expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you’ll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There’s also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the “X” from its desktop operating system’s name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we’re expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren’t any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we’ll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-June 9 for more info about the latest updates, and we’ll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

By Daniel Walker Published in Food & Drink June 2, 2017 10:00 am The doughnut game in Dallas is undeniably strong. When last we compiled our picks for best in town, there were only a few players really pushing the proverbial envelope. But today, there are a host of exciting vendors popping up in every corner of the city. Here are 15 of the best doughnuts from the most notable shops around town. Consider this your ultimate doughnut to-do list. Glazed Donut Works Saigon Cinnamon Sugar The brains behind the sweet creations at Deep Ellum’s beloved shop never cease churning out inventive new flavors. Seasonal offerings and holiday specials are the norm here, so you’ll want to keep an eye on their various social media platforms for updates. But one flavor that’s almost always on the menu board is their sumptuous Saigon Cinnamon Sugar. It may look a bit ho-hum at first glance, but don’t be fooled by its humble appearance. There’s a subtle spice intertwined with a crunchy sweetness from granulated sugar, all coating one of the finest brioche-style yeast raised donuts in town. Top Pot Doughnuts Salted Caramel Old Fashioned Blessed was the day when the celebrated Seattle-based Top Pot decided to open its very first location outside of Washington in our very own Big D. The fried-pastry-gods truly smiled down on us that day. Now with four locations across the city, it’s fairly easy to experience Top Pot’s “hand-forged” approach for yourself. Where they excel most is undoubtedly in “old fashioned” doughnuts, of which, you’re going to want to sample the salted caramel variety. These suckers have a slightly crunchier exterior, with a soft, cake-y middle. The sweet and salty combination from the salted caramel puts this particular doughnut over the top. In the best way imaginable. Momo’s Donuts Strawberries and Cream At this Sherman bakery, owner Mo Guerrero has established a loyal following of fried-dough fanatics that are, surprisingly, also big names in the bodybuilding and Crossfit community. The virtues of “donuts and deadlifts” are something Mo proudly embraces. “Our bodybuilding and Crossfit community loves us because carbs are not only great before leg day,” he says. “But we’re a treat that competitors look for after enduring strict diets in preparation for a bodybuilding show.” Momo’s popularity even landed them a spot on Cooking Channel’s Donut Showdown. And although they’re located in about an hour-and-a-half outside of Dallas, this popular donut spot will graciously deliver to Dallas every weekend for any who preorder (just message them on Facebook or Instagram @momosdonuts). Just be sure to order the Strawberries and Cream, stuffed full of plump, glazed strawberries and fresh cream.   Jerry’s Jerry’s Donuts Apple Fritter This humble Farmer’s Branch shop remains relatively unknown to most doughnut fans outside its immediate surroundings. It’s the epitome of old-school doughnut making: no outrageous toppings, no particularly fancy ingredients. Most of its employees have been hammering out the same recipes for more than 40 years—and they’ve darn near perfected their craft. The apple fritters are some their most elusive creations. It’s difficult to time exactly when they’ll be laying out a fresh tray…and when they do, they get snatched up quickly. Instead of the typical chopped, diced, and reformed dough bits that make up the apple fritter, Jerry’s serves one that’s more akin to a turnover, with the hot apple filling folded into the center of the dough, cooking in layers throughout the dough. It’s a bit unconventional, but it’s absolutely lovely to bite into. Jarams Donuts Cream Cheese & Berries For five-and-a-half years, Jarams has been supplying North Dallas sugar junkies with a very sound reason to roll out of bed on a weekend morning. They were among the first in the city to capitalize on the “Cronut” craze sweeping the nation at that time, and quickly built a reputation for serving donut varieties that couldn’t be found anywhere else in town. But one donut still shines above the rest, though it may not necessarily be the wackiest item they offer. This one comes topped with a smooth, not-too-sweet cream cheese frosting on a soft, yeast doughnut, and is finished with a crown of fresh assorted berries and a whiff of powdered sugar. It’s still deep-fried dough, but you can almost convince yourself you’re eating a fruit salad for breakfast. Almost. Okay, not really. Mojo Donuts Cookie Butter This small shop is conveniently located a mere stone’s throw from Love Field. So if you’re about to jump on a plane and are in need of a quick breakfast, look no further than Mojo. With a healthy assortment of doughnuts both traditional and elaborate, there’s plenty to keep any pastry fan coming back on a regular basis. Just be sure to snag one of their decadent cookie butter donuts when they’re on the shelf. This soft yeast-raised treat comes dipped in creamy cookie butter frosting, sprinkled with cookie crumbles, and finished with another thick gob of cookie butter in the center. It’s rich and a little messy, but it’s wonderful. FunkyTown Donuts Key Lime Pie Forget not Fort Worth when looking for exceptional doughnuts. FunkyTown has dominated this city’s scene since opening just over a year ago. Folks go nuts for their impressive array of doughnuts, so much so that they sell out nearly every day. The Key Lime Pie variety is a must. A yeast doughnut is topped with a citrusy lime glaze and stuffed with freshly-made whipped cream and graham cracker dust. It’s a Key Lime creation so good it will mentally transport you to an exotic white-sand Florida beach on a sunny afternoon. And once there, you won’t even mind that you’re destroying your beach body. Hypnotic Donuts The Peace’statio When founder, James St. Peter, established Hypnotic in 2010, there was no one else on the donut scene putting as much thought into doughnuts as him. Hypnotic built a dedicated underground following via Facebook and Twitter, selling donuts from the back of a Ford Expedition for months until demand reached a level that forced them to move into a permanent space. Today, Hypnotic’s place among Dallas’ fried-dough-royalty remains firmly intact. They’ve pioneered the “fancy” market with a collection of intriguing options, but one that remains at the top of the crop is the Peace’statio, a lovely cake variety topped with brown butter glaze and chopped pistachios. It’s the perfect way to wash down one of their sizable chicken biscuits. Earnest Donuts Blueberry Crumble This Lewisville shop is quietly putting out some of the greatest donuts in Dallas. If you’re looking for the finest “Cronut,” Earnest is your place. But the best reason to visit the shop is for their exceptional blueberry crumble cake doughnut. It’s packed with real blueberry, within a cake doughnut that’s not the slightest bit dry. They coat the whole thing with cake crumbles for a slightly crunchy textural element that really brings the whole thing home. Well played, Earnest. Dough Boy Donuts Cinnamon Roll At this Fort Worth food truck, things operate a bit differently than your standard doughnut shop. It’s just two guys in a tiny space, one taking orders and the other continuously throwing dough into hot oil. But because of their limited space, they’re churning out sweets practically to-order, ensuring that every doughnut served is fresh from the fryer—hot, soft, and golden brown. Go with the Cinnamon Roll variety. It’s less flashy than some of their other offerings—a simple sugar glazed with streaks of cinnamon-sugar drizzle—but it’s beautiful. Hurts Hurts Donut Strawberry Jelly How much does Frisco love this small Midwest doughnut chain’s first Texas location? Just take a peek at the lines. They frequently push out the door and around the building, with customers reporting waits of up to an hour during peak business. But they’re able to crank out quality donuts fairly quickly, and do a good job keeping their massive display cases filled. Generally, their yeast-raised donuts—which are larger and plumper than you’ll generally find at your average shop—outshine the cake variety. Most of their doughnuts are big, bold, and almost cartoonish, but you’ll find that the frosted jelly-filled one is everything you need it to be without all the excess. The Donut Kitchen Italian Wedding This McKinney staple sticks solely to cake donuts. But even if you generally prefer yeast-raised doughnuts, the cake variety served up here are not to be missed. They nail it on texture—never dry, light, and slightly crumbly. Truth be told, they’re probably the best cake doughnuts in town. Grab the Italian Wedding:  rolled in sugar and topped with a swirl of cream cheese icing and pecans. Donut Box Waffle Doughnut The food world has become obsessed with novelty mash-ups, but only a select few to hit the market survive and are actually worth tracking down. The doughnut-waffle was not dreamed up here at this small Little Elm shop, but they were the first to bring the concept to town. And luckily, they’re good. Darn good. It’s got all the right textural elements of a successful waffle—crunchy exterior and soft, chewy inside—but the thin layer of glaze takes it to a new level of decadence. You can get them coated in candy if you like, but it’s really not necessary to achieve peak enjoyment. Max’s Donut Shop Glazed Allen residents have long known that the finest glazed doughnuts in town were hiding in this tiny, no-frills shop. It’s a classic joint serving a simple menu of only a few standards: plain glazed, chocolate iced, apple fritters, and cinnamon rolls. But if you’re occasionally exhausted by all the glamorized, fancy doughnuts across town, and you’re most interested in a classic glazed ring of fried dough, the best is right here at Max’s. That’s right…the best plain glazed in town. And that’s a promise you can take to the bank. Rise Biscuits & Donuts Pineapple Basil with Pistachios Here’s another small donut franchise that’s already making waves within the northern suburbs. Although they are technically a chain, these are a far cry from the likes of sub-par, chain establishments. Rise simply makes a spectacular product. They do a dangerously good creme brûlée donut with a thick, crunchy shell of torched sugar, filled with a custard that sings of real vanilla. But their most interesting, and surprisingly successful variety, is the Pineapple Basil doughnut with pistachios. Holidays Most Popular The Legend of Chris Kyle By Michael J.

You could design a better phone than Samsung, Apple, Huawei, or Sir Jony Ive himself, but if not enough people hear about it, you don't stand a snowflake in Hell's chance. This, in Total Telecom's considered opinion, is the biggest single challenge facing Android co-creator Andy Rubin and his new company Essential, which, as well as having a new smartphone to show off this week, also has a professed aversion to logos – which doesn't help much when it comes to brand awareness. Essential does have a logo… You could design a better phone than Samsung, Apple, Huawei, or Sir Jony Ive himself, but if not enough people hear about it, you don't stand a snowflake in Hell's chance. This, in Total Telecom's considered opinion, is the biggest single challenge facing Android co-creator Andy Rubin and his new company Essential, which, as well as having a new smartphone to show off this week, also has a professed aversion to logos – which doesn't help much when it comes to brand awareness. Essential does have a logo, of course, but it's not happy about it. The press kit section of the Website informs the weary journalist that "we're not big on logos at Essential, but if you need one, please use the following…" Essential says it's not about logos, it's about phones, and to be fair, Essential's new phone is a good-looking piece of kit, with a sturdy titanium body encasing an edge-to-edge 4K screen. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor; 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage; a 13 megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel front-facing camera; and a fingerprint sensor. It runs Android. It also supports accessories, which attach via magnets and communicate wirelessly with the phone. The first accessory is a 360-degree camera, because framing a shot is hard, and people are nostalgic for those 90s skateboard videos filmed though a fisheye lens. Probably. Essential also unveiled its own take on Amazon Echo or Google Home. Called Home, it is designed to be less intrusive than its rivals, while offering similar functionality. However, while it does have a speaker, it is not designed to be used as a music player. Back to the phone, and the one thing it proudly lacks is a logo, because Essential says "your phone is your personal property. It's a public expression of who you are and what you stand for. Just because we played a part in making it, [it] doesn't mean you should be forced to advertise that fact to everyone in your life. Now you know why we don't have any logos on the phone." So, this is a phone designed very much for the people, and by 'people', I mean, 'rich people'. The phone comes unlocked and on its own costs $699 (€620). The camera accessory bumps up the price to $898; however, for a limited time, the phone and camera are available as a bundle for $749. Speaking at Recode's Code Conference, Rubin said the phone will begin shipping this month. The launch understandably generated a lot of excitement – Rubin co-created Android, after all; it's the phone equivalent of Steve Wozniak designing a new computer. Nonetheless, it is crucial that this be converted into sustained mindshare, if you'll forgive the gratuitous use of an advertising buzzword. Otherwise, average consumers – already bombarded by Samsung and Apple ads – will soon forget what they were so excited about. A highly unscientific and cursory glance at the online storefronts of major U.S., U.K., Japanese, and South Korean MNOs showed that Apple and Samsung hog the limelight, featuring on the front pages of the 14 operators surveyed 10 and 11 times respectively. LG ranked third with five appearances. Sony featured once. It may only be 14 of the world's operators, but together they have comfortably north of half a billion mobile subscribers. And, if the pattern observed on these 14 Websites is consistent with the industry at large, then there are a lot of eyeballs being nourished by delicious publicity shots of iPhones and Galaxy S8s. And these are just the operators' own online storefronts. There is also the money that the likes of Apple and Samsung pour into TV, print, and outdoor advertising, and sponsorship to consider too. The world is saturated with iPhone and Galaxy ads. With that in mind, Total Telecom contacted Essential to enquire about its advertising strategy; this story will be updated if and when it responds. The bottom line is Essential might not think a logo is essential, but getting word out to potential customers surely is.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 10:15AM AppleInsider shared some speculation from a J.P. Morgan analyst that there was "some possibility" that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would show off the next-generation iPhone at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event next week. AppleInsider went on to note that the analyst thinks that the public will get such a preview due to "expected large form factor change as well as new 3D scanning features." Image source: Apple. AppleInsider's Mike Wuerthele pegged this as "highly unlikely" and I agree. Here's why. Needlessly hurting iPhone 7 series sales On Apple's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that the company believes that it is seeing a "pause in purchases on iPhone" due to what the executive described as "earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones." This isn't terribly surprising. Interest in future iPhone models is generally very high among investors, consumers, and the tech press, so speculation and leaks about future iPhone models is bound to circulate to a sizable portion of the smartphone/iPhone customer base. Furthermore, given that the extent of this year's changes should be quite significant (I'd argue that they're more substantial than even the ones that Apple brought to market with the iPhone 6 series devices), the information contained in these leaks sounds compelling enough that it'd be quite sensible for potential iPhone customers who are exposed to these reports would try to hold off for the new phone, if possible. So, if Apple's executive leadership team believes that leaks about future iPhone models in the tech press is depressing iPhone sales (and I would hazard that a substantial portion, if not the majority, of smartphone buyers don't closely follow the reports about future iPhone models), then surely the team would realize that publicly previewing an iPhone that won't be out for several more months at least would probably have an even bigger negative impact on current iPhone sales. That's just bad for business and, for stockholders, virtually no potential upside for Apple. But doesn't the analyst make a good point? The analyst's basis for this speculation seems to be that Apple might want to give application developers a heads-up about what's coming so that they can prepare their applications to take advantage of the new features available to them in the new iPhone. Although that's a reasonable point, it's also important to understand that the developers of the most common iOS apps (e.g., major game developers, social media, and so on) may get advance knowledge of these features (as well as software development tools to use them) in private under a non-disclosure agreement. If the major first- and third-party apps can take advantage of whatever new features Apple plans to bring to the new iPhone early on, then that should be more than enough to make said features into compelling selling points. Such "exclusivity" on the part of the larger app developers would give them a few months' advantage over the smaller app developers in implementing new features, but in the scheme of things, this is a reasonable trade-off for Apple to make to avoid further hurting its current iPhone sales.

No matter what type of device you’re using the day of the event, you can live-stream the keynote. In this piece, we’ll go over all the methods on how for every operating system and platform. How to stream WWDC 2017 live The live stream is accessible on virtually any device, so long as you have the right software requirements to do so. One of the following setups is going to be required to watch the WWDC 2017 event live: Any iOS 7.0 or later iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad and viewed with the Safari web browser Any Mac running OS X 10.8.5 or later and viewed with the Safari 6.0.5 or later web browser Any PC running Windows 10 and viewed with the Microsoft Edge web browser Any Apple TV running software 6.2 or later, or the Apple TV 4 with any version of tvOS NOTE: Streaming for Android and older configurations of Windows require a special link that won’t be available until Monday, June 5th – the day of the keynote. All other streaming methods are straightforward and should work as described. We will update that post accordingly once that streaming link becomes available. How to watch WWDC 2017 on iPhone, iPad, or Mac If you’re using an Apple device to stream WWDC 2017, then you’re all set in terms of software, as long as everything is up to date. All you will have to do is visit the WWDC 2017 page at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) in Safari and wait for the event to begin. It should start playing as soon as Apple begins broadcasting; if it doesn’t just try refreshing the page and that should jump-start your viewing process. How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Apple TV If you’re fortunate enough to have an Apple TV and will be tuning in from the comfort of your own living room sofa, there’s a different process to stream WWDC 2017 on it depending on the type of Apple TV you have. On older Apple TVs (third-generation and earlier), an app icon is automatically added to the Home screen for tuning in to WWDC for your convenience. Fourth-generation Apple TV users will have to download the Apple Events app from the App Store to watch WWDC 2017 live. After the app is on your Apple TV Home screen, simply launch it before 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the streaming will begin on your TV set automatically. How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Android device If you’re on the other side of town and are tuning in from an Android device, then you’ll be happy to know there’s a process available for you as well. Just follow these steps: 1) Download and launch the VLC app, then tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream. 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL: Note: The link is not yet available, but we will update this post when it is. 3) Tap on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will be playing from your Android device through VLC. How to watch WWDC 2017 on a Windows PC If you’re using a Windows PC, then the steps to live-stream the WWDC 2017 keynote vary depending on the version of Windows you’re running. Windows 10 users can visit the WWDC 2017 page in the Microsoft Edge web browser at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST). Microsoft Edge supports HLS streaming, much like Safari does on your Mac or iOS device, which means you will get a seamless viewing experience. Windows 8.1 and earlier users can tune in by following these steps: 1) Download and open the VLC app, then go to Media > Open Network Stream from the top of the app’s interface. 2) When prompted to enter a source, enter the following URL: Note: The link is not yet available, but we will update this post when it is. 3) Click on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will play from VLC Media Player. Tuning in from other parts of the world? If you’re not from the United States and you’re wondering when the WWDC 2017 keynote will begin for you, the following time zone conversions may be useful: Beijing, China: Tuesday 1:00 A.M. Berlin, Germany: Monday 7:00 P.M. Hong Kong, China: Tuesday 1:00 A.M. London, United Kingdom: Monday 6:00 P.M. Los Angeles, United States: Monday 10:00 A.M. Moscow, Russia: Monday 8:00 P.M.

But this time in years past, Apple’s upcoming new iPhone design was basically a matter of record. While nothing is ever truly confirmed until Apple announces its new iPhones on stage in California, the rumor mill has always managed to produce a clear picture of what to expect. This year, however, the rumor mill is torn. Will the iPhone 8 feature an all-screen face with barely any bezels, or will there be a hideous notch cut out for the camera, speaker and sensors? Will Apple and its partners figure out how to get their embedded Touch ID sensor ready for mass production, or will Apple have to move the fingerprint scanner to the back? These questions and more have yet to be answered, and the fight took yet another turn on Friday morning. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again Early on Friday morning, new photos were posted on Slashleaks that supposedly showed an iPhone 8 mockup. We covered them in an earlier post. The mockup shown in those pictures was essentially an iPhone 7 with a new dual-lens rear camera and a new Touch ID fingerprint scanner integrated into the aluminum back of the phone. It goes without saying that these new photos show an iPhone 8 design that flies in the face of everything we’ve heard so far. Apple’s new iPhone 8 is expected to feature wireless charging, which means the company can no longer use aluminum housings. Instead, Apple is expected to use Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the iPhone 8, with a stainless steel midframe that is rounded and polished around the edges. The steel edges should create a perfectly rounded design when lined up with the 2.5D glass on the front and back of the phone. In response to those photos, graphic designer turned gadget leaker @VenyaGeskin1 posted the following tweet: Clone is wrong! This is how its going to look like. #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/U7sY9hqm5S — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 Now, Geskin has thrown a whole lot of spaghetti at the wall, so something will inevitably end up sticking. Citing unnamed sources who are believed for the most part to be random people in Chinese forums who claim to have an inside track at Foxconn, he has in the past made too many conflicting iPhone 8 claims to count. He’s said that the Touch ID sensor will be on the back. He’s said it will be on the front, embedded in the screen. He’s said that the dual-lens camera will be horizontal. He’s said it will be vertical. He’s said the flash will be beneath the two rear camera lenses. He’s said it will be between the two rear camera lenses. And so on. The iPhone 8 design Geskin seems to have landed on is the one pictured above. It’s a gorgeous design that is mostly in line with what we’ve heard from more reliable sources, though the notch cutout along the top of the display is absolutely hideous. It’s almost as bad as the one on Andy Rubin’s Essential phone. The only way I could see Apple actually using a design like this is if the company keeps the portions of the display panel on either side of the speaker and sensors dark, using them only to display things that currently appear in the iPhone’s status bar (carrier, signal strength, battery charge, Bluetooth status, location status, etc.). Of course, that wouldn’t work very well on an iPhone with a white face — perhaps Apple will only release the iPhone 8 in one color? We’re close enough to the iPhone 8’s launch that the design is almost certainly finalized by now. In fact, we recently shared exclusive photos of what is believed to be Apple’s final iPhone 8 design, though the mockup seen there doesn’t answer the display question. Someone with more solid sources will undoubted answer the iPhone 8 design questions that remain, but you can expect to see plenty of back and forth until then.

But Wharton operations, information and decisions practice professor David Robertson argues that this view is too narrow a definition of innovation, and one that is not useful to most companies. In his book, The Power of Little Ideas: A Low-Risk, High-Reward Approach to Innovation, Robertson talks about a more practical way companies can innovate: by focusing on complementary actions around a key product. He teaches innovation and product development at Wharton and is the host of Innovation Navigation, a Wharton Business Radio program. Robertson recently spoke to Knowledge@Wharton about his book. An edited transcript of the conversation follows. Knowledge@Wharton: The inspiration for this book actually came, in some ways, from a can of paint. Why don’t you tell us about that? David Robertson: My previous book was about Lego, and that was a story about a company that figured out that you didn’t want to innovate inside the box — that wasn’t going to get them anywhere — and you didn’t want to innovate outside the box because that almost put them out of business, but rather, around the box. Complementary innovations around a core product — the brick for Lego — was what really led them to their recent success. I got my house painted a couple of summers ago, and the contractor I hired put together a proposal. He helped me choose colors and helped me decide what kind of paint, what things needed painting the most, and how I’d manage on a limited budget. He put together a proposal, and he picked Sherwin Williams paint. I looked at my favorite consumer ratings magazine, and Sherwin-Williams paint is good, but it’s twice as expensive as another paint that’s equally good. So I talked to him, and I said, “Can’t we use this other paint?” And he said, “Well, yes, we could, but it’s going to raise your price.” I said, “I don’t understand, the other paint is half the price.” And he said, “Yeah, but paint is only about 15% of the total cost of your project. I have to think about all the supplies; I’ve got to line up the labor; there’s the overhead of running a company, etc..” He said, “What Sherwin-Williams does is help me though the entire process of working with you, from helping you choose your colors — there’s a Sherwin-Williams color consultant — to figuring out how much paint is needed for the primer, and for the paint itself, brushes, tarps, all the other supplies. Then, during the project, it is keeping me supplied — I can return extra primer if I don’t need it. If I run out of something, that Sherwin-Williams rep will be over at the site, delivering what I need. Then, at the end, he helps me put together that next proposal. Because there’s always a next proposal, as any homeowner knows. I looked, and it turns out within a five or 10-minute drive of my house, there are more Sherwin-Williams stores than there are Starbucks, and that’s because they realized who their customer is. It’s not me. I’m the end consumer, of course, and I’m the one that has Sherwin-Williams paint on the house. But it’s that small business, the painting contractor, [that they focus on]. Sherwin-Williams, like Lego, realized it’s not so much about the product — their product is a can of paint — it’s about their innovations around the product that make that product more valuable. I wanted to write a book for companies that wanted to try this approach to innovation. I don’t argue that there’s one best way to innovate, but it seems like it’s a tool that every innovation leader should have in their tool belt. Knowledge@Wharton: What isn’t being discussed when companies think about innovation, or how they should strategize toward an innovation? Robertson: I interview innovation thinkers, gurus, consultants, executives who have done interesting innovative things, and I continually see this binary view of innovation … — [develop] an incrementally better version of your current product here … or something revolutionary and disruptive, be it some kind of Blue Ocean Strategy thing (creating an uncontested market) or lean startup or disruptive technology, some kind of new and better version of your business. In other words, leaving the old behind and venturing out into new territories. “Sherwin-Williams … realized it’s not so much about the product — their product is a can of paint — it’s about their innovations around the product that make that product more valuable.” To see innovation in that binary way is dangerous. Most people in most companies doing most of the innovation are focused on that current product that needs to become more competitive. Maybe it’s competitively challenged; maybe it has become a commodity, whatever. What I liked about the approach of Lego and Sherwin-Williams was that it was focused on that type of innovation: How do we take our existing product and make it more compelling, make it more valuable for our customers? Knowledge@Wharton: Your book is not saying that in using this ‘third way’ of innovating, we have to throw out things. It’s more about finding the right toolkit to use for whatever your problem happens to be, or to solve your market issues. Are there ways, once you start using this third way, to keep your employees on track? Sponsored Content: Robertson: This book was a hard one to write, because the stuff in the middle is really review. It’s the material at the beginning and the end that’s different. What I lay out in the book is a four-step process. And the first step — what you are asking about — is really the step of answering, “Who are we as a company? What are our crown jewels? What are those things that we did yesterday that we’re going to do today and that we are going to do tomorrow? The things that made our company great, that our customers still depend on us for? What’s our [Lego] brick?” Some companies have many different bricks. Lego was easy. Sherwin-Williams was easy. But there are other companies where it’s more difficult [to find the key product]. But starting small, choosing something important, and then trying to understand what customers are getting from the product is the first step. That is a different step. It’s almost where you’re not going to innovate. What’s going to stay the same? I think that’s a much more stable base to build innovation efforts from. Then, once you’ve done that, it’s understanding what the value is to the customer, what I call “the promise,” that’s the second step. Then you come to the third step, which is the creative idea generation, and there’s lots of different ways to do it. Then, going into some of the prototyping and experimentation to understand whether you have the right ideas, that’s all pretty well-trod territory. I put in some things that are unique to this approach to innovation in the book. But then, it’s the fourth step, and you have to read all the way to Chapter 7. If you’re a company that’s good at product development, developing a better version of your product or service, then you have probably set up roles and responsibilities, and structured processes, metrics, reward systems, that make you very good at that. But that actually prevents this approach to innovation. You have to change some of that, otherwise, you are setting your team up for failure. That last part, about how you change your organization to give your team the chance to be successful, that’s what makes this so hard. “Get a team organized around some product, and give them the freedom to really think more broadly than just about the product or service.” Knowledge@Wharton: You also have to organize your company that way, because if it’s organized toward disruption, you can’t do this. Robertson: That’s right, and it’s why I suggest starting small. Get a team organized around some product, and give them the freedom to really think more broadly than just about the product or service. Rather, give the team the mandate to start thinking about other services, partners, channels to market, whatever, that will really help your customers get more value from the product. That’s something that can be really difficult to overcome in a company. But if you start small, you can show that it’s valuable, and then build up from there. Knowledge@Wharton: Now you also point out — using Kodak as an example — that this is not the answer for every company, for every problem. For example, Kodak probably couldn’t have used the third way to survive the advent of digital photography. Robertson: That’s right. I think of it as another tool in the tool belt that I don’t see people talking about. Knowledge@Wharton: One of the things you talk about in the book is that Lego — back when their fortunes had declined, and they were looking for a way back to growth — first turned to incremental innovation. Then they turned to disruption, and then they turned to this [third way of innovating around the box]. Robertson: I saw that pattern being repeated again and again. I saw it with Apple; I saw it with Gatorade. One of the first things that companies tend to do is … maybe they’ve grown because they came out with a great product. So they do more of that product, and they expand it to new geographies, and the company grows and everything’s wonderful. Then, all of a sudden, that’s not enough. That avenue for growth hits its inevitable end. Then what often happens — what happened at Lego, Apple, Gatorade, etc. — is they keep putting out more versions of the product. Every new variant that they spin off makes less money, but has just as much cost. So profits go down, sales don’t go up, and the whole thing — if you keep doing it — will result in a problem. What happened at Lego — as also happened at Apple, and that happened at other companies — is that they begin to ask this: How can we reinvent the future? How can we reinvent the future of play for Lego or computing for Apple or whatever? And they come out with all kinds of revolutionary disruptive products. And that’s really dangerous. It’s expensive, it’s difficult, it fails a lot. It doesn’t mean you don’t want to try. You absolutely want to try. You have to have somebody looking out there to see what’s happening with technologies, and with competitors, and new low-end, high-tech solutions that could disrupt you if you’re not really paying attention to it. You’ve got to be focused on that. “Steve Jobs was not a disruptor. He was disruptive, but not a disruptor. That may sound like academic nitpicking, but I think it’s really important.” But it’s tough to bet the company on it. It was only when those companies went back to the core product and started innovating around it that they began to have the success that they had. Knowledge@Wharton: A lot of times, when people talk about innovation at Apple, what they talk about is disruption. You argue that it’s the third way that actually came first. Robertson: Yes, and I get a lot of heat for that second chapter about Apple, because I’m arguing that [its late cofounder and visionary CEO] Steve Jobs was not a disruptor. He was disruptive, but not a disruptor. That may sound like academic nitpicking, but I think it’s really important, because it says something about where innovation leaders should look for ideas. Let me go into that in a little bit of depth. Apple, when it came out with the iPod and iTunes in 2001, made major changes in the music industry. Of course, in 2003, when they opened up the iTunes Store, that was a big change. And it opened up the first major digital market. If you’re a music company or if you’re a company making MP3 players, that feels like a disruption. But the point that I try to make in the chapter is that Steve Jobs was not looking to disrupt. You’ve got to go back to 2001 to see that Apple was a company that had focused on the PC market, and had steadily been losing share. I think they had a peak of about 15% in the mid-1990s … and hit a low of 4% market share. Things were really bad at Apple in 2001. Of course, it was the tech crash, so there was less demand, but things were not going well. What Steve Jobs was doing with the iPod and iTunes was he came out — and I urge anybody to go back and listen to his Macworld presentation from 2001, where he shows a picture of a Mac in the middle, and he shows around it a VCR and a digital camera and a CD player and a Palm Pilot — and he said, “Your life is becoming digital. Your pictures are digital, your movies are digital, both the ones you watch and the ones you take. And your music is digital. And in no place is this experience worse than with music. So, we’re going to help you manage your digital life.” And then, he introduces the iPod and iTunes. And iTunes, actually, was a product called SoundJam that he’d acquired the year before and improved slightly, but it was introduced as iTunes. And of course, the iPod was, at that time, an MP3 player. And Steve Jobs, if you go back and read Walter Isaacson’s biography, fought like crazy resisting taking iTunes to the IBM platform, which of course, was necessary. I mean, the customers just demanded it, so he had to. But the purpose of the iPod and iTunes was not to disrupt the music industry, it was to complement the Mac. It was to sell more Macs and to make the Mac more valuable. It was to make it the hub of your digital life. Again, if you’re in the music industry, those feel very disruptive. But Steve Jobs was not looking to disrupt. He was saying, “What is our brick? What’s that center of who we are? It’s the Mac. How can we sell more Macs? Well, by making it more valuable. Well, what do people want? They want to manage their digital life.” And in 2001, that was becoming a real thing. Let’s do that for one area — music — and let’s see whether that can’t sell some more Macs. It really was, I think, a misunderstood case. That is not a case of disruption, not from the standpoint of what was going through Steve Jobs’ mind in 2001. Knowledge@Wharton: What do you think is Apple’s brick today? Would it be the Mac or the iPhone? Robertson: They followed where their customers led them. That iPod, of course, became the iPod Touch, and then it became the iPhone in 2007. Then the App Store opens up in 2008, and there’s this whole system of complementary innovations around the iPhone. Now, of course, they make a lot more money from the small screen than from the big screen. The iPhone has become its own center of a system of complementary innovations. One of those, of course, is the Watch. We will see whether the Apple Watch becomes a third center. It doesn’t look like it is. It looks like Apple is not quite able to execute. One of the things that Steve Jobs was able to do, he had that force of personality that demanded everybody in the company work together to make an insanely great customer experience. “The purpose of the iPod and iTunes was not to disrupt the music industry, it was to complement the Mac.” Well, as the company has grown, and as Steve Jobs is gone, it may be getting harder within Apple to bring together all the different parts of the company to really make that seamless experience. To make it not around one center, but around two or even three, if you count the Watch. I end the book with a story of Disney. Disney is both a great example because they were the first to do this — back in 1937, they were doing this with the first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They also had records, so you could sing along. They had bath salts, so you could smell like Snow White. They had events at the movie theater. The Mickey Mouse Club, at its peak, was bigger than the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts combined. All those things made the movie more valuable and the whole experience better. But as Disney grew, and — especially during the [CEO Michael] Eisner years, this has been well documented — all those different things became their own business units. So there was the theme park business unit, the movie business unit, the stores business unit, and the TV shows. All those things kind of went in their own direction. And the one that was let go, that lost some of its luster, was movies and telling stories. A lot of the characters in the stories were the things that drew people to Disney World, and to the merchandise in the stores and so forth. And Bob Iger, when he took over for Eisner, realized that. He said, “I had this eye-opening trip in Tokyo, where I looked around, and all the characters that kids were really excited by or interested in were either very old Disney characters, like Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck and Goofy, or the new ones from Pixar.” All the other movies that they had been making — The Princess and the Frog, Bolt — were just a lot of very ho-hum movies that Disney put out. They’d lost that art. So Iger purchased Pixar, and used the management of Pixar to help revive the fortunes of the Disney innovation. Of course, that led to Frozen and some of the other great Disney animated features that we’ve seen, and a revival of the whole system of innovations around it. Knowledge@Wharton: How do you find those ah-ha moments, like when Gatorade realized that athletes were its core audience? Robertson: It starts with that question, ‘What are our crown jewels?’ Lego asked the question, ‘What would the world miss if we were gone?’ And what they found was that people would miss the brick, the plastic brick. … The toys that didn’t have bricks in them were the toys that failed. People felt that if there was no brick, they had no reason to do business with Lego. They’d rather go to Fisher-Price or Mattel or Hasbro. Just asking that question, ‘What are our crown jewels?’ And then, for each of them, what would the world miss if it was gone? Then, going out and talking to those customers and watching them use the product. Watching kids play, or watching a contractor paint a house: That’s what you have to do to understand where other innovations might make that crown jewel more valuable to a customer.

INNOVATION FUND & INNOVATION CENTRES IN ENGINEERING COLLEGES IN INDIA In a broader sense, innovation is important to the advancement of society around the world. New and innovative products can increase the standard of living and provide people with opportunities to improve their lives. Breakthroughs in medicine and technology have significantly improved living standards around the world. Innovation has also lead to significant improvements in the way businesses operate and has closed the gaps between different markets. Innovation in engineering: Innovation in engineering is much more than research and development. It encompasses an end-to-end process, such that it extracts value through implementation. Innovation involves: • creating or generating new activities, products, processes and services • seeing things from a different perspective • moving outside the existing paradigms • improving existing processes and functions • disseminating new activities or ideas • adopting things that have been successfully tried elsewhere Innovation covers the area from minor quality improvements to ‘cutting edge’ products and services. “If we can’t find ways to inspire a generation of engineers with varied skills, this is going to be a principle obstacle for growth in our slowly recovering global economy” said Lidia Brito, Director of the Division of Science Policy and Capacity Building at UNESCO. “A recent UNESCO Engineering Report shows a marked shortage of engineers in many countries. Although the general number of engineering students is increasing worldwide, the proportion who enroll in engineering, as compared to other disciplines, is concernedly dropping. We need hands-on challenges like Fly Your Ideas to motivate young innovators about the potential of engineering in helping to find practical solutions to issues the world may face in the near future.” Such innovation may be under threat from a skills gap that could be hitting the economy hard. It will see high tech companies face a shortfall of 40 million of the skilled workers needed by 2020 and beyond, with aerospace likely to suffer, along with motor and the medical equipment sectors. Charles Champion, Executive Vice President Engineering at Airbus and Fly Your Ideas Patron, says: “These future-focused and disruptive concepts prove that engineering isn’t just about technical skills – it’s about having an innovative mindset and a creative approach. But for our industry to succeed in making aviation carbon neutral by 2020, we need a constant source of fresh and inventive ideas from the innovators of today and those of tomorrow. Our future solutions are here right now – and through projects like ‘Fly Your Ideas’, we are helping them to become a reality for the future.” Innovation is extremely important to a country like India as it is closely related to productivity. Although there are a number of avenues to increased productivity, innovation is the most significant factor. Creativity is seeing what everyone sees and thinking what no one else has thought before,Invention is transforming those new thoughts into tangible ideas Innovation goes even further, involving preparedness to mix with the commercial world to turn novel ideas into products . The expertise of the engineering profession is vital to convert innovative ideas into reality for common use. Many of the comforts humankind enjoys today have been the result of innovative engineers. Examples include electrical appliances, transportation, buildings, telecommunications and urban infrastructure. Innovation and technology have become two inseparable words in the annals of human history. Engineers drive technology and are therefore at the forefront of innovation. In India there were efforts to harness the talent and innovative spirit among people by organisations like National Innovation Foundation(NIF),National Research Development Corporation(NRDC),TePP etc. besides some private initiatives(Spark the Rise) etc. In a vast country like ours these are piecemeal. “The real innovation has to come from the bottom of the pyramid,” he added.” The amount spent for innovation should help to shape the beneficiaries as entrepreneurs. I have a project: Innovation Centres in Engineering Colleges:in India: Engineers are best suited to innovate. Unfortunately most of the Engineering Colleges like Infrastructure facilities(like Good Workshop, Electronics Lab etc). A Project,” INNOVATION CENTRES) in Engineering Colleges can be started under Innovation Fund. Selected Colleges can be provided to start a good workshop and Electronics Lab. This way the Students can undertake innovative projects and come out with good gadgets. Later they can patent them and go for commercialization. This is the best way to spend Innovation Fund so that there will be productivity and promotion of Entrepreneurship. We often talk of Appropriate Technology(AT): it should be: A T ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY AFFORDABLE TECHNOLOGY ADAPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY I have a novel scheme to SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE: Human Resources – Traditional Knowledge and Methods – Great Assets to Developing Countries Ideas float around in bewildering numbers, and scores of designs, ranging from windmills to the spinning wheel, are available ; papers are circulated stating the wonders of intermediate (not innovative) technology what could be done, why it should be done, what must be done, and how the rural countryside can be changed if intermediate technology is implemented. Experts are called from abroad to tell people this. In all this talk, there seems to be no place for the ideas generated by farmers, rural artisans. A stand seems to have been taken that this transfer of technology for the socio-economic regeneration of the rural areas is a novelty for country-folk. But rural communities have survived for generations without any help in ideas and materials from outside. They have developed a low-cost technology of their own, suited to their own particular areas. It would be foolish to overlook and take for granted methods used by farmers and artisans. When a ploughshare develops trouble on the field, when a bullock cart breaks down on the road to market, when a house collapses in a storm, the villager uses materials available in the immediate vicinity to solve his problem. It is the scientist who must see these problems as challenges that must be met if there is to be development in rural areas. It is clear that the villagers and scientists will see the problems of the villages quite differently, and it will not always be true that the projects proposed by the scientists will be meaningful to the villages. If projects are imposed on the villagers, they are likely to be skeptical and may well resist rather than co-operate with the programme. Rural Development Schemes, in the broadest sense, requires first a good sociological approach, and as much psychology as scientific knowledge. After all ‘country means people and not soil’. Problems – People – Solutions Research, Development and Demonstration projects in developing countries have generated a variety of devices and systems for exploitation – for example, solar cookers, wind battery charges etc. In Innovation theory, this is a classic case of technology push, that is, technical solutions looking for a social application. Technology push innovations might of course be adopted if they happen to satisfy a real demand, or are heavily promoted. Success is much more likely, however if the needs, priorities and demands are studied before attempting to introduce a new technology or system. This is the demand pull approach to innovation. Often identifying the right problem is difficult rather than finding a possible solution. People are better judges to identify the problems and since they benefit most by the solutions, they can contribute for finding the best solutions. A novel and innovative scheme is suggested to achieve the above goal. In developing countries the Government can advertise in the media seeking problems from the people in different disciplines like education, health, energy, industry etc. The problems received can be screened, studied and short-listed by a committee comprising government officials, experts, representatives from N.G.O’s etc. The short-listed problems can be re-advertised seeking solutions from people. The solutions received can be studied in detail and the best solutions given awards. To catch a fish the bait should be attractive enough. As such there should be sizeable incentive so that people can devote their talent and energies for finding solutions. As the saying goes ‘Anything can be done for a Dollar’. In this way the creative potential of the people can be tapped to the full and a thought process will be set in motion in the country. In India a general knowledge programme conducted by a Super Star on TV is a roaring success and children, youth and old-all alike have become addicted to get equipped with general knowledge so that they can try their luck for winning fabulous cash prizes.

According to a recent report from Bloomberg, this will be somewhat similar to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, only it’ll focus on sound quality, and, naturally, be powered by Apple’s Siri assistant. It’s that last bit that has some onlookers skeptical. Despite Apple’s head start in voice assistant tech, the common assumption is that Siri isn’t as knowledgeable as its rivals from Seattle and Mountain View. And as this chart from Statista shows, those skeptics might be onto something. A recent study by digital marketing agency Stone Temple asked the major voice assistants 5,000 general knowledge questions (the most common use case for smart assistants). It found Google Assistant to be the clear leader, with Microsoft’s Cortana a bit behind. Siri, meanwhile, was well off the pace, directly answering just 22% of questions correctly. This certainly isn’t a good thing for something that may be the interface for a whole device, but keep in mind Amazon’s Alexa managed to answer even fewer questions directly. Siri has some catching up to do, for sure, but given that Google itself still couldn’t answer 32% of the questions directly — and couldn’t answer 10% of those in a complete way — it’s worth a reminder that there’s still a long way to go for everyone in the voice assistant race.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web What Google’s new payments functionality really means for banks By Daniel Döderlein Feature  As the mobile payments market continues to grow, Google and Apple will become a bank's biggest competitors. Shares A couple of weeks ago, Google announced its new payments functionality. The new functionality allows anyone using Google’s API (online stores, for example) to give their customers the ability to pay using any of their cards they currently have stored in their Google accounts.  The mobile payments market is predicted to grow to USD 17.56 billion by 2021. Currently, Apple Pay users are thought to outnumber Android Pay users. It should come as no real surprise, then, that Google would want to take a stake in this multi-billion dollar market.  At the moment, most traditional banks around the world haven’t really got it sorted when it comes to mobile payments. Sure, they and the big card companies - the likes of Visa and Mastercard - might be working with Apple, Samsung and Google to facilitate access to their customers cards for contactless purposes. But this is just a partnership and is in no way allowing them to own the mobile payments solution or indeed, to monetise it.     Google, like many others, can see that at the moment, banks aren’t properly monetising mobile payments. They also know these banks are under pressure to meet data-security and second payment services directive (PSD2) regulation requirements - in Europe, at least. With trust in traditional banks declining and challenger banks becoming more popular, it must seem to Google - and many other disruptors - that it’s surely the perfect time to sweep in.    This new development is Google starting the process of making mobile payments easy to use and valuable for the masses. That is, everyone... the everyday consumer as well as online and offline merchants wanting a way to more simply (and more cheaply) take payments.  Google has millions of users. Millions of people already intimately familiar with the Google login process. Taking all these millions of users and allowing them to use the same login credentials to easily make payments isn’t a big leap. When Google is able to go to direct to account (the second payment services directive (PSD2) within Europe allows them to do this) it seems likely they will seek to autonomise this payments process - perhaps cutting out the cards companies and by association, the banks. As of January 2018, PSD2 regulation will allow bank API access to companies who have been granted an e-money license.  There is a huge - almost global - market ripe for disruption in the mobile payments space. The exception are places like Scandinavia. Banks in Scandinavia have created and monetised mobile payment solutions which facilitate all types of payments for every person - individuals and businesses. This means that the likes of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay haven’t yet been able to gain traction in the Nordics.  Right now, whilst banks in the rest of the world don’t yet have the same protection in place with their own robust mobile payment solutions, they do have a time advantage. They also have direct access to the customer. Combine this with experience and the ability - whether they realise it or not - to relatively quickly put in place a future-proof system prior to regulations, such as those outlined in PSD2, coming into effect.    Basically, until PSD2 comes into effect, all that third-parties like Apple Pay, Facebook - or indeed Google - can do is create a payment experience that works relatively similarly to what’s currently on offer. Until they can create innovative new experiences - and what is starting to happen is a hint of what is to come - customers are starting to losing interest.    Banks effectively have a choice to make now. Knowing they have a head start they could, like Nordic banks have done, invest heavily in delivering and monetising innovative mobile payment solutions that their customers want to use. If developed, delivered and marketed before their competition, who are no longer just other banks, gain traction and accounts are opened up - they are in a great position to retain relevance. Not only could they gain renewed relevance but alongside this, grow their customer base and their bottom line.    The alternatives include partnering with other banks to create a combined offering, strengthening partnerships with the card companies and hoping they will create a solution favourable to their existing relationship or… doing nothing and hoping for the best.    A recent EY survey recommended banks overhaul their consumer relationships strategy. Another report from PwC, Catalyst or Threat, concluded that European consumers were already au fait with digital payments, including mobile. This report also made reference to the fact that banking customers wanted to be able to use innovative third-party financial solutions. A bank could take from this: unless we do something - fast - our customers will leave.    Deals between banks and fintechs or big tech companies don’t ensure continued relevancy. Nor does the addition of simple technology - such as near-field communication, tap and go, contactless - without a bigger strategy around value-add for the customer and for the bank.  Many banks are still fixated on card payments. But in certain areas - like in China and the Nordics - app based mobile payments continue to quickly grow. This is because these solutions consider all payment situations. They make it easy to build eco-systems, receive payments and solve common issues. This fixation and the launching of variations of a technology which hasn’t fundamentally changed in decades - guarantees a huge amount of wasted money. Wasted money which could be 100 per cent better spent on providing customers with game-changing payment innovations.    Companies like Facebook and Google are now a bank’s biggest competitors and this will only intensify in the future. Banks can secure their position by simply becoming... a better bank. By listening to what customers want, developing fun and easy to use technology and knowing how to then monetise the resulting payment solutions is a sure-fire way to stay relevant - and profitable. So, my advice to banks is this: launch a system that your customers - and everyone in your market - actually needs and wants. Make it easy for individuals and business owners to pay and get paid - in any situation. Stop restricting, start facilitating.  Daniel Döderlein, CEO and founder of Auka Image Credit: Bloomicon / Shutterstock  Topics Security Cloud enterprise mobile payment Android Pay apple pay contactless payment GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Micro-LED Displays and new Flexible Fuel Cells on the Horizon may see Portable Devices go Days without Charging | Main | In an Effort to hurt iPhone 8 Sales in Korea, Samsung Plans to Flood the Local market with Refurbished Note 7s » June 02, 2017 The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze   During the Google I/O developer conference we learned how they plan to advance the Google Assistant to work better at making transactions than Siri, introduced "proactive assistance" and made the Google Home device better for entertainment and working with your TV. They also introduced "Google Lens" which is bound to be a huge hit. The feature is set to kick-start Augmented Reality on the Pixel and other Android phones. A user could take a photo and with one click get information about it. You could be in Chicago taking a photo of the tallest building and in one click you'll see 'Willis Tower' labeled on your photo. Or you could be in a museum taking a photo of a favorite work and in one click it'll reveal the artist and other relevant information. This is what many are hoping that Apple will introduce at their WWDC event next week. Apple was granted a patent for exactly this task in January. This technology also extends to indoor location services.   Another cool Google Lens feature will allow you to take a photo of a poster of an upcoming event and in one click you could have access to Ticketmaster and details of the upcoming event. This might be something coming to the iPhone 8 and tied to Siri.   It's been reported on several times that Apple's intelligent speaker device to compete with devices from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others is already in production with Inventec. So this is going to likely be one of the highlights at the WWDC event – or so we hope.   There's no doubt that the tech sector is obsessed with new trend and even startup Essential Products will enter this market this summer with their own digital assistant. Apple is definitely late to the table. Danielle Levitas of app researcher App Annie noted in a new Financial Times report that "In this case, it behoves Apple to be late as it allows it to learn from other companies' mis-steps in what is still a nascent field. It's too important for them to screw up. But if you do it late, you'd better be better."   With Apple's device reportedly due to arrive in the market this fall, it'll be 'show time' for Apple to prove that they've done it better or it'll be seen as just another me-too product or worse, a copycat.   Ben Bajarin, analyst at Silicon Valley researcher Creative Strategies told the Financial Times that for ""Right now, the perception is that Siri is the least good out of those out there, from Alexa to Google. They need to make sure people have the experience they expect from Apple with Siri or they run the risk of losing those consumers' trust."   In respect to a 'Google Lens' equivalent for the iPhone, Bajarin noted that "Adding new senses is of little value, though, if the iPhone's brain does not improve too. Mr Bajarin expects the next version of the phone's operating software to see fundamental changes. 'A heavy theme is going to be how the software is becoming more smart,' he says. 'It's a learning operating system that knows about you specifically. I expect a high level of personalization and customization, as it starts to become more proactively intelligent.' Of course Bajarin was using lingo from Google's I/O regarding Google Home with Google Assistant as noted in the Google I/O slide noted below.   The Financial Times last noted that "So far, Apple has limited third-party access to Siri to a handful of app categories, including communications (Facebook and Skype), ride-hailing services (Uber, Lyft and Didi), payments (PayPal and Square), tracking workouts and photo searches. Siri can also be used to control some smart-home devices such as lightbulbs and thermostats using Apple's HomeKit platform. Mr Cook says he tells Siri to turn on his lights and make the coffee every morning. Now that Apple and its developers have all had a chance to learn from that test group, many expect Siri will be opened up to a broader range of apps — not least to create more reasons for consumers to buy that "Siri speaker", which is expected to go on sale later in the year.   The WWDC keynote is only three days away and yet it'll seem like weeks for Apple fans who impatiently await the delivery of a very important keynote that will have us all hoping this segment of the market will be seriously addressed, and better yet, give their competition something to worry about.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Ron Amadeo - Jun 2, 2017 2:00 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 29 Share this story It's June, and that means Apple's WorldWide Developers Conference is right around the corner. This year, the show kicks off Monday, June 5th at 1pm ET/10am PT/6pm UK with Tim Cook's keynote. We'll be there live from the keynote bringing you the latest news from Apple's annual developer event. Further ReadingApple’s Siri-controlled smart speaker could be revealed at WWDC next weekAs usual, we expect to see updates to iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, and also as usual, Apple has kept a tight lid on what exactly these updates will contain. There has been one reliable tidbit out there, though: Bloomberg reports that Apple plans to show off an "updated user-interface" for iPhones and iPads at WWDC. Another report claims Apple is working on a "Siri Speaker" that would compete with the likes of Amazon Echo and Google Home. In addition to pumping out jams (preferably from Apple Music) the system would reportedly serve as a hub for Apple's HomeKit smart home ecosystem. The report says Apple "could debut the speaker as soon as" WWDC, with a launch later this year. We also might see some updates to Apple's laptop lineup. Be sure to check back Monday for all the festivities—we'll see you then!

So many in fact, that even the most seasoned iPhone users may not know all of its tricks.   That's why it's always important to keep your iPhone updated: Not only will you protect yourself against cyberattacks, you'll also be able to access the latest features available.   To help you get the most out of your iPhone, INSIDER rounded up 15 of the best tips and hidden features that'll make your life better in 2017. But before you check them out, make sure you're running iOS 10.3 or later on your iPhone. Get hourly weather updates without ever opening the Weather app. This was hands down one of the most useful features that iOS 10.3 introduced. To use it, open Apple's Maps app, search for a location, and firmly press and hold the weather icon in the lower right corner.   Customise the flashlight's brightness level. Fall asleep listening to music with a custom timer that stops all media on your phone when it ends. The new iPhone 7 and a pair of AirPods (Getty) Open Apple's Clock app, and tap "Timer" on the bottom right to access this feature. This trick was a major game-changer for me when I first found out about it. I use it all the time to fall asleep while listening to meditation videos on YouTube, ocean sounds on Spotify, podcasts, and more.    Create custom vibration alerts for calls, texts, tweets, calendar reminders, alarms, and more. (Getty) By setting up custom vibration alerts, you can easily tell what type of notification you're getting without picking up your phone. Just go to Settings > Sounds, and choose an alert for which you want to create a custom vibration — for example, "Text Tone" or "New Mail." Then, tap "Vibration" and under "Custom," tap "Create New Vibration."  Tap and hold to create a pulse, and lift your finger to enter a pause between pulses. Tap "Stop" when you're done, and make sure to "Save" your custom vibration.   Like Ctrl+Z or Command+Z for your iPhone, shake your phone to undo typing This feature is especially useful if you accidentally delete long paragraphs of text. You can turn this feature on and off by going to General > Accessibility, and tap the toggle next to "Shake to Undo."   See and edit drafts across all your different email accounts with the tap of a button. Don't waste time checking the draft folder for each of your email accounts. Instead, tap and hold the "New Message" icon in the bottom right of Apple's Mail app, and you'll see every draft you have saved. Instantly choose a camera mode, even when your phone is locked.   Respond to calls with a quick, custom text message. (Getty Images/iStockphoto) Before I knew about this trick, I used to take the time to decline a call, unlock my phone, open my iMessages, and text the person who called me. I can do the same thing now with just two taps. Go to Settings > Phone and tap "Respond with Text." Here, you'll be able to create up to three custom text responses that you can use whenever you're unavailable to take a call.   Easily and quickly type symbols and letters. This trick makes typing symbols much more convenient. For example, to type a backslash, tap and hold the forward slash symbol instead of tapping the "123" button and then tapping the "#+=" button to get to the backslash button. Type symbols and numbers without switching between keyboards. Don't waste time tapping the "123" button, tapping a symbol, and then tapping the "ABC" button again. Use this trick instead.   To save even more time while typing, double tap the space bar to add a full stop (a fullstop plus a space). Instead of tapping the "123" button while typing to enter a period, double tap the space bar to insert a full stop. To turn this feature on and off, go to Settings > General > Keyboard and tap the toggle next to "." Shortcut.   Replace your 4-digit passcode with a more secure Alphanumeric code. pp-iphone-password-rf-istock.jpg, by Adam Williamson Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and tap either "Change Passcode" or "Turn Passcode On." Then, tap "Passcode Options" and choose "Custom Alphanumeric Code." To make your passcode even more secure, you can add symbols from the keyboard instead of just letters and numbers.   Customise text replacements for your keyboard to insert common phrases, symbols, or emojis more quickly. (Emojipedia) To see and edit your list of keyboard shortcuts, go to Settings > General > Keyboard and tap "Text Replacement." Next time you're building or fixing something, use Apple's Compass app as a handy level.   See a location on the map without opening Apple's Maps app.   Instead of opening Google Maps or Apple's Maps app and manually typing in an address someone sends you, use this trick to save time. Tap and hold the address in your iMessage to see a menu of options. Or, press firmly to see the address on Apple's Maps app, and swipe up on the screen for menu options.   • I've studied happiness for years — here are the 12 best pieces of advice I'm giving my daughter • Everything you need to know about Gal Gadot, the badass actress who stars in 'Wonder Woman' • These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models Read the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2015.

We may also see refreshes to the MacBook, MacBook Pro, a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro and more. Apple's also said to unveil a new Siri-powered smart speaker. Todd Haselton | @robotodd Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 9:46 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here's what to expect from Apple's big event next week    Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 1:57 PM ET | 01:15 Apple's going to have a lot of big news to share next week. The company's developer conference, known as WWDC, kicks off with a keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. PST, when we expect Apple to discuss new hardware and software. This is the time of year when Apple typically unveils new software that will power its upcoming Macs, iPhones and iPads — but we may also get a taste of new products we've never seen before. iOS 11 and macOS Todd Haselton | CNBC CNBC: iPhone-clean It's almost a certain that Apple will reveal its new iOS 11 operating system ahead of its new iPhone launch later this fall. The tech giant typically unveils the fresh version of iOS during WWDC and then runs it through developer testing to around September when it pushes it out for everyone to use. Little is known about what Apple will include in iOS 11, but we're hoping to see improvements to Siri, which has started to lag behind competitors like Google Assistant and even Amazon Alexa. Apple will also likely unveil the next version of macOS. The current version, macOS Sierra, was introduced last year when Apple officially departed from the "OS X" moniker for its operating system. Again, like iOS 11, we're not quite sure what to expect in terms of new features just yet. I hope to at least see Siri play an even deeper role in the desktop operating system, too, with more new controls that could make it easier to manage your Mac with voice. Those two, the iOS and macOS updates, are the safest bets. Now let's talk a bit about hardware, which may or may not happen. MacBook and MacBook Pro refreshes Stephen Lam | Getty Images An Apple employee points to the Touch Bar on a new Apple MacBook Pro laptop Apple's MacBooks are overdue for a refresh to Intel's latest seventh-generation processors, which are already in machines from PC makers. We should see Apple update the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the thin-and-light MacBook with the new chips, Bloomberg said earlier this month. We might even see the MacBook Air updated with the new chips, though that computer is showing its age with an old display and ports that aren't as fast as newer ones. Apple may just kill it off entirely. Also, Apple's iMac and Mac Pro desktop computers are desperately in need of a refresh. Apple has said it'll refresh the Mac Pro, but I don't think we'll see it next week. New 10.5-inch iPad Pro and refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro Todd Haselton | CNBC Supply chain reports have long suggested Apple is working to build a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that would replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It's the first time Apple has ever launched a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, so we'll be curious to hear what the company's argument is for boosting the size. Apple is also expected to announce a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, replacing last year's model. Expect more powerful graphics, faster processors and maybe even redesigns where the screen takes up more space on the front of the iPad. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple talked about the Apple Pencil, too, perhaps with a refresh to a newer model. A Siri smart speaker Todd Haselton | CNBC The big news could be Apple's entrance into the smart home assistant market. Bloomberg said earlier this week that Apple may unveil a new smart home speaker that's powered by Siri and will compete with Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The speaker will reportedly offer surround-sound effects and better audio than the Echo or Home, which suggests it may also be more expensive. Part of me is hoping it'll sound as good as a Sonos Play:1 speaker. Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Siri doesn't really allow for ordering of goods or support for playing tunes through third-party music applications like Spotify. I'm curious to see how Apple will position this if it's locked down to the Apple ecosystem of products, like Apple Music. tvOS, webOS, watchOS, HomeKit and HealthKit Apple Given the software focus of a developer conference, Apple may dive into a variety of other topics including its smart home platform HomeKit, its health platform HealthKit, tvOS for the Apple TV, watchOS for the Apple Watch and maybe a bit on Apple CarPlay. Speaking of the Apple TV, Apple has been reportedly trying to establish streaming TV deals for a while now, but I'd be surprised if anything came to fruition next week. Finally, my guess is we'll hear a bit more about original content, like Apple's first shows "Carpool Karaoke" and "Planet of the Apps." No iPhones Regis Duvignau | Reuters Finally, if you're hoping for new iPhones, you'll need to wait a few more months. Apple will probably stick to its regular schedule of launching new iPhones in September.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs June 2, 2017 The High Cost of Gadgetry by Louis Proyect by Tweet Email Still from “Death by Design.” Two new documentaries will make you look differently at your electronic gadgets, especially the cool iPhone or other products from Apple whose logo might be changed to a skull-and-crossbones after seeing “Death by Design” and “Complicit”. They examine the damage done to both the workers who produce them and the environment, especially in China, as well as raise important questions about the meaning of “progress”. If being able to use an iPhone to pay for your Starbucks coffee comes at the expense of a leukemia epidemic for Foxconn workers and making 60 percent of China’s groundwater unsuitable for drinking, then the whole question of progress has to be thought through. “Death by Design” is now available on VOD and distributed by Bullfrog Films, America’s leading distributor of politically relevant films. Directed by veteran PBS Frontline filmmaker Sue Williams, it reviews the environmental impact of computers and other products that fall within the rubric of the Information Age. When you think of the impact of toxic waste on drinking water, the first thing that comes to mind is fracking. After seeing “Death by Design”, you will learn that manufacturing circuit boards, a process we associate with workers in white suits operating in sterile, laboratory-like environments, is just as much of a threat to our health. Although 90 percent of manufacturing takes place in far-off China nowadays, it arose first in IBM’s upstate New York headquarters and then Silicon Valley. This is where high-technology cancer clusters and other serious illnesses first cropped up. Endicott, N.Y. was the birthplace of IBM. For most of the time when mainframes were being built there, the corporation used to dump industrial solvents used for cleaning hardware into local drains. The solvents seeped from leaky pipes into the ground with disastrous consequences for people living above. As happens so frequently with cancer clusters, the corporation denies responsibility since finding a smoking gun is almost impossible given medical science’s inability now and in the future to determine the exact sequence of events that lead to a mutant cell. IBM eventually took responsibility for the cleanup and compensation to the victims but only after the damage had already been done. Endicott was a blue-collar town that became impoverished after IBM moved production to Armonk. Is there any place we’d associate less with blue collars than Silicon Valley? “Death by Design” reveals that the men and women who live in $2 million homes were not spared as well. Until it became the software capital of the USA, Silicon Valley produced hardware just like Endicott and with the same disastrous results. In the 1980s, most desktop computers were being produced there except for Dell. Like IBM in Endicott, the manufacturers left behind a gigantic plume of carcinogenic chemicals. And just like in Endicott, IBM brought along its bad profit-maximizing habits to San Jose where Big Blue and Fairchild Electronics constituted the largest companies in the area. They built storage tanks for their waste products but as tends to happen with powerful solvents, they broke through the walls of the containers and leaked into the groundwater. In Silicon Valley, residents blamed the giants for an epidemic of birth defects but as is the case with cancer, determining an exact cause-and-effect is difficult to prove especially when you are dealing with companies that have a battery of high-powered lawyers with Harvard degrees. Marxist economist David Harvey was responsible for a major theoretical breakthrough that helps us understand how capitalism has such a knack for survival. When contradictions begin to mount in a country like the USA, where people feel entitled to clean air and water, the system can displace its ills geographically especially to places like China that has turned into the toxic waste capital of the world. “Death by Design” introduces us to a nation that has made a devil’s bargain with its population. In exchange for a rising standard of living, it asks its wage slaves to endure the same carcinogens that the people of Endicott and Silicon Valley would not put up with. But unlike the American toxic sites, the Chinese suffer double jeopardy. Not only do they have to put up with solvents leeching into their rivers and lakes, they suffer deadly air pollution that is the result of the unregulated elimination of the smart phones, tablets and laptops that you replace so frequently as the consequence of planned obsolescence. Apple is particularly cagey about the way it forces “great” new versions of the iPhone on you. It uses non-standard screws on the casing so unless you have a special screwdriver, you are practically forced to buy a new model, which Apple deviously designed to have a life-span about the same as the battery. China is now the “e-waste” capital of the world. While some of the discarded electronics sent to China is recycled, much of it goes up in smoke. Since this is China, there are no regulations about incineration procedures. The film shows men and women tossing circuit boards into a bonfire without any regard to what the ashes might do to them or people living nearby—or for that matter the rest of the planet Earth. Since the metals, including lead, that go into an electronic device cannot be destroyed (they are elements, after all), all you can do is transform them into tiny air-born particulates that can not only seep into China’s waters but ascend into the sky and travel across the Pacific floating in a cloud. The film shows a California biologist in a plane filled with electronic instruments that can determine the make-up of a cumulus cloud. She tells us that the clouds amount to fluffy, picturesque bundles of carcinogens. To some extent, my interest in cancer has much to do with working as a database administrator at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in the mid-1980s. Seeing 5-year old kids walking around with a chemotherapy bottle attached to their arm really has a way of concentrating your mind. In the half-dozen or so books I have read about the science of cancer over the years, I was left with the conclusion that making a direct connection between the environment and the disease is not easy. That is why, for example, it took over a decade for the court case against IBM in Endicott to be decided in favor of the victims. However, it is much easier to connect the dots when it comes to on-the-job casualties. The most obvious cases are the young chimney sweeps in London who came down with testicular cancer in the Victorian era or the mostly women workers who got cancer after applying radium to luminous watch dials in the early 20th century. It is also an open-and-shut case when it comes to the Chinese workers at Foxconn and other subcontractors to Apple who came down with leukemia after using solvents such as benzene and n-hexane to clean the glass covers of iPhones. “Complicit”, which will be seen on June 12th and June 17th as part of the annual Human Rights Festival in New York (details are here), is focused on these victims that after contracting leukemia decided to become activists determined to make Foxconn, Apple and other multinationals pay for their abuses and change the way they produce the consumer goods that are so seductive to consumers worldwide. Since wages constitute about one percent of an iPhone’s cost, you’d think that this would be no big deal—that is until you run into someone like Terry Gou, the CEO of Foxconn. With ample support from the ruling Communist Party, Gou denounces protesters gathered in front of his plant, including those who have been enduring lengthy stays in the hospital for leukemia treatments, relying on the cops to spirit away the riffraff. Most of the workers who end up working at Foxconn and other high-technology subcontractors are migrant workers from China’s impoverished farmlands. While they were willing to work at a breakneck pace up to seven days a week for minimal wages (to the point that some were driven to suicide), they had not bargained on coming down with leukemia when they were only in their early 20s. Benzene had long ago been banned in American factories but that did not get in Terry Gou’s way. To make a case against him, labor activists began to subpoena medical records from the plant, photograph chemical storage in the plants, and use picket lines to put pressure on the company. The labor activists profiled in “Complicit” had no idea what risks they were taking when they were trained to use an unnamed solvent to clean a product. Long Li, the 18-year-old daughter of peasant farmers from Guizhou who was disfigured from a kerosene lamp accident when very young, was excited when she first came to Guangdong province, where most of China’s electronic goods are made. The tall buildings, the sense of independence, and the money she earned at work that could help keep her parents fed and clothed, made her feel elated. She was told by her boss to dip her rubber-gloved right index finger into a solvent and then rub each cell phone screen for 10 to 20 seconds on the assembly line. She was issued a paper mask, but rarely used it because they were too hot. Long worked from 8 am until 11 pm, and as late as 4 am in the busy season. Unlike those exposed to benzene, Long Li worked with n-hexane that produced neurological damage rather than leukemia. While it might not have killed her, it disabled her and made it impossible for her to continue working to help out her parents. At some point, she became an activist working with Yi Yeting, a former Foxconn employee who despite being ill with leukemia devoted every hour to exposing China’s cruel, profit-driven manufacturers. Yi was 24 when he went to work for Foxconn and like Long Li came from a poverty-stricken rural village. Despite the tendency of leukemia to rob people of their energy, Yi became a tireless defender of workers’ rights. All of the subjects in “Complicit” and their families are the people who the Chinese revolution was made for. Like the peasants who sacrificed their lives fighting to liberate China from the KMT and the landlords they served, they are now on the front lines of a new battle to transform China into the world’s leading capitalist power. For some on the left, the emergence of the BRICS and China’s ability to confront Western hegemony has been viewed as a major anti-imperialist advance. Furthermore, Xi Jinping has received accolades for supposedly returning to Maoist principles. For example, Workers World Party leader Fred Goldstein wrote an article titled “Behind Xi Jinping’s call for a return to Marxism” that took note of a trip Xi made to Guangdong Province not long after becoming the head of state. There he spoke to fellow Communists about the dangers of a Gorbachev-type development in China. Goldstein reported that “He spoke in dire terms about how the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was overthrown and socialism completely destroyed. The long-term fate of the party is undoubtedly a deep concern of Xi and his collaborators.” Xi’s visit to Guangdong province is highly symbolic. This is the center of Chinese manufacturing that took off after Deng Xiaoping’s “liberalization” of the Chinese economy. For Goldstein and others who think like him, China has a dual character. It is both capitalist and socialist, perhaps bearing similarities to the NEP in the Soviet Union. Wasn’t it possible that the opening up of Guangdong to foreign investment was necessary for China to accumulate the capital that would allow for domestic development? But Goldstein worries that unlike the Soviet Union, China has gone far too long putting up with a capitalist sector. He doubts that Xi is capable of resolving the contradiction in favor of socialism but at least credits him with putting the brakes on the worst elements of the capitalist sector who are likely the sort that allowed benzene and n-hexane to be used in their factories—at least one hopes so. There is an assumption underlying the thinking of people like Fred Goldstein that must be addressed. Is socialism only about providing the necessities of life? Under Mao Zedong, there was an “iron rice bowl” that referred to a guaranteed lifetime job and benefits. Much of that has been whittled away during the post-Mao period but it is still worth asking if that was what Karl Marx had in mind when he wrote about the need for socialism. When I began working as a programmer at Met Life in 1968, they used to call the insurance company “Ma Met”. Like “Ma Bell”, it was a place that provided lifetime job security and great benefits. Lunch was free and the health plan would not be regarded as a “Cadillac” plan today. It would be seen as a “Rolls Royce” plan. My first manager once told me that as long as I didn’t keep a bottle of whiskey in my desk, I’d never have to worry about losing my job. Indeed, after the FBI sent an anonymous postcard to my workplace naming me as a commie, the top boss of my division called me into his office to tell me that if I ever got such a postcard in the future, he’d make sure that the person who sent it would be fired. If he only knew that J. Edgar Hoover authorized the postcard as part of Cointelpro, he might not have made such a promise since Hoover’s job security was even greater than mine. Was this socialism? This is not such a far-fetched question since so much of the left today believes that electing Bernie Sanders would have moved us closer to “socialism”, which really boiled down to turning back the clock to the 1950s when American industry was still operating within a New Deal context. I have a rather old-fashioned, if not quaint, idea of what socialism amounts to. It is a system that not only abolishes private property; it also prevents bureaucrats from exercising power over our daily lives. Unless you have the right to speak your mind and fight for your beliefs without fear of being sent to jail like the worker-activists suffering from leukemia in “Complicit”, then find some other word to describe the system. Despite being accused of having helped to turn Marxism into a secular religion, I continue to regard Frederick Engels as second to none—including Marx—in articulating the total freedom possible under a classless society. For Engels, the provision of food, housing and medical care is not the same thing as socialism. Instead, as he pointed out in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, it is the total transformation of society that will allow us to enjoy true freedom for the first time in human history: The socialized appropriation of the means of production does away, not only with the present artificial restrictions upon production, but also with the positive waste and devastation of productive forces and products that are at the present time the inevitable concomitants of production, and that reach their height in the crises. Further, it sets free for the community at large a mass of means of production and of products, by doing away with the senseless extravagance of the ruling classes of today, and their political representatives. The possibility of securing for every member of society, by means of socialized production, an existence not only fully sufficient materially, and becoming day-by-day more full, but an existence guaranteeing to all the free development and exercise of their physical and mental faculties — this possibility is now, for the first time, here, but it is here.

According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling. Apple’s bunkering down and preparing for a war with a vitally important component supplier; let’s just hope iPhone customers don’t get caught in the crossfire.

The motivational speaker Zig Ziglar said it best when he theorized that, “People don't buy for logical reasons. They buy for emotional reasons.” Numerous studies have backed up Ziglar’s hypothesis, finding that positive emotions about a brand build greater consumer loyalty than a consumer’s rational reasoning or a brand’s tangible attributes. This theory can be observed in practice by looking at some of the most popular commercial brands. Consumer powerhouses like Apple, Amazon and Nike have succeeded in eliciting specific emotions. According to Apple, 99% of customers love the iPhone. But consumers rarely feel such strong emotions for their financial institution. Bloomberg News Apple, one of the most recognizable brands in the world, speaks to customers’ yearning for a stylish lifestyle, imagination, innovation and power through technology. If you think about the iPod, for example, its practical outcome was not much different than a personal CD or tape player, but consumers wanted it because of its innovative technology and pleasing design. The iconic company builds upon this image to create strong relationships and a sense of community with consumers of all ages who are extremely loyal, and in most cases, purchase their technology just for the brand name. According to Apple, 99% of Apple customers love the iPhone — that’s impressive. Nike was able to tap into a similar tendency with athletic shoe brands such as the Air Jordan. Was it a better basketball shoe than that of competing brands? It didn’t matter. The marketing campaign led by commercials featuring Michael Jordan made a powerful connection: When a young baller received new Air Jordans, the feeling was electric. Amazon has been able to engage consumers in a similar way with well-designed products that elicit a sense of wonder, while the online shopping site’s quick delivery service taps into people’s yearning for instant gratification. Equally impressive (or unimpressive, rather) is that, in more than a decade of conducting consumer research, I have rarely encountered respondents that professed love for their financial institution. A checking account, CD or credit card just doesn’t have the same emotional effect. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Most consumers think of their banking relationship as purely transactional. Yet banks have an opportunity to change the dialogue and provide more value-added services and custom-tailored offerings to engender longer-term loyalty. These bespoke services will allow individuals to think of their bank as more of a partner and less as a place to park money. For younger consumers, banks must forge this relationship sooner rather than later or risk losing the client, since millennials have a higher rate of switching banks than other groups. Consumers’ lives are filled with significant events, which all tend to have financial ramifications. Some are momentous and others are mundane. Some are jubilant and others are less so. People are often hit with unpredictable and complicated situations. The life events with a financial connection range from weddings to unexpected health bills to a home’s heating system breaking down in winter, to many others. Connecting on an emotional level before, during, and after each of these events will allow banks to engage on a different level and create deeper connections with their customers who are dealing with sensitive matters. The financial decisions made during these critical events could have a significant impact on the financial lifestyle someone lives. Banks can help consumers prepare their financial plan in advance of life events that are not always predictable. This can mitigate consumers’ worry and stress. Influencing consumers’ emotional reaction in a positive way has the propensity to enhance relationship building and retention efforts. Not only in the midst of significant events, but also in everyday life, bankers can make greater attempts at inviting customers to have a deeper dialogue to learn what keeps them up at night. Bankers can also take their cue from the reason why a customer is seeking help from a financial institution to engage in a more personal back-and-forth. For example, a client comes into a branch or reaches out to a call center to open a joint account or change their last name. This is a cue to talk about the client’s wedding. A banker can then inform the customer about the array of products useful to married couples. This brief encounter can enable a more human connection, promote an emotional response, and deepen a new or existing relationship. Other cues include signs that indicate a home purchase, a death in the family (someone seeking to close the account for a parent or grandparent), or a serious medical issue. Frequent follow-ups with the customer following the initial interaction could also help establish a stronger emotional connection. Listening to customers more closely along their financial journey will be critical for moving forward if they want to build lasting brands. Having an emotional connection will strengthen the commitment on both sides and create stronger financial lives for consumers and stronger financial institutions.

Tim Cook said as much on Thursday in a tweet and company-wide memo after Trump made the withdrawal official. Don't Miss: Aerospace exec says aliens not only exist, they’re living on Earth right now The United States is now in a select company of countries who do not support the Paris accord. Nicaragua and Syria are the only two countries that did not ratify it. One of them pledged to fight climate change on its own and did not sign the agreement because it’s not punishing countries who do not play by the rules, while the other is still in a state of Civil War. Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 “Decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was wrong for our planet,” Cook said in a tweet. “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” He then followed up with an email to Apple employees in which he explained that he tried to convince Trump on Tuesday to keep the US in the agreement, “but it wasn’t enough.” Cook also said in the email that Apple will not stop fighting climate change regardless of Trump’s decision. “Climate change is real, and we all share a responsibility to fight it,” Cook wrote. “I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.” Apple is hardly the only tech company strongly opposing Trump on this particular matter. Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Salesforce and Tesla are just a few of them. Cook’s full memo follows below, as obtained by BuzzFeed. Team, I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough. Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well. We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet’s future. Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.

Such is the case with the Amazon Echo, a class-defining smart speaker that Apple reportedly plans to rip off next week when it unveils a new Siri-enabled smart speaker during WWDC 2017. The main problem with the idea of a Siri speaker is Siri, to put it bluntly. We won’t know anything for certain until next week, but the wiser move is like to go with Amazon’s tried and true Alexa speakers over anything powered by Siri.

Written by Alan Dunn June 02, 2017 Time to get more creative. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot) Share Written by Alan Dunn June 02, 2017 The world is nearly out of good “.com” domain names—and even the fourth circuit of the United States Court of Appeals agrees. As global internet usage rises, .com naming is going to get more and more complicated. Our languages only contain a finite number of meaningful words, so brand naming is becoming much more than coming up with a unique, snazzy moniker—it also involves knowledge of intellectual property rights, law, and a large of dash of luck. Many well-known brands have encountered challenges securing their preferred domain names. For example, Google renamed their parent company “Alphabet,” but it doesn’t own alphabet.com—BMW does. In 2014, Microsoft spent $2.5 billion to acquire Mojang, the Swedish company behind the popular Minecraft video game, but it didn’t get the domain name minecraft.com with it—that belongs to an Australia mining-engineering company, MineCraft Consulting PTY Ltd. (Oh yeah—that Minecraft.) Meanwhile, Nissan has spent over 20 years trying to acquire nissan.com from a man named Uzi Nissan, and it took Apple 16 years to acquire apple.co.uk from a British company called Apple Illustrations. Acronyms get even messier. Governmental organizations such as CIA.com, NSA.com, FBI.com, Mossad.com, and Mi6.com are all owned by private individuals and companies. A Google search for BOA (an acronym often used by Bank of America) may show a page covered in Bank of America listings, but a visit to BOA.com will rattle anybody with a fear of snakes. ABBA.com is not the Swedish group, but an acronym for the American Bed and Breakfast Association; DND.com isn’t owned by Dungeons and Dragons; and MOFO.com is actually safe to view at work. (It’s owned by the law firm, Morrison & Foerster). First come, first served So why don’t the big guys pull rank when it comes to owning their digital properties as well as their marketplace? That’s because most domain-name registries operate on a simple first-come, first-served rule for reservations and registrations. While this model is likely the only fair way to service a broad community, it has its drawbacks. Take Tesla, for example. Most people know of Elon Musk’s company, but fewer people know it was named after Nikola Tesla, the renowned Serbian inventor. As Tesla isn’t a word created for a brand—such as Jeep, Chapstick, or Jacuzzi—it’s more likely to be adopted by others who share the same appreciation for the original inventor. For example, Tesla Tecnologia e Comunicação owns tesla.com.br (Brazil), TESLA MR Scanning operates owns tesla.dk (Denmark), Tesla CRM Software GmbH owns tesla.de (Germany), and The Tesla Company owns tesla.gr (Greece). In theory, all of these owners have just as much right to a primary Tesla domain name as the others.  ABBA.com is not the Swedish group, DND.com isn’t owned by Dungeons and Dragons, and MOFO.com is actually safe to view at work. Some brands have been able to acquire their preferred domain names through cash or creative equity deals, such as Uber, which agreed to trade 2% of the company’s shares to Universal Music for the domain name uber.com, or Slack, which paid $60,000 for the domain name slack.com. Others will opt for less-friendly methods such as litigation or filing a Uniform Dispute Resolution Process (UDRP). The latter involves a great risk in the case of a loss, including almost always a higher cost. Domain names are a critical part of a company’s infrastructure, so it’s important for them to fight for them: Not only are they the storefront for a brand’s image online, but they also play a crucial role in everything from email to e-commerce. Many of today’s greatest companies even employ “global domain-name managers” who often have years of trademark and IP experience. Let’s say you spend tens of thousands of dollars (and portion of your sanity) on securing your desired domain name—then what about wrestling back the attached social-media handles? The real @SlimShady It’s hard to say who the real Slim Shady is, since @slimshady hasn’t tweeted since opening his account in 2007. Like domain names, social handles also operate on a first-come, first-served basis, causing very similar confusion throughout social platforms. For example, when Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election, Mike Pence also won his slot as vice president. Another winner was a Florida man whose name did not appear on a ballot—he describes himself as a “software developer, grandpa and nature lover. Not a Christo-fascist politician.” He is also named Mike Pence, and he happens to operate the @mikepence Twitter handle. I'm Mike Pence. No, not that one. https://t.co/JFtzxn197W — Mike Pence (@mikepence) December 12, 2016 I tried to see if Twitter co-founder @jackdorsey had anything to say about this, but I quickly realized that attempt might be futile. In fact, a whole bunch of tech leaders’ Twitter handles look a whole lot different than their real world counterparts. If the CEO of Twitter doesn’t have control over his own name’s Twitter handle, what hope do the rest of us have? (Twitter screenshot) And it’s just not personal names, either. Brands are subject to others using their preferred handles with almost no recourse. (Twitter screenshot) Social handles are often more challenging to acquire than domain names as there are fewer resolution methods available for an acquisition. Buying a social handle can be tricky, and selling a Twitter handle is actually against Twitter’s rules. For the most part, any decision to release or transfer a handle is left in the hands of the social handle’s owner. Some people, like Haje Jan Kamps, have used trademark law to find creative ways to acquire their handle for the cost of an application fee. However, successful attempts are few and far between. The future of .com To counteract these challenges, brands have started investing in branded digital-naming solutions for the future.  New domain name extensions like .club and .link have shown good success—while others like .bible and .rodeo are still trying to find a wider following. In 2014, ICANN—the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees primary DNS and IP regulation, maintenance, and co-ordination for the internet—introduced a series of new, generic, top-level domain names (gTLDs). This added more options to an ever-shrinking pool of quality .com domain names. New domain name extensions like .club and .link have shown good success with respect to new registrations—while others like .bible and .rodeo are still trying to find a wider following. But this last round of new gTLD applications also saw over 600 brands spend more than a collective $100 million on application fees alone for brand-related domain name extensions. Nike now owns .nike, BMW owns .bmw, and McDonald’s even owns .mcdonalds, which is a full 180-degree turn from 1994, when Joshua Quittner tried to get the ubiquitous restaurant chain to acquire McDonalds.com. “The thing about domain names is that they have become a precious commodity in their own right,” says David Taylor, a partner at Hogan Lovells and domain-name panellist for the World Intellectual Property Organization. “The opportunity provided by the ICANN new gTLD program has enabled many brands to move to the right of the dot, with a .brand. Given the application fee was $185,000, these are relatively costly domain names, but it’s often a cheaper option to paying large sums out to acquire a pre-registered and lovingly owned .com domain name that is being used for a genuine business or activity.” Over the next few years, we may see the face of the internet change as more brands shift to using branded extensions. Barclay’s, Canon, and BNP Paribas are already early adopters who have made the move, taking control over everything to the left of the dot. When a brand owns an entire extension and can actually control who can register, it puts a lot more power in their hands. Applications for new gTLDs have now closed, but it shouldn’t be too long until ICANN opens up the opportunity for more branded domain names once more. In the meantime, people will continue to call Minecraft Australia for game support, tag @mikepence in their political discussions, and question whether or not Paul Ryan is selling guitars on the side.

The information you need to start your day, including top headlines from PaymentsSource and around the Web: $100 billion store: Developers have earned more than $70 billion through Apple's App Store in the nine years since its launch, reports Engadget, which computes users have spend more than $100 billion in the App Store given Apple's usual 70/30 split with developers. There's been a notable spike in the past year of 70% with photo and video apps approaching a 90% growth rate. Engadget attributes this growth to improvements in Apple's camera quality and the increase in people's appetite for photo sharing. Paid app subscriptions are up 58% over the past year, following a change in how Apple shares revenue from subscription payments. After keeping the first year at a 70/30 split, Apple's cut drops to 15%. Engadget reports video apps may soon be subject to the 85/15 split from year one if the developers' apps are integrated with Apple TV. Over the years, the App Store has gradually supported more diverse payment options such as UnionPay and bitcoin to broaden its reach. The announcement comes ahead of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, which starts Monday. Bloomberg News Stripe's analysis: E-commerce technology company Stripe has drawn considerable investment, giving it lots of options to expand its range of merchant services. Late Thursday it launched Sigma, an analytics tool that allows businesses to avoid downloading data from Stripe for independent analysis. Sigma will be available on Stripe's dashboard, giving businesses access to instant data without technology work or maintenance. And like most of Stripe's products, it's designed for people who don't have a lot of programming knowledge. Sigma also offers templates that enable businesses to spot unpaid invoices, recurring revenue or average revenue per user. Speaking with TechCrunch, Stripe cofounder Patrick Collison said Sigma is similar to Radar, a fraud prevention program that uses internal Stripe resources and data. OneLogin's breach may hurt downstream: Identity management software company OneLogin has suffered a data breach that may have compromised customer data, including encrypted data, reports Gizmodo. OneLogin has acknowledged the breach, though it's offering more details to customers than to the general public, according to the technology website. Gizmodo also reports the company is advising mass password resets, suggesting basic login credentials are at risk. OneLogin specializes in identity security for large companies and counts Pinterest among its clients. Given the propensity for people to reuse passwords for different relationships, stolen passwords for widely used file sharing sites such as Pinterest could also potentially impact retailer or payment sites. Mexico City Metro: Mastercard has already participated in transit ticketing technology projects in Singapore and London, and is adding Mexico City to the list. Mastercard will work with bank partners to launch a debit card that can be used to for transit payments, retail purchases and potentially social disbursements. One of the most immediate impacts should be easier payments on Mexico City's transit system, which carries about 5.5 million travelers each day on buses and heavy rail. There are also about 9 million trips each day on smaller bus routes that only accept cash today. Mastercard plans to develop additional products that target small businesses in Mexico City, according to a release from the card network. From the Web LG launches a mobile payment service in Korea TechCrunch | Fri Jun 2, 2017 - LG announced plans for its own mobile payment service way back in November 2015, and today it finally went official with the launch. The LG Pay service is initially limited to the G6, LG’s flagship smartphone, via a software update, but it is only available in Korea. There is launch support for cards from Shinhan Bank, KB, BC and Lotte, and LG plans to cover all of Korea’s card companies by September. China Postal Authority Calls for End to Data Spat Between Alibaba Unit, SF Holdings U.S. News & World Report | Fri Jun 2, 2017 - China's postal authority has asked SF Holding Co and Alibaba Holding Group Ltd's logistics unit, two of the nation's top logistics players, to end a spat that disrupted deliveries when the two firms abruptly cut ties on Thursday. Why Bitcoin Needs Washington to Go Mainstream Fortune | Thu Jun 1, 2017 - It’s not hard to see why this technology is exciting the world of payments. Traditionally we’ve had to rely on intermediaries like PayPal to maintain a database of account balances and transactions in order to send money online. In Bitcoin that database is maintained by thousands of nodes in an open network and constantly validated by the work of countless miners. Suddenly you don’t need to trust PayPal anymore. Since there is no intermediary, Bitcoin works a lot like cash, but online.

Citi, PayPal defy notion that vets unfit for disruptive tech jobs On the face of it, the cultures of Silicon Valley and the U.S. military couldn’t be further apart. Stereotypical techies are slouchy, decidedly casual and resistant to order. They are the opposite of the well groomed, formal and fiercely disciplined picture of a veteran.

It stands out in a campus of gleaming glass and concrete structures where even the door handles are custom designed.

Here's a good picture from a recent drone flyover video filmed by Matthew Roberts.  It turns out, the historic "Glendenning Barn" was on the land first, and after a former Cupertino mayor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook what the company planned to do with the barn in the early stages of construction, Apple carefully took it apart and put it back together, just the way it was constructed before.  The Glendenning barn, built in 1916, had previously survived several changes of ownership, as the land around it transformed from farmland owned by the Glendenning family, to orchards, to an HP office park, and now, to Apple's new headquarters.   The barn wasn't specifically protected by local law, but the Cupertino Historical Society tried to save it, and it was beloved by the site's previous owners, HP, which used it as a gathering place for beer bashes and picnics. "I’m anxious to one day see it again," Ed Miller, a former HP manager, told the Mercury News.  Apple will store sports equipment and landscaping supplies in the barn. But its value to Apple is more as a little piece of history that shows how Silicon Valley has changed. An environmental impact report commissioned by Apple in 2013 gives the full backstory of the land that Apple's "spaceship" campus now sits on:  The project site was occupied by Robert and Margaret Howie Glendenning beginning in the 1850s. The Glendennings, originally from Scotland, were one of the first European-Americans to homestead in Cupertino. In 1851, the couple began farming 160 acres of land, living initially in a tent on the land. After building a house and planting crops, the owners of the Alviso Land Grant laid claim to the property, and the Glendennings were compelled to purchase the land at $30 an acre. Margaret Glendenning finished the land payments upon the death of her husband in 1868.  By 1884, when Robert and Margaret’s children had come of legal age, the Glendenning property was divided among the family. Margaret Howie lived on the southern half of the property and the northern half was divided amongst the six Glendenning children: Mary, Margaret C. (Caroline), Ellen (Ella), Joe, Jim, and George. In 1888, approximately 60 acres of the property contained orchards and the remaining portion was utilized for grain and hay production. Margaret Howie had a house built on her property in 1889, where she lived with her daughters, Margaret C. Burrell and Ellen Glendenning. In 1914, Margaret Burrell obtained her mother’s parcel and her daughter and son-in-law, Grace and John Leonard, purchased the land. Leonard converted 48 acres of the property from dry-farming (hay and grain production) to irrigated orchards. It is thought that John Leonard built the Glendenning Barn around this time. The Leonards established a dehydrating and packing business on the property.  In 1964, Varian Associates purchased the Glendenning property from John Leonard and his son, Burrel. The Glendenning parcel was one of several family properties, including the Lester, Craft, and Orlando families, to be purchased by Varian. The Varian lands were pooled into the VALLCO land corporation, the name of which was derived from the first names of the principal parties involved in the sale. The Glendenning-Leonard acreages were the key parcels to be incorporated into VALLCO Park and became the site of the Varian building, the first constructed in the park. VALLCO continued minimal farming operations into the 1970s, but a master plan and associated development phased out farming. VALLCO sold 46 acres to Hewlett-Packard in 1968, followed by another 50 acres in 1971. Aerial photographs from the 1980s show the barn, pump house, and windmill tower, but the Glendenning house built for Margaret Howie Glendenning, Margaret Burrell, and Ellen Glendenning was demolished in the early 1970s.16 The Hewlett-Packard and Ridgeview campuses were constructed in phases from the mid-1960s to late 1980s. Hewlett-Packard sold the 98-acre office park in November 2010 to Apple as part of its plan to consolidate employees at its Palo Alto campus. The property is just north of a 50-acre site Apple bought in 2006 and east of the main Apple campus. The properties purchased by Apple in 2006 and 2010 are part of the project site.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Report: Intel Corporation Could Benefit From the Spat Between Qualcomm, Inc. and Apple Inc. This chipmaker could see an increase in its cellular-modem shipments due to increasing animosity between Apple and its primary cellular-modem supplier. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 7:30AM A fresh report from DigiTimes says that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently sources 30% of the cellular modems used in the iPhone 7-series devices from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with the remaining 70% coming from longtime iPhone supplier, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Losing a portion of Apple's iPhone cellular modem orders certainly impacted Qualcomm's financial performance, as well as, arguably, the perception of the value of Qualcomm's technology. Previously, only Qualcomm built stand-alone models that could meet Apple's iPhone needs, but with Apple's use of Intel modems in its flagship smartphones, that perceived value may have lessened among investors. Image source: Apple. Per DigiTimes, because of the increasingly bitter litigation between Qualcomm and Apple, Intel is expected to see its iPhone modem allocation as a percentage of Apple's total flagship iPhone shipments increase over time. "Apple's outsourcing proportion to Intel for the next-generation iPhone baseband chips has risen to about 50% for orders running through the end of 2017," DigiTimes says. It will get worse for Qualcomm and better for Intel if DigiTimes' reporting is accurate. The report says that Apple is "likely to shift even more baseband chip orders away from Qualcomm with Intel to supply over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018." Good thing Intel's XMM 7560 supports CDMA One of the key factors that will enable Intel to potentially capture the bulk of Apple's iPhone modem orders is that its upcoming cellular modem, known as the XMM 7560, is expected to support the CDMA standard, a feature that's lacking in the company's current XMM 7360 (used in the iPhone 7-series) and the upcoming XMM 7480 (likely to be used in this year's iPhone models). With CDMA support, iPhones incorporating Intel's modems will be usable on CDMA-capable networks like Verizon and Sprint, as well as on the GSM-capable networks that the current Intel-based iPhone models support. In other words, iPhones with Qualcomm and Intel models would be, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable. However, Apple doesn't gain this flexibility -- and Intel doesn't enjoy this potential opportunity -- until the product cycle after the coming iPhone 7s/8 cycle. What this could mean for all parties involved Obviously, the loss of additional share at Apple would sting Qualcomm's chip business. Now, it wasn't the end of the world for said business when Qualcomm lost that initial part of Apple's modem orders to Intel, and it certainly wouldn't be the end of the world for Qualcomm to lose additional share here. Remember that Qualcomm sells mobile applications processors, often with additional support chips, to a wide range of customers, and Apple is just one customer -- albeit a reasonably large one. For Intel, the impact of additional share gains at Apple would be a boost to its relatively small wireless chip business, which is just one small part of the company's overall Client Computing Group, or CCG, business. The impact to said wireless business would be large, and it would give Intel additional incentive to continue to develop cellular modem technologies, but the impact to the company's overall revenue and profits would be quite small -- as was the impact of the initial Apple modem revenues to Intel's business. Finally, Apple would further lessen its dependence on Qualcomm, with whom it's in a bitter legal battle. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

On Monday, Apple will kick off this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference with a keynote presentation where, like every year, the company’s top executives will take the stage to talk about their next big releases. Traditionally, WWDC has been a software show, with a heavy focus on iOS and macOS (and, recently, tvOS and watchOS as well). But this year, there have been rumblings that we should expect some hardware news too — including at least one brand new product — which could make the event even more interesting than usual. The keynote starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on June 5th. The Verge will be reporting live from San Jose, so be sure to come back then for all the news. For now, here’s our guide on what to expect on Monday. There haven’t been a ton of leaks this year, so while we have some ideas of what Apple’s planning, there should still be plenty of surprises in store. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge Software Here’s something we can expect in pretty good confidence: Apple will announce the next iterations of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. All four of Apple’s big platforms are on yearly release cycles, with announcements in June, developer previews shortly thereafter, and public releases in the fall. This year shouldn’t be any different. But what should we expect from each of them? That’s where it gets a bit trickier. iOS design updates: Bloomberg reported last month that iOS 11 would have “an updated user interface,” though it didn’t offer any details beyond that. One possibility: Apple appears to be working on a “dark mode” for the entire operating system, which changes most backgrounds from white to black. That wouldn’t just be for visual flair. If Apple introduces an OLED iPhone, as it’s rumored to this fall, a dark mode would save battery by letting the screen keep more pixels turned off — much like what the Apple Watch does. More stylus support: Bloomberg also said we may see updates for the iPad based around the Pencil. Apple might update its apps, like Mail and Safari, to allow the stylus to be used for annotations. It could even go further, mimicking the kind of mark up anything-and-everything abilities that Samsung has given its S Pen styluses. The iPad’s multitasking features need to get more pro Pro iPad features: There’s a lot Apple can do to improve the iPad’s multitasking to really offer a pro experience on the iPad Pro; a native version of this this drag-and-drop feature would be a good start. I’m also strongly hoping this is the year we finally see support for multiple user accounts — it’s a frustrating omission, but Apple began laying the groundwork for the feature last year. Lots of app updates: Apple’s other big story is likely to be app upgrades — looking back to last year, some of iOS’s biggest changes came through apps like iMessage and Photos. It’d be surprising not to see Apple continue that push this year, especially with how successful its changes to iMessage have been. A way to pay your friends: A recent Recode report says Apple has been weighing a peer-to-peer payments service that would compete with the likes of Venmo and Square Cash, but it’s unclear whether that would be a feature of Apple Pay or whether it would exist as a cash-exchange feature in iMessage (or both). Something to watch in Apple Music: Apple is typically dead quiet when it comes to what it’s working on. Jimmy Iovine, however, is another story. And it seems like Iovine may have let it slip to Bloomberg that Apple Music will be reworked this year to better feature video. That’s good timing, since Apple’s first original shows are coming out soon. Carpool Karaoke arrives August 8th, and we may hear about Planet of the Apps on Monday. Siri gets smarter: Apple’s digital assistant has been getting one-upped and lapped and probably three other equivalent sports metaphors in the past couple years. If Apple wants to take on the Amazon Echoes and Google Homes of the world — and it sure sounds like it does — Siri is going to need to do a better jobs of connecting to third party apps and surfacing information for you. It seems likely Apple will start to make more of that happen this year. Small and steady updates to the Mac Small changes to macOS: Apple hasn’t made big changes to macOS in years (aside from its name), but it’ll certainly keep polishing away and adding new features here and there, with many likely inside Apple-made apps like Mail. Siri was introduced last year, and it could get more powerful this year — last year, it was missing third-party support. Improvements to watchOS and tvOS: Apple’s two youngest operating systems have been getting very useful and occasionally dramatic changes year to year. There’s no word on what to expect this time around, but it’d be a surprise if we didn’t see Apple keep iterating on the basic experience of using both operating systems. WatchOS still needs work on how it displays apps, and Apple is still figuring out how rework the classic TV guide with tvOS. In an interview with The Verge in February, Apple TV executive Eddy Cue suggested that the future of web TV would be much more “interactive,” so it’s possible that any software changes could allow app developers to create more interactive apps. And according to a recent report from BuzzFeed News, Amazon Prime Video will finally run on Apple TV, something that Apple TV users have been wanting for years. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Hardware Apple talks hardware every now and then during WWDC, and it seems like 2017 is going to be one of those years. Potentially, a big one. Siri speaker: Apple’s answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home may well be announced on Monday. What’ll it do? What’ll it look like? Pretty much all of that is speculation for now — there’s even disagreement over whether or not it’ll have a screen. The speaker is one reason to expect updates to Siri this year, as you can bet that Apple will want to let app developers take advantage of this new device. (It’s unveiling the product at a developer conference, after all.) You can imagine Apple adopting a similar model to how it distributes apps for watchOS, where developers can build Siri features into their core mobile app. Apple will want to step up Siri’s game to take on Alexa There are a few basic details we do know so far. Bloomberg said recently that Apple has started manufacturing the speaker and that it’ll feature “virtual surround sound” to provide better audio quality. It’ll also function as a hub for HomeKit, Apple’s smart home system. That’s likely to be a highlight for the product. It’s not clear if Apple has any big features up its sleeve that make its smart speaker stand out from the competition. But tight integration with Apple’s ecosystem of products may be enough. If you already have an iPhone, Apple’s upcoming product may be the easiest smart speaker to get started with. A new iPad size: This one seems a little bit less certain, but the reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple’s been working on a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and will likely introduce it at WWDC. The new model is supposed to be about the same size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it’ll be able to fit a larger screen by narrowing down the device’s bezels. WWDC would be unusual timing for an iPad Pro launch, but Apple released a surprise update of the standard iPad in March, so perhaps it’s just putting them out as they come. Updated MacBooks and MacBook Pros: Nothing major here, but it’s time for Apple’s laptops to get some spec bumps. Intel has a new line of processors out — Kaby Lake — and Apple should update its laptops to support them, offering a little bit more power and little bit more battery life. There’s also rumors that the MacBook Pro could get an option for more RAM, though that might still be down the road. Not quite the Air update we were looking for A depressing update for the MacBook Air: It’s been two years since Apple updated the MacBook Air, and it certainly looks like the company would happily watch its former star wither away and die. But apparently, sales have remained strong — it’s Apple’s only laptop under $1,000 — and Bloomberg reports that it’s likely to receive an update to include Kaby Lake processors, too. That won’t do much to modernize the laptop — the Air’s screen, in particular, is now low-resolution and outdated — but it’ll justify the laptop staying around and provide a bit more value for anyone who’s still interested. There’s been some suggestion the Air could get updated to USB-C too, but that’d require more work on Apple’s part, so it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see everything but the processor stay the same. What we (probably) won’t see: iPhones are off the table. iMacs could use new processors, but there’s no word on that yet. And while Apple has promised a new Mac Pro, that likely isn’t arriving until at least next year. It’s always possible Apple will talk about its plans for a new pro machine, but a release is a long ways out. The Apple Watch will likely be updated this fall; and while a 4K Apple TV is said to be in the works, there’s no sign it’s coming this month.

Here are the new features coming to an Apple Watch near you by Karen Haslam | 02 Jun 17 Apple is expected to launch a new Apple Watch later this year (which you can read about here: Apple Watch 3 rumours), but the company will also update the watchOS operating system software, bringing new features to existing Apple Watch models. We expect to get our first look at watchOS 4 at WWDC 2017 on 5 June, with Apple previewing some of the new features there. Read on to find out what can we expect to see. Thinking of buying an Apple Watch? Read our Apple Watch buying guide 2017 and take a look at our guide to the best Apple Watch deals. When will Apple release watchOS 4? You can expect to see a preview of watchOS 4 in June at WWDC. Here's how to watch WWDC 2017 live. After the announcement watchOS 4 will go into a beta testing phase for several months. It will finally become available for general download around September 2017. However, if you're signed up as a beta tester you may be able to download an early beta version of watchOS 4 before then. When the software arrives, here's how to update watchOS. New features Here's a rundown of the new features we are hoping to see in the next version of the watch operating system. Activity tracking The new Apple Watch software will include new sports in the Activities app. Apple is testing skiing and snowboarding activities, according to a Gixmodo report based on an Environmental Health and Safety report. Along with new Activities, there are calls for better sharing features for workouts and other activity. Fitness fanatics would like the opportunity to share a wider range of stats with friends, it seems. Syncing workouts between Apple and third-party apps can be flawed too, so improvements here would be welcome. One new feature that came in watchOS 3 was the ability to pause a workout by pressing the side button and Digital Crown simultaneously, but unfortunately this feature isn't available to third-party apps. Hopefully it will be in watchOS 4. Similarly the watchOS 3 option to disable the touchscreen during a workout (or when you're in water) would be a useful feature for third-party apps. Health tracking The next Apple Watch will offer even more health-tracking features, if there's any foundation in rumours that Apple is currently testing diabetes monitoring hardware. If Apple is indeed looking at improving the health features of the new watch you can expect to see some additional software features which will hopefully be available for older models too. Sleep tracking Many fitness trackers and smartwatches feature sleep tracking functions that'll monitor your movement while asleep and offer you some kind of stat reflecting your sleep when you wake up - a feature that up until now has been missing from the Apple Watch (other than in the form of third party sleep tracking apps). Not for much longer though, if a recent report is to be believed. Bloomberg claims that Apple is working on a new apps for that tracks a user's sleep. Apparently this feature will be supported across all existing models of Apple Watch. The problem here has always been that sleep tracking required the Watch to have enough charge to be used overnight. Most Watch users plug in their watch overnight. One saving grace is that it doesn't take long for the Apple Watch to charge, so owners keen to track their sleep could charge the watch during the evening before bed, for example. In the meantime, get a good night's sleep with our guide to the best iPhone sleep apps. Always on time This is one of the most requested features of the Apple Watch. It seems preposterous that a watch wouldn't be able to show the time all the time. Apple's decision not to have a watch face always on is seemingly to preserve battery life, but there are plenty of smartwatches on the market that do permanently tell the time so Apple looks amiss by not offering it. Battery life is predominantly a hardware issue - and there are rumours that the next version of the Apple Watch could include a bigger battery via a new modular Watch strap. Read more here: Apple Watch 3 rumours. New watch faces Speaking of the time, there are also calls for more choice when it comes to your watch face. Currently there isn't really much in the way of choice beyond the watch faces Apple offers. There are faces from Hermes and Nike, but people would like to see more. How about a watch face store for the Apple Watch? As for the complications on the faces, which can be provided by third parties, these are only allowed to update no more than 50 times per day. This can be a pain for some complications so it's something we hope will change in watchOS 4. To see what you can do at the moment, read: How to change Apple Watch faces. Apple Watch customisation The watch face is just one way of personalising your Apple Watch. We'd like to see Apple introduce new ways of customising the device. For example, it would be nice to add custom ringtones and tones for alerts. You could even learn to understand exactly what your watch is telling you without even lifting your wrist, just by the type of vibration. Siri improvements on Apple Watch SiriKit recently arrived on the Apple Watch in the watchOS 3.2 update. The update will allow third-party apps to work with Siri. An issue some people have with the watch is that Siri won't work when you aren't online - so basically whenever you don't have your iPhone handy. For example, if you leave your iPhone at home and head out for a jog you won't be able to use Siri to open apps or play particular tracks from your music collection. Given how difficult the Apple Watch interface can be to navigate, this would make selecting certain settings in the OS a whole lot easier when you're out and about. Multiple devices You can now automatically unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch, how about your iPhone and iPad? It would also be useful if you could sync your Apple Watch with more than one device - your iPhone and your iPad, for example. Control Centre We'd like to see a few more additions to the Control Centre that arrived in watchOS 3. The dock We love the dock that arrived in watchOS 3 and can be accessed by pressing the side button, but we'd like to see this evolve. Home screen With the addition of Control Centre and the dock in watchOS 3 the interface became slightly easier to navigate. But we'd like to see changes to make the home screen a little more user-friendly. We'd like to be able to add folders, for example, as that might make it easier to navigate to apps. In many ways the difficulty with the home screen is down to the fact that the icons are circular - which doesn't really make sense given the fact that the watch face is rectangular. With square icons Apple could make better use of the space. An other way to help you navigate icons could be to choose for commonly used icons to be bigger than other icons, to make them easier to spot. The ability to remove Apple apps would be helpful here too. New Apple Watch apps We'd like to see the Notes app arrive on the Apple Watch. While it's unlikely you'll be writing (or rather dictating) long notes on the Apple Watch, it would be useful to be able to access your existing Notes on that device. If you're like us, Notes tends to be a go-to for any piece of information you want to have at your fingertips, so having access to this on your watch could be useful. Another app people want to see make its way to the Apple Watch is the Podcast app, while being able to listen to audiobooks in iBooks would also be welcome. Finally, how about the calculator app on the watch? Read about the Best Apple Watch games and Best Apple Watch apps for more information about what's currently available.

Apple’s WWDC Announcements: What are the chances? Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions Apple’s iOS has become a main pillar of its ever-expanding ecosystem. It was the inspiration for creating a tvOS that revolved around apps. And without iOS, watchOS would be inoperable.  Some of Apple’s best features were first fine-tuned on iOS before migrating to the other operating systems. Siri, for example, is now present in macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. And Apple Pay, another iOS-first, has found its way to the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro. That’s why during the WWDC keynote on June 5, all eyes will be on iOS 11, and whatever Apple has planned for the latest iteration of the influential operating system. For our iOS 11 wish list, we’ve come up with a list of awesome features that will certainly take iOS to the next level, but would also play nice with the other OSes. FaceTime group calling When Steve Jobs announced FaceTime back in 2010, it was groundbreaking. Reliable video calls on your mobile device were the future. But FaceTime hasn’t been updated much since then. Now, Facebook and Google have mobile video-calling, too, with Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts. While FaceTime continues to only support two-way video calling, Facebook Messenger lets you video-call up to 50 people. MyApple Hopefully, iOS 11 will bring FaceTime up to speed and integrate group calling. Rumors have circulated that this much-needed feature is indeed coming to iOS, but obviously nothing’s been confirmed. But if Apple does not launch support for group video calls soon, it’s possible that FaceTime will start loosing its luster… kind of like Skype. Expanded SiriKit Integrations Last year, with iOS 10, Apple made one of the biggest updates to Siri by allowing it to access selected third-party services. All of the sudden, Siri could hail you an Uber or send a message via WhatsApp. It was a great move in trying to make Siri smarter. However, Amazon’s Alexa has Siri beat in this department. Amazon has given its voice assistant access to thousands of third-party “Skills.” While Siri continues to only be able to perform six types of actions. Not to mention, Google Assistant just launched on iOS, as well, making iPhone users more aware of Siri’s shortcomings in deciphering context. If Apple is indeed developing a Siri Speaker to compete against Amazon Echo, then improving Siri in iOS 11 is vital. iMessage P2P payments Despite all these competitors, Apple continues to be number one in terms of user privacy and security. That’s why the Siri integrations have lagged behind. It’s also why Apple should integrate peer-to-peer mobile payments into iMessage, giving iPhone users a more-trusted alternative to Venmo. Venmo Sure, iMessage got a major overhaul in iOS 10, bringing bigger emojis, stickers, and third-party apps. But I was disappointed by the lack of practical applications. In iOS 11, iMessage could be integrated into Apple Pay to facilitate mobile payments in a way that’s secure and convenient. Augmented Reality app Tim Cook has mentioned several times how excited he is about augmented reality. Most likely, we’ll see augmented reality integrated somehow into the forthcoming iPhone 8, but I hope Apple will give us a hint of those AR features in iOS 11. Gabor Balogh Instead of clogging the camera app or Siri, Apple could launch a new standalone app dedicated entirely to launching augmented reality experiences. I’d love to see an iOS app that combines Siri, Clips, and the camera’s viewfinder to surface information or overlay graphics onto the real world (or on your 3D selfies). Samsung has already promised a version of this for Galaxy users with Bixby Vision. And more recently, Google Lens was the most interesting thing to come out of Google’s I/O developers conference. Could Siri Vision be that far behind? Customizable Control Center I use the Control Center more than I do the widgets on the Today screen. I swipe up every time I want to take a picture or use the calculator. I even use Control Center late at night when I’m on my iPhone and want to lock the portrait orientation of the screen. But then there are Control Center actions that I never take, like setting a timer. EverythingApplePro This didn’t use to be that big of a deal before iOS 10, when the Control Center was just one panel. Now, there are so many controls that I wish I could remove some of them, or at least re-arrange them. That way I could keep all my preferred controls (including the play button) on the same panel. In addition, I would also replace the Night Shift control, which takes up way to much space, with a control to turn on Low-Power Mode. That’s something that I need to turn on more often than Night Shift, which comes on automatically anyway. Set default apps When tapping a link, some iOS apps give you a choice. Do you want to open that link in Safari or Chrome? Do you want to navigate to this destination using Apple Maps or Google Maps? My question is: Wouldn’t it be nice if iOS 11 would let you set your default apps to get rid of such prompts? It would eliminate an extra step. I’m surprised we haven’t gotten this option just yet, considering simplicity is what Apple is all about. Drag-and-drop for iPad The iPad got a productivity boost in iOS 9 with Slide Over, Split View, and Picture-in-Picture. But that was two years ago, and it seems like Apple has stopped adding new multitasking features, or even fine-tuning existing ones. This is terribly disappointing, especially when you think of all the missed opportunities for making the iPad Pro models even better. MacStories A simple, yet much-needed multitasking feature that iOS 11 can bring about is drag-and-drop in Split View. Visually, I’m already tempted to drag photos and documents from one app to another when they’re right next to each other. And other third-party apps have already figured out how this can be done. Readdle’s latest update makes it possible to drag-and-drop files between their productivity apps like Spark, Documents, and PDF Expert.

Android co-founder's new company Essential Inc may be looking to create a pair of smart glasses similar to Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: June 2, 2017 6:20 pm Andy Rubin, the father of Android, thinks he can make a better product than Google Glass. (Image credit: Patently Apple) Related News Andy Rubin’s Essential sued for infringing intellectual property rights Andy Rubin’s Essential PH-1 smartphone: How it stacks against Apple iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S8+ Android creator Andy Rubin’s ‘Essential’ smartphone, home device unveiled Andy Rubin, the father of Android, thinks he can make a better product than Google Glass. Android co-founder’s new company Essential Inc may be looking to create a pair of smart glasses similar to Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles. An old patent filing, discovered by Patenty Apple shows a pair of eyeglasses, with camera and display builtin. The Essential Smart Glasses sports a camera under its ‘dual-mode’ display. Just like Glass Glass, the smart glasses allow users to capture photo and video with a built-in camera. The filing describes the smart glasses would be compatible with prescription lenses, photolenses and sunglass-lenses. Essential is also working on to make augmented reality (AI) to its smart glasses. Essential notes that “Based on the environment that the user sees, and based on the direction of the user’s gaze, the processor can display an image to augment the environment around the user. For example, if the user is looking at a barcode of an item, the processor can display cheaper purchasing options of the same item.” While Google Glass didn’t take off, Andy Rubin might have a better product to offer. In an interview with the Wired, Rubin mentioned that the failure of Google Glass was not due to the tech but because there wasn’t a market for such product.  It’s interesting to hear that Rubin still believes in the smart glasses segment, and the Essential Smart Glasses patent just shows the company’s interest to enter the unexplored territory. If that happens, it just shows how Rubin sees the future hardware that’s tightly connected and integrated to each other.  The head of Essential, his later venture, promises to make cutting edge hardware and software. Rubin’s company recently unveiled a $699 Android smartphone called the Essential. The high-end smartphone is made out of titanium and ceramic and features  a magnetic modular connector on the back to support a range of attachments, including a 360-degree camera and a charging dock. Rubin also unveiled the intelligent assistant device – the Home. Essential Home is a voice-activated smart home device that rivals Amazon Echo and Google Home. The smart hub runs on a new operating system that Rubin calls Ambient OS.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Announces that Swift Playgrounds Expands Coding Education to Robots, Drones and Musical Instruments | Main | The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze » June 02, 2017 Micro-LED Displays and new Flexible Fuel Cells on the Horizon may see Portable Devices go Days without Charging   While consumers appreciate the "fast charging" trend for smartphones, it's really a stopgap solution. Two better ways to extend battery life is for technology companies to adopt Micro-LED displays and perhaps flexible fuel cells which are on the horizon. Unfortunately both are just a few years out. A combination of said solutions would dramatically reduce daily charging. In the 2013 video below, Venture Capitalist John Doer attended a TechCrunch event. In the video between the 4:20 and 5:50 minute mark Doer explained the killer advantage to LuxVue's Micro-LED displays for smartphones. It's a display that's 9X brighter but 90% less power. Instead of trying to discover a new battery, using an Apple Watch or iPhone with a MicroLED display will provide a vastly superior display while only using 10% of the power that an OLED display does today. Now that's promising indeed.     Yole Development's chart below shows us how smartphones, smartwatches, Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), tablets, laptops, monitors and TV's will be adopting this technology starting in 2019 and quickly ramping up over the next eight years.   Smartwatches may be first to utilize this display due to its small display size and some in the industry are paranoid that it'll be Apple to launch this breakthrough display in a modern digital device for consumers.   And you know the display trend is for real when Facebook acquires a Micro-LED company, quickly followed by Samsung and Foxconn-Sharp.   At the same time, researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) have succeeded in developing core technologies for new flexible fuel cells. The news out of Korea states that KIST successfully demonstrated the super-lightweight and flexible fuel cell stacks.   The report further noted that "The fuel cell is gaining attention as the next-generation environment-friendly energy source, as it uses hydrogen and air to create electricity without making pollutant by-products, according to KIST. The technologies are expected to be widely used in the wearable device industry.   Flexibility is the catchphrase in the IT industry, as the market for wearable devices — such as smart watches or bands — is growing rapidly across the world."   Apple's R&D teams have been working on adding a battery to the Apple Watch band in various ways in the last year as seen here and here. So the flexible fuel cell would definitely be something of interest to Apple, even if they adopt a micro-LED display in the next few years.   The report further noted that "The new development is raising expectations that fuel cells can replace lithium-ion batteries, which are most commonly used in wearable devices. Scientists have tried to make flexible lithium-ion batteries, but have failed.   For this reason, there have been growing calls for a new energy source that can be flexible, according to KIST.   "The fuel cell comes with a lot of advantages compared with other energy sources in such areas as eco-friendliness and energy storage efficiency," senior KIST researcher Yoo Seong-jong said.   In particular, the scientist expects the drone industry to benefit from the new technologies.   'The flexible fuel cell will extend the duration of a drone's flight by more than three times compared with those equipped with existing batteries,' he said. 'The new development will serve as a stepping stone for the nation to lead the global fuel cell industry.'   The research was published in the NPG Asia Materials scientific journal last week.   Just as a reminder, Apple's research teams have also been exploring fuel cells and in fact updated their original patent for it back in April. While the fuel cells aren't flexible, it at least goes to show us that Apple is working on an alternative energy source for future devices.   The industry needs a breakthrough on the battery front and at least we're able to see viable solutions are in the works that are only a few short years away.   With Samsung jumping on board the micro-LED train, the race will be on with Apple as to which smartwatch will introduce a micro-Display first to market. Apple has had the lead on this next-gen display with LuxVue that Venture Capitalist John Doer praised in the video at the top of our report. So here's to hoping that Apple delivers on this front ahead of the pack.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 06.02.17. 06.02.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am WWDC 2017: What’s Coming at Apple’s Big Spring Fling GABRIELLE LURIE/AFP/Getty Images You can always tell when Apple’s WWDC developer shindig is nigh. Just follow the leaks. A few months before Tim Cook and his executives take the stage to show off what Apple’s software teams have been building for the last year, whispers start to trickle out. The leaks start really flowing a few weeks leading up to the event, and in the last few days before WWDC, the pipes burst, the dam gives, the levee breaks. You get the idea. If the rumors are true (and they usually are), this year’s WWDC will be hardware-focused. This year’s conference, which starts Monday, has Apple at an interesting crossroads. The gadget-buying world is hyped beyond reason for the tenth-anniversary iPhone, but that’s likely not coming until this fall. (Or even later.) Meanwhile, most of Apple’s other products face some headwinds. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was met with a resounding meh. The iPad, the supposed future of computing, still can’t find a way to grow. The Apple Watch 2 still needs a killer app. The Apple TV, well, the Apple TV hasn’t exactly blown up the industry the way the folks in Cupertino wanted. Apple Music is losing to Spotify; Siri seems to be running a distant third behind Alexa and Google Assistant. Let’s be clear, Apple’s not doomed. Apple is still dominating the tech world. But there’s still that unshakeable feeling that the company’s moxie may be missing. But Siri-ously All of that may help explain why this year’s Worldwide Developer Conference is shaping up to be the biggest one in years. Siri will almost certainly be the star of the show, as Apple tries to keep up in the raging virtual-assistant wars. Siri will surely have new skills and new integrations, and Apple could even announce wider developer support. Right now, only certain apps can only do certain things with Siri, but opening the platform completely could change things quickly. Meanwhile, Apple’s most exciting new product could be the long-rumored Siri Speaker, Apple’s answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We still don’t know much about the device, but it’ll reportedly be a HomeKit controller, a Siri machine, and an always-on speaker with supposedly superior sound. Throw in some Apple TV remote skills, and we’re really talking. If the rumors are true (and they usually are), this year’s WWDC will be heavily hardware-focused. Apple is reportedly going to announce upgrades to its entire MacBook line, finally getting Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors. The big question: is the MacBook Air still part of the lineup? The much-loved ultrabook has seemed dead for years, especially since Apple announced the super-slim MacBook. But users still love the Air. Rumors about a 10.5-inch iPad Pro have been flying for years now, and like clockwork they’re back again. The new device would supposedly be about the same size as the current 9.7-inch model, but with a smaller bezel. The 10.5-inch screen makes mathematical sense, the bezel-less-ness fits right in with the current trend. But good math doesn’t make good products, and even if it does that doesn’t mean Apple’s announcing this one. Still, we can hope. Oh, and here’s one hardware announcement you can take to the bank: there will be dongles. Soft Reboot After all that, there’s still software, which remains the star of the WWDC show. Apple’s likely to show off the latest for iOS, MacOS, WatchOS, and tvOS, updating the range of its products to work better together and do more stuff individually. Within iOS in particular, you might soon be getting a dark theme for your iPhone, an improved iMessage experience, and lots of new features for photos as Apple fights against Google Photos. There have even been rumors of a big redesign, but that seems less likely with so many other changes coming. Part of the presentation should focus on how all Apple’s different products fit together. Interoperation has always been part of the company’s sales pitch, and it only becomes more important as the rest of the gadget world continues to improve and expand. People want The Whole Apple Experience, or at least they have for a long time. So Apple needs to continue making the case for why you should buy an Apple Watch to go with your iPhone, and why a Mac makes both better. Smart-home control should figure into both answers, as will Siri. One nice thing about Apple is the company doesn’t tend to talk in vague terms about ideas, or plans for the future. It doesn’t offer Ted Talks disguised as product announcements. Tim Cook and The Apples tend to get up on stage and talk about real things happening right now. In a tech world where everything seems to be in flux, and all the best tech is perpetually right around the corner, Apple’s focus on the here and now is genuinely refreshing. But for the last couple of years, at least, it hasn’t been terribly exciting. Let’s see if Apple can get back to blowing minds not with ideas and visions, but gadgets and gizmos. Go Back to Top.

At the event, engineers and developers from all over the world will congregate to see what is usually a heavy software itinerary. However, the event in previous years has been the place for Apple to announce certain bits of hardware. As such, this year, the rumor goes, that a Siri Speaker, which is similar to the Amazon Echo and Google Home Smart Assistant’s is due to be announced. Pixaline / Pixabay Siri Speaker What We Know Is the rumor of an Apple Smart Assistant for the home, just rumor? Not according to Bloomberg’s Alex Webb and Mark Gurman. In a recent report, they suggest they suggest Apple’s partners are already manufacturing it. Additionally, rumors of a WWDC announcement are highly likely, although, they do not expect it to release until later this year. So with the prospect of yet another Smart Assitant to choose from for your home. What will differentiate the Siri Speaker from the Amazon Echo, the current market leader? How It Differs From The Competition If you’ve been keeping abreast of the story that is Siri Speaker, you may be thinking; it’s no different. One area, in which many have become confused about is how it deals with sound. Some reports have suggested, like the Echo, it will just respond to voice commands, take and answer questions, play music. And ultimately control your home, most of which is of course accurate. However, the information that we have seen indicates that Apple has been working on the Siri Speaker for two years. As such, you can bet, it won’t be a copy of anything else on the market, with an Apple Logo. As for sound quality, that is supposedly where the differences are said to be compared to the devices already available. What we’ve read indicates that superior microphone and speaker technology will be incorporated. Although, we do not know if this means some kind of Beats Audio technology is going to be, behind that. However, at least virtual surround sound will happen, as well as almost perfect comprehension of a user’s voice. Facial Recognition Now, let’s be clear, Apple itself has released no official information about what the press is dubbing the Siri Speaker. Most of what we’re telling you here come from rumors and supposed insider information. So please take it with a pinch of salt, and continue to read our updates. So, what about facial recognition? It could if the rumors are true, it’s a feature that will detect who is using the speaker. Apparently, this would enable it to customize services to say an adult or child, depending on previously set preferences. As for how this could be expanded upon to give even more functionality, there’s very little details yet. However, we would like to certain safeguards placed into a Siri Speaker, which on facial detection would auto-disable certain features. Right now the predictions indicate, that a master control/administrator would need to pre-input such restrictions. Functionailty Of course, with a name such as the Siri Speaker, there’s no doubt, if this is true that Siri, the one you find on your iPhone or iPad will be present. However. He/she will maybe sound the same, but be fundamentally different, mainly because of the type of device it’s incorporated into. Although what will remain the almost same is its ability to answer questions, the only differentiator will be the scope of question answerable. And of course, the fact that as a home-based smart assistant, the speaker it would serve as a home hub. Meaning that it could act as a gateway for controlling heating, lights, locks, curtains, communication between family members and more. As for additional functions, aimed at interactivity, it could read aloud your emails, text messages, and tweets. Plus, as we’ve seen with other devices, read aloud the news and weather reports for your local area. Other uses could also include the streaming of content via Apple Music, and the easy setup of reminders, the possibilities are almost endless. Built In Camera While it’s clear that any inbuilt facial recognition feature would require a camera, what else could the sensor do? How about stand guard over your home while away, and relay still images, or video to your iPhone? Yes, there are already products which do such a thing. However, they are stand-alone devices, not Smart Assistants like the Siri Speaker. Such functionality could enable the speaker to inform you or the police of intruders and capture all relevant data. Additionally, the monitoring of who comes in and out of your home at unexpected times of the day may be possible. As for the competition, Amazon’s Echo does include a camera; however, it does not have security focussed functionality. While the Google Home device has no camera at all, which for purposes of safety is an oversight, for sure. We think these smart devices should be able to monitor your home while you’re away, that way they double in effectiveness. And ultimately, provide a service which is 24/7 and ultimately worth, the big money, you would undoubtedly be asked to pay. Touch Screen Display According to a recent MacRumors report, Apple’s Marketing chief, Phil Schiller spoke about voice-activated smart speakers. He suggested that the premise of an assistant with only voice input is useless for social media. As such, it’s now thought that the Siri Speaker will feature a touchscreen, much like the Amazon Echo Show. Now, while Schiller, hasn’t come right out and said his company’s smart assistant would have one. It is probably easy to extrapolate Apple’s thinking as a whole on this. As such it’s easy to assume the Siri Speaker will also have a touchscreen display. To further back up the notion of a display. The well-known KGi Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that he believes Apple’s Siri Speaker will include a screen. It’s thought, that Apple will not release a device, that’s behind a competitor is one area of functionality. Price At this moment in time, we have no information about Apple’s pricing plans. However, Analyst Kuo has indicated that he believes the Siri Speaker smart assistant will cost more than the Amazon Echo. That device can currently be purchased for $179, so as a pure guess we would say somewhere in the region of $250 to $300 USD. Which would be more than any home assistant available today. Although with advanced Siri, facial recognition and more, it may be a price worth paying.

Tech Apple Science Cars Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 WWDC 2017 E3 2017 Prime Day 2017     Apple Obsoletes Several MacBooks And IPhone 3GS June 30 Posted: Jun 2 2017, 5:14am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     After products are marked obsolete, repairs through official channels disappear Apple is set to make several products obsolete at the end of June and once those products are obsolete, there will be no more repair support at Apple Stores and authorized partners. That means your obsolete devices are effectively unrepairable. 9to5Mac was able to get hands on an internal document outlining specifically what products will be moved to obsolete status come June 30. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 The change will affect the 11-inch mid-2011 MacBook Air and the 13-inch mid-2011 MacBook Air. There are three MacBook Pro models that are moving to obsolete status as well. Those machines include the late 2011 13-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch models. The 17-inch mid 2009 MacBook Pro will also be turned obsolete. If you own a first generation AirPort Express 802.11n device it will be moved to obsolete as well. This is the version of the AirPort that was introduced in 2008 and uses the wall socket design. If you are still using an iPhone 3GS in 16GB or 32GB flavors, those smartphones are also moving to obsolete. If you own any of these devices and still use them, you will have to seek repairs through unofficial channels if you need them fixed after the end of the month. This means if you own one of these devices and need a repair, you have a few more weeks to get them done before things get much harder. Interestingly Apple calls some of the obsolete products vintage. This story may contain affiliate links.

And all those features mean the iPhone 8 is going to have to be seriously good.  See related  Apple Watch 3 UK release date and rumours: Sleep tracking to appear on next smartwatch We’re in June now, which means that the iPhone 8 release date should be in around three months, and we’re hearing more and more rumours about the iPhone 8 every day. To sort out the nonsense from the relatively likely, we’ve sifted through all the latest iPhone 8 rumours, and rounded up the ones you need to know about.  So want to know everything we’re expecting from the iPhone 8? Keep reading.  Everything else we know (and guess) about the iPhone 8 1. There could be THREE new iPhone 8s New rumours suggest those models will be joined by a third, higher-end model. According to a report from the Japanese website Mac Otakara, this new phone will be called the iPhone Edition, in the same way the higher end Apple Watch is called the Apple Watch Edition. Fast Company previously suggested the next iPhone would cost over $1,000, and it’s possible this is the handset its source was talking about. What’s not yet clear, is how the iPhone Edition will be different from the other two handsets. A look at the Apple Watch line-up reveals the only difference between the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition models is the use of a high-end ceramic finish, and it’s possible Apple could be bringing the same ceramic finish to the iPhone 8. For the last few years Apple has concentrated in giving consumers more choice – when it comes to colours and finishes at least – so this rumour is certainly viable. 2. We pretty much know the iPhone 8 release date Apple hasn’t announced anything about the iPhone 8 (7s) yet, but we already have a good idea of when it will be released. Apple tends to stick to a pretty rigid timeframe when it comes to iPhones, and a quick look at previous iPhone release dates will give a very good idea of when the next iPhone is due. Apple tends to release an iPhone every year in the last two weeks of September, so we should see the iPhone 7 around this time next year. 3. It should be easier to get an iPhone 8 when it is released A new report by BlueFin Research Partners, and reported on by MacRumors, suggests that Apple will begin making the iPhone 8 earlier than usual – but states that it doesn’t necessarily report to an earlier release date. Instead of changing the release date, it looks like Apple will begin production earlier, this time round, so it has more handsets available when then expected September release date does roll around. 4. The iPhone 8 might not have Touch ID According to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 is going to feature a bezel-less display – just like the LG G6 and Samsung S8. That way, Apple will be able to give the new iPhone a larger screen, without making the handset itself larger. However, it looks like the Home button is going to be the first casualty in the new change, and according to Kuo, Apple is set to replace it with a new function area. This new area of screen could work like like the MacBook Pro’s TouchBar, giving users relevant controls when needed, but disappearing altogether when watching something like a movie, for example.  According to  MacRumours, details about "an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen" also came during TSMC’s annual Technology Symposium held in Taipei. 5. The iPhone 8 could feature wireless charging This year the iPhone 7 debuted water-resistant capability, something already seen on Android phones for the past few years – and it’s possible Apple will follow the Android crowd with another feature, too. Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 feature wireless charging, and it’s possible Apple will introduce that feature in the next iPhone. Apple tends to wait a while before introducing new technologies, and the introduction of wireless charging could provide a good incentive to get the updated iPhone. 6. The iPhone 8 should cost the same as the iPhone 7 Apple hasn’t changed the price of the new iPhone recently, and that looks set to continue for the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t end up shelling more for the iPhone 7s: Apple may have kept the prices the same, but it’s also dropped and added storage options over the iPhone range. That’s forced owners to buy a smaller-capacity iPhone – or upgrade to a larger-capacity, more expensive model than before. 7. The iPhone 8 could finally use an OLED screen For the past few years we’ve expected Apple to put an OLED screen in the iPhone, and now the Sharp CEO, Jeng-wu Tai, has pretty much confirmed the iPhone 8 (7s) will have one. Late last year, Tai said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS to OLED panel. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." Tai is an executive at Foxconn, the parent company of Sharp, and also the people that make the iPhone – so it’s very likely he’s privy to some serious insider knowledge. 8. The iPhone 8 might have a vertical camera A new report from iDrop suggests the iPhone 8 will have a new, vertical camera. The rumour comes from a Foxconn source, and states that the new iPhone 8 Edition will have a vertical dual-camera, rather than a horizontal one. iDrop says the iPhone 8 will also feature a double camera set up above its screen too. iDrop’s source also says the iPhone 8 won’t have an under-screen Touch ID sensor, but will use an OLED screen, with an edge-to-edge display just like the Samsung Galaxy S8.   Read more about: Mobile phones You are here: Home Apple iPhone 8 UK release date, specs and rumours: Everything we know about the next Apple handset Most Popular Draw the cats of your nightmares using machine learning 24 Feb 2017 Art Future supreme court justice stumped by Reddit meme 22 Mar 2017 Politics i.Con wants to be the Fitbit for your penis 3 Mar 2017 Life & Culture Netflix’s interactive experiment is (a) Good (b) Bad 9 Mar 2017 Netflix This e-paper wall calendar prototype is simple but brilliant 23 Mar 2017 Life & Culture 63 Android apps you need: Supercharge your phone 2 Jun 2017 Google 20 of the best Raspberry Pi 3 projects 8 May 2017 Raspberry Pi The 14 essential PS4 games to own in 2017 30 May 2017 Sony Tesla Model 3: All you need to know 23 May 2017 Cars How to download and install the Wookie build on Kodi 24 May 2017 Software Technology Devices, software, wearables and more Snapchat brings its camera Spectacles to the UK Snap’s sunglasses come with an embedded video camera, and can record footage at the touch of a button 2 Jun 2017 Cameras DJI Spark review: Hands-on with the ultimate selfie drone DJI’s compact, follow-me drone is packed with tech – and it’s also great fun to fly 2 Jun 2017 Technology Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 can now run full-fat Windows 10 Qualcomm sticks it to Intel as Microsoft partners up to revolutionise the ultraportables market 2 Jun 2017 Technology Nvidia’s Max-Q brings GTX 1080 graphics to ultrabooks Say goodbye to hulking gaming laptops, Nvidia’s Max-Q has just revolutionised the gaming laptop 2 Jun 2017 Laptops Business How technology is changing your work 7 observations from the IoT World Forum 2017 Cisco’s Internet of Things World Forum was a timely reminder of just how big IoT is… and how much bigger it can get 26 May 2017 Business Just a few days left to apply for Apple's Developer Academy Apple’s first European Academy will be providing training on iOS development to those from a wealth of backgrounds 26 May 2017 Apple Raspberry Pi just extended its reach for young coders Raspberry Pi’s new merger gives it the scope to reach 185,000 children across the globe 26 May 2017 Raspberry Pi Minibrew raises $2.8 million to put a keg in your kitchen Minibrew is a tech-heavy answer to making homemade craft beer 24 May 2017 Startups Science Developments from the frontiers of science Trump pulls out of the Paris climate agreement: The fallout Making friends and influencing people 2 Jun 2017 Environment Elon Musk is about to dump Trump over climate change If the president pulls the US out of the Paris climate agreement, then Musk will cut his ties to the administration 1 Jun 2017 Environment Trump to pull the USA out of the Paris climate change deal 1.5 million Green party voters probably regret their choice right now 31 May 2017 Environment Shape-shifting pasta unpacks itself on your plate Self-folding food could change the way we store and ship the things we eat 31 May 2017 Bioscience Cars The cutting edge of automotive technology Lexus LC500h review: We drive the best Lexus hybrid yet Lexus has finally made an exciting hybrid car 1 Jun 2017 Cars BMW CarData: Using your data for good BMW wants to put you in control of your car's data 31 May 2017 Cars Mercedes-AMG Project One hypercar: Everything we know Imagine an F1 car for the road with 1000hp.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology From Apple to IBM: How the world's biggest tech firms reacted to Trump's climate deal exit Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Musk and Cook join the high-profile names to slam US president's decision. By Jason Murdock June 2, 2017 12:06 BST Close Donald Trump announces withdrawal from Paris Climate Accord: 'We're getting out' IBT On 1 June, US president Donald Trump confirmed the worst fears of many United Nations countries, businesses, scientists and technologists: he was pulling out of a landmark deal designed to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate the effects of global warning and generally save planet Earth. Trump said he wanted to renegotiate the terms of the agreement and said the previous deal had resulted in "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the US. Critics, including high-profile technology executives, are now speaking out against the seemingly unpopular decision. In an open letter to the president, 25 firms, including tech giants Adobe, Apple, Google, Facebook, HPE, Intel and Microsoft, had begged Trump to leave the deal intact. "Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy," it read. Ultimately, he ignored the warnings of the many. "As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does," Trump said in his speech announcing the country's exit. As the dust settled, social media erupted with activity and, behind the scenes, some tech bosses were issuing internal letters to employees. From Apple to Microsoft, a pattern of condemnation emerged. Here is a list of the initial reactions from the biggest technology firms operating today. Tim Cook: "I know many of you share my disappointment." Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted on 1 June: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver." In a more descriptive separate letter to employees, obtained by Axios, Cook wrote: "Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment." "I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the US in the agreement. But it wasn't enough. "We're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy [...] knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet's future." Pictured (L/R): Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk. Each voiced criticism of Paris Accord exit. Credit (L/R): Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images, Reuters Microsoft: "Disappointed with today's decision." Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith, known for his lengthy blog posts published via LinkedIn, did not refrain from the topic of climate change. "[The deal] creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions. And by strengthening global action over time, the Agreement reduces future climate damage to people and organisations around the world. "We are disappointed with today's decision by the White House to withdraw the United States from the landmark, globally supported Paris Agreement on climate change. "We remain steadfastly committed to the sustainability, carbon and energy goals that we have set as a company and to the Paris Agreement's ultimate success. Our experience shows us [...] investments and innovations are good for our planet, our company, our customers and the economy." Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, added on Twitter: "We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part." You can read the full Microsoft statement here. IBM: "It is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table." Unlike its competitors, IBM has chosen to remain at the side of the Trump administration through tough times. Now, it has condemned the decision to abandon the Paris Accord but yet again has declined to use the moment to criticise the US government – a potentially huge customer. In a statement, it said: "Climate change is an international problem that requires an international solution, and we believe it is important for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore IBM supported — and still supports — US participation in the Paris Agreement. "This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country. IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it." Other executives issued shorter statements via social media. Here is the run-down: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook: "Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk. "For our part, we've committed that every new data centre we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late." Jack Dorsey, Twitter: "This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together." Sundar Pichai, Google: "Disappointed with today's decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all." Elon Musk, Tesla & SpaceX: "Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH [White House] & via councils, that we remain." Amazon: "Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers." This list will be updated as more comments and statements are released. Trump has a long and established history of climate change denial. In one tweet from 2012, he said: "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." More recently, in a 2015 interview, he noted: "I believe in clean air. Immaculate air...But I don't believe in climate change." The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 @realDonaldTrump The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading climate change body, has said: "Warming [...] is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level."

See related  Laundroid: The £12,000 washing machine Apple MacBooks to get faster Intel Coffee Lake chip 'next year' Android co-founder unveils Essential smartphone An advert for the tablet, called the Ryonghung iPad, posted on the site says it's powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core processor with 1GB of RAM. It also comes with 8GB of storage and can be connected to a TV through HDMI.  It's significantly underpowered compared to Apple's most recent iPad, which the London Evening Standard says is fitted with 1.85GHz chips and 4GB of RAM. The official iPad also offers triple the internal storage as standard compared with Myohyang IT's version. "The tablet appears to be in breach of Apple's copyright", says the newspaper, as "iPad" is a registered trademark with the Cupertino-based company.  But analysts told the paper that Apple is "unlikely to pursue action" as the Ryonghung iPad "poses little threat to the real thing's market domination".  It's not the first time a North Korean tech company has imitated one of Apple's computers. In 2015, a company released a desktop computer that "looked really similar to an Apple iMac", says Mashable. That same year, a North Korean firm launched a copy of Apple's MacOS system called "Red Star 3.0".  There's no word on which operating system the Ryonghung iPad will run, but the website says it could be powered by "a heavily-neutered form of Android."  Myohyang IT's tablet is not expected to be released outside North Korea.  Sign up for our daily newsletter Newsletter CloseSign me up Read more: Technology Apple iPad tablets North Korea You are here: Home tablets North Korea builds its own tablet called 'iPad' View the discussion thread.

The App Store is home to the most innovative apps in the world and in the past 12 months alone, downloads have grown over 70 per cent. "People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers," said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” Games make up the most popular types of apps on the App Store with 25% of the total, followed by business, education, lifestyle and entertainment. From breakout hits like Pokémon GO and Super Mario Run to other standout launches such as CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly, customers discover and experience new apps and games every day on the App Store. Since the release of iOS 10 last fall, iPhone and iPad users have also experienced new engaging and creative ways to connect, such as giving a friend a Starbucks gift card using Apple Pay, collaborating on a fashion design sketch using Prêt à Template, or making someone smile with an endless assortment of stickers.  Subscriptions as a revenue stream With the subscription business model now available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store’s active paid subscriptions are up 58 per cent year over year. Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including longtime favourites such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight.  App Store developers from around the world create apps for customers in 155 countries that improve lives, rethink industries and shape culture. Gaming and Entertainment are top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, have experienced over 70 per cent growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90 per cent growth.

Swift Playgrounds is perfect for students and beginners learning to code with Swift, Apple’s powerful and intuitive programming language for building world-class apps. Apple is working with leading device makers to make it easy to connect to Bluetooth-enabled robots within the Swift Playgrounds app, allowing kids to program and control popular devices, including LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, Sphero SPRK+, Parrot drones and more. The Swift Playgrounds 1.5 update will be available as a free download on the App Store beginning Monday, June 5. “More than 1 million kids and adults from around the world are already using Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding with Swift in a fun and interactive way,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Now they can instantly see the code they create and directly control their favourite robots, drones and instruments through Swift Playgrounds. It’s an incredibly exciting and powerful way to learn.”   “Today we’re combining efforts with Apple to provide even more students around the world with the opportunity to learn how to code,” said Esben Stærk Jørgensen, president, LEGO Education. “We’re pairing the familiar LEGO bricks and our hands-on approach to playful learning found in LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 with Swift Playgrounds’ powerful learning platform so now anyone can program their LEGO MINDSTORMS creation with real Swift code.”   Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla | Post a Comment | Share Article Print Article Permalink tagged Apple Swift Playgrounds, Canada Email Article in Apple, Apps & Launches, Events and Launches, Press release Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

The details have been reported by French site Consmac, and relate to regulatory filings made in a Russian-language regulatory filing. Five model numbers for personal computers carrying the Apple trademark are listed. The model numbers registered in this filing are A1289 A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481. The expectation is that these model numbers represent updates to a number of existing Mac machines rather than Apple recycling the model numbers; A1289 is the older boxlike Mac Pro, A1347 is the Mac mini, A1418 is the iMac, A1419 iMac, and A1481 is the cylindrical Mac Pro The inclusion of significantly older machines like the Mac Pro and the Mac mini clouds the issue of what exactly is being refreshed, but the obvious answer is that some of the Mac machines are going to join the MacBook line-up with an update to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chip architecture. There are already major signals that the three MacBook Pro machines announced in October 2016 will pick up the seventh-generation Intel chipsets. As previously discussed on Forbes, Apple’s decision to release one final iteration of MacBooks in 2016 with the sixth-generation Intel chips has meant the Windows 10 competition captured a lead in terms of specifications over the last six months. Apple has decided to risk upsetting the early adopters with a switch to Kaby Lake very early in this production cycle. The filing also has a new number - A1843 - listed as  a wireless input device and handily referred to as a ‘keyboard’). There’s been less talk of a new Magic Keyboard from Apple, but a recently published patent shows a wireless keyboard with an adaptive input row that matches the design and implementation of the Touch bar, but on a standalone peripheral. For developers to make best use of the Touch Bar it needs to become a primary control area, something that cannot happen with legacy hardware. This new peripheral offers Apple a way to retrofit the Touch Bar to older Mac machines. The WWDC keynote starts at 10am Pacific this Sunday, the 5th of June. Any new or updated hardware should be announced during the expected two-hour long presentation. Keep watching Forbes’ Technology channel for all the news and analysis.   Share this story Leave a comment What others are reading Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe is new ECOWAS chairperson 'Oi, cowards!': Londoners fought back as killers rampaged June 3 Disaster: Survivors call for institution of monthly allowance Abacha $2m was used for 'nationalistic purposes' - Rawlings Latest Stories MPs want WAEC to guard against question leaks as BECE begins Mayweather's visit to Ghana: What's in it for us?

In a new Apple ad, a thief breaks into “your phone” but struggles to get into an iPhone. Here’s how it plays out in the real world. By Emily Bary May 31, 2017 2:14 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple wants to give you a new reason for buying the iPhone. The company’s latest ad campaign features a thief who’s able to break in and steal things from “your phone,” but the line gets drawn -- quite literally -- at an iPhone. In the ad, a thief tries to enter an iPhone space but gets rebuffed and quickly gives up. The iOS versus Android security debate has been playing out for years, but Apple thinks it has enough of an edge now to make it part of the iPhone’s marketing campaign -- a reason for consumers to switch, presumably from an Android device to an iPhone. We wondered how the iOS/Android security question plays out in the real world and dialed up an expert to find out. There are several reasons why iPhones are more secure than the various phones running Android software, according to Mike Johnson, who runs the security technologies graduate program at the University of Minnesota. Johnson has used both Android and iOS devices, but he has an iPhone because of its security edge. For one, the old rule about PC viruses seems to be holding true with mobile phones, as well. Android phones make up more than 80% of the global smartphone market, and hackers are more likely to succeed if they write programs for these devices, just because of sheer numbers. “Criminals are going to target the thing that provides them the most return,” Johnson says. Plus, he says, the process of “patching” security holes is easier on iOS devices. Apple’s iOS operating system only runs on iPhones, while Alphabet’s Android software runs on phones made by numerous manufacturers. It’s more complicated to deliver patches, or bug fixes, that work across so many device makers and carriers. Android can release a patch, but it won’t necessarily be available on all devices right away. “Fragmentation is the enemy of security,” Johnson says. There’s a financial way to measure vulnerability, as well. So-called “zero days” are exploits discovered by hackers and security researchers that remain unknown to the software developer. When developers don’t know about them, they can’t issue a patch. That makes the exploits valuable to the intelligence community, and government agencies will sometimes buy those zero days to monitor suspected criminal behavior. Last year, Wired magazine reported that one security firm was offering up to $1.5 million for the most serious iOS exploits and up to $200,000 for an Android one, a sign that iOS vulnerabilities are rarer. Every device is at risk, Johnson notes, and there will be malicious apps in the App Store in addition to, say, the Google Play store. But, he says, Apple “has the right and edge to say we are more secure,” because its users are ultimately less vulnerable to hacks. Whether the security angle will draw in more users remains to be seen. Ordinary users tend to pay attention to other factors -- like cameras and screens -- when they choose new phones. Both of which are likely to get big upgrades in the next iPhone -- and surely their own ad campaign.

By Mark Sullivan7 minute Read Apple’s annual developer conference kicks off this Monday at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. The official purpose of WWDC is to keep developers fired up–and well educated–about developing apps and services on and for Apple’s operating systems and platforms. But the event is also a statement about where Apple is in terms of consumer-tech competition on an array of fronts. advertisement New features in the company’s operating systems–iOS, MacOS, WatchOS, and tvOS–will likely dominate Monday’s two-hour keynote presentation. Unfortunately–for preview writers like me, at least–precious few details have leaked about Apple’s plans for the next versions of these platforms. Whatever the specifics of Apple’s announcements on Monday, it’s wise to look at them through the lens of two key strategic themes: artificial intelligence/machine learning and camera-related technologies such as computer vision. Throughout the keynote, we’ll likely hear repeated references to these themes as Apple both pushes its own stated goals in those areas, and responds to competitive pressures from companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Some of the new AI features will be presented as Siri assistant functions. I predict you’ll hear Apple people mention the term “Siri” onstage approximately 237 times in 120 minutes at WWDC. Okay, probably less than that, but a lot. iOS (and New iPads?) I’ve heard some smart people say Apple will bake some significant interface changes into its mobile operating system. Though the specifics about iOS 11 haven’t leaked, it makes sense for Apple to focus on improvements to the most popular user-facing functions on the iPhone, the company’s most important product. From Facebook’s Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp to Microsoft’s Skype, messaging is a key battleground among the major tech platforms, which are fighting vigorously to get and keep daily users. The more features they build into their messaging environments, the less reasons people have to go outside of them. For instance, last year Apple began allowing users to play YouTube videos and Apple Music songs within the Messages app. Apple also announced new third-party integration possibilities in the iMessage service last year, like the ability to send Square payments and order food deliveries. This year it’s likely to expand the ways third parties can offer goods and services within the app. It may even talk about adding full Apple Pay support in iMessage. At last year’s WWDC keynote, a new version of Messages packed with features designed to help it take on Messenger and Snapchat got plenty of stage time. This year, some Apple watchers believe that the app could get some new image filters a la Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. advertisement The company will likely talk at least a little about Maps, perhaps adding new features that more intelligently understand the user’s intent and the context around map searches. “My expectation is for a number of changes as Apple tries desperately to keep Google Maps within reach,” Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart wrote in a brief. Apple Music is likely to see some significant design changes, while sticking with its ultra-simple black-and-white-with-big-letters theme. As iPad sales have struggled, Apple has been working both to make its tablet more of a business tool and to make sure it’s relevant in a changing consumer market. So now might be a great time to add a bunch of new features to iOS just for the iPad. This could mean anything from new multitasking and screen-splitting features to a more work-ready Safari browser. Speaking of the iPad, the rumor mill has been working overtime on the rumor that Apple could unveil a new 10.5-inch iPad on Monday that may or may not replace the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We know very little about the device except that it would have significantly less bezel and more screen space. It would likely also contain a faster chip than the other (9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) models in the Pro line, raising the possibility that Apple could announce chip upgrades for iPads in other sizes. MacOS (and New Macs?) Apple has managed to keep a lid on its plans for the next version of MacOS. Actually, much of the chatter seems to concern whether the company will finally ditch its “California landmarks” nomenclature and call the next version of the OS MacOS 11, which would look nice alongside the new iOS 11. (Apple changed the OS name from OS X to MacOS in 2016 but called the new version “Sierra.”) Lots of people would by very happy if Apple would finally reinvent iTunes. As wireless devices and music distribution models have evolved over the years, the iconic music app looks less and less relevant and intuitive. A redesign might feature Apple Music in a more central role. More likely, Apple will focus more on integrating MacOS with iOS in new ways, as it did last year with a clipboard that let you copy something on your iPhone and then paste it on a Mac. We may also see the company continue to export iOS features to MacOS. It brought Siri to the desktop last year, and there’s plenty of opportunity to make that experience richer. Other iOS features may follow. advertisement We may hear some talk about Mac hardware too. In early March Apple brought a few journalists to its Cupertino campus to say that it’s still devoted to its pro users–people who use their Macs for demanding work, such as the software developers in the audience at WWDC. Apple will probably repeat this message at WWDC. Though the new iMacs and Mac Pro models the company mentioned at that event may be a long ways off, Jason Snell, writing for Macworld, points to rumors that Apple might announce processor upgrades for the MacBook Pro models that were released last fall. There’s also been scuttlebutt about a new version of the 12″ MacBook. tvOS Apple won’t likely spend a lot of time talking about tvOS, but it may crow about a new content agreement that will make a difference to lots of people–a deal to bring the Amazon video app to Apple TV. We’ll also likely see Apple add some new Siri integration to Apple TV to help users find new content without having to click the remote. WatchOS Don’t expect massive differences as the Apple Watch’s software segues from WatchOS 3 to WatchOS 4. Notifications, the control center, and the app dock will likely remain largely the same in form and function. We may see some further emphasis on the Watch as a health device with the addition of new fitness and wellness functions. We’ll likely see some new watch faces and complications. The “Siri Speaker” Rumors have intensified in recent weeks about a new Apple smart speaker device that will look something like Google Home and Amazon Echo. A report by Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman and Alex Webb on Wednesday said the new device is already in production and will feature “virtual surround sound” courtesy of some fancy speakers and software. If this is true, it may get announced on Monday. The device would act as the vehicle for the Siri assistant in the home, and would act as the front end for several major Apple services (notably Music). You’ll note that I didn’t mention HomeKit in the iOS section above. Well, that platform might end up getting a lot of attention on Monday. The new speaker device could assume a key role at the center of the Apple connected home. For consumers who own smart-home devices that support HomeKit, a speaker could be the go-to natural-language interface for home control. I’m betting we will indeed see the announcement of this product Monday. The popularity and influence of the Amazon Echo is simply too great for Apple to ignore. The risk is that some users might bail out on Apple services such as HomeKit if there’s no ambient way to call them up by talking. Even an announcement far in advance of when the product can actually ship might mitigate that risk somewhat. (Note that Google announced its Google Home speaker at last year’s I/O conference, six months before it shipped.) advertisement Augmented Reality Finally, some people are wondering if Apple will use this year’s WWDC to finally make some nods at augmented-reality features. The company has repeatedly expressed interest in the technology, which superimposes digital imagery over the real world as seen through a camera lens. And some believe Apple is beginning to feel some pressure from rivals like Google that are advancing the technology. One of the new iPhones coming this fall will indeed contain a 3D sensor, my sources say, which could enable the phone to process the real-world images shot by the camera and position 3D digital images in that environment. On the other hand, that 3D sensor could be used in the new phone for some other function, like iris recognition for securely locking the phone. Predicting when or if Apple will announce anything related to AR or VR is risky, but it’s worth acknowledging that such an announcement gets less farfetched every day. The WWDC keynote party begins at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, June 5. You can find Apple’s live stream here. My colleague Harry McCracken and I will be on the ground at the event in San Jose. We’ll be delivering news and commentary throughout the keynote.

Stock analyst Rod Hall, from the top financial services company J.P. Morgan, has written a note to investors that reportedly contains wild claims about Apple’s plans for the WWDC event next week. Reuters 2 Apple boss Tim Cook speaks on stage at WWDC in 2015 Website Apple Insider has seen the briefing document, which says that Apple will unveil the new iPhone 8 and updated iPads. But that’s not all, because the analyst also said tech fans will be able to get a first look at a new Apple TV device which will allow films and programmes to be streamed at 4K as well as an Amazon Echo-style “Siri Speaker, which is said to already be in production. Hall has previously suggested the iPhone 8 will come with a Samsung-style “infinity screen” and incorporate facial recognition technology.

As 9to5Mac highlights, a $70 billion payout to developers would put around $30 billion in Apple’s pocket based on the company’s standard 70/30 revenue split. Downloads have also grown more than 70 percent over the past 12 months, we're told. Of the 25 app categories in the App Store, Apple said the Gaming and Entertainment categories are the top-grossing. The Photo and Video category is among the fastest-growing at nearly 90 percent growth over the past year although both the Health and Fitness category and Lifestyle apps have grown more than 70 percent during the same period. Active paid subscriptions are also on the rise now that the model is available to developers across all app categories. Such subscriptions are up 58 percent year-over-year, Apple said. Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, described the $70 billion payout as “simply mind-blowing.” He added that they are amazed at all of the great new apps developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Speaking of, Apple is set to host its 28th annual Worldwide Developers Conference next week. The keynote kicks off on June 5 at 10 a.m. PT with festivities running through June 9. Most expect Apple to preview iOS 11 and the latest version of macOS at the event. It’s also likely that we’ll get a look at watchOS 4, tvOS 11 and perhaps a new iPad.

Believe it or not, it’s IBM IBM, -0.41%  , which for years has represented in many investors’ eyes the kind of old, stodgy and washed-up company that nimble firms like Apple AAPL, +1.48%  run circles around. But a surprisingly large number of market-beating newsletters editors I monitor think that view is unfair. In essence, they argue that IBM is a growth company that trades like a value stock. Many of the newsletter editors credit IBM’s “Watson” for much of the company’s growth potential. Gray Cardiff, editor of the Sound Advice newsletter, describes Watson as IBM’s artificial intelligence “super computer that can ‘think’ like a human.” Notes Cardiff: “Watson cognitively scans a world of data and applies relevant information to what it learns about a company’s business and systems to create new revenue streams, reduce expenses, and make existing operations more efficient. We have only begun to see and imagine the uses of artificial intelligence. IBM is the leader in that field and on a solid path to provide a growing abundance of opportunities in the months and years ahead.” John Buckingham, editor of the Prudent Speculator newsletter, adds that “the growth opportunity for the company’s Strategic Imperatives is high. Watson continues to impress with deployments in Health Care, Internet of Things and Financial Services.” Despite such optimism, IBM stock in out of favor and trades solidly in the value camp. Its price/earnings ratio based on trailing 12 months’ earnings is 12.6, compared to almost double that for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37%  . IBM’s P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is even lower, at 11.1. The newsletter editors also are impressed with IBM’s high dividend yield — 3.9% currently — that provides investors with a nice cushion during the time those editors think it could take for the rest of the market to discover the stock’s potential. Also impressive to them is that, with IBM’s recent 10-cent increase in its quarterly dividend, the company has now raised its dividend in each of the last 22 years. Kelley Wright, editor of Investment Quality Trends, bases his recommendation of IBM on its dividend yield. In fact, he calculates that the stock wouldn’t become overvalued until it’s trading at $462 — which represents more than a triple from where IBM is trading today. Moreover, each of these advisers recommending IBM has a market-beating track record. John Buckingham’s Prudent Speculator, for example, has beaten the broad stock market by 1.7 percentage points annualized over the past 30 years. Though my performance monitoring service has been tracking Gray Cardiff’s and Kelley Wright’s newsletters for less time, they also have beaten the market: Wright’s market-topping margin over the past 20 years annualized is 2.6 percentage points, while Cardiff’s over the past 15 years is 1.7 points. For the record, I should emphasize that the newsletter editors I monitor don’t actively dislike Apple. Many are recommending it also. They just like IBM more.

Believe it or not, it’s IBM IBM, -0.41%  , which for years has represented in many investors’ eyes the kind of old, stodgy and washed-up company that nimble firms like Apple AAPL, +1.48%  run circles around. But a surprisingly large number of market-beating newsletters editors I monitor think that view is unfair. In essence, they argue that IBM is a growth company that trades like a value stock. Many of the newsletter editors credit IBM’s “Watson” for much of the company’s growth potential. Gray Cardiff, editor of the Sound Advice newsletter, describes Watson as IBM’s artificial intelligence “super computer that can ‘think’ like a human.” Notes Cardiff: “Watson cognitively scans a world of data and applies relevant information to what it learns about a company’s business and systems to create new revenue streams, reduce expenses, and make existing operations more efficient. We have only begun to see and imagine the uses of artificial intelligence. IBM is the leader in that field and on a solid path to provide a growing abundance of opportunities in the months and years ahead.” John Buckingham, editor of the Prudent Speculator newsletter, adds that “the growth opportunity for the company’s Strategic Imperatives is high. Watson continues to impress with deployments in Health Care, Internet of Things and Financial Services.” Despite such optimism, IBM stock in out of favor and trades solidly in the value camp. Its price/earnings ratio based on trailing 12 months’ earnings is 12.6, compared to almost double that for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37%  . IBM’s P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is even lower, at 11.1. The newsletter editors also are impressed with IBM’s high dividend yield — 3.9% currently — that provides investors with a nice cushion during the time those editors think it could take for the rest of the market to discover the stock’s potential. Also impressive to them is that, with IBM’s recent 10-cent increase in its quarterly dividend, the company has now raised its dividend in each of the last 22 years. Kelley Wright, editor of Investment Quality Trends, bases his recommendation of IBM on its dividend yield. In fact, he calculates that the stock wouldn’t become overvalued until it’s trading at $462 — which represents more than a triple from where IBM is trading today. Moreover, each of these advisers recommending IBM has a market-beating track record. John Buckingham’s Prudent Speculator, for example, has beaten the broad stock market by 1.7 percentage points annualized over the past 30 years. Though my performance monitoring service has been tracking Gray Cardiff’s and Kelley Wright’s newsletters for less time, they also have beaten the market: Wright’s market-topping margin over the past 20 years annualized is 2.6 percentage points, while Cardiff’s over the past 15 years is 1.7 points. For the record, I should emphasize that the newsletter editors I monitor don’t actively dislike Apple. Many are recommending it also. They just like IBM more.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday June 5, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Bonnells Bay Public School parent anger over KOFM's Apple for the Teacher competition Helen Gregory@HGregory_Herald 2 Jun 2017, 7 p.m. Bonnells Bay Public School parents angry over KOFM's Apple for the Teacher competition. Winner: Shelley Sneath received 349,673 votes to win KOFM's Apple For The Teacher competition. Parents said she was "exceptional" and had helped many students improve. Picture: Bonnells Bay Public School Facebook page. Local Business A RADIO station competition intended to honour an outstanding educator has split parents at a Hunter school, as some say they “feel deceived” over the prize for their winning teacher and that their children were robbed of iPads. Hunter radio station KOFM awarded Bonnells Bay Public School year three teacher Shelley Sneath a glass trophy after she won its Apple for the Teacher competition last week with 349,673 votes. But some parents have lodged complaints with the Department of Education, saying the school led them to believe Ms Sneath and students in her class would directly receive much bigger rewards: a trip to New York City and their own iPads. If the students won t-shirts or chocolate bars they would not have to share them with everyone. - Bonnells Bay parent “We feel deceived,” one parent said. “It’s so confusing for our eight-year-olds to understand.” The department and the parents and citizens committee have defended the move to award the trip and iPads to the whole school instead, saying parents were kept informed of changes to the competition. KOFM posted on its Facebook page on May 1 the teacher “with the most votes will win big with a trip to New York City. Every child in their class will also win an Apple iPad mini each”. A spokesman for the Department of Education said it contacted KOFM on May 2 to explain its code of conduct, which includes that prizes of significant monetary value are usually considered property of the department. The spokesman said it also discussed “the issue of equity with the distribution of iPads” and “how these issues could be resolved with any prizes going to the winning teacher's school as a whole”. “The winning teacher, Ms Sneath, has always understood she is not in a position to accept the prize personally,” he said. KOFM group content director Mike Byrne said teachers not being able to accept prizes “was not something that was on our radar” when the station committed to the competition. “We thought, do we continue, do we still do this, or do we bail out?” Mr Byrne said. “We decided to go ahead with this change [to award the trip to the school]. “We made that very clear on air and in our correspondence. We’ll adjust how we do things in the future. It’s a bit disappointing, but understandable.” Mr Byrne said he had believed the iPads would still go to students in Ms Sneath’s class. The station’s posts from May 3 said the “winning teacher will have the honour and prestige of being crowned best teacher and the school will score a trip to New York City and Apple iPad minis for the class”. The school posted on its own Facebook page on May 15 that “each child in the class will receive an iPad if [Ms Sneath] wins”. The spokesman said the school then advised parents on May 17 “if Ms Sneath won, the prizes would benefit the school as a whole”. It said the school issued a newsletter and flyer that said it could win “lots of iPads”. But some parents said this wording did not adequately communicate the changes. They said the school did not specify how the prizes would be distributed until May 25, the day before the station visited the school. Parents received a letter that day that said the school would hold a raffle to determine the winner of the New York City trip. "The money raised… will be split equally between the John Hunter Hospital paediatric oncology unit and the school,” it said. The letter also said the class set of iPads would be shared between all pupils. “The iPads will be an amazing asset for our school,” the letter said. “As Miss Sneath teaches 3S, they will be using the iPads on a regular basis. “They will become a school resource available to other classes as well.’’ One parent said she was “ropeable”. “They knew how much we were voting,” she said. “I had the kids voting as I was cooking dinner and I was voting to midnight after I put the kids to bed. I had my workmates voting, others had family overseas voting. “We wanted Shelley to have a holiday. Also, there are lots of families in that class who can’t afford an iPad and we thought it would be a fantastic thing for our children. They were told they were getting that iPad. “If we had known [about the changes], we would still have voted, but not as extensively as we did. “We just want them to right this terrible wrong.” Another parent said Ms Sneath’s class should have been asked what to do with the prizes. “The station handed the iPads to each student and said ‘These are yours to keep’ but they then had to hand them back,” the other parent said. “If the students won t-shirts or chocolate bars they would not have to share them with everyone. I think the Department of Education has seen what a bonus this is for the school.” Principal Karin Hird is understood to have written to the parents who complained to the department to say she would respond to their concerns “in due course”. Bonnells Bay P&C president Kylie Whitelam said it was unfortunate some parents had misunderstood the rules, but said she felt they had been “black and white”. “Everyone reads into things differently and is entitled to their own opinion, but there was no doubt in my mind that the prizes were going to the school,” she said. “Our amazing teacher has received recognition and the school has received positive publicity, but this was a community competition and this is a community gift to benefit all the children.” Ms Sneath wrote in the newsletter she was “truly humbled by the support and excitement that surrounded our school”. “It was fantastic to see everyone out enjoying the morning,” she wrote. “I would like to thank the parents in my class who nominated me and the parents in the wider school community that supported me through the whole process. “Special mention also must go to my colleagues and the executive team for their support throughout the competition. “Lastly, I would like to thank all of the BBPS students and in particular my class. “Thank you for making every day an exciting learning adventure.” Local Business Latest News War hero’s park trashed | PHOTOS Newcastle under fire | photos, video Trees come down for Supercars track | photos, video Social photos 2017 Statement from the Heart a ‘turning point’: Sean Gordon Editor's Picks Pasha Bulker memories flood back | photos A gentle man who endured with dignity The Elf on the Shelf in the Hunter | PHOTOS Popular Pasha Bulker memories flood back | photos WATCH LIVE: NHRU - Merewether VS Maitland Hearts are locked and loaded Searching for some Hunter hearts of gold A whole lotta love hearts Multimedia +more multimedia stories Photos Video Interactive The Hunter’s best restaurants in pictures | photos CHECK out the top picks from our Weekender diners.

Believe it or not, it’s IBM IBM, -0.41%  , which for years has represented in many investors’ eyes the kind of old, stodgy and washed-up company that nimble firms like Apple AAPL, +1.48%  run circles around. But a surprisingly large number of market-beating newsletters editors I monitor think that view is unfair. In essence, they argue that IBM is a growth company that trades like a value stock. Many of the newsletter editors credit IBM’s “Watson” for much of the company’s growth potential. Gray Cardiff, editor of the Sound Advice newsletter, describes Watson as IBM’s artificial intelligence “super computer that can ‘think’ like a human.” Notes Cardiff: “Watson cognitively scans a world of data and applies relevant information to what it learns about a company’s business and systems to create new revenue streams, reduce expenses, and make existing operations more efficient. We have only begun to see and imagine the uses of artificial intelligence. IBM is the leader in that field and on a solid path to provide a growing abundance of opportunities in the months and years ahead.” John Buckingham, editor of the Prudent Speculator newsletter, adds that “the growth opportunity for the company’s Strategic Imperatives is high. Watson continues to impress with deployments in Health Care, Internet of Things and Financial Services.” Despite such optimism, IBM stock in out of favor and trades solidly in the value camp. Its price/earnings ratio based on trailing 12 months’ earnings is 12.6, compared to almost double that for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37%  . IBM’s P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is even lower, at 11.1. The newsletter editors also are impressed with IBM’s high dividend yield — 3.9% currently — that provides investors with a nice cushion during the time those editors think it could take for the rest of the market to discover the stock’s potential. Also impressive to them is that, with IBM’s recent 10-cent increase in its quarterly dividend, the company has now raised its dividend in each of the last 22 years. Kelley Wright, editor of Investment Quality Trends, bases his recommendation of IBM on its dividend yield. In fact, he calculates that the stock wouldn’t become overvalued until it’s trading at $462 — which represents more than a triple from where IBM is trading today. Moreover, each of these advisers recommending IBM has a market-beating track record. John Buckingham’s Prudent Speculator, for example, has beaten the broad stock market by 1.7 percentage points annualized over the past 30 years. Though my performance monitoring service has been tracking Gray Cardiff’s and Kelley Wright’s newsletters for less time, they also have beaten the market: Wright’s market-topping margin over the past 20 years annualized is 2.6 percentage points, while Cardiff’s over the past 15 years is 1.7 points. For the record, I should emphasize that the newsletter editors I monitor don’t actively dislike Apple. Many are recommending it also. They just like IBM more.

Apple's Trademark Being Used In Pyongyang, Violating Copyright By Rishabh Jain On 06/02/17 AT 4:49 AM Close A state-owned North Korean company is advertizing a locally made tablet under the copyrighted name of Apple’s flagship tablet, the iPad, NK News reported citing the North Korean Foreign Trade magazine in which an ad for the tablet was published. "Ryonghung iPad is now popular among customers. It can perform a range of functions such as reading different sources of digital information, office work and documentation. And it also has more than 40 apps. The iPad has been certified by the local GMP system, and highly appreciated at the third national sci-tech festival and the national intellectual property products show in 2016," it continued. GMP stands for "Good Project Management" the copy read, ironically mentioning the product, which violates Apple’s copyright, was presented at a show with ‘intellectual property’ in its name — the National Intellectual Property products show. Read: iPad Pro 2017 Specs: 10.5-inch, 12.9-inch Models Have Different Mic Placement As Per Leaked Cases The tablet specs include a 1GHz CPU, 512MB RAM, 8GB internal memory, 16GB external Memory, an eight-inch screen and a battery, which the company claims lasts for 6 hours. Apple’s iPad comes with a warning against violating copyrights, which hasn’t made any difference to North Korea. “You may not use or register, in whole or in part, Apple, iPod, iTunes, Macintosh, iMac, or any other Apple trademark, including Apple-owned graphic symbols, logos, icons, or an alteration thereof, as or as part of a company name, trade name, product name, or service name except as specifically noted in these guidelines,” the company’s guidelines for its trademarks and copyrights read. “iPad” is mentioned as a registered Apple trademark on its website. To use the term on any products, manufacturers in any part of the world generally need to ask Apple’s permission to use the term for any products. The company is yet to respond on the breach of its copyright. Apple does have a history of taking other companies to court for the violation of its copyright. The company has fought a long patent war with Samsung and is currently suing Qualcomm over being forced to pay extra loyalties. With its history of litigiousness, it would be a surprise, if Apple does not take up the matter. That being said, this is not the first time North Korea has violated American copyrights, or even the first time it has infringed Apple’s products. The country uses a national Linux-based operating system, called the Red Star OS, which is suspiciously similar in its design to Apple’s OSX operating system. Read: North Korea Ready To Attack US? Pyongyang Sourced IRBM Engine Likely From Ukraine Or Russia, Report Says North Korea’s state-run economy generally does not follow international trade or intellectual property rules and therefore has become a grey market for very similar, copyright-infringing adaptations of products from major brands. The Ryonghung tablet was launched in North Korea in 2013, but at that time it was called “Ryonghung-trademarked tablet computer.” In 2015, the tablet was disassembled by a North Korean defector and it was found the memory chip was manufactured by SK Hynix, which actually makes chipsets for Apple products Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers," said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” According to Apple’s press release, subscriptions saw a 58% increase year over year, fueled by their availability in all 25 app categories. Games and Entertainment are the App Store’s top grossing categories, Lifestyle and Health and Fitness apps have experienced 70% growth, and the Photo and Video category is up over 90%. Apple’s press release also highlights the addition of iMessage apps and stickers with iOS 10. The timing of Apple’s press release is interesting coming just days before WWDC, its annual developer conference. Developer earnings have historically been covered as part of the WWDC opening-day keynote. One possibility is that this is a sign that the usual keynote updates are being compressed this year to make room for more product and operating system announcements than usual.

Valentina Palladino (US) - Jun 2, 2017 7:27 am UTC Enlarge reader comments 34 Share this story Ahead of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next week, a report from Bloomberg suggest the company could announce a long-rumoured, Siri-controlled smart speaker. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg that the device could be revealed as early as WWDC, but likely would not ship until later this year. Further ReadingGoogle Home review: A step forward for hotwords, a step backward in capability Details about the speaker are slim, but the report states the Siri-controlled smart speaker will have "virtual surround sound technology" and integration with Apple's existing product lineup. This would be Apple's first device to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home, both of which are vessels for each company's virtual assistant. Sources say Apple has been developing the speaker to be louder than its competition and to produce crisper sound overall. The device may also include "sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use." In addition to keeping up with Amazon and Google, a Siri-controlled speaker would also likely serve as a smart home hub for Apple HomeKit products. Currently only Apple TVs and iPads can fully control HomeKit lights, door locks, and other devices, so a home-based speaker would be a logical addition to a household already equipped with HomeKit products. The Bloomberg report also suggests a smart speaker from Apple could encourage loyal Apple Music subscribers to stick with the service. In the wake of slowing iPhone sales, services like Apple Music, which costs users £10 per month, have become more important to Apple. Neither Amazon Echo or Google Home officially support Apple Music, so this speaker would be the only at-home smart speaker that Apple Music subscribers could use to access their streamable music. Further ReadingAmazon Echo Show: Alexa-powered touchscreen speaker launches June 28 The design and price of Apple's speaker will be telling. Amazon has evolved the Echo family over time to include the original cylindrical speaker, shorter disk-like speakers, and most recently the touchscreen-equipped Echo Show that can make voice and video calls. Sources told Bloomberg that Apple's device won't have a display, so it may look more akin to the original Echo or Google Home. At £130, Google's device undercut Amazon's speaker on price when it first debuted, but there's no word on how much Apple's smart speaker could cost at launch.

Turn to Buffett wisdom By Rahul Oberoi , ETMarkets.com| Updated: Jun 02, 2017, 01.40 PM IST READ MORE ON » Warren BuffetttechnologyMarketFedExCharlie Mungercash flowApple Buffett says investors will do fine if they hold good businesses and “never look at short-term market moves.” Guru, guide and god – these are the words the investing community uses to describe billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Every single word from the ace investor is taken as prophetic and every action as a cue on investing. When Buffett talked about aviation stocks in his letter to shareholders this past February, aviation suddenly became a sector of investor interest. Everyone wanted to know why he suddenly started betting on a sector that looked all doom and gloom till the previous day. Buffett fans say his actions carry deeper messages, and his words are wisdom of life. We tried to decode some of them: Mistakes are part of life, accept it Whether it is you, me or Mr Buffett, anyone can make a mistake. The investment guru himself admitted this year that he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp “would do better” when he amassed 81 million shares of the company six years ago. Berkshire recently sold about one-third of that holding even as it bought a large stake in Apple, which Buffett said is more of a “consumer” company that a technology company. Keep learning John Rooney, an American sportscaster once said, “The quickest way to become an old dog is to stop learning new tricks.” So, keep learning and always remain in the league. Even 86-year-old Warren Buffett and 93-year-old Charlie Munger say they both try to continue learning and that shows up in the investment decisions they make for Berkshire Hathaway. Munger says Berkshire’s purchase of 133 million Apple shares shows Buffett is learning because for decades the Oracle of Omaha had resisted investing in technology companies. Buffett says he came to realise that Apple behaves more like a consumer products company than a tech company. So he became comfortable in investing in it. Get your financial plan and goals in place first Your financial plan and goals are cornerstones of your financial success. Even before you set out to decide where to invest your money, you need to know what you want it to do for you. Put down on paper or work on an excel sheet, your financial plan with future cash flow requirements. If you cannot do this on your own, identify a professional financial planner who can do this for you. If this is not done properly, failure is assured. Ability to accept changes One should not be rigid with their decisions. At 86 years of age and with robust track record, Mr Buffet still believes the market is supreme and his views can change depending on how conditions change. For instance, Buffett has defended Berkshire’s foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings. “It’s a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it’s a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 per cent or better of capacity for some time... it’s fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next five to 10 years than historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx or UPS.” Learn to say thank you If someone does a great job for you or community, then you must be thankful to him or her. For instance, during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder bash in Omaha last month, Buffett thanked Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group, for saving billions of dollars of investor money by creating index funds. In his address to the 53rd annual general meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett said index funds have bought down costs significantly for investors. Keep morale of employees and managers high For better productivity or results, you should not ignore praising your employees for good work. Buffett said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue. He says he believes it works better to hold employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Invest for the long term Buffett says investors will do fine if they hold good businesses and “never look at short-term market moves.” Be optimistic and make money Warren Buffett always says if you are optimistic, you will always make money. If you are associated with financial markets, buy assets which are growing, buy businesses which are cheap and those which are adding to productivity.

It stands out in a campus of gleaming glass and concrete structures where even the door handles are custom designed. So why did Apple recently construct an early-20th century barn in the shadow of its massive new "spaceship" campus? Here's a good picture from a recent drone flyover video filmed by Matthew Roberts.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple Park It turns out, the historic "Glendenning Barn" was on the land first, and after a former Cupertino mayor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook what the company planned to do with the barn in the early stages of construction, Apple carefully took it apart and put it back together, just the way it was constructed before.  The Glendenning barn, built in 1916, had previously survived several changes of ownership, as the land around it transformed from farmland owned by the Glendenning family, to orchards, to an HP office park, and now, to Apple's new headquarters.   The barn wasn't specifically protected by local law, but the Cupertino Historical Society tried to save it, and it was beloved by the site's previous owners, HP, which used it as a gathering place for beer bashes and picnics. "I’m anxious to one day see it again," Ed Miller, a former HP manager, told the Mercury News.  Apple will store sports equipment and landscaping supplies in the barn. But its value to Apple is more as a little piece of history that shows how Silicon Valley has changed. An environmental impact report commissioned by Apple in 2013 gives the full backstory of the land that Apple's "spaceship" campus now sits on:  The project site was occupied by Robert and Margaret Howie Glendenning beginning in the 1850s. The Glendennings, originally from Scotland, were one of the first European-Americans to homestead in Cupertino. In 1851, the couple began farming 160 acres of land, living initially in a tent on the land. After building a house and planting crops, the owners of the Alviso Land Grant laid claim to the property, and the Glendennings were compelled to purchase the land at $30 an acre. Margaret Glendenning finished the land payments upon the death of her husband in 1868.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple Barn By 1884, when Robert and Margaret’s children had come of legal age, the Glendenning property was divided among the family. Margaret Howie lived on the southern half of the property and the northern half was divided amongst the six Glendenning children: Mary, Margaret C. (Caroline), Ellen (Ella), Joe, Jim, and George. In 1888, approximately 60 acres of the property contained orchards and the remaining portion was utilized for grain and hay production. Margaret Howie had a house built on her property in 1889, where she lived with her daughters, Margaret C. Burrell and Ellen Glendenning. In 1914, Margaret Burrell obtained her mother’s parcel and her daughter and son-in-law, Grace and John Leonard, purchased the land. Leonard converted 48 acres of the property from dry-farming (hay and grain production) to irrigated orchards. It is thought that John Leonard built the Glendenning Barn around this time. The Leonards established a dehydrating and packing business on the property.  In 1964, Varian Associates purchased the Glendenning property from John Leonard and his son, Burrel. The Glendenning parcel was one of several family properties, including the Lester, Craft, and Orlando families, to be purchased by Varian. The Varian lands were pooled into the VALLCO land corporation, the name of which was derived from the first names of the principal parties involved in the sale. The Glendenning-Leonard acreages were the key parcels to be incorporated into VALLCO Park and became the site of the Varian building, the first constructed in the park. VALLCO continued minimal farming operations into the 1970s, but a master plan and associated development phased out farming. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple Barn VALLCO sold 46 acres to Hewlett-Packard in 1968, followed by another 50 acres in 1971. Aerial photographs from the 1980s show the barn, pump house, and windmill tower, but the Glendenning house built for Margaret Howie Glendenning, Margaret Burrell, and Ellen Glendenning was demolished in the early 1970s.16 The Hewlett-Packard and Ridgeview campuses were constructed in phases from the mid-1960s to late 1980s. Hewlett-Packard sold the 98-acre office park in November 2010 to Apple as part of its plan to consolidate employees at its Palo Alto campus. The property is just north of a 50-acre site Apple bought in 2006 and east of the main Apple campus. The properties purchased by Apple in 2006 and 2010 are part of the project site.   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Some of the biggest firms in the US have reacted with dismay to President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal. General Electric, Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Walt Disney were among corporate giants to condemn the move. Critics say the withdrawal, part of Mr Trump's "America first" policy, will hurt US companies' ability to work abroad and inhibit innovation. US coal firms welcomed the move, saying it would save jobs and ease regulation. The Dow Jones share index closed up 0.6% following the widely expected announcement. 'Not good' Before Mr Trump confirmed he would go ahead with his campaign pledge to withdraw, a slew of major companies issued statements urging him to remain in the deal. After the announcement, they expressed disappointment. Why is US business angry about climate deal decision? Watch: Can coal make a comeback under Trump? Exxon shareholders back 'historic' vote on climate "Climate change is real," tweeted Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE. "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Tesla boss Elon Musk confirmed he would quit two seats on White House advisory groups. He wrote on Twitter "Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world." Walt Disney chief executive Robert Iger said he too would quit an advisory role, while Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein used his first ever tweet to condemn the move. Other big firms, including Morgan Stanley, PepsiCo and Walmart, and major tech firms such as Apple and Google, issued statements on Thursday with several reaffirming their own commitments to protect the environment. Apple boss Tim Cook told the Financial Times: "I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the US in the agreement. But it wasn't enough. "I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment." 'They went wild' Under the deal, the US, which accounts for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emission, had committed to a 26% to 28% reduction from 2005 levels by 2025. The US also promised $3bn in aid to a United Nations fund to help poorer countries to tackle climate change problems. In his announcement on Thursday, Mr Trump said the deal, which involved voluntary commitments, put the US at a disadvantage. He said he would be willing to renegotiate under different terms. "The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement -- they went wild; they were so happy -- for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage," he said. "They don't put America first," he said. "I do, and I always will." 'Saving coal jobs' Some energy firms, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, had also pressed the administration to remain in the pact. But for the US coal lobby, the decision by Mr Trump to withdraw from the global Paris agreement on climate change was a win. Murray Energy, a coal mining company based in Ohio, applauded the move, describing it as an important part of the Trump administration's broader environmental agenda. "In following through on his promise, President Trump is supporting America's uncompromising values, saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the World," chief executive Robert Murray said in a statement. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The coal industry has welcomed the move Paul Bailey, the president of the coal lobbying organisation American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said the standards established under the previous Obama administration were too stringent. "We support President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement," he said. "Meeting President Obama's goal would have led to more regulations, higher energy prices, and dependence on less reliable energy sources." Market reaction Oil stocks such as ExxonMobil and Chevron climbed on Thursday, as did the overall market. The broad S&P 500 share index and the technology index, the Nasdaq, closed at new highs, having already been climbing throughout in the day in anticipation of strong employment figures due out on Friday. Investors had been expecting President Trump's announcement and analysts said it had already been factored into prices. Peabody Energy, the US's largest publicly traded coal company, saw its shares slide 0.66% on Thursday. Peabody welcomed the decision to leave the Paris accord. "We believe that abiding by the accord, without significant changes, would have substantially impacted the U.S. economy, increased electricity costs and required the power sector to rely on less diverse and more intermittent energy," the company said.

Also for smaller developers, being able to develop for multiple platforms simultaneously can be tiresome and expensive. That being said it seems that Apple’s iOS and Mac platforms appear to be making good money. During Apple’s recent earnings call, the company has announced that they’ve managed to pay out a whopping $70 billion to developers to date, and that App Store downloads have managed to increase by 70% year-on-year. Given that Apple takes more or less a 30% cut from apps sold in its App Store, it has been estimated that Apple might have made as much as $30 billion so far. According to Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller, “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers. Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” Recently Apple has been trying to get developers to start selling more in-app subscriptions and services, in which the company will take a reduced cut to make it more tempting. We’ve seen services such as Spotify express their displeasure at the 30% cut that Apple takes, which prompted them to encourage users to sign up via their website instead of the iTunes App Store.

Review our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy. Rubin believes that smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung have lost their edge in recent years, and customers have paid the price. As the now-CEO of startup Essential Products, Rubin’s response is a sleek smartphone simply named Phone. “One of the reasons I started this company is because I would go into a store and I wasn’t happy with any of the phones out there,” Rubin said at recode’s Code Conference in California on Tuesday. With Apple and Samsung accounting for 56% of the US smartphone market today, according to Counterpoint Research, Rubin complains that innovation has become “lumpy.” Gone are the days when phone makers were trying to coax first-time buyers into making the smartphone leap by pushing out flashy new features in quick succession. “Every six months there’d be some new technology out there,” Rubin told the conference-goers. “There’d be a higher-res display, there’d be a 3D camera, there’d be a faster processor. And was really a great time when the consumer saw the innovation that was happening.” Today, however, most of the innovation happens at rich firms like Apple and Samsung. The pair each release a new flagship model every two years, with more minor tweaks in the off-years. “The innovation is still happening, but it’s happening in these much more lumpy cycles,” Rubin said. Rubin’s $699 Phone -- available for preorder online -- runs Android, features a titanium unibody frame, edge-to-edge display, fast processor, and an antenna that works with any mobile network. Rubin plans to roll out new features faster than the big guys thanks to a magnetic connector on the back of the device. That tweak will allow users to wirelessly connect a wide range of accessories, without having to buy a whole new phone. It will also let them keep their add-ons even if they upgrade to a newer Phone with a different shape. Remember what happened to your iPhone dock once Apple dropped its original 30-pin iPhone charger? Or what happened to your favorite headphones once the headphone jack disappeared? This is a “much more powerful way to get technology and innovation into consumers’ hands quicker,” Rubin said. The first accessory available for Essential’s Phone is a 360-degree camera that clips onto the back of the device and acts like an internal camera, no configuration required. The add-on is barely larger than your thumb. Rubin claims it’s the world’s smallest high-quality 360 camera. Essential is promising more accessories to come. Meanwhile, the company plans to make the connector open source, allowing third-party companies to sell their own add-ons. The Phone will be sold directly to consumers, but, according to BayStreet Research, more than 92% of U.S. phone buyers today buy their device through their mobile carrier, so Rubin might have a tough task getting the masses to buy in. Production volume will likely be low at first. But Rubin sees niche-status as another advantage over the likes of Apple. It allows Essential to experiment with technologies that might not yet be ready to produce at scale. If Apple wants to introduce a new feature to the iPhone, Rubin says, it has to be ready to ship 50 million of them over the next quarter. The Phone is unlikely to topple Apple or Samsung, but it could cause the two to pay more attention. Apple added a Smart Connector to its iPad Pro line two years ago, but it never really pushed the idea beyond a few keyboard accessories. In theory, the smart connector could behave in a way similar to Rubin’s new connector. To make his point, Rubin’s next act won’t have to take over the world. He just has to make your phone a little more exciting.

The details have been reported by French site Consmac, and relate to regulatory filings made in a Russian-language regulatory filing. Five model numbers for personal computers carrying the Apple trademark are listed. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 36.32 +0.20 +0.55% The model numbers registered in this filing are A1289 A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481. The expectation is that these model numbers represent updates to a number of existing Mac machines rather than Apple recycling the model numbers; A1289 is the older boxlike Mac Pro, A1347 is the Mac mini, A1418 is the iMac, A1419 iMac, and A1481 is the cylindrical Mac Pro The inclusion of significantly older machines like the Mac Pro and the Mac mini clouds the issue of what exactly is being refreshed, but the obvious answer is that some of the Mac machines are going to join the MacBook line-up with an update to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chip architecture. There are already major signals that the three MacBook Pro machines announced in October 2016 will pick up the seventh-generation Intel chipsets. As previously discussed on Forbes, Apple’s decision to release one final iteration of MacBooks in 2016 with the sixth-generation Intel chips has meant the Windows 10 competition captured a lead in terms of specifications over the last six months. Apple has decided to risk upsetting the early adopters with a switch to Kaby Lake very early in this production cycle. © Provided by Forbes Media LLC Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar Patent drawing (USPTO) The filing also has a new number - A1843 - listed as  a wireless input device and handily referred to as a ‘keyboard’). There’s been less talk of a new Magic Keyboard from Apple, but a recently published patent shows a wireless keyboard with an adaptive input row that matches the design and implementation of the Touch bar, but on a standalone peripheral. For developers to make best use of the Touch Bar it needs to become a primary control area, something that cannot happen with legacy hardware. This new peripheral offers Apple a way to retrofit the Touch Bar to older Mac machines. The WWDC keynote starts at 10am Pacific this Sunday, the 5th of June. Any new or updated hardware should be announced during the expected two-hour long presentation. Keep watching Forbes’ Technology channel for all the news and analysis.

While the world is still reeling from the impact of this decision, leaders from Silicon Valley have spoken against this decision. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: June 2, 2017 1:50 pm US President Donald Trump has pulled his country out of the Paris Climate change agreement. Here are reactions of top tech leaders from Silicon Valley to the decision. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Russia President Vladimir Putin denies having compromising information on Donald Trump Over The Barrel: A note to the class of 2017 President Donald Trump has announced the United States of America will be pulling out of the Paris Climate change agreement. The President in a speech confirmed the US will no longer be a party to the Paris Accord of 2015. In his speech, President Trump said, “The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord and begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.” According to Trump, the United States “will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord,” and it will also end all the “implementation of the nationally determined contribution” including the Green Climate Fund, which, according to him, has cost the country “a vast fortune”. While the world is still reeling from the impact of the US pulling out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change, leaders from Silicon Valley have come out to speak against this decision. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has been very vocal about climate change, tweeted that he would be leaving the presidential councils in light of the decision. Musk tweeted, “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” Elon Musk has also tweeted articles about how India and China are trying to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is believed to be the number one source for pollutants and thus contributing to climate change. Musk tweeted an article on how China wants to produce clean electricity, saying: “Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.” On India, the Tesla CEO tweeted, “India commits to sell only electric cars by 2030. It is already the largest market for solar power.” Also read: Donald Trump pulls US out of Paris Climate Agreement: Here’s the full text of his statement Apple CEO Tim Cook has also spoken out against the decision. Cook tweeted, “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change, and we will never waver.” According to a report on CNN, Tim Cook also sent out a message to Apple employees assuring them the US government’s decision wouldn’t mean that Apple would stop caring about the environment and climate change. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 The report on CNN quotes Tim Cook’s message as saying, “I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment.” The report also says Tim Cook had spoken to President Trump in the hope of keeping US from leaving the Paris deal. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also tweeted against President Trump’s decision. He wrote, “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also voiced his criticism, saying it was bad for the economy and puts “our children’s future at risk.” Facebook’s co-founder wrote on his personal page, “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy…” adding as a company they had committed that every new data center built by them will be “powered by 100% renewable energy.” “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late,” he wrote. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also criticised the decision, saying “climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action”. He said Microsoft is committed to fighting this, and shared a letter by Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, which has discussed this issue at length. “In the past few months, Microsoft has actively engaged the Trump Administration on the business case for remaining in the Paris Agreement. We’ve sent letters to and held meetings on this topic with senior officials in the State Department and the White House. And in the past month, we’ve joined with other American business leaders to take out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and New York Post, urging the Administration to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement,” says Smith’s letter. Microsoft in its letter adds climate change demands global attention , and the company says they wish to keep their operations 100 per cent carbon neutral. “We remain steadfastly committed to the sustainability, carbon and energy goals that we have set as a company and to the Paris Agreement’s ultimate success,” concludes the letter.

If your iPhone isn’t as fast as you’d like it to be, your first thought might be to take it to the closest Apple Store. But why spend an hour or more at the Apple Store (more if there isn’t one close to you) when you can speed up your iPhone from your computer chair or couch in a matter of seconds. You don’t need to be an Apple Genius or even an expert to speed up your iPhone right now. All you need is a few seconds during a quiet part of the day. If your iPhone is starting to feel sluggish, try one of these remedies. Some of these will work better than others so you might need to use trial and error until you find the right combination for you and your iPhone. Restart Your iPhone A simple restart could have a significant impact on your device’s speed, especially if you haven’t turned it off in awhile. To shut off your phone, hold down the power button until the prompt appears. Follow the on-screen instructions and power your iPhone down. Wait a minute and then hold the power button down again to power the phone back on. Clear Space If you’ve owned your iPhone for awhile you’ve probably collected a ton of clutter on your device’s hard drive. If you’re anywhere close to your hard drive’s threshold, you’ll want to do some cleanup. Freeing up space could speed up your iPhone. To get started you’ll want to head into Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and select Manage Storage. From that screen you can determine what can stay and what needs to go. Maybe it’s a game you no longer play, a video you no longer watch, or hundreds of photos you no longer need. You should be able to find something to delete. Deleting your messages could save you a ton of space and help speed up your iPhone. If you notice your Messages taking up multiple GBs of storage, it might be a good idea to get that under control. To cut down on the amount of saved messages on your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages and scroll down to the Message History section. Tap on Keep Messages and select 1 Year or 30 Days. This will delete any messages older than a year or 30 days so make sure to save the photos and videos from within those messages that you wish to keep. Clear Browser Cookies & Data You can also free up some memory by clearing your browser’s cookies and data. If you use Safari go into your iPhone’s Settings > Safari > and scroll down to where it says Clear History and Website Data. Tap that. Clearing this will remove your browsing history, cookies, and other data from Safari. History will also be cleared from any devices signed into your iCloud account. If you can handle that, tap Clear History and Data again. If you’re using Google Chrome on your iPhone, you’ll want to head into the app itself and tap the three vertical circles in the top right corner. From there, tap Settings > Privacy > Clear Browsing Data. There, you can select what you wish to delete. If you’re noticing serious lag on your iPhone it might be a good idea to start clean. Select them all (you’ll notice a check mark on the right once you’ve done this) and then click Clear Browsing Data. Install the Latest Software If you failed to install iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 and you haven’t install iOS 10.3.2 on your iPhone, you’ll want to consider it. Apple’s iOS 10.3 update delivered a brand new file system called APFS. If you chose not to install iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.2 will automatically convert your device’s filesystem from HFS+ to APFS. Installing iOS 10.3.2 and APFS could improve your device’s boot time (the time it takes for the phone to go from an off state to on), the overall speed (our iPhone 5 feels faster with iOS 10.3.2 and APFS on board), and a bump in storage which, again, could improve your device’s speed. The move to iOS 10.3.2 might seem daunting for those of you with older iPhone models on older versions of iOS. If you’re straddling the fence, take a look at our full list of reasons to install the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone right now. Turn Off Animations Turning off some of your iPhone’s animations and transitions could deliver a nice little bump to your device’s overall speed. To reduce Motion Effects, go into your iPhone’s  Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle Reduce Motion on. Toggling this on will disable some features like the bubble effect in the Messages app. While you’re there, you’ll also want to reduce the transparency and blur effects on your iPhone to. This could help your iPhone’s GPU. To Reduce Transparency on your iPhone, tap Increase Contrast and then tap the toggle to turn on the Reduce Transparency function. Disable Widgets Try cutting down on the amount of active widgets to see if that gives your iPhone a speed boost. If you have a lot of widgets active on your iPhone, they could be hogging your device’s precious resources and thus, hampering its overall speed. To start killing off widgets, swipe to the right while you’re on your iPhone’s home screen. Scroll all the way to bottom of the list of widgets and select Edit. Disable iPhone widgets to improve your device’s speed. You’ll be taken to a new screen where you should see a long list of services and apps. These are your widgets. If a widget is active, you’ll notice a red circle with a minus sign to the left of its name. If it’s inactive, you’ll see a green plus. To remove a widget, tap the red circle with the minus sign and tap Remove. You can remove all of them or a few as needed. Delete Apps We also recommend getting a handle on your applications. Just because you’re no longer using an application doesn’t mean that it’s no longer sucking up your device’s precious resources. If you no longer need an application, get rid of it. If for some reason you decide you still want it on your iPhone, you can always re-download it from the App Store. Kill Processes in the Background If you aren’t good at managing the apps and services on your iPhone there’s a good chance some of your apps and services have become resource hogs. Getting a handle on your items running in the background could pay dividends. The first service to look at is Background Refresh. When Background Refresh is flipped on, your apps will be refreshed with new information while running in the background. It’s nice but it might be the cause of your lag. If you don’t need instant data, go to your Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle Background Refresh off. This will completely kill the service. If you’d prefer to whitelist some apps, go down your list and toggle Background Refresh off for individual applications. If you have Automatic Downloads turned on, you might have apps downloading new content in the background. To disable Automatic Downloads, go to your Settings > iTunes & App Stores > and toggle Music, Apps, Books & Audiobooks, and Updates off. Wipe Your Device If these quick fixes don’t help you speed up your iPhone in seconds, it’s time to press the red button and go nuclear. If you’re using an older phone like the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4s, it might be time to wipe the phone and start from scratch. We recently did this on our iPhone 5 and the results were fantastic. It feels 100x faster than it did before. Restoring your iPhone will take more than a few seconds to complete because you’ll need to start by making a backup. Once you backup your iPhone, you’ll want to head to Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings to get started. For additional support, take a look at our full length guide. Go to Apple Contacting Apple support on Twitter is an option but we recommend taking your iPhone to the nearest Apple Store so Apple Geniuses can run diagnostics. Appointments fill up quickly so if your situation is dire, you’ll want to try a book a visit as soon as you possibly can. Buy a New iPhone If all else fails, it might be time to buy a new phone. Devices like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c will probably see their software support end here in a few weeks. In other words, you won’t be able to count on Apple and its iOS updates to fix your lag or sluggishness. The iPhone 7 is Apple’s fastest phone but for those on a budget, you might take a look at the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are still plenty fast with iOS 10.3.1 on board and they’re worth a look if you can no longer deal with your device’s speed. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.2 & 10 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 14 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.2 brings (by our count) 23 security patches for a potential exploits. That's a ton for a small maintenance update and a great reason to install iOS 10.3.2 in the near future. Your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring even more security features if you failed to download previous versions of iOS. If you skipped iOS 10.3.1, your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring its security patch. If you skipped iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.2 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device.    1 / 14 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 7 Things to Know About the iPhone 5s iOS 10.3.2 Update We’ve been taking a close look at Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update and today we want … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 Update The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update is a small but important release for the former flagship. … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPad iOS 10.3.2 Update Its been a little over two weeks since the iOS 10.3.2 update release for the iPad, iPad Ai… 06/02/2017 6 min read Load More In Apple 1 Comment One Comment driving directions maps 06/02/2017 at 12:37 am These tips are useful to speed up my iPhone fastly.

Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, which last month became the first ever US company to be valued at more than $800bn (£621bn), tweeted that the US President’s decision was “wrong for our planet”. “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver,” he said.

Amazon tweeted from its main corporate account that it “continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change”. “We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers.” Read more US choice to pull out of Paris accord labelled foreign policy blunder Macron says there is 'no Plan B' after Trump pulls out of Paris accord Theresa May tells Trump she is 'disappointed' at Paris withdrawal Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated despite Trump's claims, says France, Germany and Italy in joint statement Beyond the technology space, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, appeared to use his first ever tweet to condemn the President’s move: “Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the US's leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement”. Goldman Sachs has traditionally been cautious when commenting on political matters but in January Mr Blankfein became one of the first Wall Street executives to speak out against Mr Trump’s immigration ban. Several former Goldman Sachs executives are working in the President’s administration, including Gary Cohn, the chief operating officer of the bank, who is Mr Trump’s chief economic adviser, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who was chief information officer at Goldman. Overnight Disney boss Bob Iger became the latest chief executive to quit Mr Trump’s business advisory council, protesting against the withdrawal. Mr Iger wrote on Twitter that “as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal”. He joins Tesla chief executive Elon Musk who earlier tweeted: “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world". Technology companies have been among the most vocal to oppose some of Mr Trump’s controversial policies and in February Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit the council after the administration implemented the travel ban.

Previous Next Tom Hughes played the charismatic, psychotic, rat-catcher/killer. But the woman he was stalking seemed just as unhinged in Paula, by Jim Shelley By Jim Shelley for MailOnline Published: 03:18 EDT, 2 June 2017 | Updated: 04:46 EDT, 2 June 2017 e-mail 16 View comments Paula was so deranged it was like watching a sixty-minute trailer promoting the BBC’s expertise in bleak, bonkers, thrillers. As tradition required, it involved a solitary maverick detective, an unfeasibly handsome killer, and a good-looking middle-class woman who lived alone in a creepy, badly lit, house with an enormous basement. It was so hysterical it could have been made up of clips from other series – the bits too ludicrous even for Luther, Apple Tree Yard, The Fall, The Replacement, Doctor Foster, or Silent Witness. Deranged: Paula was so deranged it was like watching a sixty-minute trailer promoting the BBC’s expertise in bleak, bonkers, thrillers It even featured a hooded psycho re-creating the Greatest Hits of ‘Balaclava Man’ from Line Of Duty so accurately he could have been a tribute act. ‘This is nuts !’ concluded ‘Mac’ the detective investigating the gruesome handiwork of the handyman James, who had not only seen to the rats in Paula’s basement but her married lover, Philip the PE teacher.

Like romance, chivalry was dead judging by the way JP and... Share this article Share ‘Do you not think I’ve got enough crazy s**t in my life?!’ Paula complained to her drop out brother Callum. (This was before James torched the garage he was living in and hospitalised him with three degree burns.) We knew how they felt but just because writer Conor McPherson had the characters commenting on how mad it was didn’t that it wasn’t. Troubled: As tradition required, it involved a solitary maverick detective, an unfeasibly handsome killer, and a good-looking middle-class woman who lived alone in a creepy, badly lit, house with an enormous basement Bad times; It was so hysterical it could have been made up of clips from other series – the bits too ludicrous even for Luther, Apple Tree Yard, The Fall, The Replacement, Doctor Foster, or Silent Witness ‘We’re all crazy ! The whole lot of us !’ her brother had retorted. This was certainly true in Paula, where the victim and the cop seemed almost as unhinged as the killer, who we will no doubt be expected to sympathise with in next week’s finale because of his traumatic childhood. Paula had already started to have the same disturbing dreams as James, and similar violent fantasies. ‘If they told me it was legal and I could have an hour with him… she seethed when Mac told her the police didn’t have enough evidence to arrest James for either attack and that he’d been keeping one of the women he lived with locked in a cupboard. ‘I wouldn’t want him chained up either. I’d fight him and f***ing kill him !’ Unhinged: This was certainly true in Paula, where the victim and the cop seemed almost as unhinged as the killer, who we will no doubt be expected to sympathise with in next week’s finale because of his traumatic childhood Bonkers: It was so hysterical it could have been made up of clips from other series – the bits too ludicrous even for Luther, Apple Tree Yard, The Fall, The Replacement, Doctor Foster, or Silent Witness She seemed to have forgotten she’d already had more than an hour with him – and certainly hadn’t had any complaints, let alone wanted to kill him. Mac didn’t seem too alarmed by Paula’s unbalanced rants about vengeance, New Year’s Eve, or her psycho-sexual revelations. ‘You do know that after everything you’ve been through it would be recommended that you really tried to see someone - like a counselor,’ he suggested. This was sound advice but a bit much considering Paula had completed her hat-trick by copping off with him too. Serious problem: She seemed to have forgotten she’d already had more than an hour with him – and certainly hadn’t had any complaints, let alone wanted to kill him ‘I’ll be alright,’ she assured him. ‘I tell you why. Because I don’t have feelings Mac - not proper ones. I’m serious. It’s like I know the whole world is there but I’m not interested in any of it.’ She explained that as a child playing games with her brother her ‘favourite thing’ had been to be the prisoner. ‘Callum practised his knots on me. I was always wanting to be locked up. I didn’t care if I was rescued or not.’ One night when she was 12 they camped out in the back garden and she got Callum to put a skipping rope round her neck ‘and pull it tighter and tighter.’ Woes: One night when she was 12 they camped out in the back garden and she got Callum to put a skipping rope round her neck ‘and pull it tighter and tighter' Fuming: She explained that as a child playing games with her brother her ‘favourite thing’ had been to be the prisoner She passed out. ‘It was the strangest thing. I went to some other place - like some other city in a different, older, time. I lived with another family. They really loved me. I lived with them for years. I grew up with them. And it was like this life had all been a f**king bad dream.’ When she woke up, she was on the kitchen table having been revived by her father. ‘I was back five minutes later but I had been away for years Mac, I really had,’ she said even though she really hadn’t. Solemn: ‘I was back five minutes later but I had been away for years Mac, I really had,’ she said even though she really hadn’t' Not now: The look on Mac’s face told you he was thinking: ‘now you tell me. After we’ve slept together' ‘The weird part is when I’m with someone – physically – I can see it all again. Where I was. It gets me in trouble Mac.’ The look on Mac’s face told you he was thinking: ‘now you tell me. After we’ve slept together.’ On the other hand, one thing we’ve learnt from shows like The Affair and Marcella is that women as disturbed as this are always great in bed. Paula must have been. Mac was still semi-obsessed with her – as James was – even after James had sliced his eye open. Great: On the other hand, one thing we’ve learnt from shows like The Affair and Marcella is that women as disturbed as this are always great in bed Obsessions: Mac was still semi-obsessed with her – as James was – even after James had sliced his eye open This was after James had dressed up as Balaclava Man and attacked Paula in the Ladies toilets of the bar where she and Mac were having a drink. The ensuing fight saw Paula stab James in the shoulder, discharge all the bullets from Mac’s gun (incredibly without hitting either of them), before a chase that ticked off every cliché from Mac and James rolling around in the sea to the cop being clipped by a car as he crossed the road in hot pursuit. ‘What are we doing eh? The two lover boys?!’ James roared dementedly as he pinned Mac down and held a knife to his eye. ‘She’s done it you too hasn’t she? She’s shown you the steps out of hell.’ Fury: ‘What are we doing eh? The two lover boys?!’ James roared dementedly as he pinned Mac down and held a knife to his eye. ‘She’s done it you too hasn’t she? She’s shown you the steps out of hell' This was certainly one way of putting it. ‘And into the light !’ James continued, slashing Mac’s eyelid. What it was about Paula that attracted such madness was hard to tell. Earlier Philip’s wife had also attacked Paula claiming: ‘for some reason I can’t help thinking you opened up a door into his life and let all the bad things in.’ The connection between Paula and the little sister that was haunting James remained unexplained too. Haunting: The connection between Paula and the little sister that was haunting James remained unexplained too Paula obviously reminded James of her – although not enough to stop him from sleeping with Paula. Why James had cut the cop’s eye and then sat waiting to be arrested was anyone’s guess. At least it seemed to have finished things off but given that there was still one episode to go anything was possible – except something that made sense.  Remember: Paula obviously reminded James of her – although not enough to stop him from sleeping with Paula Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Graphic footage of London attack victim with serious neck injury Shocking dashcam footage shows people fleeing scene of terror attack Hero Londoners try to save victims of city's latest terror attack Bloodied man led to safety through a cordon of armed police Moment gunshots are heard outside a restaurant in London Bridge Police tell drinkers to 'get down immediately' in London bar Exclusive: Armed police order people to the floor in Barking Horrific moment man randomly hits 90-year-old with cane in NYC Shocking moment woman blocks young boy from brutal crash This cat wants out!

Apple said June 1, 2017, it has paid out more than $70 billion to app developers since opening its App Store in 2008, and that the ecosystem is still growing. (AFP/Glenn Chapman) Apple said Thursday it has paid out more than $70 billion to app developers since opening its App Store in 2008, and that the ecosystem is still growing. "People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, in  a statement ahead of next week's annual developer conference by the iPhone maker. "Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can't wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference." Apple said downloads have grown over 70 percent over the past 12 months, fueled by hit games like Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run. Read also: Apple opens first official store in SE Asia Apple, which faces a growing challenge in the mobile space from the dominant Google Android system, has been tweaking its business model as part of an effort to keep developers in its ecosystem. In addition to payment for downloads, Apple allows developers to use a subscription model across all 25 app categories. The company said active paid subscriptions are up 58 percent year over year. "Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including longtime favorites such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight," an Apple statement said.

Image: akatz/Shutterstock In a move that will reset efforts to save the planet, US president Donald Trump has announced he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. Tech leaders have responded in shock to US president Donald Trump’s retrograde decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on combatting climate change. The decision to take the US out of the pivotal global accord has prompted Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to pull out of presidential councils that he was involved in. ‘Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy and it puts our children’s future at risk’ – MARK ZUCKERBERG Top Silicon Valley leaders, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have urged the president to reconsider his actions. Yesterday, on the White House Lawn, Trump announced: “We’re getting out.” He described the agreement as draconian, claiming that it placed unfair financial and economic burdens on the US. “In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,” he confirmed. Trump said the US would begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris Agreement or a “new transaction” on terms more advantageous to the country. The Paris Agreement is a global action plan by nearly 200 countries to work together on what is arguably the biggest issue endangering life on Earth: global warming. The end of the world as we know it? Tech giants from Apple to Facebook have made environmental protection their top stated goals, using renewable energy to power offices, stores and data centres. In response to Trump’s announcement, 25 tech companies including Adobe, Apple, Salesforce and Intel took out newspaper ads urging the US president to reconsider. In a letter signed by the 25 companies, they said: “Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy in many ways. “US business is best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg implored Trump not to walk away from the accord: “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy and it puts our children’s future at risk. For our part, we’ve committed that every new data centre we build will be powered by 100pc renewable energy. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late.” The March for Science group, an organisation set up to defend science integrity at a time when politicians are attempting to discredit scientists, also decried Trump’s decision. “Science was ignored today. The decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement stands in stark opposition to the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is a real and active threat to communities around the world and to future generations. The group said that the decision is out of step with the views of the majority of Americans in all 50 states who support US actions in this field, and surrenders the role of America as a leader in the fight against climate change. It warns that vulnerable communities will suffer disproportionately in the face of US inaction. “In addition, the fact that this decision was made without the input of a presidential science adviser – a position that, like most of the key scientific leadership positions in the administration, remains unfilled – is deeply troubling to all those who care about the role of science in informing policy.” In Ireland, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Denis Naughten, TD, hit out at Trump’s decision. “We are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and we all have a responsibility to address climate change within our respective capabilities,” Naughten said. “I am therefore extremely disappointed and concerned that the United States has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. “The previously strong ambition shown by the United States played a major role in mobilising global ambition and achieving the agreement reached by 195 parties in Paris in 2015. “This is a major setback for the international community and it is essential that the decision of the United States does not weaken global resolve,” Naughten said. Tech leaders such as Benioff, Apple’s Tim Cook, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Google’s Sundar Pichai and others also spoke out on Twitter against Trump’s decision. Here are some of their reactions: Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part. https://t.co/Gfu7P2ESlL — Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) June 1, 2017 Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change. pic.twitter.com/cmCLf9CoVY — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o — jack (@jack) June 1, 2017 We all live on a small planet and every nation needs to work with others to protect it.  https://t.co/RJHTlwgl5X — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 With so many things America needs to make substantial progress on, it's incredibly disappointing to see us regress in significant areas. — Aaron Levie (@levie) June 1, 2017 US president Donald Trump.

The technology giant's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) begins on Monday, where chief executive Tim Cook could also reveal a new iPad and additions to the MacBook laptop and Mac desktop computer lines. Reports claim the Cupertino-based firm may also use the event to introduce a smart home speaker featuring its virtual assistant Siri, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The voice-activated hubs have become extremely popular with consumers, and rival Microsoft has already revealed plans to enter the market with a speaker containing its own virtual assistant, Cortana. Mr Cook will deliver the keynote address to open the event, which traditionally is used to discuss forthcoming updates to iOS, which powers the iPhone and iPad, as well as desktop computer operating system MacOS. The updates often provide a preview of what to expect from Apple's next iPhone - due to be announced in September and which will mark the tenth anniversary of the phone's launch. Rumours have also suggested a new line of Mac desktop computers and an update to the MacBook laptop could be discussed. Updates to the Apple Watch, including possible new health and fitness tracking features, are also likely to be among the announcements in California. WWDC will also be the first event since the company began moving into its new multibillion-dollar headquarters, Apple Park, which first opened its doors to employees in April. The keynote could feature more details on Apple's environmental plans for the new campus. Several thousand developers attend the five-day event, which also features technical sessions and hands-on time with the new software for those in attendance.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Plans Product Tour Research Topics Request Pricing For Smart-Home Speakers, a Possible New Competitor Apple reportedly plans a speaker product June 2, 2017 | Advertising & Marketing Share Email Print Apple is reportedly manufacturing a smart-home speaker that will compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. The manufacturing giant is expected to debut the new speaker at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 next week, Bloomberg reports. However, it’s not slated to ship until later this year. The smart-home space is an area that Apple has yet to penetrate. Apple is looking to differentiate its new device from its rivals by offering virtual surround sound technology, as well as tight integration with its many products, like its internet of things ecosystem HomeKit. The new smart-home speaker is also likely to help boost another service the company has been continually focusing on: Apple Music. But Apple faces some tough competition. Amazon has been seeing a lot of success with its Echo line of devices, which are powered by Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant system. In fact, sales of Echo devices surged more than ninefold over last year’s holiday season. “Apple can compete with its rivals if the speaker is reasonably priced and if the company can present a compelling value proposition for why it is a top choice,” said eMarketer principal analyst Victoria Petrock. “For a long time, Apple has viewed smartphones and watches as the true intelligent connectivity hub. It seems they are rolling this device out to provide a larger-scale experience that extends that hub. “Two big things Apple has going for it are brand loyalty and seamless product compatibility,” she added. “There are a lot of consumers who are loyal to the brand and who would love to see uncomplicated integration between their iPhones and iPads, Apple TVs and Apple speaker devices.” So far, Amazon’s Echo and the Invoke smart speaker from Harman Kardon/Microsoft are being built to incorporate voice calling and messaging, but these devices are not as seamlessly integrated with smartphones the same way as the Apple speaker could be. Integration between devices manufactured by different brands is often clunky and raises major compatibility issues. “To some, it may be comforting to know there is an Apple speaker out there that will seamlessly integrate with the iPhone and Apple family of products,” said Petrock. “It remains to be seen whether Apple will pursue an exclusive product compatibility strategy, or one in which it makes products from other manufacturers compatible with its HomeKit platform.” While still far from hitting mass adoption, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa are becoming more widely used by Americans. According to eMarketer estimates, 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year—that’s a jump of 128.9% over 2016. eMarketer expects Amazon’s Echo speaker will control 70.6% of the US market this year. Meanwhile, Google Home will trail significantly with a 23.8% share. The remaining share will be portioned among smaller players, such as Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. —Rimma Kats New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week US Ad Fraud 2017 Buyers and sellers now have to worry about more advanced forms of fraud siphoning away digital display ad dollars.

Apple is expected to extend its Siri voice-activated helper beyond the iPhone to a sleek new speaker. Credit: Apple Most Popular Agencies and brands suddenly have plenty of questions for Siri, which Apple is expected to extend from the iPhone to a new home-assistant device at its conference for developers next week. Marketers and publishers are eager to see where they could fit into the device, but right now all they know is the world of Amazon and Google's assistants, where they've accumulated plenty of experience developing programs to answer consumers' commands. Apple is late to the party. It also traditionally maintains tighter control over its ecosystem than its rivals. "Amazon and Google have allowed broad third-party support, but brands may want to temper their expectations for any Siri additions," said Jon Reiling, AKQA's head of emerging technology for Atlanta and Washington, D.C., in an e-mail. "If their previous implementation of third-party Siri integration is anything to go by, Apple's concern for multilingual support, privacy and user experience means that they will remain gatekeepers for many elements of the user interaction." So far, brands have taken most to Amazon, because its Alexa controls 70% of the voice-enabled speaker market in the U.S., according to eMarketer. Alexa can take voice commands to order a Lyft, send a text message through AT&T, reserve a table through OpenTable and play videos from Amazon's library. Brands have the potential to score big when they become the go-to habit in a voice-assisted service. "We've built prototypes for brands on Alexa and are working on one for Google Assistant," Azher Ahmed, exec VP-director of digital at DDB Chicago, said in an e-mail. The agency's emphasis is on services that naturally make sense for the way people use assistants and offer some kind of value, he said, as opposed to gimmicks designed just to force a brand's way onto a cool new platform. Ahmed declined to identify the brands for which DDB is developing home-assistant apps. Related Stories Google Will Promote Its AI Assistant Home in a Super Bowl Spot Steve Smith Gets an Assist From Alexa in Amazon Echo's New Spot Apple's Siri speaker will likely feature the "usual spit and polish" one expects from the hardware maker, Reiling said. Reports have indicated that the speaker will offer sound quality above Amazon and Google's devices. Still, Siri does not have a reputation as the smartest smart assistant, and both Google and Amazon have superior machine learning technology. "Siri must differentiate in broad ways, beyond hardware," Reiling said. "The assistant is too quick to frustrate and too easy of a punchline." Third-party developers could be the key to Apple's home-controlling devices, and it will look to dominate like it has with its app store, which has been the most innovative and lucrative. On Thursday, Apple said the App Store generated $70 billion for third-party developers since it first opened. There will be room for that base of developers to build for Siri in the home. "If Apple releases this platform in the same way they released their watch and the iMessage platform, a native app developer will be able to simply build an extension for their app," Christian Brucculeri, CEO of Snaps, an Apple iPhone developer, said in an e-mail. "This would make sense as it'll allow Apple to leverage its massive installed app base to populate its speaker with experiences with the least amount of friction for consumers and developers." But Apple often prefers its own services for music and other forms of media. That could make it hard, if not impossible, for Spotify and others to integrate with Siri in the home. Apple, of course, has Apple Music. In this article: A.I.

Their TaptoLearn app launched in May 2010 and their first game was shipped in June 2010. It went on to become one of the top 25 grossing games in the world, and would eventually lead to the next big break for the company. Written by Shruti Dhapola | New Delhi | Updated: June 2, 2017 11:57 am June Software’s founder Roby John credits the close working relationship with Apple in helping them understand how to plan games for the future. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected India is currently the second largest internet user base in the world, with 355 million (Mary Meeker’s 2017 report), just behind China. This is also the market where most of the traffic is driven by mobile web, with the majority of users relying on their phones to access internet. But the proliferation of smartphones hasn’t always translated into easy monetization for app developers. The idea of paying for apps, including mobile games, is something that is yet to catch up. For game developers like June Software, which has seen its fair share of success in the US market, the Indian market is just starting to change. June Software is a Silicon Valley-based company, which actually started in India. They have been developing games, including education-based games, for Apple’s iOS since 2007. Games like Ninjump Dash, MaskGun, Maths vs Zombies, have bought the company success. “We started in 2007, when the first iPhone came out. December is when we made our first app, December 2008. We had 900 downloads on the first day. That’s when we realised the power of the iOS platform, and decided to shift,” explains Roby John, one of the three founders of June software. He explains the company’s big break was when the iPad launched in 2010.  “We thought it was something that was very interesting. When the iPad came out, I realised it can be used to grab the student’s attention, also measure the retention,” says Roby, who has a background in the education, teaching world. June’s TaptoLearn platform launched in May 2010, and June 2010 they shipped the first game from this platform. It went on to become one of the top 25 grossing games in the world, and would eventually lead to the next big break for the company. As Roby explains, the success with the iPad and TapToLearn showed them the real pace of monetization possible on iOS. June Software’s TaptoLearn launched in May 2010 and their first game was shipped in June 2010. “We got great feedback when we went to schools in the US,” he adds. June Software would eventually shift base to Silicon Valley. In 2012, they managed to get into Y Combinator, and in 2012 raised money to from Silicon Valley investors. “When we went into Y Combinator, we had half a million installs. After that we had 3 million, which shows what it did for us,” explains June’s founder. For this gaming company, the link with Apple and its iOS platform also helped boost success. Roby cites a 2012 meeting with Lauren Powell Jobs, the wife of late Steve Jobs. “To actually meet the first family of Apple was a two-year journey for us. It told us anything and everything is possible. They have great confidence in our abilities, and the quality of our games kept improving,” he adds. June’s founder also says the key to survival in the gaming app industry is centred around adapting. “Most companies in this space have kind of died. We focus on free to play category, and one kind of genre: real-time gaming. Why real-time gaming? We think this is the hardest category. In 2013, we saw it as the future,” he explains. Roby credits the close working relationship with Apple in helping them understand how to plan for the future. The company has also won a prize as one of the oldest developer in the App Store, and has seen over 70 million installs worldwide. He explains that Apple’s WorldWide Developer Conference (WWDC) is one important stage for developers to get a headstart on how to plan for future products. “One of the ideas with WWDC is to show our team members that the top game are being made by people just like you. You can get insider tips on what to do, and what not to do. That is really what you get from Apple WWDC: learning from your peers,” he says. The other value for developers is understanding things from Apple’s side. “See Apple has a lot of its own developers, and APIs, but there is a core thinking behind all of this. If you understand this core thinking, you can plan your products better,”says Roby. June software brought their games to India in 2015-16, but here they have gone for a different strategy by relying on some popular cartoon figures like Chhota Bheem and Motu Patlu. According to him, the advantage of WWDC is that developers get to know what’s coming next from Apple, how it will affect their game, upcoming payment methods, the kind of marketing they can do. “From a developer perspective you want all the possible access to WWDC,” he says, given it means three to five months advance notice for future products. June software brought their games to India in 2015-16, but here they have gone for a different strategy by relying on some popular cartoon figures like Chhota Bheem and Motu Patlu. “So India is home ground advantage for us. From a distribution perspective, we’ve tied up with Nazara, which owns the rights for Chota Bheem and Motu Patlu IP (Intellectual Property) and built games on those. We take our existing games and built on around those properties. Chhota Bheem Race and Chhota Bheem Talking Toy which went to be number one on the AppStores briefly, and we’ve seen over 12 million installs in India,” says Roby. For the developers, the Indian market is still a work in progress. For example, their game MaskGun has not yet launched in India, because it requires high-speed internet, and a high-end device for optimal experience. However, Roby admits, the devices have gotten better, and so has internet connectivity and data usage, which will work well for their real-time multiplayer games in the future. June Software has also partnered with telecom carriers in India, helping curate stores, which has helped them gain more perspective around this market, and write games around the market. “We’ve started using Chota Bheem to repackage some of our TapToLearn stuff in India. We think from a schools perspective, in the US it is very easy to sell it to schools, they are outlined to a district. But in India, it is largely private, so you’ll need a large sales force on the ground,” he explains. Roby thinks India needs a good model for payment, and Apple’s subscription model is one such way of changing this. “If you see the app store, the top grossing games are free to play games thanks to in-apps payments,” he explains. He think there is huge potential in India, even for paid apps, and this will start to grow in the coming year. In India, the company has repackaged its Maths vs Zombies around Chota Bheem, and is also looking at the ads model for monetization. “People would not pay $5 upfront here like they do in the US. Paid advertising can also work. In India, all kids TV is sponsored content. We’re exploring something similar for our games,” he says.

What most people don't think about is the PiPP!N, a home console that looks a bit like a lovechild between a PowerPC and the Dreamcast. The PiPP!N was a collaboration between the Japanese toy maker Bandai (which didn't merge with Namco until 2005) and Apple in the early 90's. It was borne out of an idea to license Apple's software onto third party devices to help the company's outside of its core hardware segment. Unveiled in 1994, Bandai took care of the manufacturing and marketing for the console. Apple's responsibility lie in the research costs, and they maintained the licensing rights as well. But while both companies had big plans for the console, which was marketed as something that bring some of the functionality of PCs into households that hadn't jumped on board yet, it ended up being one of Apple's biggest failures. Snazzy Labs took apart and played with a PiPP!N recently, which you can see below. It wasn't actually a bad piece of kit for 1996, with a 4x CD-ROM drive, expandable memory, up to 16-bit colour, and support for accessories like a keyboard and mouse. It was even region-free, although that didn't get around the console's biggest problems. Apart from a complete failure on the marketing side - Apple was completely hands off with the PiPP!n in that regard - the console also launched into a heavily competitive market. The SNES, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 were all vying for attention. PC gaming was plenty big as well, and around the same time 3D accelerators were starting to become affordable. It also had the appeal of multiplayer shooters like Duke Nukem and Quake, which was a huge drawcard. That wasn't helped by a lack of developer support from Apple and Bandai, which harmed the console's game library. When Steve Jobs returned as Apple's CEO in 1997, he killed the project, along with all other third-party Mac-based offerings. Bandai ended production of the PiPP!N by the end of 1997, with the remaining consoles rebadged as "Atmark" and sold at bargain prices.

Huawei P10, P10 Plus launch in South Africa Samsung Galaxy S8 review: a great phone, but not Galaxy S7 great Reviews / Samsung Galaxy S8 review: a great phone, but not Galaxy S7 great By Hadlee Simons on 1 June, 2017 How do you build on the success of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge (review)? It’s quite possibly one of the best smartphones ever released, combining a killer camera with a respectable battery and a gorgeous screen. That alone is a tall order, but throw in the Note 7 disaster and you’ve got all eyes on Samsung, as it seeks to regain its place atop the Android smartphone pile. Speaking of “tall”, that’s the first thing you’ll notice about the Galaxy S8… Design Imagine the Galaxy S7 Edge, but with thinner bezels, a similarly thin design and a taller form factor, and you’ve got a great idea of what the Galaxy S8 is like. Much like LG and the G6 (review), Samsung has opted for the high screen/body ratio, cutting borders away to just a sliver at the top and bottom. But Samsung has thrown in that dual-curved screen as well, dominating the front of the phone. And the only logo you’ll find is on the back. LG’s smartphone is definitely thicker, with Samsung’s device being more svelte. I quite like LG’s heft and thicker design though — I don’t feel like the S8 can survive an accidental drop. In fact, a fellow tech writer friend has already cracked their review unit after an inadvertent drop. As for materials, you’re looking at a metallic rim (tapering off on the left and right edges) and a glass back that attracts fingerprint grease. In any event, it all comes together to produce a phone that definitely feels expensive. In terms of I/O and buttons, you’ve got an earphone jack (yay), USB Type-C port and speaker at the bottom, power/lock button on the left, SIM/microSD bay at the top, and volume rocker and Bixby button on the left. More on that Bixby button later… Between the high screen/body ratio, the materials used and the thin form factor, the Galaxy S8 definitely makes for a striking first impression. Is it the most visually appealing Android smartphone around? I still like the Mi Mix, but Samsung’s device is certainly in the running. Display Whether you’re a member of the LCD legion or an AMOLED acolyte, I think we can all agree that the Galaxy S8 has an absolutely gorgeous screen. Text looks sharp, your photos look great and the choice to go narrow and tall, much like the G6, is a wise one. It’s not a fingerprint magnet like many other screens, while it bursts with colour and reaches some high brightness levels. You won’t have trouble in direct sunlight, then. And the AMOLED nature of the screen means that always-on functionality (displaying the clock, battery life, etc) is put to good use, only lighting a portion of the screen rather than the whole display. The display is HDR-enabled, but Netflix only supports the LG G6 as of writing, while other services like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube are missing. The ability to record video in HDR would be a solid way improve the content situation then, but it’s not present either. Nevertheless, the 18.5:9 screen ratio and tall, narrow screen is indeed a great decision. The phone’s display does feel a little too tall when reaching for the dropdown menu and the upper sixth of the screen, necessitating a shuffle to get to the top with one hand. But overall, it’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5, feeling far more ergonomic than a traditional 5.7-inch display even. Heck, my seeded Huawei P9 feels super wide in comparison, despite having a 5.2-inch screen. I’m still not fully sold on the dual-curved design though, as gorgeous as it is. The hit-and-miss palm rejection tech means you might miss camera shots on the very odd occasion or accidentally open a WhatsApp contact’s profile photo (this happened far too often for my liking). Still, if you’re basing your purchase on display quality above all else, the Galaxy S8 is definitely up there with the Xperia XZ Premium as one of the best in the market. Performance on paper? Last year’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge stood out for sheer horsepower too, with the Exynos 8890 chipset actually beating the Snapdragon 820 used in rival phones. In fact, the Samsung chip was also more powerful than Huawei’s own beefy Kirin 950 chip, specifically in the graphics department. Does the Galaxy S8 and its Exynos 8895 provide a big leap though? An Antutu test saw the phone deliver some pretty fantastic results during graphical scenes, with judder now and again but a smooth experience the vast majority of the time. As for an overall score, you’re looking at two consecutive scores in the 173 000 range, being significantly higher than the Galaxy S7’s 129 000 or thereabouts. In fact, the S8’s score sees it landing at number two on the Antutu charts, with Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus being ahead of it. The GFX Bench 4 test also sees the Samsung device hand in a strong performance for the most part. It goes toe to toe with Apple’s best when it comes to the likes of the T-Rex test, ALU 2 run-through and several off-screen tests. Otherwise, the phone lags behind Apple’s best and/or Nvidia’s Shield TV when it comes to tests like Car Chase, Manhattan and texturing. In plain English, the Galaxy S8 silicon is a big step forward for Samsung in benchmarks, but Apple’s hardware/software synergy means it’s still pulling big numbers.

The phone unlocks in no time flat, multitasking is usually extremely snappy and responsive, apps launch quickly and scrolling (be it on the web or in apps) is a smooth endeavour. Sticklers for detail will probably notice a frameskip once in a blue moon, but it’s clear that we’ve got a speedy phone on our hands. It’s a long way away from the Galaxy S4 and its bloatware-ridden skin. In saying so, I did notice two random shutdowns in the three weeks I’ve been using it. The first shutdown took place when I was tinkering with the camera, failing to save the last photo I had taken at that moment. The second reboot came out of nowhere, as I stuck the phone in its box. The phone booted up a game as I placed it in the box (an accidental press due to the curved screen) and then, as I hit the home button to exit the game, it shut down. Very weird. In the gaming department, we played about half a dozen titles on the handset, starting with lighter/older fare like Nimble Quest, MNDZZ and Astra, then ramping it up with Nascar Heat Mobile, Motorsport Manager, Maximum Car and Fury Turn. The result? Well, the lightweight titles predictably ran without judder at all, but the heavier games didn’t disappoint either, running at a very smooth pace. Maximum Car in particular is a workout for many a phone, but it looks and feels great on the Galaxy S8. Now, about installing the Dolphin emulator and getting my GameCube library onto the phone… What does Samsung bring to the Android table? As for the actual TouchWiz skin, we’re glad to see Samsung isn’t quite returning to the heavy theme of yore. That’s not to say that the company hasn’t delivered plenty of customisations though… We’ve got a Pixel-style app drawer that I don’t particularly care for (swipe vertically to open your app list), a Bixby menu on the left-most homescreen that can fortunately be disabled, a persistent local search bar at the top of the app drawer, the now-standard device maintenance menu (to optimise battery life, free up RAM/storage etc) and a settings menu overhaul, among other things. In terms of preinstalled goodies/bloatware, the Galaxy S8 fares a wee bit worse than the S7. There’s the usual suite of Microsoft apps, Samsung Health, the Galaxy Apps store, Samsung Gear (why not make this an optional download?), the Samsung internet browser (a rather capable app), a Samsung Members app (for diagnostics, help etc), a Samsung Notes app, a Secure Folder app (why not add this functionality to the file explorer?) and of course, Bixby. To put it bluntly, Bixby is Samsung’s take on Google Now/Assistant and, at its best, the card-based aspect seems like a less capable version of Google Now. At its worst, Bixby is an unfinished product, due to the lack of voice commands at launch. And the voice aspect was a heavily hyped feature, with Samsung saying it represents a true natural language interface. TouchWiz on the Galaxy S8 looks and feels great, but that doesn’t mean Samsung got rid of bloatware Meanwhile, the Bixby Vision feature is another element that could do with some polish. No Bixby, that box of crackers isn’t toothpaste. Although I have to say that the Translate feature seems solid enough, using Google’s backbone to get things done. Now, if only it delivered offline support too… The biggest issue with Bixby is the fact that Samsung has delivered a physical button devoted to the feature. A feature that isn’t quite ready yet. This wouldn’t be as big of a deal if the company just let people customise the button. But no, the firm is strong-arming people into opening Bixby, even if it is an accidental launch. Probably so they can say “look, people are opening our app” at the Note 8 launch… There are indeed apps that let you remap the button (I’m using Bixby Remapper), but it’s not an ideal solution and Samsung has been clamping down. Here’s hoping they change course and introduce a native remapping option. When it comes to software, the Galaxy S8 is more proof that Samsung wants you to use its services rather than Google’s. That’s not to say that it’s reached the dizzy heights of Meizu and LeEco though. We still have a fast phone and a very pleasant user interface, while the menu when holding down on an app is a nice touch. But this is about as far as Samsung should go for its next release, before we have a repeat of the Galaxy S4. Is the camera any good? Does a bear poop in the woods? A post shared by Hadlee Simons (@brophylactic) on May 28, 2017 at 3:38am PDT The Galaxy S7 delivered a sensibly sized 12MP camera with a large f/1.7 aperture for improved low-light performance. And the results were fantastic, featuring Samsung’s trademark sharpness and saturated (but not overly so) colours. Night-time snaps were also a step ahead of the competition in many ways, sucking in more light than rivals. The Galaxy S8 has the same camera sensor, which means that you should reasonably expect quality snaps again. But, much like Google, Samsung has sought to differentiate itself by using software smarts to improve the camera experience, in the form of multi-frame image processing. Samsung’s technique sees a few images being combined for each shot taken, in order to reduce blur and improve low-light performance. Does it actually make a massive difference? I’m not sure, as I’d need a Galaxy S7 to do a side-by-side comparison. But the phone is still spitting out some great shots, with well-defined edges, accurate (if a tad saturated) colours and low levels of noise. Night time situations also see some great results and, when I took the S8 and P10 Plus to a live gig, the Samsung phone would often have less blur and seemed to have less noise. Is that due to the software smarts, better OIS or what? I don’t know, but it was clear that Samsung had a distinct advantage in that department. The Samsung Galaxy S8 takes some fantastic photos, but so did its predecessor Speaking of the competition, it’s clear that the 2017 crop of high-end phones are as close as ever when it comes to photo quality. You can see this in our G6/P10 Plus/Galaxy S8 camera comparison, where the difference mainly boils down to white balance and colour preference (although noise is a factor too). The difference also comes down to things like autofocus, with the phone being extremely quick on the draw due to a tweaked autofocus system. I haven’t really had any occasions where the phone failed to focus, save for those times when I got a little too close to a subject. Read more: Samsung Galaxy S8 – check these photo samples There were a few oddities though, like stubborn lens flares when taking outdoor snaps or a ghosted hand in one of our shots. To be fair, the former sometimes can’t be helped, but the latter was definitely a weird result. As for actual features, we’ve got the usual auto, pro, panorama, food, selective focus and virtual shot modes. The pro mode gets the job done well enough too, although the lack of LG-style focus peaking is a little disappointing. Nevertheless, Samsung still manages to stay level with Apple when it comes to fire and forget photography. No need for endless tweaking, no need for half a dozen shots — one or two will get the job done. One for video enthusiasts? We really enjoyed the Galaxy S7 video experience, delivering great quality recordings in 4K, 240fps slow-motion and 1080p/60fps flavours. The same great quality is on show here too, but those rumours of 1000fps video are unfounded. We went one step further with the Galaxy S8, taking the phone to a live gig. The result? You’ve got clips that are well-lit and feature less noise than many rival devices. It’s also worth noting that the phone has an AOP microphone for audio recording and, as the clip demonstrates, it’s capable of capturing good quality, distortion-free sound for the most part. My only qualm is that the company could’ve slapped on another AOP microphone for “richer” sound and HTC-style recording features (surround sound etc). Otherwise, the phone makes for a great buy if you value video quality above all else. And your shaky concert footage will actually sound decent. Will that 3000mAh battery last? The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8 share the same 3000mAh battery capacity, which is pretty much the baseline for a flagship smartphone these days. In fact, LG’s battery is slightly bigger (3300mAh) while Huawei’s P10 also edges out Samsung’s offering (3200mAh). In any event, I never found myself having to charge before leaving the newsroom on a typical day. My usual day of usage saw me chatting extensively on WhatsApp, listening to some tracks via Google Play Music and accessing email, often having 40% or more juice still left. Attending a conference is one of the more strenuous workouts for a phone, as I live-tweet, browse the web and generally punish the modem and screen. At the recent BotCon Africa event, I was live-tweeting pretty much 70% of the time, from about 10am to 4pm. The result was that the phone dipped below the 30% mark at about 2pm or so, subsequently plugging it into the power bank. A pretty good workout, but a solid showing from the phone. Still, I’d expect the likes of the Mate 9 (review) and other much larger phones to last a few hours longer. I did find however, that running benchmarks on the phone (two Antutu tests and GFX Bench) knocked double digits off the phone’s battery life. And you can expect streaming video to do similar damage. What about normal video playback? We put the phone through our usual video playback test, running a 20 second 1080p/60fps video on loop. We use MX Player, while enabling mobile data/WiFi and turning the brightness up to 100%. The result? It hit the 10% mark after eight hours and a few minutes, handily beating our five to six hour average. So that means you should be able to watch three movies on the plane, turning down the brightness and disabling connectivity to add a few hours. Still, if you’re worried about lasting for a day, the Galaxy S8 won’t let you down. In fact, if you forget to charge the night before, you should have enough juice for the morning. So it’s pretty much on par with the other flagships this year. The biometrics are a step backward and forward The elephant in the room really, is Samsung’s poorly placed, tiny fingerprint scanner. You’ll press the camera more times than you’d care to admit — and don’t get me started on the phone imploring me to cover the scanner with my entire finger. It works fine when you eventually get the hang of it, but yeah, the Galaxy S7’s scanner puts Samsung’s current flagship to shame. Although I still think the P9 has the best scanner on the market, owing to my preference for rear-mounted scanners. Then there’s the iris scanner, being much faster than my Lumia 950. The phone only takes a second or so to unlock, in a best case scenario. Unfortunately, much like Microsoft’s effort, it seldom works in direct sunlight, so you’ll need to use the fingerprint scanner or PIN code instead (or go to a shady spot). It works well in the dark though, owing to the use of infrared light to scan your iris. There are two other notable issues I have with Samsung’s iris scanner though. Firstly, why do I have to hit the power button and then swipe up to activate the scanner? A power button press like the 950 should automatically activate the scanner. This is even more apparent when the afterthought of a fingerprint scanner only requires a touch — no power button needed. [Update: we somehow missed that there was an option to enable iris scanning without a screen swipe. We’ve tweaked the score to reflect this.] The second iris-related issue (and one covered extensively here) is that you can’t improve your scanning profile like the aforementioned Microsoft phone. That means you can’t scan your iris with and without spectacles, for instance, or in a lighting situation that proves troublesome. Nevertheless, Samsung still lets you log into websites and the like via your biometrics, being very convenient. And the preinstalled Secure Folder utility means you can securely stash away your apps, photos and other files. Otherwise, Samsung has pulled a Huawei and delivered the ability to activate the dropdown menu with a fingerprint scanner swipe. So… should you get it? The Galaxy S8 is a less impressive leap from the Galaxy S7 than the LG G6 was from the G5. Then again, Samsung had already achieved greatness with the 2016 phone, while LG… well… hadn’t. Does the Galaxy S8 represent a big upgrade over the S7? Is it a skin-deep change only? Or is it a step back even? Well, the truth is that it’s a little bit of all three in many ways. We’ve got a solid but not great iris scanner, that gorgeous screen and a slick but “please-don’t-let-me-drop-it-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy” hardware design. Then there are the changes that are barely felt. Yes, the camera is excellent, but so was last year’s model. Sure, the phone is extremely nippy, but the S7 was a smooth operator too. Finally, we’ve got the departments that feel like a step back. There’s the tiny fingerprint scanner in a weird location. We’ve also got the return of an extra physical button — a good idea, but bad when Samsung forcibly ties it to Bixby. Speaking of Bixby, we’ve also got the return of software that duplicates Google functionality (Assistant/Now) for the sake of it. And it’s still not finished yet, lacking voice commands. Verdict: The Samsung Galaxy S8 packs a slick (water-resistant) design, snappy camera, brisk performance and a battery that punches slightly above its capacity. But if you’ve got a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge, you actually have an equal or even better phone in many ways. Got an S6 or S6 Edge? Then you’re in for a treat. Score: 8.6 out of 10 Disclosure: Samsung allowed us to keep our Galaxy S8 review units, as well as a wireless charging pad.  Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI AI Weekly: Siri, please meet Alexa and Google Assistant Blaise Zerega@BeeZee June 1, 2017 8:53 PM What a difference a year makes. The headlines this week could have been pulled from last spring: intelligent assistants, voice interfaces, and devices. But in 2017, different flavors of machine learning underpin all of them. Hello, Google Assistant. Hello, Alexa. Please meet Siri. Yes, Apple has finally begun extending Siri to a new line of smart speakers. While the devices may not be available until later this year, Apple watchers are hoping to learn how they work with Apple’s other products and services at the upcoming WWDC event. Meanwhile, here at AI Weekly, we’re watching to see just how smart Siri can become. At the same time, interoperability is improving. You can now use Amazon Alexa to add appointments to your Apple iCloud calendar. This rounds out Alexa’s access to G Suite, Outlook and Office 365 calendars. While less lofty than pondering machine learning, we’re keen to see whether such cross-platform uses spark entirely new services. Recombinant DNA, anyone?

Monday 5th June, 2017 Menu Home International News South Korea News Business News Weather Network Volume No. 15/156 North Korea’s tablet mimics Apple, calls itself ‘iPad’ and is rated ‘pretty impressive’ North Korea Times - Friday 2nd June, 2017 The Ryonghung iPad is featured in the latest edition of its Foreign Trade Magazine The gadget’s specs include a quad-core 1.2 GHz CPU, a measly 1GB of RAM It has an 8BG hard disk and only 40 apps but can diagnose up to 1,200 ailments and offer remedies PYONGYANG, North Korea - North Korea reiterated its love for Apple products on Thursday, when it releases its own version of Apple’s iPad. They love Steve Jobs’ creation so much that Pyongyang ruled out changing the name of the device too - calling it, iPad.  While Apple chief executive Tim Cook might not have too much to worry about - given the gadget’s specs are not that great - it does have one feature that gives it an advantage over its Californian rival.  The tablet, Ryonghung iPad was featured in the latest edition of its Foreign Trade Magazine. According to the description, the gadget’s specs include a quad-core 1.2 GHz CPU, a measly 1GB of RAM with an 8BG hard disk and only 40 apps. iPad models go up to 4GB memory and 256GB storage space, and are fitted with Apple’s 1.85 GHz processor. The North Korean iPad can, however, “diagnose up to 1,200 ailments and offer remedies” but comes with no internet connection.  The device, manufactured by Myohyang IT company, that reportedly has been around for years, was just been rebranded the IPad recently and claims to be “popular among customers.”  The adverts also shows SD cards and programmes including a calculator app, a health encyclopaedia, a medical app called “Good Doctor 3.0” and a farming game present on the tablet. Earlier in 2014, North Korean officials created an operating system which looked suspiciously similar to Apple’s Mac OS X software and was called the Red Star OS. It was devised by the Pyongyang-based Korea Computer Center (KCC) and is used to manage the regime’s official website as well as a state-approved search engine. While the system looks like MAC software, it is said to be based on Linux. Last year, an accident let outsiders access to the nation’s private internet and it was discovered that the nation’s Internet had 28 only websites.

apple Australian Stories Pokemon Go Share Image: iStock Apple released some figures last night that showed the global app store developer community has earned over $70 billion since it launched in 2008. And there's no sign of slowing down: in the past 12 months alone, downloads have grown over 70 per cent, says Apple. The top grossing categories? Gaming and Entertainment, of course. "People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. "Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can't wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference." Subscriptions are another big reason for growth. Since the subscription business model was made available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store's active paid subscriptions are up 58 per cent year over year. We're talking apps like Netflix as well as photo editing apps like Over and Enlight. Gaming and Entertainment are the top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, have experienced over 70 per cent growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90 per cent growth. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments darren @darren Jun 2, 2017, 1:37pm Wait, you can sign up to Netflix via the app and give Apple a cut of the subscription???? I don't think that is even an option on Android. I'm surprised they let Apple take a huge cut of their money. Reply 1 darren @darren Jun 2, 2017, 1:40pm Hmm looks like that is indeed correct. Seems they got a good deal, paying half the rate. Reply 0 zak @zak Jun 2, 2017, 3:15pm That's a lot of money. Almost makes you wish they paid tax. Reply 1 greenlego @greenlego Jun 2, 2017, 4:15pm Do you have a source (link) for this information? app store developer community has earned over $70 billion Is that before or after Apple took their cut? Apple takes a 30% cut, so I wanted to know if Apple made $21b or $30b. Reply 1 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” Apple said downloads have grown over 70 percent over the past 12 months, fueled by hit games like Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run. Apple, which faces a growing challenge in the mobile space from the dominant Google Android system, has been tweaking its business model as part of an effort to keep developers in its ecosystem. In addition to payment for downloads, Apple allows developers to use a subscription model across all 25 app categories. The company said active paid subscriptions are up 58 percent year over year. “Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including longtime favorites such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight,” an Apple statement said. Apple has more than two million paid and free apps for the iPhone, iPad and other devices.

We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers’ Conference,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, in a statement. In January, Apple announced that its app developers earned over $20 billion in 2016 — up over 40 per cent from 2015 and according to sources, a sizable chunk of those app developers were from India.App developers from India are now creating amazing apps for its platform. Apple last year revealed plans for an iOS app design and development facility in Bengaluru. Across India, Apple supports over 640,000 iOS app developer jobs and other positions related to the iOS ecosystem. According to the company, since the release of iOS 10 last fall, iPhone and iPad users have also experienced new engaging and creative ways to connect. From Pokémon GO and Super Mario Run to other standout launches such as CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly, customers discovered and experienced new apps and games every day on the App Store. The App Store developers from around the world create apps for customers in 155 countries that improve lives, rethink industries and shape culture. In the past 12 months alone, downloads from the App Store have grown over 70 per cent. Gaming and Entertainment are top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, have experienced over 70 per cent growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90 per cent growth.With the subscription business model now available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store’s active paid subscriptions are up 58 per cent year-over-year. “Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including long time favourites such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight,” Apple said in a statement.  “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” added Schiller.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Here’s a gorgeous iPhone 8 concept that Apple could never make Chris Smith BGR News June 1, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The iPhone 8 continues to be one of the hottest topics in the tech world, and today we’ve got another interesting concept to look at, one that proposes an amazing design. But sadly, it’s probably this new concept iPhone 8 features a design that Apple will likely never actually make. Don't Miss: Aerospace exec says aliens not only exist, they’re living on Earth right now Concocted by designer David Chapman as the “iPhone Pro,” this iPhone 8 device looks very much like an iPhone 7. If it were not for the all-screen design and the rear camera, you might think this is indeed an iPhone 7 variation. And that’s precisely what makes this iPhone 8 concept unlikely. Does this make you want the White-Silver model?#iPhonePro / #iPhone8 Concept pic.twitter.com/1Z7d2dKdJR — David Chapman (@DaveChap) May 31, 2017 Sure, Apple will adopt an all-screen design for the iPhone 8, and eliminate the physical home button in the process. And sure, the phone will have a vertical dual camera on the back. But what Chapman gets wrong here based on the many iPhone 8 rumors and leaks from reputable sources, is the phone’s rear design. The iPhone 8 is expected to support wireless charging, a first for Apple. That means the phone’s shell can’t be made out of metal. All reports do say the phone will feature a glass sandwich design consisting of a stainless steel chassis that houses all the internal components, sandwiched between two sheets of 2.5D glass. After seeing tons of #iPhone8 #iPhonePro mockups, I decided to make one that maintains Ive’s desire for symmetry. pic.twitter.com/oE2JiHByJt — David Chapman (@DaveChap) May 31, 2017 With metal out of the picture, those hideous antenna bands will also disappear, and they’re likely to be replaced with tiny antenna bands on the edges, similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 — those iPhones also had a glass sandwich design. There are other details in Chapman’s designs that do not jibe with more recent rumors. The camera flash should be placed between the two rear cameras, the power button should be slightly longer, and the front-facing camera and sensors should “protrude” into the top side of the display. At least there’s no fingerprint sensor on the back, though. As for the screen design Chapman imagines, we’re looking at a display that resembles the LG G6 and the Galaxy S8, although the top and bottom bezels appear to be even smaller.

Cook, along with other business leaders including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Exxon chief Darren Woods, issued a last-minute plea to persuade Trump to remain in the climate change agreement. In a letter to Apple (aapl) employees in the wake of Trump's announcement Thursday, Cook said, "Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it," according to Bloomberg. "I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment," he continued. "We’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy." Cook's words echoed other industry leaders who have spoken out in opposition to the President's decision to leave the agreement, which aims to limit the average global temperature increase to below 2C (3.6F). Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger both resigned from their respective roles on Trump's advisory council in protest. Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.- Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 The Apple boss took to Twitter late Thursday, saying the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement "was wrong for our planet" and that Apple would "never waiver" from the fight against climate change. Cook, who said he phoned Trump on Tuesday asking him to stick with the deal, said his appeal "wasn't enough," according to CNN. Apple has been one of the computing sector's leaders in sustainability and renewable energy, earning an overall A grade from environmental watchdog group Greenpeace in its energy report earlier this year.

The Siri Speaker seems like it will be a voice-controlled device in your home that happens to be able to emit sound. But I think there’s a different target Apple’s going after: Sonos. Remember, this isn’t rumored to just be a voice-controlled device with a speaker thrown in for audio feedback. Reports peg this as a device which contains multiple, high-quality speakers. In early May, KGI Securities’ Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said: We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP). Seven tweeters. Amazon’s Echo at US$179.99, by comparison, has one woofer and one tweeter, as does the $199 Sonos PLAY:1. Even Sonos’s Flagship PLAY:5 at $499 only has six speakers, though three of those are woofers (the remaining three are tweeters). Yesterday’s report from Mark Gurman and Alex Webb writing at Bloomberg states: The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology […] Virtual surround sound. This is starting to sound like the technology that Sonos has baked into its PLAYBASE and PLAYBAR (and, used a little differently, in the aforementioned PLAY:5, as well). Amazon and Google aren’t doing that with any of their current offerings. Twitter User @iFunnyVlogger’s rendering of what the Siri Speaker might look like. I would expect a device with seven tweeters to provide truly room-filling sound, perhaps from all angles given that each of those tweeters could be aimed in slightly different directions. This might be something that could pair with an Apple TV and not only play music but also play the audio for your TV shows and movies. The Siri Speaker may be more of a living room device than a kitchen device. For additional support, let’s include this tidbit from the same Ming-Chi Kuo report: […] likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo. Better entertainment experience is something none of the existing voice-controlled home assistants seem to boast or even target. Given the popularity and functional usefulness of the $49 Amazon Echo Dot and its one, tiny speaker, it could easily be argued that the Alexa product line completely omits the I-care-about-sound-quality market (feel free to leave your “but Bluetooth!” comments below). Given the reported Siri Speaker’s enhanced acoustics and higher price points I’m thinking this thing targets the Sonos market: people that care about audio quality. It could perhaps finally be the first device that truly competes with Sonos (again, feel free to leave your comments about Bose and Polk below… I’ve tried those systems, folks, and I stand by the previous sentence). Sonos Killer? I’ll stop well-short of applying the term “Sonos killer” here, though. Sonos already has excellent support for Apple Music and every other streaming platform available. I would be surprised if Apple’s Siri speaker did that upon launch, too, though it’s not outside the realm of possibilities. Remember, your iPhone supports this stuff, and if the reported Siri Speaker processor speed is even close to accurate, there’s no reason that this device couldn’t run apps to support third-party services just like the Apple TV does. If Apple can truly release a high-quality speaker that is audibly-controlled and supports multiple music services including Apple Music, they would potentially have something very, very compelling to offer. Sonos is due to release their Alexa support later this year, but I’ve had a chance to approximate that with a hacked-together setup. Even with my hack’s imperfections, controlling music with one’s voice is true bliss and is most definitely the future of products like this. Let’s just hope Siri doesn’t interpret “Play Stevie Wonder” as “Hey, this is a steaming blunder.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: Apple TV, Siri speaker, sonos You might also like… Get Free Bitcoins from 23 Faucets That Pay The 5 Best Hackintosh Graphics Cards macOS: Disable Video Autoplay in Safari Monday's Apple WWDC Keynote Just Got Even More Exciting A Bezel-less iPhone 8 Will Change How Photos Look 8 Comments Add a comment Andrush June 1, 2017 Hey Dave, you may be right to suggest that “Apple’s going after Sonos” but I have to say that the rest of your comments are rubbish. Are we talking about a mono BGM system or are we talking about 5.1 channel surround sound? Either way, there is a clear differentiation between streaming services and the number of tweeters in a speaker enclosure. “I would expect a device with seven tweeters to provide truly room-filling sound, perhaps from all angles given that each of those tweeters could be aimed in slightly different directions.” Say What ??? June 1, 2017 at 12:57 EDT PM CudaBoy June 1, 2017 Apple is incredible – the production of Toyota with the margins of Ferrari. No wonder Android is the most popular OS on the planet. This speaker Apple is throwing out here now allows them to make it obsolete in a year when they add the LED screen to it like the others. Mark me, it will happen. Save your pennies kiddies. June 1, 2017 at 8:54 EDT PM rmcq June 2, 2017 So they’re finally upgrading the iPod HiFi then? June 2, 2017 at 2:00 EDT AM jackster12 June 2, 2017 Andrush, I don’t understand your criticism of the article. The original provided a quote from a source that says the speaker will have seven tweeters. And then deduced that would imply room-filling sound. What’s confusing about that? Not sure how that conflates with any discussion about streaming services. As for me, I was actually just hours away from biting the bullet and ordering three Sonos speakers. I’ve been a holdout not only because of the high cost but because I’d really like a system that works within the Apple eco-system (even though, I know, Sonos added Apple Music support a bit ago). So I’m grateful for the timing of this article. I’ll be holding out to see what gets unveiled. June 2, 2017 at 6:10 EDT AM Andrush June 2, 2017 jackster12, I think the problem is that, if you don’t really understand what woofers and tweeters do, you shouldn’t be talking about them. If there is such a thing as “Apple’s rumored Siri Speaker”, which is by no means certain, then Dave could be right, it could be an alternative to the Sonos system. It could, but I don’t think so, for two reasons: 1. Apple’s “iPod Hi-Fi” speaker “is considered one of the classic Apple failures”; 2. Sonos does what it does very well, so why should Apple want to compete with that? Basically, speakers are devices for moving air, that mimic the air being moved by musical instruments and voices. If you want to fill a room with sound, you need to move a lot of air, which means big speakers. Tweeters, as their name implies, are small speakers that only reproduce high notes like a bird’s “tweets”. Having more of them will not fill a room. Incidentally, depending on your needs, I’m not sure if “three Sonos speakers” is the best solution. I have not listened to the PlayBase, but it’s one unit. I have used the PlayBar, in conjunction with the Sonos Sub (containing 2 woofers). Now that is two units, and it does indeed deliver “room filling sound” ….. June 2, 2017 at 11:46 EDT AM Andrush June 2, 2017 jackster12, On further thought about how Sonos’ surround sound works, I think I may have been misled by Dave’s use of terminology, equating “truly room-filling sound” with “Virtual surround sound”. However, since I posted I have seen two reports by John Gruber on Daring Fireball about this story. In the first, Gruber says the entire original report on Bloomberg is rubbish. In the second he says that Bloomberg’s story, as re-told by Dave “sounds like a great idea” ….. “Like Sonos but with really good AirPlay — ….. Sonos doesn’t support AirPlay”. So I agree, let’s all wait to see what, if anything, Apple unveils at the WWDC. June 2, 2017 at 12:50 EDT PM Manqueman June 2, 2017 This sounds more like Apple than a Siri speaker that’s just another Google Home or not even an Alexa: When not being used to take orders (or hoover data like Google Home), it doubles as a music playback system. Does what the others do (more or less) and a whole lot more too. June 2, 2017 at 3:10 EDT PM Brian Cashion June 3, 2017 This speaker Apple is throwing out here now allows them to make it obsolete in a year when they add the LED screen to it @CudaBoy Obsolete? When Apple releases the next version of this speaker, the first one will continue to work just as it did on the day you purchased it. It will be eligible for tech support. Just because it won’t have all the newest features doesn’t mean it’s obsolete. Besides, this is the way pretty much every product works. New ones come along and improve upon the old ones. You make it sound like Apple has some nefarious plan. June 3, 2017 at 11:35 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Aleks JakulinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Information Economy Jun 1 What has Internet done to Media? This essay contains my thoughts about how Internet has been evolving over the past 20 years. It contains my analysis, supporting links and my recommendations. These ideas have been driving me over the past decade to develop a set of improved technologies, practices and standards. If this resonates with you, if you have ideas on how to improve this document, please reach out to aleks+ie@ganxy.com. Let’s bring different people, efforts and organizations together and fulfill the dream that was at the core of Internet: to unleashing the potential of networked humanity. 1. Introduction Internet originated from an effort to develop reliable communications in the case of a nuclear war. It’s been an incredible success even in peacetime, a science fiction tale come true: Internet now connects well over 3 billion people, provides access to information and services using tiny devices we carry in our pockets. The change to the society that the Internet will cause will be as large or larger than Gutenberg’s press, internal combustion engine, airplanes or electricity, and we’re yet to see the full extent of its impact. Internet, unfortunately, isn’t fulfilling its potential for several reasons: Violation of the information property rights through piracy and “scraping” has eliminated a source of income for developers, journalists, authors, and artists, reducing both quality and quantity of Internet content. Much valuable information is not yet online, or not easily found, even if there’s a market for it. The fundamental reason for this is rigidity of licensing contracts and practices. It’s unnecessarily hard to create a sustainable content business online: advertising is inadequate, and charging for information on the global web is encumbered by legacy regulation. The internet is putting the public in danger: there is an increasing amount of false and misleading information online, leading to political polarization, extremist movements, and terrorism. The practices are inadequate, and there’s a lack of a system. The collection of personal data is threatening democracy with the emergence of a number of powerful private surveillance organizations. Again, the regulation is futile and inadequate. Fortunately, there is a solution. Protection of personal and private data is a universal human right, but we need to enforce it. In order to develop and distribute protected information online, we need to implement better licensing technologies. To increase the quality and trustworthiness of information, we need to set up systems for reviewing, versioning, and reputation. Consequently, the Internet will develop its full potential, and we will create more than a billion jobs in the sustainable information economy. 2. Value of Data and Content The Internet emerged by connecting communities of researchers, but as Internet grew, antisocial behaviors were not adequately discouraged. When I coauthored several internet standards (PNG, JPEG, MNG), I was guided by the vision of connecting humanity. Groups of volunteers like myself were developing open standards that would allow programmers to create internet software without restrictions or taxes. We had felt this could be big if we succeeded, but we didn’t imagine that billions of people would be now using the open standards and the open software we created. The world is smaller than ever before. Friendships now span the globe. Internet technologies are reducing the need for travel for work, reducing fossil fuel consumption and pollution. Internet was originally designed to connect a few academic institutions, namely universities and research labs. Academia is a community of academics, which has always been based on the openness of information. Perhaps the most important to the history of the Internet is the hacker community composed of computer scientists, administrators, and programmers, most of whom are not affiliated with academia directly but are employed by companies and institutions. Whenever there is a community, its members are much more likely to volunteer time and resources to it. It was these communities that created websites, wrote the software and started providing internet services. The skills of the hacker community are highly sought after and compensated well, and hackers can afford to dedicate their spare time to the community. Society is funding universities and institutes who employ scholars. Within the academic community, the compensation is through citation, while plagiarism or falsification can destroy someone’s career. Institutions and communities have enforced these rules both formally and informally through members’ desire to maintain and grow their standing within the community. The values of academic community can be sustained within universities, but are not adequate outside of it. When businesses and general public joined the internet, many of the internet technologies and services were overwhelmed with the newcomers who didn’t share their values and were not members of the community. In the beginning, there was very little unwanted email, or spam, on the Internet. But once America Online and other service providers started bringing hordes of new Internet users starting around 1996, spam started growing. It was spam that brought down the USENET forums and made decentralized email clients almost unusable. Many companies are still being held hostage with the denial of service attacks on their servers. False information is distracting people with untrue or irrelevant conspiracy theories, ineffective medical treatments, while facilitating terrorist organization recruiting and propaganda. The excessively idealistic assumptions have actually made reality worse for Internet users. Fighting spam led to commercialization of the Internet, and excessive centralization of control and information. Large web media companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft have been able to detect spam by creating highly centralized systems. Their services are highly popular, and the companies are liked by the general public. But as a result, a small number of companies have control of an unprecedented amount of personal information. These companies have access to what we search for, what we post about, what we email, who we message, where we go, who we go with, who we call, what websites we view. A small group of conspiring individuals within these companies or an outside hacker can access all this data. Such break-ins have happened several times before (*,*,*). Even without a break-in, these companies are already accessing this data right now by themselves and potentially using it in ways we cannot even detect. Privacy laws do not protect us: it’s impossible to detect violations when private data is stored with these companies. These web media companies generate profits using our data. Their business model is facilitating advertising. Advertisers working with web media companies can target us by bidding on our gender, our age, or location or even our personal identity. These web media companies control the operating systems of our phones, computers, the web browsers we use to do banking and communication. They can activate a microphone or camera at any time by pushing an update to the software. We seem to be perfectly okay with the companies already using the data for profit, by performing data analysis about us, and choosing what version of an ad is most likely going to compel us to buy something we don’t need while interrupting the communication, research or entertainment we’re engaged in. They are beginning to use our data to train the artificial intelligence, thus using the value of our information and applying it elsewhere. As long as the public has trust in these companies, the amount of information and data will grow. It’s like a balloon that’s being inflated with data. It’s precarious: it takes a single needle to pop a balloon. Of course, once the break-in happens, people won’t trust the companies anymore. But there’s so much information there that even a single event can be highly lucrative. It’s irresponsible of these companies not to protect the private information in case of an attack on their systems. We shouldn’t expect much: the appropriation of user data is at the core for many of these companies. For example, the founder of Facebook hacked into protected areas of Harvard’s computer network and copied private dormitory students’ images. He then used them to create a website where users ranked two students based on their hotness (*). The situation is becoming even more dangerous because we are trusting these companies to offer us search results without a bias and documents without tampering. If the power of the internet consumer companies continues to grow, nobody will even know the balloon popped. There’s already evidence that internet consumer companies are becoming involved in politics by tampering with search results (*), buying media companies (*) and sponsoring politicians (*,*). So, when the balloon pops, there will perhaps be no news posts and no search results about it. Web media companies have earned hundreds of billions of dollars by extracting value from personal and protected data As a result of the internet development over the past 20 years, the average level of content online has been lowered, many publishers have gone out of business, and we’ve got more advertising than ever. The magazine industry has shrunk by 20% just between 2005 and 2011. The number of newsroom employees has fallen by 40%. We do, however, have web media companies earning valuations measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. Web media companies earned this in large part by matching advertising with the content either taken from the media companies or created by unpaid volunteers, while only returning a tiny fraction of that money to those who created the content. How did this happen? Above I’ve described how web media companies accumulate and extract value from our personal data. Many of these practices have actually developed earlier, with the public internet. It was the volunteers, webmasters, who have created the first websites. Websites made information easily accessible. The website was property and a brand, vouching for the reputation of the content and data there. Users bookmarked those websites they liked so that they could revisit them later — or emailed the creators of websites with suggestions and comments. Some of the websites primarily collected links to other websites and kept the links current and curated. In those days, I kept current about the developments in the field by following newsgroups and regularly visiting key websites that curated the information on a particular topic. Google entered the picture by downloading all of Internet and indexing it. It was a Faustian bargain for the webmasters: if they prevented Google from crawling and using the data, their websites could languish in obscurity. But if they did allow Google to crawl, they’d also allow Google to make a copy of the pages and using the information in there for Google’s own profit. Something else happened too: the perceived credit for finding information went to Google and no longer to the creators of the websites. After a few years of maintaining my website, I was no longer receiving much appreciation for this work, so I have given up maintaining the pages on my website and curating links. This must have happened around 2005. An increasing number of Wikipedia editors are giving up their unpaid efforts to maintain quality in the fight with vandalism or content spam (*,*). On the other hand, marketers continue to have an incentive to put information online that would lead to sales. As a result of depriving contributors to the open web with brand and credit, search results on Google tend to be of worse quality. When Internet search was gradually taking over from websites, there was one area where a writer’s personal property and personal brand were still protected: blogging. While search yielded results on a particular topic, one could stay current by following blogs on topics of interest. RSS reader software provided a way to maintain subscriptions or bookmarks to blogs. The community connected through the comments on blog posts. The bloggers were known and personally subscribed to. Alas, whenever there’s an unprotected resource online, some startup will move in and harvest it. Social media tools simplified link sharing. Thus, an “influencer” could easily post a link to an article written by someone else within their own social media feed. The conversation was removed from the blog post and instead developed in the influencer’s feed. As a result, carefully written articles have become a mere resource for influencers. As a result, the number of new blogs has been falling. Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook reduced barriers to entry by making so easy to refer to others’ content so much that the pool of influencers was a simple rich-get-richer phenomenon: famous personalities from mainstream media also became the most followed personalities on the social media. Social media companies then used the social relationships and communities and started inserting their own advertising. This way, even social media has started withering. Part of the rise of podcasting is the inability of social media to interfere with podcast subscriptions through special apps (*,*). But it’s a just a question of time when podcasting will get aggregated. How advertising fails as a business model for journalism? To earn an income with free content, publishers sold advertising space for banner ads. Ad tech companies like DoubleClick (later acquired by Google) sold ad space on behalf of publishers in exchange for a cut of the revenue. Because of the lack of competition in ad tech the revenue share continues to be unfavorable for publishers. Moreover, abundant advertising fraud led to over $7B in revenue going to fraudsters rather than to publishers (*). As a result, web advertising is hardly lucrative: the revenue that can be generated with web page advertising is measured in mere cents per hour, whereas subscription revenue from newspapers and magazines was easily measured in dollars per hour. At the same time, the online content is fundamentally unprotected through conventional copyright. The creation of print content and photographs, the collection of links to other relevant pages end up being a resource that gets harvested by search engines, social media, and content farms who end up extracting most of the financial value. For example, a search engine will extract the title and the summary, and reuse them in their page with search results — but the publisher will not partake in lucrative ad revenue displayed on the search result page. Social media will similarly repurpose the photos, headlines, and summaries to create an attractive news feed, and similarly, won’t share the lucrative targeted ad revenue with the creators of those. A content farm will re-use the hard work of journalistic reporting by creating a derivative article for a fraction of the cost — which can be published only minutes or even seconds after the original publication. To increase revenues in such an environment, publishers have made the advertising increasingly obstructive, eroding the privacy with tracking, slowing down page loading, increasing the amount of data consumed as well as shortening the battery life. This led more and more users to employ tools such as ad blockers (*), ad-blocking browsers (*,*), and offline reading apps (*,*). These tools strip content of ads and thereby publishers of revenue. Google’s Chrome browser is planning to start blocking ads (presumably non-Google ones, further consolidating their already dominant market share) in 2018 under the pretense of “usability” (*). Google and Facebook engage in censorship under the pretense of fighting “fake news” (*,*), although better proposals exist (*). The success of paid content business models and continued erosion of digital advertising. I’ve recently realized I read web content less and less, and read eBooks more. It’s true that web articles are often shorter and convenient, but I find I save a lot of time by reading well-researched and well-written ebooks from reputable publishers. It’s not even necessary to pay a lot to purchase ebooks — one can just loan or rent them from public libraries and online stores that support lending. Public libraries have spent over 6% of their total materials spending on ebooks. Why are ebooks better than web articles? Ebooks have a better business model than web pages: when an ebook is sold or lent, writers and publishers earn income. The income allows writers to do quality research and writing. Income also allows publishers to do quality selection, editing, design and distribution. Income is especially important at a time when publishing quality content on the web is increasingly about volunteering rather than about livelihood, and livelihood is about satisfying advertisers or, more recently sponsors. The sponsored content or native advertising model is about presenting advertising as content, so that readers think they’re reading an article when in reality they’re reading an advertorial. The web media firms that have successfully charged for content are worth considerably more. Financial Times has been sold for $1.3B to Nikkei, having the circulation of 1.3M. The Economist has been valued to $1.5 billion through the sale of Pearson’s stake, with a similar figure of 1.3M subscribers, and reaching 11M digitally. These publications are thus worth $1K per paid subscriber. On the other hand, newspapers that aren’t restricting access to their content are worth considerably less per customer: The Washington Post sold for $250M with the paid circulation of about 400K, even if the digital reach is 76M. The Boston Globe and its affiliated New England media assets sold for only $70 million with the reach of 571K. Paid business models are technically expensive to implement for smaller newspapers. But even more importantly, the management fears that increasing the price will drive down the number of readers, who have been spoiled with free content. Thus, while Financial Times and The Economist picked the path of staying financially independent from advertisers, most American newspapers and newspapers like The Guardian chose larger audiences, while continuing to shrink and cut costs. The give-away of content by national newspapers has led to the vanishing of many blogs, smaller newspapers, and magazines. Now even these national newspapers are threatened. They have hoped that growing digital audiences would lead to growing ad revenues, using the model of renting space alongside the articles to digital ad networks. However, consolidated digital advertising networks like Facebook and Google are a strong adversary. These networks are inviting newspapers to syndicate their content to Google search results and Facebook news feeds in exchange for a fraction of the ad revenue. In the meantime, Google and Facebook can play the game of favorites, and hold all the customer data. How content gets devalued by using Internet as a promotional tool. Perhaps the most dramatic downfall of a content industry has happened to music. Between 1996 and 2014, 75% of global music revenue evaporated, going from $60B to $15B (*). The annual revenue per capita in the US dropped 67% to $26 between 1999 and 2014 (*). The number of full-time music artists dropped by 42% between 2015 and 2000 in the US (*). An average American still spends more than 4 hours per day listening to music: this amounts to less than $0.02/hour of music, and only a fraction of that actually goes to its creator. The fastest growing revenue source for music is digital streaming. The business model for digital streaming is still based on the radio which paid a relatively insignificant amount in exchange for creating exposure to music. However, digital streaming offers millions of channels instead of maybe a dozen that existed when the business model was created. With old radio, one had no choice what to listen to, and had to buy the album to be able to listen to a song arbitrarily. But digital streaming services offer this ability while still only paying the artist the amount a radio station would. Several artists have opted out of streaming services (*), even though it’s difficult to do so (*). Independent musicians are furthermore in a disadvantageous position and receiving as much as 10x times less money per play than large music publishers — who often hold ownership stakes of digital music streaming services. Yet in the big scheme of things, digital streaming music companies are not alone at fault for the downfall of the music industry. They are still trying to charge for access to music under an all-you-can-eat subscription model while giving away some content for free combined with some advertising. The real problem is the ad supported model: if a website or an app offers any piece of music for free with some optional advertising to everyone in unlimited quantities — it’s very hard to persuade customers to purchase it. With human nature as it is, customers are eager to look for the cheapest option. And the epitome of the cheapest option these days happens to be YouTube. YouTube has over a billion users watching millions of hours of video per day (*), and generated over $4B in ad revenue just in 2015 — but has paid only about $2B to rights holders in the decade from 2007 until July 2016. The most popular YouTube search term is “music”. The revenue is only a small part of the value generated for Google: there are goodwill and generated data. Goodwill is the brand value generated for YouTube by giving content away is another part of the profit for the company, and that doesn’t get measured in the revenue share calculations. The generated data allows Google to create detailed viewing profiles for users that allow them to optimize ads. YouTube is free, while at the same time, people are perfectly happy to pay for a drink, a meal, a cab ride or a vacation. The primary ways of monetizing content these days is the subscription model. How does that work? A subscriber pays a fixed fee every month and received unlimited access to the content. Examples of this are Netflix for video and Spotify for music. It’s a bit like an all-you-can-eat buffet: a fixed payment for an unlimited quantity of food. It’s seemingly attractive, but to make it work, there is a small number of high-quality items and a large amount of inexpensive filler content. Netflix provides a trial account as the high-quality video is still scarce online, but Spotify has to compete with YouTube by providing a free ad-supported tier. As long as YouTube can freely provide content, only a minority of the potential market will be willing to pay extra. Why would a student pay $10 for an album if they can get unlimited Spotify subscription for less than $5 per month? Yet another consideration for the holder of content rights: they only have a limited amount of information what’s happening with their content, the information is delayed and it’s difficult to trust and audit what they do get. The news websites have tried the “metered model” — where the ad-supported tier only carries a limited number of articles that can be read. Maybe such a model will also appear in music. But the fundamental problem is that articles are still fundamentally treated as “free”, and that the news media continue to value their editorial role even though the editorial role has largely been transferred to the social media “curators” who make use of inexpensive raw material of articles. Subscriptions have been seen as the solution for content monetization online. Yet, at the same time, all-you-can-eat restaurants are a tiny minority of all restaurants. Subscriptions will not include top content without additional payment. The selection of what is free and what isn’t will be intrinsically subjective and expensive to negotiate. In the meantime, as long as a large variety of content is available free of charge. Wide accessibility of a large quantity of content on Spotify makes it difficult for bands and labels to offer digital downloads of their music. Already, Apple iTunes model of selling uniformly priced singles in addition to albums made it much cheaper to assemble an album composed of outstanding tracks. The subscription model is just the next step in this direction. The ad-supported model is a jump to zero. This price competition is leading the industry in a downward spiral which ultimately reduces the creativity. How some companies benefit from the rhetoric of “free” content, and how the hopes of content creators aren’t materializing. With the Internet, both barriers went down: the fragmentation of digital jurisdictions among hundreds of geographies, and judicial and law enforcement’s lack of technical ability led to the copyright laws being violated on a regular basis. The ease of copying or modifications removes the investment and delay that previously existed for physical carriers. Finally, web media companies have successfully lobbied against revamping laws that would limit or prevent effective enforcement of copyright (*) even though that is technically feasible, while passive aggressively making it difficult to use (*,*). So, at the moment, DMCA framework from the dark ages of the Internet (1998) remains as it is, with all the limitations (*,*). Whoever pretends to “liberate” content in this system, gets to play the role of a seeming Robin Hood and gets the credit, attention, and resources. Those facilitating illegal piracy became extremely wealthy, like Kim Dotcom (*), or politically powerful, like Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde (*). In some cases, companies that violate copyright particularly egregiously, such as the music piracy pioneer Napster (*) or Kim Dotcom’s MegaUpload (*) do get shut down. But there are few personal repercussions for the agents: Napster co-founder Sean Parker later helped start Facebook as its founding president — and is now a billionaire (*). There’s a distinct disunity among creators on the role of copyright. Those creating are also consuming, and consuming more than most others, so having free access is quite appealing. To justify this, they are very happy to also freely share their work with others, engaging in a personal gift economy. Creators often base their work on creations of others, remixing and drawing inspiration from it, but rigid licensing practices make it difficult to obtain the formal permissions. Lack of transparency and one-sided contracts in the publishing industries create an alienation between creators and publishers. As a result, many creators are looking to revise the copyright laws, often by removing them altogether. However, rejection of creators’ rights is short-sighted. This change would primarily benefit intermediaries like Internet media and search companies. And these companies are the ones sponsoring think tank organizations and grassroots efforts that criticize copyright, and fund lobbyists that advocate limiting copyright. With these efforts and with the adoption of free content mindset, only advertising models are feasible. Creators have also been quite willing to offer free access to everyone as to get discovered and develop a following. It’s a strategy that worked quite well in the early days of the Internet when there was a strong community, a relative lack of content and still functioning avenues to sell content. But in the over 10 years that YouTube has existed, not a single best-selling album got launched on YouTube — and most artists still get discovered and launched through existing industry networks. A hope has been that free music would increase concert attendance. However, while $13B (in inflation-corrected dollars) of total recorded music revenue in the US vanished between 1999 and 2014, the live concert revenue only increased by $4.1B in this same period: to fill the gap, even tripling of current live concert revenue wouldn’t suffice (*,*). So, competition for attention by giving content away has only devalued music. Another hope has been that fans would donate. Yet, the only result is continued commercial failure of the donation model (*). When the music is perceived to be free, and when “sharing is caring” and 18% of American youth think it’s acceptable to upload content to pirate websites (*) — there simply isn’t any value attributed to the content, regardless of the effort that was put into it. When physical property is assured protection by the government — why shouldn’t intellectual property have the same? What makes a landlord more deserving of government’s protection of their investment and property than a scientist, a journalist or an artist? And why not transition from the model of apartment and property leases to voluntary donations to landlords by squatters? To summarize, with adoption of the Internet, the protection of content has weakened. It’s not that people aren’t willing to pay for good content: The success of iTunes, Netflix, Amazon and many other examples has already demonstrated that beyond all doubt. It’s that creators have bought into the deceptive optimism that giving away content will grow their audience. Moreover, the proprietary content e-commerce solutions have limited the traditional rights of content buyers — so content creators have been trying to compensate by giving content away. As a result, the value of content has been devalued, and it’s still hard to find an audience. It’s the content creators who are subsidizing this vicious cycle of content which is leading to an unprecedented shrinking of content creation industries. The importance of insisting on a price for content. It takes many years of study to be able to produce music. Then it takes a lot of work to create a good piece of work. Finally, it takes much effort and resources to establish recognition for a single or album, so that it can rise above the din of mediocrity and find its audience. After that, it costs virtually nothing to deliver the content through the Internet. The cost of content is not the cost of delivery, it’s the cost of creation. The creators hope to recoup the cost of creation by charging for delivery. It’s not too different for a farmer to acquire and clear the land, enrich it, select seeds, plant an apple tree, nurture it to maturity, and then protect it from pests. Once the apples are ripe, it’s very little work to pick them. But this ignores the vast amount of time and effort that needed to be put into those apples prior. Societies that don’t protect the farmers’ investment end up in poverty, as farmers stop working the land. This is beginning to happen to the Internet. The solution to this problem is the creation of a new type of rules for the protection of content creators. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states (*): “Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.” The US Constitution states (*): “The Congress shall have power […] To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;“ Copyright has been developed at the beginning of the 18th century, became more widespread at the end of 19th century. These laws need a very significant update for the present-day internet. Moreover, to correct for the anomalies of the past two decades, content creators and the general public deserve a part of the value that has been unfairly captured by the web media companies. Publishers, authors, film production companies and many other owners of intellectual property are in a weak position compared with the concentration of Apple, Amazon, Google and a small number other consumer web media companies who control the commerce and rights protection technologies. These companies also spend enormous amounts of money for lobbying, Google spent $450M betwee 2015–2016 just in the EU (*). It’s only after the standards will truly protect the authors, creators and curators but also allow more openness and competition among the services based on content and data outside of public domain. What’s needed is a model governed by standards that allows content rightsholders to control and enforce the cost of acquiring a license to the content. The cost of that license needs to be clear and should hold for everyone, regardless of the business model, be it advertising or acquisition. With this, media companies can develop new innovative offerings to the users, while the clearly priced licenses ensure that the competition is in the quality of offerings and not through content deals. The dream of the universal internet library will then be fulfilled, where any piece of work is accessible for a fair price, without illogical bundles and barriers. 3. Failing to Protect Content The obsolescence of copyright with advancing technology. In the past, content was packaged into books and videotapes, later DVDs. It was physical objects, the “carriers”, that were bought and sold, even though the value was in the content itself. Carriers could be distributed, sold by a variety of competing vendors in different stores. The scarcity of carriers and the protection of copyright law ensured that the access to content was priced and valued. In addition to copyright, the delay and considerable investment needed for production and distribution of an illicit carrier protected the underlying content. Physical media were very difficult to copy, magnetic media such as audio cassettes simplified copying, but the quality of the copy was lower, but with the transition to digital media, copy is perfect. The content industry tried to develop digital copy protection and digital rights management (DRM) technologies. While they do prevent casual sharing to some extent, they also prevent behaviors that people were used to with physical media, such as the creation of permanent private libraries, creation of backup copies, lending to friends, ability to use different devices to consume content. DRM is only applied to commercial content, but fails to protect our personal data and many other types of content and data. But the most important flaw of DRM is that it’s fundamentally inadequate: the protection can always be broken, and the bootleg copy uploaded to the internet. The unintended effects of digital rights management technologies. Media companies understood that with digital technologies, digital content can be copied more easily than ever before. They sought protection for their digital content products through DRM technologies. Implementing a DRM system is difficult: it requires low-level integration with the operating system, the ability to offer a positive buying experience to end consumers, as well as the business ability to maintain partnerships with content rightsholders. As a result, few companies had the resources to develop DRM: Apple, Amazon, Google, Adobe and Microsoft. These companies were in a powerful position and they tried to leverage that. For example, when ebooks were a novelty, I bought a Kindle to read them. To get an ebook, I’d have to use a computer to buy it from a website. Kindle allowed the books to be transferred wirelessly. Before that, an ebook would be transferred to the reader with a USB cable: a complex feat for many people, requiring special software to run on the computer. That was the time of Kindle and Nook that only large companies can accomplish: it required 1) building a hardware device 2) creating custom software 3) acquiring the content from a number of publishers 4) launching and supporting millions of customers. It took an Apple to release the iPhone. It took a Microsoft to release Windows. It took Barnes & Noble to release Nook, and Amazon to develop the Kindle. Adobe and Microsoft tried to develop general-purpose technologies that were to be used by other stores. This is a harder problem, and Adobe’s ebook DRM technology has proven not to be very user friendly. Consequently, 75% of all the ebook sales now happen just through one company, Amazon. Amazon does not have to support open standards (*): a customer can’t read the purchased book on a device or with software that isn’t Amazon’s own (*). This limits innovation in e-book reading technology. Unlike with paper books, it’s very difficult to legally share one’s library with others. All the purchases are locked into an Amazon account, at mercy of the company operating the service (*) — and Amazon can even arbitrarily remove purchases from customers’ libraries (*). It gets worse: Amazon controls the prices, the selection (*), and the reading experience, and is monitoring every individual page view of every reader. Amazon uses price as its main competitive advantage over other retailers and has a history of driving competitors out of business (*) through predatory pricing (*), which it can afford because of its size (*,*). Amazon has started reducing payments to authors based on monitoring of the e-book reading applications (*). Amazon even started its own publishing unit (*). Other publishers can buy ad space on Amazon to promote their products. But Amazon can feature their own books on the landing page, or include them in automated product recommendations. With the search data, they can prioritize what books to publish. Amazon’s leadership now controls important national news media (*) and is now expanding to education (*). Ironically, judicial system perceived Amazon as an underdog when publishers tried to develop an agency pricing model for ebooks (*). As a result of media companies quest for content protection, a very small number of technology companies have developed a commanding share of the paid media market: Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. These companies are involved in politics and have a considerable amount of ability to affect pricing, presentation and access to content for hundreds of million of people. There are very few controls on what these companies can or cannot do, and with their growth and degradation of journalism, it is becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and regulate them. A better approach than DRM is needed. These days, I prefer to read ebooks on my smartphone or a standard tablet: the pages turn faster, and I don’t need to carry another device. In fact, over 80% of American cell phones sold today are smartphones. I’ve been using several different apps to read my books. Some of them are web applications which don’t even require an installation. Since an ebook is technically not much different than a saved web page, there’s no need for special ebook stores or store-brand reading devices. Ebooks have become an internet technology. It’s the time of Linux and Android, not Windows. There are much fewer barriers to entry for new publishers. The role of libraries in making content affordable and accessible. For those who can’t afford to buy ebooks, it’s now increasingly possible to borrow ebooks from public libraries for free. Libraries are transforming themselves away from warehousing paper into curators of publishing. Libraries protect the rights of publishers and authors, buying ebooks using funds provided by the public, by members and by donors — to make verified and high quality information available to children, students and others. A large part of humanity’s information, knowledge and entertainment aren’t yet easily available online. There are wonderful books only found in libraries, fascinating video materials and recording only found in archives, children’s cartoons only available on DVD, performances only accessible at rare and expensive metropolitan venues, lectures only happening at certain universities. Why are then these materials not accessible to anyone online? It’s not just that the digitalization of physical content into digital form costs money, but that tickets, tuition, physical books help pay for the creation of these materials. In fact, the creators of these materials have a justified fear that once the content will be digitized, unlawful copying or piracy will deprive them of most of their income, just as it has happened to music. When it does become available, it’s usually available for a limited period of time from a single source. This model of licensing is very similar to the broadcast model, where the buyer of the license pays a fixed amount in advance. Such licensing deals tend to be viable only for a limited selection of works that are extensively promoted. At would be unaffordable for a comprehensive library of content to be created using broadcast licensing. In summary, more content will be available when protection and licensing practices are updated for the Internet era. Instead of trying to maintain practices from the publishing and broadcasting industries, a new paradigm of data licenses needs to be developed. Data doesn’t stand alone, but it depends on what is known about it, its reputation, quality, origin. In that respect, the next chapter will examine the role of the middleman. 4. Protecting the Middleman How products get developed and discovered? Creators put their love and care into producing something of quality, be it a book, a song, a film, or a physical product. We celebrate creators for their individual achievements, but in reality, creators don’t get very far without a team. A prerequisite for a quality product is training the creator, helping them develop the skills. Then, the creator needs collaborators and funding to create a high quality product. And finally, the product needs to be checked, certified, introduced to the public, and then distributed. This last stage is often dismissed as marketing, but it’s exceedingly important. In fact, the distribution of the product itself is itself a part of creation. While the creator is intimately familiar with the product and its qualities, a customer initially knows nothing about it. The task for the curator is to create a bridge between the customer and products. Customers have their own motivations, problems and interests. A curator seeks to understand the customers’ state of mind, and present the available products so that their value is clear to the customer, and present them in a way that allows the customer to explore and select. Moreover, the curator seeks to protect the customer from low quality and high price. Finally, curator retains a long-term relationship with the customer, as it’s rare for a customer to maintain strong relationships with every individual product’s creator. The job of storekeeper or merchant includes the work of a curator. Running the business of a store also requires procuring, storing, displaying, and protecting the merchandise, handling accounting, taking payments, and managing complaints, returns and refunds. With all this complexity, the curatorial role can easily be neglected: we’ve often found a store assistant that knew little about the products he was selling. Amazon does not have to create a pleasant environment of a bookstore and doesn’t employ staff to provide guidance to the bookstore customers. Amazon doesn’t have to display products and let customers try new products. But Amazon benefits from brick-and-mortar stores doing that. A buyer can be enjoying the curated selections in a physical store. Once the customer discovers a product, they can go to Amazon and search for the product they already know. With Amazon’s scale, it’s hard for most curators or brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with on cost. This practice is referred to as showrooming. Indeed, a store is a mix between a warehouse and a showroom or a gallery. Customers can explore products, ask the store employees for recommendations. If there’s a problem with the product, the store provides assurance and returns. It’s expensive to provide recommendations and allow a customer to explore the products. When stores do not provide such service, the publisher needs to market the products by broadcasting. While this isn’t a problem for consumer products like toothpaste, it’s a much more significant problem with small-volume products like books and fashion. That’s why stores provide an important role in discovery. They have a similar role as museums, as they create curated collections of products. Tourists travel far to spend time visiting shopping districts filled with boutiques. On the other hand, online stores like Amazon are the equivalent of a warehouse: it’s hard to discover anything new unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Amazon and iTunes provide a user interface that has changed very little from the 1916 self-service store patent by Clarence Saunders. Saunders’ patent proposed that the customers walk through a store, collecting products for purchase from the shelves and putting them into the cart, paying at the checkout. Various devices, like one-way turnstiles, prevented thievery. Before that, a customer would order an item from a shopkeeper on the other side of a counter. This concept was quickly imitated across the industry. Online retailers are encouraging showrooming and attempting to steal the efforts of curators, giving them no recognition or compensation. For example, Amazon introduced the Amazon Shopping App in 2011. A customer can use this app to scan the bar code on the product, and buy it for a lower price from Amazon online (*). The store had to pay to attract the customer, stock the products, let customers browse in a pleasant environment, working to match the products to the customer. The store is now deprived of income, and the local community is deprived of sales tax and later deprived from retail stores going out of business. Over the past two decades the circle of curators has shrunk. The number of bookstores has fallen from over 38,500 in 2004 to fewer than 25,000 in 2016, a 36% decrease (*). The number of independent record stores has fallen from over 3,300 in 2003 to under 1,600 in 2013, a 52% decrease (*). The number of movie tickets sold is predicted to fall from 1.6B in 2003 to 1.0B in 2016, a 36% decrease (*). As these curators are vanishing, the mass-marketed hits and best-seller lists are beginning to dominate sales. In the past, the curators used to enable the “middle class” of quality content. That content was not being mass marketed, but was still widely available through theaters, through reviews, and through stores. There, content was picked up by enthusiasts who then recommended it further and gave it enough distribution for the products to be financially viable. But now, much content is no longer as viable as it used to be (*,*). Big hits are becoming bigger than ever: in the summer of 2016 of the top 100 tracks spinning on Pandora, 20 belonged to Drake according to the Pandora Top Spins chart (*). Many retailers are responding to the problem of showrooming. They don’t want to carry products where they won’t offer the best price. They look to be the exclusive retailer for products, sometimes through custom products or through store brands. We can already see deals where certain movies or TV shows are only accessible through one of the stores. It’s a frustrating situation for consumers, who are sometimes forced to acquire a whole monthly subscription to just watch one show or listen to one album. With digital products, content is fundamentally the same regardless of the source — and it would be most sensible to fix the price and allow different retailers to instead compete on the quality of curation and delivery. In the meantime top tier manufacturers such as Apple are opening their own stores partly also in response to retailers’ falling ability to curate. Many publishers have tried this as well, but the results have been somewhat mixed. Digital marketing is expensive if the customer lifetime value is less than $100. While a publisher knows how to select and produce quality content, creating a bookstore environment is not their core competency. Moreover, retailers do not want help customers discover products just so that they would later be bought directly from the supplier directly. Some publishers take an effort to assure their impartiality with respect to all their retailers. The demise of the reviewer. A large part of curation of products is done by our friends. They purchase products and test them — and then recommend them to others. Early adopters, which Malcolm Gladwell refers to as “mavens” in his book “The Tipping Point“ can spend a lot of time and money on staying ahead of others in knowing what’s best. But these are acts of volunteerism, not paid professional work. Few people can afford to develop a true expertise on products. Professional reviewers of the heyday were employed by magazines and newspapers, who had the resources to systematically evaluate a wide selection of products, and create high-quality reviews. Internet has made it a lot easier for anyone to publish. While such reviews are cheap and plentiful, volunteer reviewers typically don’t have much expertise in the product or evaluation techniques. Professional reviewers’ work is also used by “review aggregators” such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes without compensation to create aggregations which are then offered online to end-customers. Some of the largest review aggregators have no qualms about uncredited data theft (*). E-commerce companies like Amazon solicit product reviews from its customers, offering no compensation and deprofessionalizing reviewing. As a result, there is an increasing amount of unreliable and deceptive reviews (*) — and customers need to spend an increasing amount of time researching. The best-seller lists can be easily manipulated by large publishers who have the resources to simply purchase their own products. Social media “influencers” can leverage their following to solicit positive reviews, views and ratings to help boost their ratings. Because customers trust such lists and recommendations, an initial fake purchase will be followed by real purchases — so such manipulative actions can be highly profitable (*). Reviewing communities bring together enthusiasts and expert who collaborate to develop their expertise on a particular topic, just like academic and hacker communities. The community provides a reward for sharing, but also peer review which discourages fakery and deception in reviews. As a result of that combined with the attitude of giving reviews away to the general public, the websites that bring the communities together are attractive acquisition targets. A book reviewer community GoodReads, as well as the movie database IMDB have been acquired by Amazon (*,*). Thus, the reviewers who thought they volunteered their work to the community, have instead merely donated their work to the companies who hosted the communities. It was these companies who received the money from the acquirers without having to compensate the contributors. The work of the contributors and their social connections are now effectively owned by Amazon. Automation of recommendations. The internet media companies think reviews and reviewers will soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and recommender systems. Such automated recommendations use the data we voluntarily submit about what we like or dislike. For example, one who liked several action movies might be recommended other action movies. The technology was pioneered by Netflix who realized that marketing drives people to see heavily marketed recent blockbuster movies — but it was expensive for them to purchase such a large number of DVDs. So, Netflix seeks to persuade its customers through recommendations to instead order an older, cheaper movie that they would still like. This has proven very profitable for Netflix, and given it a key advantage over other DVD rental companies. When Amazon notices that we’re considering a particular product, it lists other products that were frequently bought alongside with it. For example, if you look at Tolstoy’s War and Peace product page on Amazon, you will be also suggested other Russian classics. Amazon’s goal is to increase the number of sales, while minimizing the human effort of curation. This automation seems convenient, but there are important problems. Quality curation is often about exposing a visitor to new experiences, so that they develop a broader perspective. On the other hand, recommender systems seem to draw an unsuspecting customer deeper and deeper onto the rabbit hole they might have crawled into. For example, someone who bought a right-wing political book was just recommended more right-wing books, and someone who has bought a left-wing book was recommended even more left-wing books, based on the research into Amazon’s product recommendations (*). This can lead do dangerous political polarization, creating a deep rift in society. Another problem with such product recommendations is that new products have not been bought by anyone yet. So, a manufacturer with a large marketing budget can pay people to buy the product and thus populate the recommendation systems. Somewhat ironically, Amazon also offers its suppliers an option to buy advertising on amazon.com (*). The digital advertising market is highly centralized with Google and Facebook controlling almost 50% of digital advertising dollars in the US in 2016 (*). But there’s no economic incentive for an early adopter or a discoverer of such a product to profit from helping to spread the good word for a quality product except through non-monetary reputation economy. This is hopefully not the end. There are solutions. As many other volunteers on the Internet, I’m dependent on emotional and material support to continue to do my work. There’s much funding available for fashionable stuff. But there are real problems that aren’t fashionable (yet!).

Many are expecting the Cupertino company to unveil the said device during this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. The event, which will take place on Monday, June 5, will be the first since 2013 to introduce a new device during the proceedings. Unfortunately, as exciting as it may sound, it seems like anyone hoping to acquire the Siri Speaker later this month will be in for a rude awakening. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, source close to Apple claims that the device will not be released until much later. Instead of the expected June release, consumers might have to wait until the last quarter of 2017. This is quite surprising since the alleged Siri Speaker is already in production at the moment. Right now, nobody knows why Apple has decided on the delay. Nonetheless, this could prove to be detrimental in terms of possible sales. Amazon Echo Show (via amazon.com) Amazon is expected to ship the Echo Show around the 28th of June. By missing the supposed release date for the Siri Speaker, Apple is effectively giving Amazon a free reign on the initial sales for the virtual assistant hardware. Until this point, not a lot of details are known about the rumored Siri device from Apple. The latest report from Bloomberg claims that, to beat the competition, the Siri Speaker offers far superior speakers with surround sound capabilities. Furthermore, the device will also have full integration with all of Apple’s products. Other than those information, nothing much has been revealed. It is still too soon to say whether the Siri Speaker will indeed be a hit even for hardcore Apple fans. A few years back, Apple has released a device with a slightly similar concept. However, due to steep pricing, the product was eventually pull from the market in about a year and a half. For more updates on the Siri Speaker, be sure to check us out at The Bitbag.

Both companies have been firing lawsuits after lawsuits at each other for quite some time now. It is undeniable that the relationship has now been strained especially after one calling the other “unfair” and the other retaliating with an import ban. Now, rumor has it that Apple has gained a new ally with regards to the iPhone 8 that may spell disaster to Qualcomm. Over the past few years, Apple has been dependent on Qualcomm to provide its products for Apple’s range of mobile devices. These are mostly broadband or wireless modems used on most of the iPhones in the market. Last year, Qualcomm has controlled the majority of supplies for the iPhone’s modems. The other part of the spectrum was held by Intel, with its subpar chips. Last year, however, Digitimes reports that the supply for wireless modems will be split equally between Qualcomm and Intel. Furthermore, the report also mentioned that Apple is planning on giving Intel much of the supply percentage by 2018. This could potentially mean the end of Qualcomm modem’s inside the future iPhone and iPad devices. Alleged iPhone 8 mockup unit (by Benjamin Geskin) The only real reason that Apple chose Qualcomm is the fact that it has the better technology when it comes to wireless modems. However, since the release of Intel’s XMM 7560 LTE modem, this will soon change. This is because the said chip is capable of reaching a theoretical 1GB bandwidth. The recent counter lawsuits against each other has certainly not helped Qualcomm’s reputation in this regard. It should be noted that Apple, early this year, withheld almost $1 billion of royalties to Qualcomm on the basis of unfair monopoly. After that, Qualcomm fired with a counter lawsuit regarding patents that are used on the iPhones and has sought to get the said devices banned in the United States. Because the court has ruled in favor of Apple, a few companies have started following suit by not paying royalties to Qualcomm. This has infuriated Qualcomm which leads us to the current predicament. Unless Qualcomm does something drastic about the matter, it risks losing quite a big chunk if its earnings. For more tech update, be sure to check us out at The Bitbag.

In a memo to Apple employees Thursday afternoon, Cook expressed his disappointment with Trump's decision to pull out of the global agreement. "I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment," Cook wrote in the message, which was obtained by CNN. "We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that's good for our planet and makes good business sense as well." Cook joins a growing chorus of business and Silicon Valley executives panning the president's decision to pull the U.S. out of the accord. Earlier on Thursday, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk quit two of the president's business advisory councils after Trump announced his decision. According to a March report in the Washington Post, Cook is working with the White House Office of American Innovation. Apple did not comment on whether Cook would continue working with this group. On Twitter, Cook further criticized Trump's move, tweeting: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver." In his memo to employees, Cook said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday to try to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the Paris deal. Other tech executives including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have also expressed disappointment in the decision and reiterated their commitment to sustainable technologies.
