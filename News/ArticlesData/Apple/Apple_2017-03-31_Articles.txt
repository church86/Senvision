Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 OPINION: FOR a long time there have been tongue-in-cheek suggestions that Apple should be considered a religious cult instead of a tech brand, In my view, it’s hard to deny this fact. From mercilessly defending the smallest criticisms of the tech giant’s products online to lining up for days outside of its flagship stores to be one of the first to get an ever so slightly better iPhone, Apple has been able to attract fanboys unlike any of its competitors. And while the “Cult of Apple” might be well-deserved, it appears the tech giant is starting to take it for granted and constantly banking on the fact its customers will stick by the company regardless of the decisions it makes. I understand we live in a ruthlessly capitalist society and companies need to keep making a profit in order to survive, but I can’t help but feel Apple is delivering its customers the middle finger over and over again. It’s primary focus seems less on making our lives easier and more on making them more money. Take the tech giants latest 9.7-inch iPad for example. The product is a thin, elegant and powerful tablet with a starting price of $469, which makes it a relatively cheap solution to those not wanting to drop the money for a new laptop. On the surface its all very kosher, but when mobile repair website iFixit pulled apart the iPad in the name of helping the consumer, it discovered a nasty little secret that is not great news for anyone who breaks the device. As with the predecessor model, the iPad has been built in such a way that it would be almost impossible for customers to perform a DIY fix on the product, which means customers are forced to rely on Apple to perform repairs — generally the most expensive option. According to iFixit, which gave the iPad a repairability score of just 2/10, there a number of features that can actually do more damage to the device during a fix. “Just like in previous iPads, the front panel is glued to the rest of the device, greatly increasing the chances of cracking the glass during a repair,” iFixit wrote. “Gobs of adhesive hold everything in place. As with its Air 1 predecessor, this ranks among the most difficult battery removal procedures we’ve seen in an iPad. “The LCD has foam sticky tape adhering it to the front panel, increasing chances of it being shattered during disassembly. “You can’t access the front panel’s connector until you remove the LCD.” All of these factors combine to make a simple fix much more difficult and costly if things go wrong, meaning the safest option is to drop some serious cash at Apple’s Genius Bar — this could only be made slightly cheaper if you have invested in an Apple Care plan. Apple has been contacted for comment on this issue. One of the most common issues with the iPhone might have just gotten more expensive to fix. Source: SuppliedSource:Supplied The iPad isn’t the only product to introduce this type of repair monopoly, with Apple’s forthcoming iPhone 8 tipped to be designed to ensure the tech giant gets your money from one of the most common problems people have with their device — a cracked display. It has to do with the device tipped to have a full-screen OLED display without a physical home button, meaning the Touch ID fingerprint-reading sensor will be moved into the screen itself. As it currently stands, the Touch ID sensor is the only part of the iPhone that has to be replaced by Apple because it is paired with the Secure Enclave — a chip providing all cryptographic operations for data protection, including Touch ID, Apple Pay and passcodes. Given the fingerprint data is actually stored on the Secure Enclave, it is impossible to get replacement Touch ID sensors to work on your existing phone. “[The secure data] is encrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the device’s shared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave,” Apple wrote in a security document. So, essentially, new touch sensors will not be able to work as the component cannot be paired with the existing Secure Enclave in your phone — a feature needed to ensure someone can’t take data from your encrypted phones by simply putting in a new button assigned to their finger. Apple is able to get around this problem with the tech giant has a “calibration machine” located in every flagship store that is capable of recalibrating the new sensor to work with your existing phone. The machines are believed to cost between $20,000 and $60,000, and to ensure they remain hidden from the public, an Apple employee said it’s impossible to even photograph one. Apple denied to comment on this issue. Apple MacBook removed all of its legacy ports.Source:Supplied While the iPhone 8 repair monopoly remains purely speculative at this point in time, there is past evidence of Apple putting profit in front of consumer satisfaction. Remember the donglegate controversy that surrounded the 2016 release of Apple’s MacBook Pro line-up? In case you forgot, Apple removed all of its MacBook Pro legacy ports, except for the 3.5mm headphone jack — a strange choice given it removed that very port from its iPhone 7 because it believed it was an outdated and irrelevant feature. The decision meant there were no longer ports for USB 3, HDMI, SD Card or even Apple’s MagSafe connector, with the tech company opting for four USB Type-C ports. While USB-C is the next-generation industry standard as it offers ultra-fast data transfer speeds, device charging and video output, it meant Apple customers were forced to buy a number of dongles to effectively use their new MacBook Pro. As the latest iPhone 7 charging cable is USB 3 to Lightning, a dongle was needed so customers can charge Apple’s latest smartphone on its most recent MacBook Pro. With no HDMI port on the new laptops, another dongle was be required to hook your MacBook up to a television screen. There was also the need to purchase additional dongles to use SD Cards, VGA and Thunderbolt 2 connected devices, and Ethernet cables. At the time of release, adding all of these products to your shopping basket from Apple’s online store put an additional $378.85 to the cost of the MacbBook Pro. Thankfully, after the heavy backlash Apple slightly reduced the price of its dongles — but it was still making a profit from it’s “valued customers” don’t you worry about that. Apple also denied to comment on this issue at the time. Apple AirPods were another one of Apple’s issues.Source:Supplied Just this week, Apple caused another stir when it was discovered owners of older iPhones might soon be forced to upgrade, with Apple tipped to cease support for previous models of its phones. Despite being supported by the iOS 10.3 update Apple released earlier this week, the tech giant is tipped to drop the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the fourth generation iPad later this year. Eagle-eyed analysts made the discovery when looking into the code of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, which was made available to developers shortly after the iOS 10.3 release. IT specialist Zeph. McLearan tweeted a picture of Apple’s code showing it makes no mention of any of the older 32-bit devices in the iOS update — only including modern iPhones with 64-bit processors. Although the gadgets would still function in theory, it would be impossible to install the latest apps or downloads official Apple patches to protect hackers from exploiting security holes. Apple has the option to build in support at a later date as the firmware is still in beta testing, but its something to be mindful of if you own any of the above mentioned products. In addition the cost of add-ons, repairs and replacement of its devices, Apple also has shown it doesn’t mind making its customers wait for products it has advertised. The iPhone 8 hasn’t even been released yet, but industry reports are already suggesting Apple will be struggling to get the tenth anniversary edition iPhone out in time for Christmas — despite likely showcasing the product in September. This will be nothing new for the tech giant which saw similar problems with the launch of its flagship products last year. During the September launch, Apple provided an answer to the removal of the headphone jack in the form of its AirPod wireless earbuds. Apple said the product would be available for $A229 from late October, but the AirPods didn’t go on sale until just before Christmas. The AirPods were just one of the delays from the launch, which started with the Aussie teenagers who lined up outside of the Apple store for more than 72 hours to secure a jet black iPhone 7 Plus, only to be told the units weren’t available in stores because they were already sold out. In fact, the jet black model of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus became increasingly rare, people ordering the phone had to wait more than a month to get the product. I mean, it’s cool that you make great products Apple, but how about putting a little more thought into your consumers because the fanboys might not stick around forever.

Towards the end of his tenure, he moved into a confidential role within the firm's hardware technologies division.  After leaving Apple in 2015, Hillman spent a year working at robotics outfit Zoox, before eventually being picked up by Facebook, which spent $2 billion to acquire Oculus in 2014.  As Bloomberg notes, the move is interesting because Hillman has a history of developing consumer products at one of the biggest tech firms on the planet. And according to a job listing for the head of hardware gig, that's precisely what he'll be doing at Oculus, with Hillman being brought in to "set the strategy and execute on Oculus' consumer product roadmap." This is the second major hire Facebook has made in its virtual reality division this year. Back in January, the company made Xiaomi's former global vice president, Hugo Barra, its new VP of virtual reality. "There's no greater calling in our industry than taking breakthrough tech and making it available to the greatest number of people," wrote Barra at the time, making Facebook's consumer VR ambitions crystal clear. "[I'm] really looking forward to doing just that at Facebook."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost Image Source: Oliur Rahman, Pexels Zach Epstein @zacharye March 28th, 2017 at 10:43 AM Share Tweet After releasing a few hundred different beta versions over the past month or so, Apple on Monday finally released iOS 10.3 to the public. Eager iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users rushed to download and install the update, and they were greeted with some nifty new features. In a post on Monday afternoon, we went through the eight best new features in iOS 10.3, including a new Find My AirPods feature, updates to the Maps app, Apple’s new file system and more. There was one feature in particular that we listed in the post that deserves more attention though, and not many people realize it’s even there. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design When Apple releases any new iOS software, hardcore Apple fans always rush to download and install it immediately, regardless of what new features Apple adds. This is a good thing for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that new iOS software always includes security updates that are crucial. iOS 10.3 is no different — it’s packed full of security fixes that users should be eager to install immediately. Of course, the user-facing features are typically the main draw for new iOS updates, and iOS 10.3 has a few nice additions and changes. One set of changes in particular is worth noting, but it’s hiding in plain sight so most iPhone and iPad users won’t even notice it’s there. Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart‏ tweeted on Monday afternoon about something that we mentioned in passing in our post covering the best new features in iOS 10.3. “iOS 10.3 feels ‘snappier,'” he said, “because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.” iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 Long story short, Apple has made a number of small adjustments to the animations that are played when the user does things like opening an app, closing an app, or switching from one app to another. Longtime iPhone users may recall that Apple did something similar back in 2014 with iOS 7.1. The speed difference back then was much more dramatic and noticeable, but the improvements in iOS 10.3 are still nothing to scoff at. If you have an iPhone or iPad and haven’t yet updated to iOS 10.3, a faster UI should be reason enough to install the update as soon as you can. iOS 10.3 is available to download in iTunes, or as an over the air (OTA) update accessing in the Settings app by navigating to General > Software Update.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Hidden feature in iOS 10.3 will make living with 16GB iPhones a lot easier Chris Smith @chris_writes March 29th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Apple earlier this week released a bunch of updates for its various mobile operating system, including iOS 10.3, the next major upgrade for iPhone and iPad. We already showed you some of the best features of iOS 10.3 and explained why the iPhone will suddenly feel snappier after the update. But it looks like there’s one more hidden perk in iOS 10.3 that users will certainly appreciate. The operating system now gobbles up less storage than before, which should make living with a 16GB iPhone or iPad a lot easier than before. Don't Miss: iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s specs and features listed in new report Apple finally killed the 16GB storage tier this year, which is great news for new iPhone and iPad buyers who get to buy an iOS device that has at least 32GB of memory on board. But there are plenty of iOS users out there still rocking 16GB devices who probably feel the pain of not having sufficient storage space. iOS 10.3 will fix the problem, Apple Insider explains. While upgrading a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus to iOS 10.3, the site discovered an increase in available storage space of almost 8GB. The device has over 40,000 photos and more than 200 apps installed before and after the update. Image Source: Apple Insider Not only did the overall capacity estimate shot up from 248.5GB to 252.14GB, but the available storage jumped from 75.45GB to 83.26GB for an increase of 7.81GB, as seen in the image above. That doesn’t mean your 16GB iOS device will suddenly get a massive storage boost. The more memory you have, the report explains, the more free space iOS 10.3 will reclaim. The reason why this happens appears to be one of the major features of iOS 10.3, but one that users will hardly notice. APFS, short for Apple File System, is now the new file system running on Apple’s devices. That’s why the iOS 10.3 update took so long because Apple moved from the dated HFS+ system to its brand new innovation. AFPS manages how files are stored on the iPhone. It’s optimized for flash storage, and it’s apparently more efficient at optimizing how storage is consumed by the system and apps. It’s likely Apple will continue to improve storage management in the future to squeeze out as much free memory as possible for the user. In the meantime, if you still haven’t updated your device to iOS 10.3, this might be a great reason to do it.

Media Creation | 29 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) Photo Editing as One with Luminar by Jeff Carlson Back when most photographers used Adobe Photoshop to edit their images, many developers created plug-ins or stand-alone applications to focus on specific tasks. For example, Nik Software’s Silver Efex Pro plug-in specialized in creating black-and-white images, as did Macphun’s Tonality application. Whether you wanted more control over removing digital noise or applying lots of pre-made effects, there was a separate tool (often purchased separately or as a bundle) for you. Recently, though, photo editing is shifting back to all-in-one tools. Google purchased Nik Software and has been working its technology into Snapseed and Google Photos (though the Nik tools are still available for free; see “Google Gives Away Its Nik Collection Photo-editing Apps,” 31 March 2016). And Macphun has released a new application, Luminar, that takes the technologies from its solo applications and combines them into one master tool. (Tonality and the other utilities remain for sale separately or bundled as Creative Kit.) Luminar is a bold bet intended to compete against Photoshop — still the biggest gorilla in the jungle for professionals and enthusiasts — while also beckoning those who haven’t yet moved on from Apple’s long-discontinued Aperture. Luminar is also trying to appeal to casual photographers who want more image editing capabilities than Apple’s Photos. Plus, with its $69 price, Luminar hopes to appeal to the folks who don’t want to pay Adobe’s monthly or yearly subscription fee to use Photoshop. Before we get into the details, though, indulge me in one quick declaration about its core capabilities: Luminar is more than capable as an image editor — it has all the adjustment controls for manipulating tone and color that you’d expect. Trying to cover them all in this article would bore us both. In my testing, none of Luminar’s edits were inconsistent with what you’d see when editing in other applications. The tools are all there; it’s what you do with them that makes a difference. If you want to compare features with Aperture, Lightroom, and Creative Kit, Macphun has created a handy chart. What’s most interesting about Luminar is its approach to juggling all of those tools. Like other Macphun applications, Luminar prominently features presets for one-click editing. And for the individual tools, Luminar refers to everything as “filters” that exist in “workspaces.” Other editing applications also use that terminology, but Luminar’s execution sets it apart. First, a disclaimer: In early 2016 I wrote a short guide for Macphun about its Aurora HDR application, which the company still gives away as part of purchasing bundles. I also contract with Adobe to produce tutorials and other educational materials. Presets -- I tend to gloss over or outright ignore presets, probably because of how I learned to edit photos in other applications. I prefer digging into the adjustment controls to nudge a photo’s appearance so it’s closer to what I remember seeing when I captured it, rather than applying a preset that dramatically shifts the look of the image. Some of Luminar’s 60 presets help with the kind of nudging I like. Image Enhancer, for instance, acts as a general make-better button, while Sky Enhancer and Detailed address specific goals or fixes (pulling drama out of bland upper areas and sharpening soft images, respectively). However, it’s increasingly common for photographers to want to apply stylized looks to photos. I often see Instagram photographers who have developed a signature look for all of their shots. The idea isn’t necessarily to reflect what was captured, but instead to evoke a mood, like adding a tinge of earth tones to every shot. Each of Luminar’s preset displays a preview of your image with the effect applied, so you get a sense of how it will affect the photo before you make a choice. Applying a Luminar preset saves a lot of time adjusting the same settings for each image. The app’s six categories of presets — Basic, Street, Outdoor, Portrait, Travel, and Dramatic — are fine starting points, but it’s better to create your own based on your editing preferences. It’s easy to make new presets, share them with other Luminar users, and install presets others have created. Editing with Filters -- One of the things I like about Luminar is that it’s relentlessly non-destructive. When editing photos, you don’t want to actually change the pixels in the original image, something older software did and many of Photoshop’s legacy controls still do. Non-destructive editing not only makes it easy to revert to the original and start over, but also change different aspects of what you’ve edited to that point. For example, if you increase the color temperature and then later increase the saturation, the photo could end up too warm. You can go back and lower the color temperature to balance the warmth while maintaining the saturated colors you want. Luminar enables this flexibility by making nearly every adjustment a filter, from basic controls such as Tone to specialized ones like Adjustable Gradient, which manipulates several types of edits — exposure, contrast, vibrancy, and warmth — in the top and bottom areas of the frame. To use a particular editing effect, add a filter; the interface even explains what each effect does. You can also read more detail about each filter in Macphun’s documentation. This approach isn’t unique; Lightroom has editing panels whose adjustments can be turned on and off, and Photos includes more adjustments than most people realize because they’re not initially visible in the Adjustments panel. Luminar takes the concept further by making almost everything a filter. That leads to some interesting options. You can duplicate each filter, enabling you to stack multiple instances of an effect, or perhaps colorize two instances of the same effect with different hues. Filters can also have their own blend modes, something typically available only to layers. A blend mode applies the filter’s effect to a certain range of colors or tones. For example, the Multiply blend mode removes white from the scene, darkening it dramatically without having to adjust the exposure. One feature I miss is an easy Auto option for calculating the best adjustments to make a photo look good. This isn’t due to laziness on my part (though that’s sometimes true) but is because I’m curious about how the software thinks an image should look. In Lightroom, I often click the Auto button in the Basic adjustments panel to establish a starting point for my editing. Sometimes the software overexposes a shot compared to what I’d prefer. I’ll then adjust the settings to my liking, or choose Edit > Undo and manually start from scratch. The closest workaround in Luminar is to choose a preset such as Image Enhancer and work your way up from there. To the app’s credit, the Tone filter also includes a Smart Tone slider that performs some of these tasks. Perhaps I just need to retrain myself, but I’d find it helpful to have an Auto button on the Tone filter, or on any filter, for that matter. Tools and Layers -- In addition to the filters, Luminar includes a handful of tools that perform specific actions. The Clone & Stamp tool, the Erase tool (which is like Photoshop’s content-aware technology), and the Denoise tool all operate like stand-alone modules, taking over the screen and presenting controls for just those actions. When you finish making the edit, such as removing an object from a scene using the Erase tool, Luminar adds that edit as a new layer — yet another instance of non-destructive respect for the original image. As with layers in other applications, you can use layers in Luminar to build up effects, isolate edits to specific areas, and more. When a new layer is created, by a tool or by manually adding one, all of Luminar’s filters are available to it. For example, suppose you want to brighten just one area of a photo instead of the entire image. One way to do that would be to create a new adjustment layer (which affects the appearance of the layers below it), and add a filter such as Tone or Exposure. Next, you’d use the Radial Mask tool to drag an oval over the area you wish to highlight and click Invert so the adjustment is applying to the area within the circle. You could then add other filters to change the appearance. Luminar supports the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. When using the Clone & Stamp tool, for instance, there’s a handy brush size slider in the Touch Bar, which is far more convenient than taking a mouse trip to the options bar and changing the size there. (You can also press the bracket keys to make the brush size larger or smaller, a faster method and a standard convention among many similar applications, but that’s not obvious to new users.) However, the size slider is not present when using the Brush Mask tool, which would be equally helpful, so it looks as though Touch Bar support isn’t yet complete. Workspaces -- The final piece of Luminar’s editing experience is its Workspaces feature, which takes advantage of the modularity of filters to create collections of filters that you use regularly or in specific situations. Not every photo needs every filter; if you’re working on a black-and-white image, why clutter the interface with Hue and Saturation controls? Luminar offers workspaces for four common photo types, each of which includes filters you’d use for such an image: B & W, Landscape, Portrait, and Street. You can also set up Workspaces for convenience, such as by putting your preferred controls at the top of the Filters panel to reduce unnecessary scrolling. Lightroom Plug-in and Photos Extension -- It’s worth calling out the fact that Luminar does not attempt to manage your photo library. I normally wouldn’t even bring that up, since Luminar is an editing application, but Macphun has said that a future update will add library management, too. If you’re accustomed to managing, opening, and editing photos in Lightroom or Photos, it feels almost archaic to edit image files in another app. In the meantime, Luminar includes a plug-in that lets you use Lightroom’s Edit In command to send a copy of an image to the Luminar application. When you finish, the edited version shows up in your Lightroom library. If you instead use Photos to manage your photo collection, you can take advantage of Luminar’s editing tools using a Photos extension. That loads Luminar inside the Photos interface and offers the same controls you’d find in the stand-alone application. When you save your changes, the extension applies the edits to the image in the Photos library. Note that when you’re using either the Luminar plug-in for Lightroom or the Luminar editing extension in Photos, you can’t go back in and adjust your settings later. Both options create a final edited version of the photo. In Lightroom, the copy sits alongside the original in a stack (Lightroom’s method of grouping photos). In Photos, you can revert to the original and start over if you don’t like the result, or you can edit on top of the edited version. Compare that to opening photos from the Finder and editing them directly in the Luminar application. In that situation, you can save the results as Luminar files that can optionally retain their edit history. You get more editing flexibility, but if you use Lightroom or Photos to manage your photos, you need to track those Luminar files (with an .lmnr filename extension) separately. When Macphun delivers the update that adds image management (which so far isn’t pegged to a date, but is just a promise), you will, in theory, be able to go back and access the entire edit history for any photo in your library. That’s how Lightroom works now if you use its built-in editing tools. All in One and One for All -- For pure convenience, having all the editing tools you want close at hand is better than reaching into every corner of your workshop to get them. Too often, when companies try to build all-in-one tools, the result is either lackluster or overcrowded. Luminar strikes that delicate balance of including most everything you want in a photo editor without being overwhelming. It’s a powerful app that can also be picked up pretty easily by photographers looking for more than Photos offers without committing too (and paying for) the full capabilities of Photoshop.

Hats off for a great review of Luminar that serves your readers well. Your insights into using presets as starting points, plus explaining the flexibility of filters/layers and workspaces were spot on. I also loved the idea of stacking multiple instances of the same filter - good insight that I often forget about! The "Auto button" is a feature I've also recommended and am advocating for w/ the dev team - nice suggestion! One thing I'd add which I think is super-unique and really flexible is the idea of using Filter Masking within a single layer. In other words, any filter you want to apply to an image can be selectively applied with a brush/mask, without creating additional layers. Opens up a world of possibilities! Cheers!

The update to iOS 10.3 is now rolling out to the iPhone and iPad, while Apple Watch owners are receiving a bump to watchOS 3.2. On the iOS side of things, you can expect the new update to bring Find My AirPods, a feature that’ll help you locate your lost wireless earbuds, as well as lots of other smaller tweaks. Also included is the change to Apple File System (APFS), which isn’t exactly user-facing, but is still a big enough change that you should probably perform a backup before updating. Focusing specifically on T-Mobile, folks on Reddit are reporting that they’re getting a new carrier update today, too. Here’s what the official iOS 10.3 changelog from Apple looks like: Find My iPhone View the current or last known location of your AirPods Play a sound on one or both AirPods to help you find them Siri Support for paying and checking status o bills with payment apps Support for scheduling with ride booking apps Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps Cricket sports scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council CarPlay Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song’s album Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music Other improvements and fixes Rent once and watch your iTunes movies across your devices New Settings unified view for your Apple ID account information, settings and devices Hourly weather in Maps using 3D Touch on the displayed current temperature Support for searching “parked car” in Maps Calendar adds the ability to delete an unwanted invite and report it as junk Home app support to trigger scenes using accessories with switches and buttons Home app support for accessory battery level status Podcasts support for 3D Touch and Today widget to access recently updated shows Podcast shows or episodes are shareable to Messages with full playback support Fixes an issue that could prevent Maps from displaying your current location after resetting Location & Privacy VoiceOver stability improvements for Phone, Safari, and Mail Meanwhile, Apple Watch owners are receiving an update to watchOS 3.2. One of the big new features in this update is Theater Mode, which will disable Raise to Wake and turn on silent mode on your Apple Watch so that your smartwatch doesn’t disturb your fellow moviegoers. Here’s Apple’s official watchOS 3.2 changelog: Siri now works with apps from the App Store to start workouts, send messages, make payments, book rides, and more. Theater Mode setting turns on silent mode and keeps the screen dark until you tap it, even when you raise your wrist. Scribble is now available in French, Spanish, and Italian. Music playlist sync progress is now displayed in the Apple Watch app on iPhone.

He says, "We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirit is second to none." | TNN | Updated: Apr 1, 2017, 08.34 AM IST Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. BENGALURU: Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, was one of Steve Jobs's closest friends and confidantes, and a product keynoter. He came up with the spin-wheel interface for iPods, led the digital music revolution with iPod and iTunes, and helped reinvent mobile phones with the iPhone and the App Store. Schiller, who reports now to CEO Tim Cook, was in Bengaluru on Friday - his first trip to India - for the launch of the company's App Accelerator, a platform that will support iOS developers on design, quality and performance of their apps. The accelerator will assist developers to build apps using its programming language Swift that was created for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. In an interview with TOI, Schiller talks about how they want to offer the best for Indian customers and developers. When did India show up on Apple's radar? Hard to say to a day. Over the last few years, it's grown dramatically in importance to us. This is a very exciting change, we see the opportunity for a huge market and a very young population and we want to be important here. We want to make products that this market loves. Our driving ambition in every market is to be the best, and not the cheapest, with whatever that means to customers. In India, we want to be the best provider of the things we do. We have started asking ourselves what it means to be the best in India - how is it like other markets and how is it different. Distribution can be different, network infrastructure is different. How are you tapping into India's vibrant developer base? We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none. Our rough estimate is just under half a million registered developers and if you include the extended number of people that are working with them on their apps, that should be somewhere around three quarters of a million people in the iOS app economy. We want to help them be more successful in the local market and there is a great opportunity for developers in India through our App Store to reach to the world. We want to use things that Apple is good at to assist these developers, like user interface design, we also want to give them our knowledge of the latest tech, the new frameworks and the new APIs. Apple has somewhat had a love-hate relationship with developers globally. Have you reduced the friction points since you started running developer relations? I would always like to think that we have a love-love relationship. But we have certainly had to get better as to how we run the business and listen to developers. And over the last year and a half, we have put a concerted effort to say that our App Store has been open for 8-9 years and so much growth is in front of us. And developers tell us that our effort has been showing. They have seen it in our review times, in the business models that we are opening up with subscriptions. Also Read: Apple opens its Accelerator program in Bengaluru You were one of Steve Jobs's closest colleagues, you shared the dais with him on blockbuster product launches. How did you deal with the pressure? Steve was a truly remarkable person and a great mentor for all of us at Apple. Over the years, he worked hard to put in place people and a system to try to keep alive the spirit of the company he founded. And I would like to think that still matters to all of us who work at Apple. His passion for great products, sensitivities of the intersection of tech and design, customers and experiences, and taking responsibility for everything - from the chips we use to the buying experience - are some of the many things that he taught us. Apple's fortunes sank in 1997, the year you rejoined the firm. How did Jobs and his team including you think about resurrecting a company that was nearly out of business? Apple was almost out of business. Steve tried to bring together a bunch of us to save the company and it seemed an impossible task at that time. One of the great things Steve did and taught us all was how to stay focused, how to make tough choices and to say no to a lot of things that were going on and that were good but were diluting resources and we needed to all come together and just make a few great things that could help save Apple at the time. We had to first get back to doing things that mattered. One of the things he did that's fascinating to me organizationally is he reorganised Apple in a way like a startup. Apple was then divisionalised, like most large corporations are, and in order to pull everyone together, he got rid of that division structure. And no one ever imagined Apple could grow to become a large company maintaining that functional structure like a startup. What's the next big thing for Apple? We are really excited about the work we are doing with Homekit and IoT (internet of things). Our homes are going to get smarter and smarter. There are so many everyday things we can do at home with technology and what's critical is making it secure for customers. We are working with content creators so that Apple TV not only provides a great experience, but apps on the phone work together with Apple TV so that it knows what you really like to watch.

Here’s why. By Emily Bary March 31, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large After covering Apple for more than a decade, Gene Munster left his job to start a firm that invests in virtual reality. Photo: Brian Ach/Getty Images for LocationWorld 2016 Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst, made a few ripples on Wall Street last year when he decided to leave his job to start a venture capital firm called Loup Ventures focused on virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Depending on your view of the future, it was either a stroke of genius or a big mistake. VR, after all, has largely been a failure, despite years of hype. Munster concedes the technology is struggling for mass acceptance. But the analyst sees a bright future for his new slice of the tech world. “The reason I left my job is I feel like the combination of these four themes are going to have a more radical change on our lives in the next 10 years than even mobile did,” he told Barron’s Next earlier this month. They could eliminate 70% of current jobs within the next 30 years, Munster says, with artificial intelligence handling the sort of work that accountants and lawyers now do. VR and AR, meanwhile, could change communication, entertainment, and more. (AR, unlike VR, allows you to see your real surroundings behind virtual overlays.) The underlying tech may be powerful but the current applications are clunky. We asked Munster why he believes in VR and how players like Apple and Facebook might fare in a changing world. Excerpts of the conversation follow. In the past you said you thought AR might be the selling point of the next iPhone. Do you still think that? Initially it’s an add-on. The new screen is going to be one of the bigger features, and maybe the wireless charging. And then they’ll talk about the 3D camera and bring a couple developers up who will kind of show some non-Pokemon, non- Snapchat AR. We just did a survey of 500 people in the US, and 16% of them had an interest in AR. It’s just hard for people to even conceptualize what it is. It’s too strong to say that it’s a selling point initially. It’s a feature that will evolve to be a selling point. More from Barron’s Next Never Mind the Apple Watch, AirPods Are the Future Facebook CEO on VR: ‘It’s Going to Take 5 or 10 More Years’ Apple: Maybe It’s Time to Focus Less on the iPhone What do you think of Snap as an AR company? Snap is an AR company around communications. That means there’s a new way that people communicate, by using filters and geotags. When you think about how AR evolves and how people communicate in that new paradigm, Snap understands that you have to figure out the camera in order to be successful there. The story for them in the next year is probably going to be from a stock perspective and it will probably be more disappointing…[But,] we’re optimistic about Snapchat over the next five years, that they’re going to own the communication layer in AR. What about VR? I imagine skeptics ask you why you believe in this when the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be. If you look at our four themes -- VR, AR, AI, and robotics -- VR is the one that’s the most controversial. I can’t remember someone outside the VR world who believes it’s going to be game changing longer term. We think that once it’s indistinguishable from the real world, that’s when you can teleport yourself for education and entertainment. It becomes exponentially more appealing once you reach that, and we’re about five years away. Indistinguishable from the real world -- what does that mean? If you watch [sports on] high-definition TV, it’s like actually going to a game. It’s indistinguishable. Imagine putting on a headset and actually feeling like the quality of it is as good as high definition television in 4K. Headset-wise, are we talking cheaper phone-powered devices like Samsung’s Gear VR, or more sophisticated ones like Facebook’s Oculus Rift? The mainstream ones are going to be something that’s not even out right now. It’s going to have to be the quality of Rift but be wireless. There’s just too much involved with Rift right now for it to be mainstream. If you look at the spectrum, there’s Rift and the HTC Vive on the high quality side, which are really cumbersome in terms of setup. The easy to use stuff would be Gear VR, but the quality is not good. Google Daydream is probably going to be a step in the direction of higher quality. We’re still a few years away [from the ultimate winner] but it’s probably going to be something that is a dedicated VR experience -- it won’t be your phone.

If you decide to give the beta a try, this guide will help you prepare your iPhone or iPad for the early version of the iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3 update’s only been out for a few days but Apple’s already working on another version of iOS 10. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it will be coming to several devices down the road. An iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn’t been confirmed though we, and others, expect it to roll out in the near future, probably a few short weeks from now. While most of you will want to wait for the official version of iOS 10.3.2 to roll out, others might want to give the iOS 10.3.2 update a try right now.   An iOS 10.3.2 beta is available for most devices capable of running iOS 10. The list includes the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, and many others. For whatever reason, iTunes Restore images currently aren’t available for 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 and iPad 4. It’s unclear if they will receive iOS 10.3.2 or if they will remain on iOS 10.3. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance upgrade which means it will appeal to a select groups of users: Developers, those who want to gauge performance ahead of the official release, and those who want to help Apple weed out bugs. If you decide to give the iOS 10.3.2 beta a try before the official release, you need to be careful. Early software is extremely unpredictable and it can (and probably will) cause problems on your device. This is why you’ll want to prepare yourself, and your device, before you update. Our iOS 10.3.2 beta installation guide outlines some of the things we think you should do before you install the iOS 10.3.2 beta on your iPhone or iPad. It’s aimed at new iOS beta users but some of these tips might come in handy for veteran beta users as well. Read Apple's Beta Rules & Conditions   1 / 9 These are the steps that we usually take before we install iOS beta software but know that you do not need to follow every single one of these before you download and install iOS 10.3.2 beta on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you decide you want to download the iOS 10.3.2 beta for your device, you'll want to first go over the rules and regulations for Apple's iOS beta software process. Getting the iOS 10.3.2 beta on board your iPhone or iPad is actually very easy but there are some guidelines that you'll need to follow once you commit to doing so.  If you're thinking about downloading and installing the paid iOS 10.3.2 developer beta you'll want to take a look at Apple's beta website for developers.  If you want to download the iOS 10.3.2 beta for free, you'll need to join the Beta Software Program. Like the developer beta, Apple's Beta Software Program has some rules that you'll want to follow.  Before you download and install iOS 10.3.2 beta, read Apple's FAQ on the Beta Software Program because it will answer many of your burning questions and help you understand some of the important do's and don'ts.    1 / 9 10 Responses 08/04/2016 Chris Reply You should note that doing a backup through the cloud will not be of any use. If you encounter some major hiccups and/or can’t use iOS 10, you will need to roll back your operating system to the latest public iOS from Apple (iOS 9.3.4). You CANNOT role back from iOS 10 to iOS 9 using your backups stored in the cloud. You need to make an “archived backup” before proceeding to upgrade to the iOS 10 Beta. This is really easy and I will name the steps here: How to make an Archived Backup on iTunes: 1. Connect your phone to whichever computer is running your iTunes. 2. Under “Backups” choose “This Computer” 3. Underneath that, click “Encrypted” (Note: this is essential if you want to save all your passwords, HomeKit and Health info. Not selecting this will wipe all of this data) 4. Click “Backup Now” and wait for it to finish 5. Once finished, click on iTunes menu and then “Preferences” 6. Go to the “Devices” tab and highlight the backup you just completed 7. Right click that backup and choose “Archive” and you are all done! Note: To know whether you have successfully archived a backup, it will have the date and time next to it of when this archive took place. And remember, you cannot simply archive a backup through an “iCloud Backup.” Hopefully not, but if for some reason you need to restore to previous version, simply google how to downgrade and restore iOS on whichever device you are using. You will have to do this is “recovery” mode and is fairly simple if you follow those instructions correctly. Hope this helps! :) 08/10/2016 Aditya Reply My iphone is in warranty if i will download beta software and updated in ios 10 warranty is left or there is issue in warranty 08/26/2016 Yusva Reply Your warranty will not be void! it says it on the website of http://www.apple.com 08/14/2016 Von Don Reply “Early software is extremely unpredictable and it can (and probably will) cause problems on your device.” I’ve already transfer my photos, podcast, music, video to my PC in case I lost them when updating with WinX MediaTrans (https://www.winxdvd.com/mediatrans/). Thank you, Adam, very useful. But I need to know what other problems it is likely to cause on my iPhone… 08/15/2016 Chris Reply I have had iOS 10 Beta for two weeks and it is VERY stable. I’m actually really impressed by how stable and compatible with my apps it’s being. ADITYA: Downloading any Apple beta software from Apple does NOT void your warranty. It says it right on their website. 09/01/2016 baljeet Reply Wow! I simply want to give a huge thumbs up for the good data you may have right here on this post. 09/07/2016 gabriel Reply Will downloading the beta allow to upgrade when the actual update comes out? or will I have to restore my device 09/07/2016 Chris Reply Why would you need to download what you already have? When IOS 10 comes out for everyone you will not even notice. You will already have iOS 10 and won’t have to do anything. 10/13/2016 Tom Reply Most worthless post from the most worthless website on the entire internet. This entire site is one giant native ad. 10/13/2016 Chris Reply Haha so true, yet we find ourselves here for some reason?

The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none," Schiller said. Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 BENGALURU: Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller was one of Steve Jobs's closest friends, and a product keynoter. He came up with the spinwheel interface for iPods, led the digital music revolution with iPod and iTunes, and helped reinvent mobile phones with the iPhone and the App Store. Schiller, who reports now to CEO Tim Cook, was in Bengaluru on Friday--his first trip to India--for the launch of the company's App Accelerator, a platform that will support iOS developers on design, quality and performance of their apps. In an interview with TOI, Schiller talks about how they want to offer the best for Indian customers and developers. When did India show up on Apple's radar? Philip Schiller: Hard to say to a day. Over the last few years, it's grown dramatically in importance to us.This is a very exciting change, we see the opportunity for a huge market and a very young population and we want to be important here. We want to make products that this market loves. Our driving ambition in every market is to be the best, and not the cheapest, with whatever that means to customers. In India, we want to be the best provider of the things we do. We have started asking ourselves what it means to be the best in India--how is it like other markets and how is it different. Distribution can be different, network infrastructure is different. How are you tapping into India's vibrant developer base? Philip Schiller: We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none. Our rough estimate is just under half a million registered developers and if you include the extended number of people that are working with them on their apps, that should be some where around three quarters of a million people in the iOS app economy . We want to help them be more successful in the local market and there is a great opportunity for developers in India through our App Store to reach to the world.We want to use things that Apple is good at to assist these developers, like user interface design, we also want to give them our knowledge of the latest tech, the new frameworks and the new APIs. Also Read: Apple opens its Accelerator program in Bengaluru You were one of Steve Jobs's closest colleagues. How did you deal with the pressure? Philip Schiller: Steve was a truly remarkable person and a great mentor for all of us at Apple. Over the years, he worked hard to put in place people and a system to try to keep alive the spirit of the company he founded. And I would like to think that still matters to all of us who work at Apple. What's the next big thing for Apple? Philip Schiller: We are really excited about the work we are doing with Homekit and IoT (internet of things). Our homes are going to get smarter and smarter.We are working with content creators so that Apple TV not only provides a great experience, but apps on the phone work together with Apple TV so that it knows what you really like to watch.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday April 1, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Apple agrees to repair iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease' malfunction ... for a price Stephen Hutcheon 20 Nov 2016, 2:27 p.m. Apple acknowledges that there is a structural problem with its iPhone 6 Plus which causes the device's screen to freeze and become unresponsive. Apple agrees to repair iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease' malfunction ... for a price A grey flickering bar across the top of the iPhone screen is a symptom of the so-called "touch disease". Photo: iFixit Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Apple has finally acknowledged that there is a structural problem with its iPhone 6 Plus which causes the device's screen to freeze and become unresponsive. The condition, which is accompanied by grey flickering bars at the top of the screen, was christened "touch disease" by the US-based iFixit repair advocacy group in August. Although the existence of the issue had been known for months, Apple had refused to acknowledge that it was widespread or offer any solution beyond its standard out-of-warranty replacement service. The service involves swapping a damaged iPhone 6 Plus for a refurbished one at the cost $519. Under a new policy announced on Friday, Apple will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices affected affected with the touch screen problems for a service fee of $228.95. To qualify, however, the device needs to be in "working order" with a screen that is "not cracked or broken". "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device," the company said. The company has also agreed to reimburse iPhone 6 Plus owners who paid for repairs related to the issue using Apple or Apple Authorised Service Providers. iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens​ previously told Fairfax Media that because of a design flaw in the iPhone 6 Plus, it was likely that many of the popular devices would eventually succumb to the condition. The issue was caused by what Mr Wiens called "design anorexia" - the imperative to make smartphones ever thinner and lighter. It relates to the 2014 "bend-gate" incident, when some iPhone 6 Plus owners found that their devices had been bent out of shape after carrying them in their back pockets. Bending or frequent dropping of the phone can cause the touch-screen controller chips to be dislodged from their mounts on the phone's logic board. Apple subsequently upgraded the quality of the aluminium used for the casing on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in what was seen as a tacit admission that the material used in the earlier model was too flimsy. ​Earlier this year, a number of aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners in the US filed a class action suit, accusing Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws and seeking unspecified damages. The story Apple agrees to repair iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease' malfunction ... for a price first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

 How one analyst thinks Apple could hit $200 Kif Leswing Mar. 28, 2017, 11:38 AM 2,455 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Andrew Burton UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple might be able to hit a $200 stock price if everything goes right for the company over the next few years.  "For Apple to hit $200, iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond F18, new product categories must be established, and buybacks should exceed $50bn per year, boosting the P/E to 17x," Milunovich wrote in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday.  Basically, Apple still has lots of upside left, even at its price of $141 at publication, especially if CEO Tim Cook decides to pursue more aggressive buybacks. However, Milunovich does see some downside risk too, especially if the iPhone underperforms and whatever next big product Apple is working on — the car, or augmented reality — gets delayed or underwhelms.  In the near term, UBS sees "double-digit" iPhone growth next year and high single-digit iPhone growth in fiscal 2019. Apple's iPhone performance will affect "Apple's narrative" as it goes through three phases, according to the note. First comes the "super cycle" later this year, as a redesigned iPhone spurs a bunch of user upgrades, then it shifts to an "sustainable growth phase," as Apple's services business throws off reliable annual revenue, and finally, in 2019 and beyond, Apple will move into an "innovation phase" as it chases the next big thing.  "As investors adjust to a post-super cycle reality and become comfortable with new growth expectations, we expect focus to shift to 'the next big thing,'" Milunovich wrote.  Here's the most likely scenario, according to Milunovich, which sees Apple stock hitting about $175 in two to three years:  UBS Here's the scenario which could take Apple to $200 by 2019: UBS UBS rates Apple a "buy" and raised its 12-month price target to $151.  Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple’s MacBook Pro Dongle Sale Ends Today By Tyler Lee on 03/31/2017 18:16 PDT It is no secret that USB-C will eventually become the standard and will ultimately replace the current USB ports, and we’ve already seen companies start to make that change, namely Apple who decided to equip its more recent laptops with only USB-C ports. What this means is that for now, consumers will have to rely on dongles to get the job done. As if the MacBook Pros weren’t expensive enough, the fact that you’d have to buy dongles to use legacy accessories means more money spent, which is why last year Apple decided to hold a promotion where they would discount dongles and accessories to make the transition to USB-C easier (and cheaper), and that sale ends today. The sale was originally meant to conclude at the end of 2016, but Apple extended it to the 31st of March, 2017 which is today, so today is basically your last chance to get in on this deal before the prices go back to their normal levels. While the discounts on the cables and adapters aren’t much, the real “winners” are on the LG UltraFine displays where you would actually end up saving hundreds of dollars. For example the LG UltraFine 4K is currently available for $524 where it would normally be $700, while the LG UltraFine 5K is priced at $974, which is a pretty steep discount from its original price of $1,300.

By: Nandagopal Rajan | Published: April 1, 2017 6:48 AM Just under a year after CEO Tim Cook announced it, Apple on Friday launched its App Accelerator at Yelahanka in Bengaluru. (Source: Reuters) Just under a year after CEO Tim Cook announced it, Apple on Friday launched its App Accelerator at Yelahanka in Bengaluru. The accelerator, the first from Apple anywhere in the world, will handhold Indian developers when it comes to skills and tools and onboard them on best practices. India is already an important developer location for the company with tens of thousands of developers coding for iOS. Here to launch App Accelerator Bengaluru and also meet top Indian developers, Philip Schiller, senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, told indianexpress.com there are lots of reasons for doing something like this in India. “One, there is an incredible developer base here with incredible software talent and it is growing stronger and stronger for iOS development. We have around half a million registered developers here and growing dramatically and there is probably about three-quarters of a million involved in the app economy with other related jobs. It is a large base, but out of an even larger software community, so it can grow larger still. Then, India is an exciting global market for Apple with incredible growth potential.” The impact of developers, he said, will help with the impact of Apple products in India and the rest of the world. “Developers here can make software that everyone around the world is interested in.” Visibly impressed by the “great entrepreneurial spirit” he has seen here along with the innovation and creativity, he said Apple will be able to bring its expertise in under interface design and ease of use to this community. At the accelerator, Apple experts will lead weekly briefings and offer one-on-one app reviews. Also on offer will be guidance on Swift, Apple’s programming language created to build apps for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. Schiller, who is on his first visit to India, said they have already seen some incredible developers at the App Accelerator Bengaluru like Practo and Reliance Games create innovative apps to meet customers’ needs in India and around the world. He said Apple will continue to encourage developers create apps for India as well as help them reach a larger market around the world, “and that is the benefit of our app store model”. “I don’t think one has to happen without the other,” he said. Open to iOS developers in India through a sign-up process, the facility will help the community refine skills for developing iOS apps and transform their quality and performance. It will feature Apple Technology Evangelists who will provide specialised briefings for over 500 developers every week with detailed app analysis feedback. Apple is expected to start local assembly of devices in India soon, but Schiller, who said he is not involved with the manufacturing plans for India, said there was a very competent team working with the government to get the best product to users in India. “The team we are building in India is extremely talented and we are excited to grow it. I think this is an amazing marketplace and we have a lot to learn from it and our decision to increase invest in this market is a great thing to be doing.” You might also want to see this: Schiller suggested that a different pricing strategy for India was unlikely as “we don’t say let’s try and make it more affordable in this market in comparison to another”. Apple, he said, has a strategy of pricing the products globally in a fair price around the world. Schiller said that like their products, Apple’s marketing strategy also tries to be as consistent as possible worldwide. “But there will also be things we will do that are unique to this market as we learn from customers and developers that there is an opportunity to do something special here. The app accelerator is exactly that.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Streaming TV, a smarthome hub, new freaking Macs, the list goes on. But something new on my mind I wish Apple would do, an Apple owned and operated virtual private network (VPN). With the current government in the U.S. selling us out to broadband providers and surveillance capitalism on the rise, an Apple VPN would be a welcome port in the storm. Apple VPN The idea occurred to me during Wednesday’s Apple Context Machine. The original idea was for me and Jeff to revisit old rumors about Apple launching an NVNO or even a high-speed broadband service like Google Fiber. It would be great to get our Internet access from a company not predicated on surveillance capitalism. In the middle of that conversation, though, I had a better idea. What I really want is an Apple VPN. I want an Apple VPN owned and operated by Apple, with built-in support in iOS, macOS, and tvOS. I want to be able to turn it on with a switch, and I’m willing to pay extra for it. Building a VPN would be easier than any physical network and could be rolled out to Apple customers through software. More importantly to me, I would trust Apple to clearly and concisely layout its privacy and security policies for such a service, and to then stick by those policies. Apple’s track record in this area is excellent. Surveillance Capitalism I’m sick to death of surveillance capitalism. This is the practice of offering services, and even physical products, for free or a nominal fee, in order to amass a sellable profile. Surveillance capitalists spy on your life, your data, the people you know, the things you do, and everything else about you so that you can then be sold to advertisers. Worse than advertisers using our data to peddle targeted products—which in and of itself isn’t bad—is that those companies will inevitably be hacked. Hacked companies have a track record of not telling us our information is resting comfortably with Chinese/Russian/criminal hackers who will use to steal from us or even steal our identities. The Republican party voting to let ISPs sell our data—and making it harder for any future government to reverse that decision—is merely the latest insult heaped upon one surveillance capitalism example after another. Google’s entire business model, and Facebook’s, too. Home wiretap devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. TVs that spy on us. Every single product or service where we, the consumer, are the product being bought and sold on the open market. It’s funny because it’s true I’m sick of it. Apple’s Track Record on Privacy Apple is all but alone among platform providers selling us products at a profit rather than engaging in surveillance capitalism. There are very interesting companies like Purism built on evading surveillance capitalism, but I like Apple products. Plus, Apple says privacy is important and works hard to preserve it. Here are six examples of Apple CEO Tim Cook on the importance of privacy: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I found those examples with three seconds of searching. My point is Apple is the one tech giant talking about this stuff and doing something about it. There are many great VPNs, but there’s a level of trust we must convey on the VPN provider when it comes to privacy. In addition, VPNs require some level of technology savvy. Apple is ideally situated to make a real difference in minimizing our exposure to surveillance capitalism with a VPN that’s broadly accessible. I’ve not heard that Apple is working on a VPN. Being software-based, though, it is the kind of technology Apple could develop in secret. But an Apple VPN sure would be a welcome addition to the Apple family.

Pun intended. I like the idea however in Andrew Orr’s article today about VPNs he said don’t use providers in a Five Eyes country. The Five Eyes are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States. This refers to the level of cooperation surrounding their spy agencies like the NSA and GCHQ. So while I like the idea I would want the option of not routing through Cupertino or Prineville or Reno or South Carolina, or anywhere in Canada or the other Five Eyes countries. The VPN I’m experimenting with lets me route through any of their servers. Currently some of my traffic goes through Germany and some through The Netherlands. One thing I am running into though is Siri. Neither Siri nor Dictation will work when the VPN is on. Siri comes back with a message saying “could not connect”, and dictation just won’t start. Turning the VPN off solves the issue, but this is a pain. What I’d like is the ability to tell my Mac or device to use the VPN for these apps and not for those others. That would be very useful. March 31, 2017 at 8:43 EDT PM xmattingly April 1, 2017 This is a brilliant idea, Bryan. Obviously our government places no value nor has any incentive to mind its own damn business (as well as leaving our tracks bare to anyone who wants to buy and sell it). Since so many Apple customers have multiple devices connected to cloud services, this to me seems like a great feature that they could provide like no other tech company.

From complaints about a 16GB ceiling on RAM to concerns about the utility of the Touch Bar, many developers and creative professionals were quick to categorize Apple’s new notebook lineup as overpriced and under-powered. Many Apple enthusiasts also took umbrage with the design of the MacBook Pro itself, specifically lambasting Apple for removing a number of beloved and useful ports, including the MagSafe 2 charging port, the HDMI port, and the standard USB port. Instead, Apple’s new MacBook Pro design featured four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, effectively forcing many users intent on maintaining their workflow to invest in any number of dongles. Don't Miss: Using my iPhone for the next six months is really, really going to suck Acquiescing to customer complaints about Apple’s port revamp, Apple last November began offering users significant discounts on various dongles to help ease the pain. Conceding that the new MacBook Pro might require a period of transition, an Apple spokesperson at the time said: “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem.” Apple’s dongle sale was only supposed to last until 2016, but Apple, showing its users some mercy, decided to extend its adapter and dongle sale until March 31. Translation? If you have a MacBook Pro and are keen on picking up one of Apple’s many dongles at a nice discount, you’ll want to act today. Now if you’re not ready to make a purchase today or are perhaps looking for even better savings on various MacBook Pro dongles, there are a number of affordable alternatives available on Amazon that you might want to check out as well. Listed below are a few of the better deals we’ve seen in recent weeks. Priced reasonably at $26, you can pick up the AUKEY USB C Hub 3 which features 3 USB 3.0 Ports, 1 Ethernet port, and 1 Type-C input charging port. The AUKEY USB C Hub 4, meanwhile, offers up 4 USB 3.0 ports, 1 HDMI port and 1 Type C input charging port for just $43. For an even more affordable option, HooToo’s USB C Hub retails for just $12 and features 3 USB 3.0 ports and an SD Card reader.

Huawei, founded by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei three decades ago, has emerged as one of China’s most recognisable consumer brands. A relatively new entrant in mobile devices, it has rapidly grabbed market share from Apple and Samsung with premium phones and is now ranked third globally. However, that expansion comes at a cost, as the company boosts spending to keep up. Its main business of networking equipment is also slowing as phone carriers rein in network rollouts and prepare for the advent of faster 5G standards. And smartphone competition at home from the likes of Oppo is intensifying. Net income inched 0.4% higher to 37.1bn yuan (€5bn) in 2016, the company which is based in Shenzhen said yesterday. That was its slowest pace of growth since a profit decline in 2011. Its net margin dipped to 7.1% from about 9.3% the previous year. That level of profitability is “appropriate,” said Eric Xu, the current rotating chief executive. Huawei said it spent 14.6% of its 2016 revenue on research and development and will set aside $10bn (€9.3bn) to $20bn annually for that purpose as it ramps up research into everything from artificial intelligence and wireless technology to cloud computing. It has also begun keeping a closer eye on the bottom line. Xu pledged in December to cut extravagant marketing events and warned against “blind optimism and rhetoric.” Mounting expenses would damage efficiency and profitability, he said in a memo to staff. “We’re paying more attention to efficiency and scaling back on investments that cannot bring value,”said Xu. Under the current rotation he will cede the helm this week. The company blamed a rapidly expanding consumer business for weighing on margins. Revenue grew 32% to 521.6bn yuan, said Huawei, a closely held company that discloses only basic finances. That was a tad ahead of its own expectations. However, the consumer division outstripped that pace, increasing revenue 44% to 179.8bn yuan by shipping 139m smartphones in 2016. Huawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones. About 56% of its sales came from the telecoms-carrier business last year, down from about 60% in 2015 and about two-thirds in 2014, according to previous reports. It has declared its intention of becoming the world’s largest smartphone player within half a decade and Huawei is said to be aiming for $33bn in 2017 revenue for its consumer electronics business, which include smartphones, tablets and wearables. However, that business is under assault at home. It lost its top position in China’s smartphone market last year to Oppo Electronics, which attacked rural areas and lower-tier cities. And Vivo ranked just behind Huawei domestically in the December quarter, according to research firm IDC. While Huawei has voiced ambitions to expand abroad, it remains heavily reliant on its home market. China contributed 45% or 236.5bn yuan of revenue last year compared with 42% in 2015. A little over half of its smartphones were shipped within the domestic market in the quarter ended December, according to IDC. Deputy chairman Guo Ping will now become CEO. Guo started as a project manager at Huawei nearly 30 years ago and once headed the smartphone business. Huawei employs a unique rotating-CEO mechanism after Ren excused himself from daily operations more than five years ago. Ken Hu, who used to lead information security and US businesses, is the other executive in the rotation.

Elegant all-in-one digital creation solution. Fast performance. Super-thin display with fantastic image quality. Responsive, accurate touch screen for art and design work. Cons Doesn't use the latest components. Lacks expandability options. Bottom Line The Microsoft Surface Studio is a gorgeous desktop PC and a capable digital creation tool in a single package. It brings innovation to a relatively stagnant space and provides an elegant solution to multi-product work for artists and designers. By Matthew Buzzi Digital art creation, engineering, architecture, and graphic design are complicated, and often require multiple computers and peripherals. Microsoft sets out to change that—and to bring more creatives to the Windows platform—with the Surface Studio (starting at $2,999; $4,199 as tested), a touch-screen all-in-one (AIO) PC that can stand upright like a traditional desktop display or recline to serve as a digital canvas, letting designers draw, sketch, and edit as they would on a dedicated drawing tablet or physical medium. It's all wrapped up in a thin, thoughtfully designed package, making it equal parts attractive, innovative, and useful. It's expensive and lacks cutting-edge components, but the Surface Studio still manages to easily earn our Editors' Choice endorsement for high-end AIO PCs. //Compare Similar Products Compare HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 27-Inch With Retina 5K Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Aura   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS 27 (7760)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell OptiPlex 24 7000 Series All-In-One (7440)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Veriton Z4820G-I5650TZ   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Envy All-in-One (27-b010)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkCentre X1   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 21.5-Inch With 4K Retina Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corsair One Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Drafting Board First, a quick rundown for the uninitiated: The Surface Studio is an all-in-one PC, the first desktop in Microsoft's hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops. In keeping with that spirit, but tying it squarely to your desk, the Studio's super-thin 28-inch touch screen can tilt from an upright setup (what Microsoft calls Desktop Mode) to a reclined, canvas-like state (Studio Mode). The screen is just 0.44-inch thick, while the components and ports are all housed in a base that measures 1.26 by 8.66 by 9.84 inches (HWD). Our other top pick AIO, the 2017 HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One, takes up even more desk space with its incredible ultra-wide screen, but there's no touch functionality. The Studio's design and build are gorgeous. The look is undeniably iMac inspired, but the convertibility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio its own distinctive look. The "gravity hinge" can stop at any point between fully upright and reclined. It slides effortlessly between modes, and it's satisfying to push the screen down or up with a single finger. View All 11 Photos in Gallery As for the display itself, it bears a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television (192ppi). The Apple iMac With 5K Retina Display, by comparison, has a 27-inch screen with 5,210-by-2,880 resolution, though it's tough to compare directly because the Studio's aspect ratio is also different than standard wide-screen. Its 3:2 ratio was chosen with designers in mind, as one inch on the screen represents one inch in reality, better mirroring physical work in a digital space. The screen shines, with an incredibly crisp and vibrant picture that suits the work many creative types will use it for. The colors are bold and bright, as the display uses 10-bit color depth and supports the P3 and SRGB color gamuts, which you can swap between on the fly. It's brilliantly bright on the default Vivid color profile (so much so that the maximum setting hurt my eyes up close at times, driving me to lower it down a notch). You won't have to worry about images appearing too dim. Fingerprints do smudge up the screen, but you can really only see them when it's powered off. Of course, exceptional screen quality alone is not what will have designers flocking to the Surace Studio en masse. Its convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a real artist's workstation. With the display folded down, it becomes infinitely easier to draw directly on it compared with a traditional upright monitor, and that's what gives the Surface Studio its unique value. Microsoft is aggressively targeting the creative demographic, which has been Apple's bread and butter with the iMac and MacBooks for years. This vibe was unmistakable in its debut presentation of the Studio, and is doubly obvious with additions in the Windows 10 Creators Update like Paint 3D and upgrades to Windows Ink. By embracing touch capability on the hardware and software fronts (while Apple continues to relegate touch to iOS only), the Surface Studio could feasibly become the go-to one-stop-shop for designers and artists. More importantly, it continues the transformation of Windows and PCs as stodgy and business-centric to stylish, versatile platforms for a new generation of professionals, creatives, and students. That brings us to the topic of price, which will likely have many potential buyers balking. The Surface Studio is clearly an expensive product—even the starting configuration costs $2,999—but it's priced relatively competitively when you look at what you're getting. Comparably sized drawing displays don't double as powerful computers, or feature the Studio's engineering, but still cost upward of $2,000 or more. For example, Wacom's 27-inch QHD Cintiq is $2,799, and while you can hook it up to a PC or Mac for digital creation, you'll still need to buy that computer. When accounting for graphics, processing, storage, and a super-high-resolution display, the Studio's price actually starts to look reasonable. Ports and Peripherals All ports are located on the back of the base. They're a bit difficult to access, particularly when the screen is reclined, since you have to reach around it or turn the whole machine around. But it's not terribly frustrating, and keeps the flush, sleek look intact. There are four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack. USB-C connectivity is notably absent here. The Studio comes with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, both of which connect via Bluetooth 4.0. These are also very iMac-like in look and feel, and they get the job done. I don't find the low-profile mouse particularly comfortable, but Apple faithfuls likely won't mind it. The keyboard is satisfying to type on. The Surface Pen stylus is also included. It works well with the Studio, and there's little to no latency between strokes and response on the screen. The "eraser" is a customizable button, as is a skinny strip along the side you can set as right click, paste, or something else depending on your workflow. By default it brings up the Windows Ink Workspace software for quickly launching into note-taking and drawing. There are magnetic strips on either side of the display, like the Surface Pro, to attach the Pen when not in use. We also tested the Surface Dial ($99), though it isn't included. The Dial is not an instrument for drawing or editing in and of itself, but an aid for tool and menu selection. You can press and spin the Dial to scroll through various on-screen options, which feels very satisfying. (Stay tuned for a full review of the Dial.) Placing it directly on the display and pressing down brings up a digital radial menu around the physical Dial with options like Volume, Brightness, and Undo, which looks and feels very futuristic. It doesn't take long to learn, and I was flipping between settings and changing tools with ease within a few minutes. Whether or not this will speed up your process depends on your workflow, but it definitely helped me save time shooting up to the toolbar and back to my canvas. Future software will better integrate with the Dial, giving you more options like a radial digital color wheel, and we'll test those features when they are available. The bottom of the Dial is rubber to help grip the screen, but I found that it slowly slides down when the Studio is at any angle other than fully reclined. This shouldn't be a problem most of the time—the Dial will most likely be used alongside the Pen in Studio Mode. Keeping the bottom clean helps grip, and the Dial also works if it's simply sitting on your desk. Outside of the peripherals, the Studio integrates 802.11ac Wi-Fi and wireless support for Xbox controllers (connecting them to a PC typically requires you to purchase Microsoft's Wireless Adapter). You also get two front-facing cameras. One is a 5-megapixel cam for Windows Hello sign-in. When you set up Hello, it will scan your face once and recognize you in the future, allowing you to log in by standing in front of the screen instead of typing in a password. The other 1080p camera is for video chats. Speakers are also built in to the Studio, and have a loud maximum volume with good sound quality. They're of better quality than most built-in speakers on standalone displays, though certainly not up to par with those on the room-shaking Dell XPS 27 AIO. Under the Hood While the design and functionality are worthy of high praise, I have a few reservations about component selection. The Surface Studio a fast system by any measure (see the performance numbers below), but for the high-stress workloads of creative users, some inclusions could be cause for concern. Though generally speedy, thanks in part to 32GB of memory, the Core i7 Skylake processor and GTX 980M graphics card are a generation behind. This could be because the Studio has been in development through the launch of newer components (using a Kaby Lake CPU or Pascal graphics would have presumably delayed its release). Cost concerns or engineering obstacles could also be the culprits. Either way, the Surface Studio's internal hardware isn't quite cutting edge, which is disappointing for the price, and a (likely inevitable) refreshed version with newer components would really knock it out of the park. Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive similar to Apple's fusion format. Our test unit includes a 2TB drive, while the base and midrange models each include 1TB. Rather than provide solid-state storage (it's not an option on any of the Studio's configurations), Microsoft includes a hybrid hard drive that utilizes an SSD cache, but data is stored on the 5,400rpm hard drive. In spite of this, and a bit to my surprise, load times were still on the level of solid-state storage. The computer boots very quickly, and programs launch with little or no delay, even if it's not the ideal SSD solution you'd hope for. This leads to the issue of expandability options, which are something you'll have to live without if you buy the Studio. Like most all-in-ones, the machine is ready-to-go as ordered and will stay exactly that way, since you can't open it up to add more RAM or storage. That might be enough to ward off some potential buyers, since it's an expensive product you won't be able to upgrade down the road, but that's not anything new for the category, or for anyone who's worked on an iMac for years. External and cloud storage will be your friends (as they likely already are for artists), even with the roomy drive. Performance Just how fast is the Surface Studio? It's plenty zippy, especially since the gap between the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors is not nearly as pronounced as some generations past. The 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU and 32GB of memory powered it to a strong score on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, even at its demanding native resolution. Multimedia test scores were also solid. It completed the Handbrake test in 1 minute and 3 seconds, Photoshop in 3:03, and scored 702 points on CineBench. These results were all faster than the 2015 5K iMac (1:15, 3:19, and 510 points), but not by the margin you'd hope for a newer, pricey desktop. That extends to the last-gen graphics hardware as well, though it matters a bit less since this isn't a gaming system. A 980M was among the best graphics hardware for laptops last generation, so it's a capable 3D card and a lot better than integrated graphics. Gaming isn't the Studio's purpose, but 3D performance for model rendering and manipulation (say, for CAD, architectural, and medical use) is aided by the GPU, so high-powered discrete graphics fits the bill. See How We Test Desktops It is still a mobile card, though, so it can't go toe-to-toe with gaming desktops like the Corsair One Pro or even the Digital Storm Aura, which is also an all-in-one. That said, the Studio is a capable performer at 1080p, averaging 55 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley gaming tests on Ultra-quality settings in HD. Don't expect it to run much in native resolution, though few computers could do so smoothly, really, but you can definitely manage some high-setting HD gaming on the side. It's not VR-ready, however, since the Pascal GTX 1060 graphics card is the recommended entry point for virtual reality gaming, and the 980M does not reach that mark. Bold Concept, Excellent Execution The Surface Studio delivers on Microsoft's vision of creating a digital drafting board and an efficient desktop in a single package. On top of that unique proposition, it's a beautiful and cleverly designed piece of hardware with a stunning display. I have some misgivings about the component decisions, but it doesn't mean the system is slow or not up to the task. Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed. It's a successful proof of concept in Microsoft's bid for reinventing both the digital artist's workspace and the perception and function of Windows as a creator's platform. You might want to wait for version 2.0 with newer parts if you're concerned about performance. But I can assure you that in its current form, the Microsoft Surface Studio is a joy to use and work on. It's a beautiful, innovative marriage of form and function, and an easy Editors' Choice. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

Setting Routines could be easier. Bottom Line The third-generation Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit is costly, but remains the ultimate way to get started with smart lighting in your home. By Victoria Song Philips set the bar high for smart lighting with its original Hue Connected Bulb. Now in its third generation, the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit ($199.95) raises it even higher, thanks to Apple Homekit compatibility, enhanced brightness and color consistency, and a retooled app experience. It still costs a pretty penny, but you get better bang for your buck as Philips has improved the longevity of each bulb. With class-leading features and a robust third-party ecosystem, the White and Color Ambiance package is a great way to get started with smart lighting, and our Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Philips Hue Connected Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White Ambiance   %displayPrice%%seller% C by GE Starter Pack   %displayPrice%%seller% Cree Connected LED Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% GE Link Connected LED   %displayPrice%%seller% LIFX Color 1000   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% TikTeck Smart LED Light Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% MiPow Playbulb Rainbow   %displayPrice%%seller% Stack Downlight Starter Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% New and Improved The latest Hue bulbs aren't so much about innovation as refinement. Design-wise, there isn't anything different from the original Hue lights—they're still the same shape and size. Aside from the words "Hue White and Color" at the base of the bulb, you'd be hard pressed to tell these apart from first-gen models. So what's different? For starters, the included Hue Bridge features an upgraded processor with more than 500 times the memory and is now square. This lets it run multiple applications like the Hue system and Apple HomeKit at the same time, whereas the original (round) bridge was really only designed with the lights in mind. The bulbs themselves are also brighter. Philips has increased lumen output from 600 to 800 lumens, which is equivalent to a jump from 40W to about 60W. Each bulb is also estimated to last 25,000 hours or 22 years, up from the 15-year estimate for the original. And in terms of color, the new bulbs have a richer gamut, with special attention paid to the blues and greens. I plugged two bulbs into my living room and one in my bedside lamp for testing. At night, I was pleased that I didn't have to strain my eyes to read a book or write in a journal thanks to the adjustable brightness levels. As for colors, the range is truly impressive. You can choose anything from light pastels to intensely vivid (bordering on garish) hues. True to Philips' claims, the blues and greens are both rich and bright. I tried out the preset Artic Aurora Scene, which is full of shades like mint, teal, sea foam, and sky blue. Even with a red accent wall, my living room was thoroughly transformed into what felt like an undersea paradise. Likewise, the bulbs were able to produce a darker, murkier shade of green that mimicked deep space (or at least what I imagine deep space to look like) quite well. Cost-wise, individual bulbs are now slightly less expensive at $50 apiece, instead of $60. That's still asking a lot if you're looking to outfit your entire home, or even an apartment. Thankfully, Philips now offers a more diverse lighting portfolio so you don't have to empty your entire bank account. The Hue White Ambiance bulbs, which offer the full spectrum of white light, are $30 per bulb, or $129.99 for a starter kit. Alternatively, if you don't care about having multiple shades of white and just want the bare basics, you can get the Hue White bulbs at a relatively affordable $14.99 per bulb, or $69.99 for a starter kit. The setup process is simple. First, you screw in your bulbs into the fixtures you want and switch them on. Then you connect the bridge to your router via Ethernet, download the Philips Hue app to your Android or iOS device, and follow the on-screen instructions to identify the individual bulbs and group them into rooms. Because the Hue bulbs connect to the bridge via Wi-Fi, you can control them even when you're not at home—something you can't do with Bluetooth-only bulbs like the TikTeck Smart LED. Streamlined Experience The ability to personalize not only the color and intensity, but also to recreate lighting scenes from your photos, was a major draw for the original Hue bulbs. The only caveat was that the original Philips Hue app wasn't the most intuitive to use. So it's a good thing Philips has created a new Hue app that addresses many of the problems we had with the original. First off is a more streamlined design. You no longer have to rotate your smartphone to access the full color gradient for individual bulbs. The layout has also been tweaked so there's a bit less sifting through menus to access the features you want. For instance, you can now find the gradient for colors, whites (cool or warm), and preset lighting recipes all on the same page. Grouping lights by room is also more intuitive. Previously, you had to drag individual bulbs together to create a room. But they'd still be listed individually under the Lights tab, which is confusing when you have a lot of bulbs. The new app does away with that approach. Instead of focusing on bulbs, it centers on rooms. Once you've created groups, you can easily adjust brightness and color for an entire room from the main menu. You can still customize each bulb individually—you just have to tap on the room name. The Scenes feature is easier to use as well. You can find the Scenes tab once you tap on the name of an individual room. There are a number of presets and lighting recipes, including the aforementioned Arctic Aurora, Energize, Read, Relax, and Spring Blossom, among others. Scenes like Spring Blossom are based on actual pictures, while Energize and Read are optimized white lighting for specific moods or tasks. Energize is a cooler, blue-tone white light, while Relax utilizes a warmer, yellow tone. To select a Scene, tap on the bubble with the Scene photo and your lights will automatically match that color scheme. If you want to edit it, hit the pencil icon. That will take you to a larger version of the same image, where you can select a specific area you want to recreate. The app will then assign the colors to each bulb, and you can adjust brightness using the slider at the bottom of the screen. You can easily upload your own photos as well. For example, I uploaded a photo of my vacation to Cozumel, Mexico, and the app automatically adjusted my living room lights to soft shades of teal and sand to recreate the lighting on the beach. Even with these improvements, the Hue app isn't perfect. Setting Routines is a little more roundabout than it needs to be. There are presets for waking up, going to bed, and you can enable location services so that lights turn on and off based on where you are. These are simple enough, but it's less intuitive to create a custom schedule. Setting a start time, brightness, color, and days of the week is straightforward, but it's frustrating that you can only program an on or off time in a single routine, so you essentially need to create the same Routine twice (once to turn lights on, and once to turn them off). Lastly, the Settings menu is where you can add extra lights, accessories, and even widgets for the Apple Watch. The latter are basically shortcuts on the watch to your favorite settings, so you don't have to pull out your phone. I was surprised by how much fun I had with these—especially since I could quickly change the living room lights to my favorite color whenever I won a dispute with my roommate. (Immature, yes, but an entertaining use of technology.) Throw a Party With Third-Party Apps Philips also has a big leg up on the competition with 400 unique third-party apps in its Hue ecosystem. Some are fairly practical, but most center around syncing your lights to music, movies, or television shows. Others, like Lightbow, offer you more options for presets and color palettes. None of these are necessary, but they enable you to do more than the official app alone. Keep in mind that many of these third-party apps cost a few extra dollars. I tried the free SyFy Sync app, which uses your phone's microphone while you're watching certain SyFy shows to match your lights to what's happening on screen. Initially I was skeptical, but it worked pretty well for season one of The Expanse—even if I ended up focusing more on how well the lighting fit each scene than the actual plot. You can find these apps in either the Apple App Store or Google Play, but I'd recommend rifling through the Explore tab in the Hue app. There's a handy, curated list of third-party apps and all compatible platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Bosch, Google Home, IFTTT, Logitech, Nest, and SmartThings. I tested the Hue lights with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit. With Alexa, you just download the Philips Hue skill in the (Alexa) app itself. You can then create groups and control your lights through voice commands such as, "Alexa, dim living room lights to 50 percent" on your Amazon Echo. You can do the same with Siri and Apple HomeKit, right from your iPhone. There's a simple "HomeKit & Siri" menu in the Hue app, and you don't actually have to do anything extra to set things up. The only caveat is that you can't edit HomeKit settings unless you're on the same Wi-Fi network. The Best Smart Bulbs Money Can Buy Hue's only real limitation is the depth of your pockets. At $200 for the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit and $50 per additional bulb, it's still quite expensive for the average consumer. This is especially true if you want smart lighting in every room of your home. But as mentioned, you can spend far less by adding a mix of Hue White bulbs, which are less expensive and offer similar functionality, minus the color. (And let's be honest, most rooms don't need to light up like a club.) If you want to go the more economical route, the C by GE Starter Pack is about a quarter of the price, doesn't require a hub, and comes with four bulbs—one more than you get here. You can't set routines and there's no Wi-Fi support, so you can only control your bulbs when you're home, but you can't really beat the price. If price isn't an issue, however, the Hue White and Color Ambiance are the smart bulbs we recommend. They're easy to install, customize, control remotely, and they integrate with many other devices and services you probably already use. Despite the intimidating start-up cost, they are shining examples of what smart bulbs should be, and our Editors' Choice.

As car factories fell silent, as homes fell dark, as rubbish piled up in the streets, people would ask in frustration: ‘Who governs? The government? Or the unions?’ The answer was a long time coming. It was only after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, with a mandate to tame the union leaders’ power, end the culture of industrial militancy and reassert the sovereignty of the British government, that the question was finally consigned to the history books. Four decades on, I believe it has returned to the heart of British politics.  For, as in the Seventies, the Government finds itself heading for confrontation with a group of remote, unaccountable and increasingly militant opponents, who treat our nation’s elected leaders with contempt and set their own interests above those of the British people. Tech giants' defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age, writes Dominic Sandbrook (file photo) I am talking, of course, about the gigantic multinational technology companies — Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber and the like — whose defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age. Two days ago, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, summoned representatives of the major tech firms to Whitehall, to express her frustration at their failure to stop terrorists using their services to communicate among themselves and to distribute extremist material. I doubt Ms Rudd offered her guests beer and sandwiches, the symbol of successive Prime Ministers’ futile attempts to rein in the militant union leaders in the Seventies. But I suspect Thursday’s meeting will produce exactly what all those meetings with the union bosses produced 40 years ago: very little. The firms may have promised to crack down on terrorist videos online. Yet that pledge came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet. A pledge to track down on terrorist videos online came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet (file photo) Yesterday, it revealed that there has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone. What lies behind this latest confrontation between the Government and the big technology firms is the fallout from the dreadful attack in Westminster ten days ago. We now know that the killer, Khalid Masood, sent a message on WhatsApp — the online messaging system owned by Facebook — just moments before his car ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. But we don’t know what it said or to whom he sent it, because the company’s encryption software means the security services cannot access it. So when, last weekend, Ms Rudd said that the Government would like to have the powers to read encrypted messages on social media platforms like WhatsApp, I struggled to see the problem. There has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone (file photo) That doesn’t mean, by the way, that I care nothing for civil liberties. After all, we in Britain are famous for valuing our freedom and bridling at government interference. Yet, as most of us recognise, we want to enjoy that freedom without a madman blowing us up or running us down. When terrorists strike, we don’t simply shrug our shoulders and say: ‘That’s life.’ We wonder why our security services failed to stop them; we try to learn the appropriate lessons, and to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This doesn’t strike me as knee-jerk authoritarianism, just common sense. But, of course, the tech companies and their ultra-libertarian cheerleaders see things rather differently. Cue the hysterical shrieks that the East German Stasi had bugs in everybody’s bedrooms, and that this is the slippery slope to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, with its Big Brother surveillance. This is, of course, the world view promoted by the Guardian newspaper’s pin-up Edward Snowden, now a grateful guest of Vladimir Putin in Moscow, who leaked tens of thousands of British and American intelligence files to the media in an attempt to discredit the U.S. government’s electronic spying programmes. Ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda (file photo) Yet what really baffles me about Mr Snowden and his supporters is that they elevate one principle — liberty — while ignoring all others. I like liberty as much as anybody, but I like security that protects me from being killed, too. Of course, I would prefer not to have my phone and email conversations tapped — but which of us would genuinely elevate our privacy above the lives of innocent men, women and children? I can already hear the howls of protest from the libertarian fringe. But do they really think that the men and women who drive into GCHQ every morning from their suburban Cheltenham homes are itching to become a British Stasi? RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer... Tech giants bow to Amber Rudd's demands to get tough in... Male nurse, 44, who laughed as he showed colleagues a video... Share this article Share Behind all this is a deeper and more serious issue. We will be debating the tension between liberty and security for as long as we are debating anything at all. The bigger question, though, is the looming conflict between national governments and the vast technology giants that think themselves above the nation state. This is not the first time, after all, that the British government has come up against their intransigence: ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda. The technology companies, of course, claim that these are nothing to do with them. But they provide a platform for them: surely they cannot duck their responsibility for ever. Thus far, the Government’s early efforts have achieved nothing. What firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes (file photo) Two years ago, for instance, David Cameron demanded so-called ‘back doors’ to be built into message encryption software so that the security services would be able to monitor conversations between suspected terrorists. Under pressure from the American-owned technology companies, however, Mr Cameron backed down. And we now know that this was part of a pattern. Last week, the Mail revealed the extraordinary story of how Mr Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, put pressure on London’s then mayor, Boris Johnson, to halt plans to curtail the business model of the American minicab app company, Uber, which has mercilessly eaten away at the livelihoods of black cab drivers in London, and threatens the survival of taxi services in other British cities. What makes this so shocking is not just the fact that Mr Cameron appears to have been influenced by his friendship with Uber’s senior vice-president, Rachel Whetstone. It’s that like so many multinational technology firms, Uber pays tax at a rate so low — effectively just 1 per cent — that it might as well not be paying at all. It is a familiar story. Google, for example, employs almost 2,500 people in this country, but pays a tax rate of just 3 per cent. Indeed, what firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes, yet track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives. But the tech firms track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives (file photo) And yet they have the brass neck, the flagrant hypocrisy, to invoke the principles of privacy and freedom when the security services come to call! You can see why Government ministers have become convinced that these over-mighty subjects simply do not care about the wider national interest. Take WhatsApp, the secure online messaging service used by Khalid Masood before the Westminster attack. Its chief executive is a fortysomething U.S. computer programmer named Jan Koum, who is estimated to be worth $9.1 billion. In Koum’s own words: ‘We want to know as little about our users as possible. We don’t know your name, your gender . . . we have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story.’ Alas, such pious assurances proved worthless when WhatsApp started sharing more than a billion users’ phone numbers with Facebook, so the latter could target its adverts at individual consumers. Yet this is the same company that has flatly refused to help the Government look at Masood’s phone messages! Little wonder that earlier this week the Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, accused the technology barons of ‘earning huge revenues but not [being] willing to play their part defending the open society from which they make their money’. If that sounds harsh, just remember that after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in London four years ago, a Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee blasted one internet company for its failure to inform MI5 that Michael Adebowale, one of the killers, had posted messages which should have sent shivers down our spines. But because the system was automated — in other words, operated by algorithms — no human being had even bothered to find out what was going on. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities (file photo) The firm was not named by the Parliamentary Committee. But we now know that it was — surprise, surprise — Facebook, which is based in the United States. Bear in mind that these are not just companies: they are global behemoths with unparalleled reach and power. They wield immense influence over millions of ordinary Britons’ lives. Most of us use their products on a daily, even hourly basis: even Amber Rudd, ironically, uses WhatsApp. Yet you would have to go far, I suspect, to find more flagrant examples of corporate irresponsibility. Remember how Apple reacted when the FBI asked them to unlock the iPhone of an Islamist terrorist who took part in an attack that killed 14 people in California in 2015. Did they co-operate? Well, I imagine you can guess the answer. In the end, the FBI, desperate to find out whether the man had associates plotting more attacks, paid a hacker over $1 million to access his mobile phone. In the meantime, Apple smugly sat on what the technology barons and their allies laughably regard as the moral high ground. Perhaps the best example of Silicon Valley’s smug self-righteousness is Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook, who wastes no opportunity to pose as a champion of privacy against the police and intelligence services. When the FBI asked for help unlocking the terrorist’s phone in California, he noisily refused. In a blistering open letter to all Apple customers, Cook warned of the ‘chilling’ privacy breach posed by the agency’s request. If they had to comply over terrorism, he claimed, they might have to do the same for investigators in a tax or divorce case. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities — such as paying their tax dues — that apply to the rest of us. ‘We will not help any government, including our own, hack or attack any customer anywhere,’ the president of Microsoft declared this week. That, I think, says it all. Not even if there were another 9/11-style atrocity? Not if there were a war? The truth, I think, is that these companies are run by people who see themselves not as members of a national community, but as members of a secretive, super-national digital elite, floating above the common herd on clouds of their own hot air. They are, in fact, precisely the kind of people of whom Theresa May famously said last autumn: ‘If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, then you’re a citizen of nowhere.’ Her words might have been written specifically to describe the tech giants. Indeed, a moment later Mrs May said: ‘If you’re a household name that refuses to work with the authorities even to fight terrorism… I’m putting you on warning. This can’t go on any more.’ Yet the tech giants have not changed their ways. As the past few days have shown beyond doubt, they have no stake in British society and little commitment to the greater good. There is a nice irony in the fact that this issue has come to the fore in the very week that Mrs May sent her letter to Brussels triggering Britain’s exit from the European Union. After all, we have heard much in the last year about ‘taking back control’. But firms like Google and Facebook have much more influence over our daily lives, and far more power for good or ill, than entire legions of EU bureaucrats. Isn’t it time our Government took back control from them, too? Mrs May has shown herself admirably keen to stand up for national identity and the nation state, and I suspect that taking on the technology bosses would prove a very popular battle. Above all, though, it is a battle she must win. It is no exaggeration to say that our national security may well depend upon it.

A news release sent out by the Kelowna Apple Triathlon Society says the 2017 season will be taking a “sabbatical year” to fully support  the International Triathlon Union Multisport World Championship Festival in Penticton which runs August 18 to 27 and would overlap with the Apple Triathlon. M1 Sports Management Inc. has been hired to help plan the 2018 Kelowna Apple Triathlon.  The organization has many years of experience hosting big sporting events including the Suburu Vancouver Triathlon. “We will miss the Apple Triathlon in 2017, but we like the direction the organizers are taking to make this elite event even bigger and better for next season and for years to come,” Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran said. The next Kelowna Apple Triathlon will take place August 18-19, 2018.  The triathlon includes a 1.5 km swim, a 40 km bike ride and a 10 km run.             © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

It's called "Live bright", and it's all about the Apple Watch Series 2 which launched last fall. The ad emphasizes the device's display, which is two times brighter than that of the original Apple Watch. It's also showing it underwater, which is fine since it comes with water resistance up to 50m. And of course showcasing the fitness tracking features couldn't be missed. In fact, Apple says the new watch is "the perfect partner for a healthy life" in the video's description.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

You can install the 560–650 MB update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. The biggest new feature in iOS 10.3 is one you may not notice: it introduces Apple’s new Apple File System (APFS), which will eventually replace the legacy HFS+ file system currently in use on all of Apple’s platforms (see “What Apple’s Forthcoming APFS File System Means to You,” 24 June 2016). It remains to be seen what, if anything, this will mean for iOS users, but for now, the primary impact is a longer update process than usual while it converts the existing file system. At iMore, Rene Ritchie has a good rundown on APFS’s benefits. So far, I’m finding iOS 10.3 snappier than 10.2, but it’s impossible to say if that’s due to the new file system. Regardless, we always recommend backing up your devices before updating, but doing so is even more important with iOS 10.3. Owners of Apple’s new wireless AirPods will appreciate that iOS 10.3 lets you track the little earbuds with Find My iPhone. You can either track their location on a map or make them play a locator tone. The sound is played on both AirPods and can be muted on each one individually, so if you drop one AirPod, you can silence the one you have so you can better hear the one you’re looking for. Given that replacing just a single AirPod costs $69, this new feature is extremely welcome (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). However, there’s a catch: the AirPods must be connected to (and thus in range of) a paired device for this feature to work. So while you should be able to locate an AirPod that disappeared into the couch cushions, you likely won’t be able to find one that you lost during a run. iOS 10.3 brings support for cross-device iTunes movie rentals, which Apple first introduced in iTunes 12.6 (see “iTunes 12.6,” 21 March 2017). Now, finally, you can rent iTunes movies on one device and watch them on another, though you’ll need iTunes 12.6, iOS 10.3, and tvOS 10.2 to do so. Siri sees a few improvements with iOS 10.3, including support for paying bills in supported apps, scheduling in ride-booking apps like Lyft, and checking cricket scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. If you own a car that can be controlled via an automaker app, you gain some cool Siri capabilities, such as checking your car’s fuel level and lock status, turning lights on and off, and activating the horn. It’s probably still easier to slam your hand into the steering wheel than to say, “Hey Siri, BEEP!” Speaking of cars, CarPlay gets a few new additions, such as app shortcuts in the status bar, Up Next and the current song’s album in Apple Music’s Now Playing screen, and access to daily curated Apple Music content. Apple has rethought identity in the Settings app. Your identity now takes center stage above all other settings and provides a shortcut to a new, more coherent screen to handle your personal information, payment options, security settings, account information, and Family Sharing. Apple has also addressed the problem of Calendar spam, which made the news late last year (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). You can now delete unwanted invites and report them as junk. HomeKit sees some welcome improvements in iOS 10.3: you can now trigger scenes with switches and buttons, and the Home app now shows Accessory battery levels. Other improvements include being able to search for “parked car” in Maps, a new widget and 3D Touch action for the Podcasts app, the option to share podcasts with full playback support in Messages, and hourly weather forecasts in Maps if you 3D Touch the current temperature. Also, iOS 10.3 addresses a bug with Maps that could prevent it from showing your location after resetting Location & Privacy settings, as well as improving VoiceOver stability. There are a couple of additions not mentioned in the release notes. In iOS 10.3, developers can now respond to App Store reviews. I’ve also noticed one small change in Mail: a count of unread Inbox messages in the back button when viewing an email thread. Lastly, iOS 10.3 includes a total of 67 security fixes! When Should You Upgrade? -- Honestly, although Apple doesn’t even mention the move to APFS in its user-level release notes, that’s the main reason to hold off. If there’s some subtle problem that surfaces only once hundreds of thousands of devices have updated to iOS 10.3, you don’t want to be among that group. So we recommend waiting at least a week before installing iOS 10.3, and perhaps longer if you don’t use AirPods, suffer from Calendar spam, or automate your house with HomeKit. After that, though, give it a whirl and enjoy the new features!

Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-28 23:38 I think the change in the iOS file system, which is part of the APFS version of the OS, is the most significant change in iOS 10.3. Almost, I'd say, earth shaking, or, at least, groundbreaking. APFS will be coming to the Mac in the near future, which means iOS and macOS will be truly compatible for the first time. This will provide significantly improved interoperability between iOS devices and the Mac. It should be particularly important for the iPad, which people use for actual work from time to time. The lack of an accessible file system provided iOS with both security and simplicity. But those advantages have been overshadowed as iOS has gotten more capable and the iPad in particular has become more like a computer than was originally imagined. Once iDevices and the Mac have parallel and compatible operating systems, the sky's the limit. Of course, the impact of this change on developers will also be important, if not frightening. And I certainly agree with Josh that it would be wise to hold off on the upgrade until you find out what early adopters (otherwise knows as unpaid beta testers) discover about iOS 10.3. If experience is any guide, the upgrade will have plenty of problems that will need sorting out. I will do the same when the macOS receives the APSF upgrade. If we are lucky it will solve more problems than it creates. Be that as it may, right now, for me at least, macOS 12.3 Sierra is stable. I'm not in a hurry to break it. Reply barefootguru   2017-03-29 15:43 APFS does have a lot of advantages, but I'm not following what you're saying: - Until now both iOS and macOS *have* shared the same HFS+ filing system, so that's not changing. - Apple released the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9 for users to view some of the file system; and AFAIK has no plans to expose more of the underlying file system. - APFS is transparent to developers in all but a few edge cases. Reply brent  2017-03-30 04:24 since this will brick your TidBITS app, will you be upgrading it? Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-30 15:52 Probably not because very few people actually use the app. It's basically just a dedicated RSS reader, so most people are better served by an RSS app, Apple News, or just email. Reply brent  2017-03-30 16:10 understand. thanks! i look forward to your email every week. keep up the good work! Reply  Search   Cached.

Cori Fisher, who worked at a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Apple Store from 2010-2016, said he witnessed management at the Center City Apple Store asking security to remove a group of African-American teenagers from the store and then instructing employees to closely monitor other African-American guests who entered the store. "Specifically, after Plaintiff observed a store manager ask a police officer to tell African-American teenagers to leave the store," the complaint [PDF], filed to the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court, stated. "Plaintiff complained about Defendant's instructions to employees to closely monitor African-American customers and to ask African-American customers to leave the store. All of the store managers told employees to closely monitor African-American customers, which concerned Plaintiff." The complaint alleges that, after he complained about the discrimination to management in February of 2016, he was fired. Fisher says that while Apple cited an unspecified December, 2015 incident for the termination, he believes he was fired both for his complaint as well as his religious beliefs (as a Seventh Day Adventist). He also had a pair of cancer bouts that put him on disability leave previously. He is suing Apple for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Civil Rights Act, and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. Apple has yet to file a response to Fisher's complaint with the court. The company did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. While still in its very early stages, the suit could prove to be embarrassing to Apple, as a company that has fancied itself a leader in the push for better diversity and equal rights in the tech industry. ® Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register US Congress asks FCC to snuff out Google's TV landgrab It's dead already, Congresscritters argue 16 Comments Apple ordered to cough up $2m to store workers after denying rest breaks Now, each of you, take this check for $95 and get the hell out of my sight 35 Comments Microsoft slaps Apple Gatekeeper-like controls on Windows 10: Install only apps from store Configurable switch on software spotted in latest Insider build 68 Comments Fake Cisco box pushers cuffed by Intellectual Property Police That's intellectual-property police, not intellectual property-police 9 Comments Thief dresses as Apple Store drone, walks off with $16,000 in iGear 'Genius Bar' didn't quite live up to its name this time 73 Comments FCC lops off red tape around small US ISPs, y'know, things like having to own up about connection speeds And hidden fees and pricing 10 Comments Whitepapers Capacity Management in the Modern Data Center Capacity management tools were originally developed to support IBM mainframes.

That glow is caused by light pollution emanating from towns and cities. If you really want to make the most of your new hobby, you’ll need to find a place where the sky is truly dark.  Here we reveal the best spots to go star gazing in your area. Pictured: Orion over the Rollright Stones in the Cotswolds  Thankfully, there are many organisations and websites that can show you the best stargazing spots in your area. A good place to start is Dark Sky Discovery (www.darkskydis covery.org.uk), which has an easy-to-use map of over 150 excellent stargazing spots across the UK.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Revealed: Which manuka honey is really good for you?

Share this article Share These sites, which are all wheelchair-friendly, are free from most light pollution and boast great sightlines so you can enjoy the best panoramas possible. Also useful is the website NightBlight (nightblight.cpre.org.uk), which is run by the Campaign to Protect Rural England.  The site’s interactive map reveals the levels of light pollution at any given spot in the UK. Although it doesn’t recommend specific locations, it offers more flexibility if you want to know what the pollution is like at a place you might want to visit. Here then is our guide to the best stargazing spots around the UK… and don’t forget to take your Daily Mail Stars Over Britain poster free with last week’s magazine. SOUTH EAST Near London, the South Downs National Park boasts no fewer than seven recognised stargazing spots, including Ditchling Beacon, Butser Hill, Old Winchester Hill, Iping Common and Devil’s Dyke. Visit southdowns.gov.uk/enjoy/explore/dark-night-skies for more information. FOUR GREAT STAR GAZING APPS  There are lots of apps out there that promise to be planetariums for your smartphone, but these are four of the very best – and they’re all free... Sky View (Free, Android and Apple) Simply point your device towards the night sky and Sky View tells you what you’re looking at. Then click on a constellation, planet or star for a full description. Meteor Shower Calendar (Free, Android and Apple) Shooting stars are more common than you think. This handy app will tell you when and where you can watch meteor showers. NASA (Free, Android and Apple) This app is packed with information about current NASA missions, when to spot the International Space Station where you live and a fantastic gallery of images.  STAR CHART (Free, Android and Apple) A great app for young stargazers, Star Chart shows what’s visible in the sky above you. Point it at the ground to see the view on the other side of the world. MIDLANDS The Peak District is blessed with truly dark skies and has three recommended spots at Surprise View, Parsley Hay and Minninglow. They’re all easily accessible and have information panels that help to guide you around the night sky – essential if you’ve forgotten your Daily Mail poster! NORTH The North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland national parks all have many stargazing spots. The Kielder Observatory holds stargazing events including family astronomy nights. Book your space in advance at kielderobservatory.org. NORTH WEST If you’re near Blackburn, Preston or Lancaster then head into the Forest of Bowland. There are five designated dark sky sites there, including the Beacon Fell Visitor Centre. There’s also Clerk Laithe Lodge (clerklaithe.co.uk), a guest house and restaurant right in the middle of the forest that offers walkways to the darkest possible areas. WALES The Brecon Beacons National Park is a designated Dark Sky Reserve, so it’s a superb place to take your telescope. There are countless stargazing locations in the park – try the remote Usk Reservoir Car Park near Trecastle for the darkest of skies, or the National Park Visitor Centre in Libanus where the Cardiff Astronomical Society holds occasional sessions. WEST COUNTRY Like the Brecon Beacons, Exmoor National Park is also a Dark Sky Reserve, which means light pollution is at a minimum. If you’re further south, near Newquay, try Carnewas and Bedruthan Steps where the Kernow Astronomers (kernowastronomers.com) periodically hold events. SCOTLAND Take your stargazing really seriously north of the border in the Scottish Highlands.  The Cairngorms and the Loch Lomond and Trossachs national parks are unrivalled on the mainland, or if you’re very adventurous try the Isle of Coll in the Inner Hebrides. It’s been named a Dark Sky Island by the International Dark Sky Association, as it has some of the darkest skies in Europe. For more details visit darkskycoll.co.uk. COTSWOLDS It’s not just the national parks that enjoy unpolluted night skies, but also the designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty all over the country. The Cotswolds has a particularly suitable location at the Rollright Stone Circle near Chipping Norton, where you can watch the heavens with these Neolithic sentinels. Scotland is also host to Europe’s first ‘dark sky town’ in the form of Moffat in the Annandale valley. Thanks to special street lights that minimise light pollution, the stars are visible right in the centre of town. You can see at least 17 of Orion’s 30 stars, whereas in most towns you will only see six.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack CCTV captures milkman killing tuk-tuk driver with a BRICK Most adorable kitties get treats when they ring their bells Tourists abuse hotel staff after kids get trapped in lift Jaw-dropping moment a great white shark catches a seal 'Boxing champion' driver threatens dad on dual carriageway Maid hangs from window before dramatically falling seven floors Entrepreneur flies impressive Iron Man-like flight suit Oddly satisfying deep cleaning of a very dirty car seat Gran starts heated debate with anti-Brexit campaigners Trump exits oval office without signing executive orders on trade Dashcam of Police chasing after suspected Stourbridge stabber Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to See (and Remove) Devices Linked to Your Apple ID on Your iPhone By Jason Fitzpatrick on March 31st, 2017 Thanks to a new feature in iOS 10.3, you can now see (and remove) every device connected to your Apple account right from your iPhone. You can also check the status of their Find My Phone and iCloud backup functions, check device info like model, version, and serial number, view and remove Apple Pay cards on the device. All this information gathered in a single place makes it extremely convenient to manage your stable of Apple devices. To access the new menu, simply launch the Settings app on any iOS device signed into your Apple account. The new layout of the Settings app puts the menu we need front and center: click on the profile link at the top of the screen to open up the Apple ID menu. Scroll to the bottom of the Apple ID menu and you’ll see all the devices linked to your Apple account, including all iOS devices, Apple TVs, Apple Watches, and authorized computers—authorized computers being any Windows or macOS machine you’ve signed into either iTunes or the iCloud software with. We’ll select our iPad to take a closer look at the individual entries. Here you can see a variety of information about the device, including the status of the Find My iPhone or iPad function, and the status of the iCloud backup (Note: if you haven’t enabled either of these functions on the device, these top two entries will be missing altogether). In addition, you can also see the model number, the iOS version number, as well as the serial number of the device—which is super handy if you need to plug in the serial number for a warranty claim or the like but you don’t have the device right at hand. If the device has Apple Pay configured with an associated credit card, you can also remove individual cards in this menu as well. Finally, and most usefully, you can remove the device from your account with the “Remove From Account” link at the very bottom. With a single tap and confirmation you can remove any device from your account but it’s important to understand what this accomplishes. RELATED ARTICLE How to Track, Disable, and Wipe a Lost iPhone, iPad, or Mac This revokes access to any iCloud/Apple services (the person with the device will not be able to make any purchases with your account or access your account setttings) but it does not wipe the device. In order to remotely wipe a device, you need to have the “Find My” feature turned on for that device and you need to first wipe the device before removing it. Once a device is removed, you can add it back into the Apple ID control panel by—you guessed it—signing back into the device with your Apple ID. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Jason Fitzpatrick is a warranty-voiding DIYer who spends his days cracking opening cases and wrestling with code so you don't have to.

They have their problems. Here, we take a look at what you need to know about iPhone 6s problems today and going forward. In early September, Apple confirmed two brand new iPhone models. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were released in late September and they replaced the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus as the company’s new flagship options. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still around but they’ve dropped in price. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been given excellent ratings from critics and users and they are outstanding devices. They’re two of the best phones around but they aren’t perfect and we continue to see complaints about iPhone 6s problems. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus run iOS 9 out of the box. iOS 9 is Apple’s latest mobile operating system. In the weeks since launch, the two devices have been outfitted with new iOS 9 updates including iOS 9.2. If you buy the iPhone 6s today, it might be running iOS 9.2. Today, we want to take a look at iPhone 6s problems. We also want to make sure that you’re prepared for the future, just in case you run into an issue with your phone. This roundup offers a look at the issues themselves and some steps to take if you do happen to run into iPhone 6s problems. iPhone 6s Problems Plaguing Users As we move away from the iPhone 6s release date, we continue to hear about iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus problems. Many iPhone 6s owners have run into iCloud Restore problems when firing up their phone for the first time. These iPhone 6s iCloud Restore problems are among the most common iPhone 6s problems and they are giving new iPhone 6s users headaches. Users are reporting long restore times that seem to go on forever. Fortunately, the process actually won’t take forever and we’ve found a potential fix to try. If you’re running into an iPhone 6s iCloud restore problem, you’ll want to set your phone up as new, install the iOS 9.0.1 update, choose restore, and then restore from iCloud. One other note. If you are having trouble activating your new iPhone 6s, try restarting the device or trying another connection. We’ve been hearing complaints about iOS 9.2 downloads getting stuck during the installation process. If this happens during the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus iOS 9.2 update, you’ll want to hold down the power button and home button at the same time. The phone will reboot and the download should work properly. The iPhone 6s problems go beyond activation issues, problems with iCloud restore and iOS 9.2 installation problems. iPhone 6s users are complaining about Slide to Update issues (fix for this here), problems with iMessages, overheating issues, and more. Apple’s discussion forums are starting to fill up with complaints about the iPhone 6s and iOS 9 and we expect more complaints to emerge as the dust from the release settles. hasn't even been 3 months since ive had my iPhone 6s & my battery is already messed😡😡😡 — – (@mvnirxh) December 20, 2015 iPhone 6s users have also encountered many of the same bugs that’ve popped up for other iOS 9.2 users. We’ve seen complaints about bad iPhone 6s battery life, broken Wi-Fi and various Bluetooth problems. These are all extremely common iOS problems and they affect all iPhone models, not just the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. It’s important for us to note that we’re not pointing these out to nitpick. We’re pointing them out to generate discussion and to serve as a warning. If this is your first iPhone, you’ll want to take a look at our list of things to do before installing an iOS update and at our iOS 9.2 upgrade tips. You’ll also want to take a look at the first iPhone 6s settings to change. How to Fix iPhone 6s Problems If you’re running into iPhone 6s problems, the last thing you want to do is panic. The iPhone 6s might be new but the iPhone itself isn’t. Over the years we, and many others, have compiled a long list of fixes to try in case something goes wrong. We continue to update our list of fixes for common iOS 9 problems and those should help if you encounter an issue on your device. These fixes include ways to improve iOS 9 battery life, fix poor Wi-Fi connectivity, and more. The fixes will work for iOS 9.0, iOS 9.1, iOS 9.2 and any and all upcoming iOS updates. It’s also important to note that some iOS-related problems will dissipate after a couple of days. For instance, battery life tends to settle after a few days with a new device or iOS update. If your iPhone 6s problems persist after a few days, that’s when you’re going to need to take action. How to Downgrade If an iOS update isn’t performing to your standards on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus you can downgrade to an older version of iOS. For a limited time. Apple isn’t signing off on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus iOS 9.1 updates which means you don’t have this option right now. The company typically signs off on older updates for a week or two before pulling the cord. Once that happens, the downgrade loophole will close up and you’ll be left with whatever version of iOS you’re on. We’ve put together a step-by-step guide that will take you through the downgrade process. We highly recommend getting familiar with it right now so that you can take advantage of the loophole in the future if you need to. Additional Resources If your needs go beyond our list of fixes or the downgrade process, know that you have a ton of resources at your disposal. If you’re in need of a fix or advice or feedback about new iPhone 6s iOS updates, you’ll want to check out Apple’s Discussion Forums. It’s going to be a fantastic resource for iPhone 6s problems. Bookmark it so that you can use it going forward. We’ve also found the MacRumors community to be a great resource so it might be in your best interest to stop by there as well. Social media websites like Twitter are also places to look for fixes and advice regarding problems with the iPhone 6s. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Your last line of defense is going to be the Apple Store. If you can’t fix your iPhone 6s problem on your own, you’ll want to make an appointment to see a Genius at an Apple Store. They can run diagnostics that you might not be able to do at home and if you’re under warranty, you might be able to get a new phone. What’s Next Apple’s next update for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be its iOS 9.2.1 update. The update is currently in beta but it doesn’t have a public release date. iOS 9.2.1 will be coming to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus next year, probably in the early part of the year. Its official change log isn’t available but it’s expected to bring bug fixes for iOS 9 problems. If you’re unable to fix your iPhone 6s problems, be on the lookout for it. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 37 Responses 09/25/2015 Jade Reply Any reports of problems with photos saving to camera roll, or notifications not working? (Plenty of storage space for camera roll) I too experienced the never ending iCloud restore for my new 6s 02/21/2016 Lynn Device Reply I had to restart the iCloud download three times until it finally worked, I have the 6S plus. 09/26/2015 Will.I.Aint Reply If anybody having the ‘slide to upgrade’ error and then get the activation code sent to your phone that won’t turn on. I got it solved with apple, just hold home button and side power button and release right when it turns off. then only hold down the home button while its off and plug it in while its still off. Oh all with iTunes open. It’ll bring you to a restore or update screen, choose restore. Accept all the info and it’ll go through a FULL restore and d.l. the software fix i assume. The only thing is it is a full restore so contact, media, apps, will all be removed. 09/26/2015 KCSunshine Reply Will I Aint – Thanks for the tip. I’m trying now. How long did the full restore take? 09/27/2015 Robert Long Reply I had a battery problem after restoring to last settings. Found the problem of lagging and drain to be caused by slow to dead download of music to the new phone. Left is on charge all night and 5 hours latter it only downloaded 500 songs out of 3000. I will associate it with just too many people doing the same thing and the iCloud servers not keeping up with demand. I turned iCloud off and did the rest with iTunes from the macbook pro and uploaded everything from there old school style and since then it has only dropped 3% batt over the past 10 hours. I would recommend people restore from PC backups and wait till the servers cool down before going the over the air route. 10/01/2015 Let Vio Reply Who can help me?

Kept getting the message iCloud Backup Failed There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup. I backed my phone on iTunes, upgraded to the iphone 6s and restored it from iTunes. No issues with the activation, nor the iTunes back up. I still cannot do an iCloud back up as I keep getting the same error message. Any ideas on how to fix this? I deleted the latest iCloud back up, and I see I have plenty of storage, so I am not sure if this is even a phone issue or an apple issue.

Click here to listen to a podcast version of this week's Trading With Cody Q&A Conference Call or read on for the full transcript. Cody: Welcome to the Trading With Cody Q&A Conference Call #2. Let's start with an overview of the markets. What's in the headlines? What's everyone freaking out about? What is the crises du jour or the celebration du jour. Talk about a "Teflon market"? You saw that on Thursday/Friday as the American Healthcare Act from the Republican side of the Republican-Democrat Regime pretended it was going to make a whole bunch of big changes to the overall system itself. Which really on the fringe was going to take a lot of options and protections away from people on the lower end and allow the giant corporate healthcare companies and biotech companies and pharma companies and everyone selling into the tax-payer funded healthcare system to keep making just as much money and making 99% gross margins, etc. The market, at least the talking heads out there, wanted everyone to freak out about it on Thursday and Friday. Monday morning, we come in and the futures are down 1%. I was listening to either Fox Business or CNBC on my drive in that morning and everyone was breathlessly saying "I thought it would be down even more than this after the vote failed on Friday for the American Healthcare Act." By the end of the day, the market was down pretty ugly but they were off their bottoms. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and here we are almost with the DOW back to 21,000 and the NASDAQ trying to pick up near all-time highs again, if it is not already there today. NASDAQ 6000 coming soon? Guys, I've been talking about this concept of the Republican-Democrat Regime and their very corporate profit focus, and not just corporate profits, but even the stock market focus. From allowing you to invest your 401Ks and your IRAs in mutual funds and stock market-related vehicles and making it much harder to invest in other assets, or starting your own business, to the Federal Reserve having interest rates basically still at 0%. These are all things that create the Bubble Blowing Bull Market I've been so vocal about for the last seven years. We are talking about de-regulating the banks right now. Don't forget that every single emergency measure from the financial crisis in 2008 when we were staving these banks off from bankruptcy, just so we could supposedly get back to a state of normalcy...every single one of those emergency measures is still in place in 2017. It is part of the reason I have been so bullish overall on the general markets, the stock market, on tech, on what I have been calling now for seven years the "bubble-blowing-bull-market". And we continue to live through it here. Someday, these Bubble things will come back to bite. Bubbles are not healthy over the long run. There is a lot of mal-investment going on and the banks still have a higher rate of profit relative to GDP than they ever have in the last 200 years. Those things allow people to fly around in private jets and do all the giant wonderful things that the top 0.1% of people get to do as they use the system in many ways to not pay their 30% of taxes that small businesses are. All that stuff, guys, goes into this thing that I keep talking about, "the bubble-blowing-bull-market". Apple is sitting there borrowing money at negative interest rates, which means people are paying them to borrow money from them. Then, Apple goes out and buys tens of billions of dollars of their stock and then they route as many revenues as you can through other countries that don't make you pay any income taxes on it, or near zero income tax on it, and you end up with a near 0% overall income tax. Not to mention benefiting from the 0% interest rates from the Federal Reserve in the first place, which is what enables the negative interest rates that Apple borrows at. Guess what? Apple is now a three-quarters of a trillion-dollar company. We have ridden Apple for 12-13 years and I complained about their ability to avoid taxes every step of the way, of course, because I want a level playing field. I want small businesses like my own, The IAm App, that is competing against Apple and Google and Facebook out there, to have to pay 30% if they are not paying 30% like we are. As long as Apple is the most profitable companies on the planet and they are barely paying taxes, their stock is probably going to keep going up. We need to be, like I talked about last week, paranoid and worried about that next Black Swan event, but we don't want to just scared for no reason right now. The bears and the perma-bears out there have been scared for the last seven years and they have missed a lot of wealth creation that we have been able to benefit from. Any questions from those who have called in? Q. I have had $AAPL for the last 12-13 years. It is a large portion of my portfolio. I am afraid to let it go and I have been holding on to it because it seems like it is still going well. The only guideline that I have developed for myself, if it is any help to anybody, is to look at the weekly unemployment number. As long as that stays strong it is okay, but if it starts to go the other way, then I feel there can be too many negative cascading events. Then, I'd start selling. A. So, are you going to sell 1/3 of your $AAPL? ½ of your $AAPL? Or, all of your $AAPL? If and when you decide that turn has come? Subscriber response: No, overall I am still at the same level. A. Have you been reading me since I owned $AAPL 12-13 years also? Subscriber response: Yes, and I have been a subscriber of Trading With Cody for about 8 years. A. Thanks so much. I think I've owned $AAPL since March-April 2003. I am at a fourteen-year anniversary with my $AAPL and I've continued to pare it down on occassions too. I'll sell 5-10% on occasion. I'll nibble some more when it has been crushed. I might by some call options every once in while. Again, with $AAPL, it is a three-quarters of a trillion-dollar company, but I do think it still has a lot more upside. I think it will be a trillion-dollar company. Obviously, as it is still one of my three largest positions. I don't know that the employment rate, going back to that part of the comment, I don't know that will be the thing that will tell for me per say. I don't watch the macro economic reports in the same way that most economists do. And I am an economy major from college and I have been doing this now for twenty years on Wall Street. I think a lot of that stuff is rearview looking. In 2010, if you were looking at the unemployment numbers you would have been panicked and you would have missed the bottom. Sometimes, economic number are the counter tell. One of the things that I think we do need keep paying attention to is the Federal Reserve as they continue to raise rates. I think a rising rate environment is very bullish. Which is exactly the opposite of what most every pundit out there will tell you about the Federal Reserve raising rates. Over the last twenty to thirty years, every time the Federal Reserve has been in a raising rate environment, the markets have been going through the roof. The Federal Reserve almost looks like it is chasing the stock market trying to tamper that bubble whenever it is raising rates. Eventually, the Fed catches up to the bubble, or there is a turn or a Black Swan event or the capital dries up like it did in the dot-com bubble. And then, all of sudden, the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates and/or otherwise easing. And cutting and cutting. We saw that in 2000 to 2002 and in 2007 to 2008. And what was happening to the stock markets when the Federal Reserve was in those major easing cycles? The markets were crashing. So while we're still net/net betting on the Bubble-Blowing Bull Market, we want to see that Fed continue to, at least at some point, pull back some of those emergency measures, raise rates to something a little more sustainable, a little more natural and the stock market will likely continue bubbling as they do that. At some point, there will be a crisis, or a black swan or they will end up with capital drying up anyway and they will chase the crash back down by this easing cycle. The Federal Reserve is a complete and total tool of the giant banks and the corporations that we are investing in this giant bubble-blowing-bull-market and don't ever forget that. Emailed Q. If you had "feet to fire" and had to put all of your money into one (or two) "great ideas" today, what would it be?? (i.e. the next "Facebook", or the next "big short"... whatever you consider most opportune now, after 8 year tired bull market, etc. etc.???) A. Cash? LOL. I've talked before about a book that Jim Cramer gave me when I was launching my hedge fund back in 2002 by Andrew Beyer called The Winning Horseplayer. It is about gambling at the race track. The reason Cramer gave it to me is because beyond the idea that it is about gambling at the racetrack, Beyer is all about maximizing his upside exposure when he is really confident that he has an edge and there's huge upside potential returns; cutting back when he is less confident and/or the returns have less upside relative to the risk;, and getting the heck out entirely and not trying to bet when he feels like he does not have any edge and/or there's little upside potential. As that relates to the stock market, I am at that spot right now that I don't feel like the upside potential is high enough to be aggressive right now. There are not a whole lot of excellent values out there. The market has not crashed like it had the last time I got aggressively long. It's not like it was in 2010 when I was aggressively long and buying call options, buying stocks, getting aggressive and more than 100% long. Then again, it's not like it was in October 2007 when I sold out of my hedge fund and took the job at Fox because I just really didn't like the setup of investing in technology. I didn't have enough confidence in my own short-selling skills to try and bet against the market, so I just got out and went to TV. Where we are right now in that cycle is that I am not widly bullish. I don't think we have a huge edge like we did in being able to buy $FB at $20 when everybody hated it and nobody thought the mobile App Revolution was going to be billions, trillions of dollars in size like it has become. That's when we were buying these things. Now everybody does believe in FB and the App Revolution. $FB has gone from $20 to $140. The flip side though is that I am not out there shorting everything either. It's not like I think it's October 2007 and there is some whole real estate collapse going on around the world that is going to cause a financial disruption. Patience is the best trade right now. I continue to think we have a Bubble-Blowing Bull Market right now. I want to continue to own some of our best Revolution Investing stocks. I'll buy some of them when they get hit next time I expect. I have got my ear to the ground and I am making sure there is no Black Swan about to crash the thing either. If I thought there was I would probably be looking at a great short opportunity. I think you just be patient. We own a lot of great revolution stocks. We should keep with them, sometimes taking some profits, trimming back a little. But I'm not ready to get net short yet. Me telling you to be patient is why people do stick around with Trading With Cody over time because I am not forcing ideas on you. I am not forcing the next trade because you guys need an idea. I think there is a lot of value you in me reminding you to just be patient sometimes. Q. If we take a look at an average Trading With Cody subscriber portfolio they've ended up with huge positions in Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon. Those stocks really take up a large portion of many of our portfoliso, even though the number of shares we hold may be small relative to the rest. How do we keep a balanced portfolio in a situation like that? A. That is part of what our earlier discussion about $AAPL was about and after owning it for 12-13 years it becomes an out-sized part of your portfolio, no matter how often you trim it. Stocks can go up 10000% like Apple has since I've owned it, or $AMZN like you are talking about which I haven't owned for the 10,000% gain, but I have owned for several 100% several times over the years. You look at my own Trading With Cody largest positions/latest positions, and it is dominated with $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, and $GOOGL just like your portfolio. I have owned them and I have had huge gains with them and I already had big positions in them. When I recently started a position in $GIMO, well, even a full-sized position in $GIMO isn't going to be anywhere near what my position in $AAPL, $FB, $AMZN, $GOOGL are at this point. There is no science to this. One of my very good friends, a hedge fund manager, never allows a position to grow larger than 5% of his hedge fund. But that means that if he had bought $AAPL (which he didn't), for example, and it went up 10000% and he bought $FB $20 and it went up 500%, he's going to end up selling, selling, selling and missing out on a lot of those gains because he wouldn't allow the big position to continue to rise. The flipside of that is we have had subscribers before who have talked before in these Q&As that they have been following me for 12-13 years and owned $AAPL with me that whole time and others with huge gains that made 30% of their personal portfolio in $AAPL. That is too much. We can try to have our cake and eat it too. We can trim some when these stocks with gains in our portfolios rip to all-time highs (like you've seen me do over the years) and the stocks have gone through the roof. We have to have the discipline to nibble a little bit back when they get crushed and everyone is freaking out over Brexit or a Greek financial crisis or whatever it is. We have to try to balance it. The simplest way to tell if you need to rebalance your portfolio is if you are worried about it at night. That applies to your overall portfolio and it applies to an individual position. If you are so long in your portfolio that you are losing sleep, sell a little bit and catch your breath. If you own 30% in $Amazon, well, that's too much and it should be keeping you up at night. If you own 20% in $AAPL but it is not keeping you up at night because you bought it at $2 and it is at $140 and have trimmed some along the way, you might ride it a little bit. You have the gains to cushion you a little bit...but maybe sell 5%. Point being, if you are up at night you are too long in either a stock or your portfolio. Subscriber comment: I agree with you totally. Did you know as we are talking that we are about to pass 20 trillion dollars in debt? It's all good when interest rates are near zero, huh? Emailed Q. I just read an old article by you titled "Where to invest your money when you don't trust the markets". This article was of interest to me because I don't trust the markets. Any of them. There is just way too much manipulation, corruption, and fraud that goes on in all of them. So, my question to you is, if one feels this way then where is the best place for my money? And just to let you know, I've worked on finance for a number of years as a portfolio manager but left the industry because of I got fed up with all the BS and lack of accountability. And this is from all sides; from the companies, themselves, to the regulators, and the governments. I also trade (options, etfs, bonds, and futures) and have developed several systems to manage the risk and uncertainty. Yet despite all of this and having a positive expectancy with minimum draw downs on my portfolio (<5%) I am just so sick and tired of the whole game. So I'm wondering where I can place my money where it won't be manipulated with for someone's else's gain or benefit because it seems to me this is the only way that companies can earn a profit (manipulation, fraud, lying, robbing, cheating, stealing, needing subsidies, bail outs, bail ins, having their taxes cut to 0%, etc....). A. The simplest answer to this question is invest in yourself. Start a business. Place the vast majority of your own money, time, and energy in to betting on yourself and something that you are creating. That's what I do. I certainly own stocks. I own some hard gold. I own real estate. I own other assets. But even a lot of those markets I don't trust. I don't trust the real estate market. Mortgage interest deduction..that is ridiculous. People who are rich enough to own a house don't have to pay as much taxes as people who rent a house. That is another one of those things that creates bubbles. The Federal Reserve and the Republican-Democrat Regime's policies are forcing money into places that it would not naturally go without tax incentives. Real estate is manipulated on many levels in the tax code and other policies. You all know that I don't trust gold ETFs or any ETF market out there that is supposed to have some hard-based asset backing it. I don't trust the oil markets. Stocks, as I mentioned in my opening, are far from being a pure market, what with all your different incentives from 401k's to IRAs to 0% interest rates to tax tricks for giant global corporations. I don't trust any of it. But we live in this world and I am not going to stuff all of my money under my mattress either. I am going to do my best to be objective, to be thinking free, to look at the world, to look at the economy, to look at these markets and try to understand the dynamics between them and to profit off of those things before they happen. To have a bigger picture than most of those guys that you are out there listening to on CNBC. We have to be objective and open to the ways these markets are manipulated, but that doesn't again necessarily mean that we are scared of being in them. It means we should be paranoid about it, but it doesn't keep us entirely out of them. If you want to avoid every market out there, you are going to have to either buy gold or you are going to need, more to the point, just invest in yourself. Invest in your own business. Invest in your own ideas. Q. What smaller companies do you see with the most potential to become the next $AAPL, $FB, $AMZN or $GOOGL that are in an early place for growth, where $AAPL was say twelve years ago? A. It's a great question, but I don't have a great answer for it. That is what I spend all day, every day, trying to find. My own companies, I do think have a whole lot of potential. The IAm App could become the next $FB. We've owned $AAPL, $FB and $GOOGL for many years, and we have owned $AMZN off and on for many years. I was being interviewed a couple of months ago on the radio in New York and the guy asked me some of my holdings. I threw out $NVDA that I had a good year with last year and I mentioned my $FIT losses. And he said what are some of your other winners? I said "I've had $AAPL since March 2003 at $1 and I bought options and I bought $FB at $25 and all the way down $18. I tell him all the stories that you all that have been subscribing with me here at Trading With Cody have hear. That we bought $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB and $GOOGL and I was calling them the "Four Horsemen of Tech" ten years ago in some of those cases and 5 years ago in $FB's case. And the guy was like "What? that's all of them, $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOGL and last year $NVDA! That's incredible." I said "Don't get me wrong, I've had some losses, too." As you all know not all of my picks have been $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOGL and $NVDA, but that is the point. We own and have owned 4 or 5 of the biggest winners in the stock market out of the last ten years. $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB and $GOOGL are the most valuable companies on the planet. They are worth 400 billion dollars for $AMZN and $FB and $550-600 for $GOOGL and $750 billion for $AAPL. And we bought them when they were small caps, mid caps. I am not trying to just brag here or avoid the question. My point is that it's hard. All I do every day is try to find the next $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB or $GOOGL. I promise you, if I had the ones with the most potential that aren't already in the portfolio, I would tell you. I think $PANW could be a five or ten-fold return. $AMBA, if they deliver, but it is so volatile and such a binary outcome and a lot more risk than $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB or $GOOGL, frankly. Haha, of course, in regards to the "risk in Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google" years ago, well, hindsight is 20/20. Q. What about some of these drone stocks? What ones are unique and sets them apart from the rest? A. You guys remember when I wrote a report about 10 Stocks for the Drone Revolution. I need to go back and look at some of those stocks. Drones are not as big as smartphones and the App Revolution and they are not going to be any time soon. Robots and wearables, for example, are probably more exciting for the next few years. Subscriber comment: They have the biggest potential. A. I don't think so. Drones, themselves any time soon, aren't going to be that kind of thing. I think wearables are probably a bigger market near term. I think robotics, themselves, and artificial intelligence, too. Drones, maybe 10-20 years from now it will be a better tectonic plate of the world of technology in the world. I think we are too early in the cycle for it to be a trillion-dollar market. Q. What about Uber or Lyft? A. If they come public, we will take a look at them as always. It depends on the valuation and the actual fundamentals. It depends on the business models. I sure don't like the management at Uber except for the fact that they have taken over the world and I use their service every time I travel. I've never used Lyft frankly. We will find out when they come public. Subscriber response: They like Lyft out here in Las Vegas better than Uber. A. The whole thing for me is that when I want a car service, I want as many options as possible and Uber has a bigger critical mass of drivers. That is the totality of the reason I use Uber. Like most things in app world, it is a winner takes all kind of business. Maybe Lyft is sort of like Yahoo with Uber being Google. Q. With a little more time and activity and others' commentary under our belt, any new reflections on $SNAP? A. Snapchat. You saw the article I wrote, which I think I called Six Differences Between Facebook and Snapchat When They Came Public. I really do put a lot of weight in the IPO itself and the price action immediately after. As you guys know, just like the Federal Reserve commentary we did earlier, this is exactly opposite of what everybody else I've ever read or heard talk about IPOs believes. This is my own free thinking here. But my theory is that you want to get as much as possible on your balance sheet, in your checking account, when you go public. The reason you are going public is to raise money to compete to build your business to grow. If you are going public and leaving a 50% pop from where you sold the shares to where the people who bought the shares then get to sell it in the market, when the stock market opens and trading in your stock, that is 50% money that you could have had. Facebook, again, being the best example of doing it the right way. They got every dollar they could have. They upped the price, they upped the price, they upped the shares, they upped the shares. Then, they sold as many shares as they ever possibly could at as high of price as they possibly could. The market couldn't bear it near term and the stock crashed from $35 to $18. Who cares? Facebook got as much money as possible for the battle for the wars for the next ten years. They put tens of billions of dollars on their balance sheet that they wouldn't have had if they had allowed the stock to pop 50% the first day, which is what $TWTR, $GPRO, $SNAP and so many companies do. The IPO pop, in and of itself, is a huge red flag against $SNAP's management and for the company. They have to compete against $FB, $GOOGL, $AMZN and $AAPL. $SNAP has to compete against those companies for the next 10-20 years. $SNAP put 3 billion dollars on their balance sheet to do that battle with when they could have put 4.5 or 5 billion dollars on their balance sheet to do battle with. That's a billion dollars that they don't have now to invest, to research to hire, to poach talent from Google and Facebook. It is a big mistake. A big mistake. It truly makes me feel like I am on another planet that nobody else in the world sees it this way. You never hear anything good about the Facebook IPO to this day. Well, despite the so-called "disastrous" Facebook IPO, the stock has done great ever since. Despite the so-called "brilliant" IPO at Twitter, the stock has been crap ever since. It was a crappy IPO at Twitter. It was a brilliant IPO at Facebook. I don't know why the world doesn't see it that way. It seems pretty straight forward to me. You are raising money. That is why you went public. Raise as much money as you can. Zuckerberg is one step ahead. Q. Speaking of Amazon, if you do not own shares what is a good entry point? Wait for the long awaited broad market breathercorrection before taking a position? A. Amazon is a juggernaut and has so much potential upside still with so many high growth businesses. I'm not even going to talk about Amazon's dominance in retail or the huge growth and profits in Amazon Web Services. Those are reasons enough to own Amazon for the next 5-10 years, but it is Alexa that has me excited. Game-chaning is the artificial intelligence, the deep learning of Alexa, the ease of use of Alexa. I will not talk to my Siri. It never works. It never hears me or if it does, it doesn't hear me correctly. Watch this: [Demonstration of Alexa playing Spotify, turning volume up, stopping]. That technology is going to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 10 years. It is not just cool, but the fact that it is also from Amazon and creates the halo for the Amazon eco-system. Alexa also has sold tons of units. Alexa is also going to be in cars next year. If Amazon is doing what I think they are doing, they are right now creating an Alexa-centric Android smartphone. And an Alexa Smartphone is going drive the next phase of the smartphone wars and the App Revolution. I've sometimes thought that maybe I should cover my short in $EWY/Samsung until Alexa comes out with their new phone. When Amazon comes out with their Alexa smartphone, it is ends of days for the Samsung dominance and the Android hardware. [At this comment from Cody, Alexa starts reading headlines about Samsung's Galaxy 8]. Haha, Incredible. Alexa is getting better all the time. It didn't do that three months ago. That is what I am talking about with the deep learning and the artificial intelligence. They are investing billions in making Alexa what Watson was supposed to be. Emailed Q. Cody, I think you should take a look at $FEYE again. They seem to have implemented their turnaround plans and with the new CEO, Mandia, in place, I think there is a lot of upside in this name. Just because you are in $PANW doesn't preclude you from looking at a competitor, right? I'd love to get your thoughts on $FEYE here at mid-12s with everything they've done to streamline business and cut bloat. Many thanks! A. With a company like $FEYE, it is small company, a start-up. It is not like they are established in the market place nearly as much as $PANW, which is also not established in the market in the way $CSCO is. $FEYE with the crises they ended up having when the stock was $60-80 and now it is down to $12 and they have taken guidance down over the last few years, there would have to be some serious proof in the pudding before I would want to get back in there. I would rather pay $15 or $18 for the company after the turn has been proven out rather than hope and pray that new CEO actually does get it turned without much proof. There you have it for $FEYE.

Why Are McLarens Always Orange? New Apple Patent Shows Wearables that Aim to Curb Distracted Driving Share Tweet Subscribe Get AutoGuide.com in your Inbox Like AutoGuide.com on Facebook By Jason Siu Mar 31, 2017 American tech giant Apple has been granted a patent for “Detecting Controllers in Vehicles Using Wearable Devices.” First uncovered by Roadshow, the patent essentially uses a wearable like the Apple Watch to detect if someone is behind the wheel of a car. If they are, the wearable will adjust the number and type of notifications it receives. Basically the motion sensors in a wearable would determine whether or not it appears someone is driving a car. And since it’s using existing motion sensors, no additional hardware would be needed to put the technology in effect. SEE ALSO: Apple CarPlay Finally Goes Wireless Distracted driving continues to be a major issue in the U.S., especially texting and driving. But now that more and more smartwatches are being used, this technology could cut down on people having to check their watches while driving as well. The U.S. government estimates 431,000 people were injured and 3,179 were killed in 2014 due to distracted driving.

The iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and iPhone 8 will come with "full spectral sensing" ambient light sensor for the purpose of a "True Color" screen, the analysts said. Read: New iPad vs. iPad Pro 2: Apple's New And Upcoming Tablet Compared True Tone is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The feature allows the tablet to automatically adjust the color and intensity of its display depending on the environment. For example, if a room has a yellow, dim lighting, the tablet’s display will switch to a warm color, and if the iPad is used outside on a cloudy day, the screen’s color will adjust to a cool blue tone. To offer True Tone, the iPad uses advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to adapt to the environment, Apple explains. The feature is similar to Night Shift, currently available on iPhones. True Tone on the iPad Pro was likely introduced to compete with other tablets, such as the Amazon Kindle, which is easy on the eyes for readers. Now it seems like Apple is expanding the feature to its smartphones. The analysts said the sensors for the screen will be supplied by Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro Enters Limited Production; Don’t Expect An Early Launch States Source By Ramish Zafar Mar 28, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s approach with the iPad shifted slightly this year. Cupertino quietly put the white flag up and launched a $330, 9.7 inch iPad last week. Balance sheet numbers for the device continue to disappoint and Apple’s desperate to make shipments. However, that doesn’t mean the company won’t make any changes for the lineup. It’s all about larger screens on the iPad, as the device will serve as a notebook/smartphone hybrid. Need a smartphone’s portability but low powered notebook productivity? Get an iPad if you’re an Apple user. Today, we’ve got more details for a much rumored, 10.5 inch iPad Pro. Take a look below for more. Limited Production For Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro Has Commenced Claims IHS Analyst Industry sentiment for the iPad Pro is mixed. While a lot of folks expect Apple to launch one new device after the other, Cueprtino plays its cards more sensibly. The 10.5 inch iPad Pro will be the lineup’s first serious overhaul since the original 12.5 inch device was launched. Apple’s rumored to introduce it’s new edge to edge design theme on the device as well. This fact has led some to speculate that we won’t see an early 2017 launch for the device. The iPhone is Apple’s star portfolio performance and Cupertino won’t introduce a design shift on its tablet lineup. Related Apple’s Free App Of The Week Is A Popular Puzzler – $0.99 Value However, MacRumors now reports that limited production for the 10.5 inch iPad Pro has commenced. This suggests that Apple has nearly perfected its overall approach for the device to be confident enough for production. As March ends, sources now expect that the 10.5 inch iPad Pro will launch next month. This doesn’t hold water for the reasons mentioned above. Advertisement Related New 9.7-Inch iPad Teardown: Is This Just Another iPad Air From the Inside? The focus for 2017 will be on the iPhone for Apple. While the media loves to speculate that a completely overhauled iPhone 8 will launch this year, such a move might place Apple in a rut. A vastly different iPhone 8 from the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will render the devices an obsolete look. It’ll introduce unnecessary conflict into the lineup as Apple will divide the iPhone into ‘Premium’ and ‘More Premium’. Back to the iPad. Limited production for the 10.5 inch model will give Apple a lot of room for testing. The iPad Pro lineup feature great devices that provide an efficient bridge between computing and productivity. Furthermore, an edge to edge display combined with 10nm processors for the 10.5 inch variant will add a lot of new features into the mix. So it’s only sensible for Apple to be ahead of time for production and testing. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Here’s the Reason Why iOS 10.3 Feels Slightly ‘Snappier’ By Uzair Ghani Mar 28, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit Noticed how iOS 10.3 feels snappier compared to iOS 10.2.1? There’s a reason behind it, and no it’s not entirely because of the new Apple file system. Apple Tweaked the Animations to Make iOS 10.3 Feel Faster than Ever iOS 10.3 adds a bunch of great features to iPhones and iPads. Surprisingly, it makes the overall experience snappier too. And in case you are blaming the new Apple file system for it, don’t. It has nothing much to do with the overall snappiness. In fact, you’ll be surprised to learn that Apple was able to make iOS 10.3 zippier compared to iOS 10.2.1 by simply tweaking the animation speed and length. How do we know this? Engineer Renaund Lienhart from Apple chimed in on the topic and made everything clear in a tweet. Related Zelda Breath Of The Wild Can Run At An Acceptable Framerate On Cemu 1.7.3d; ReShade, 12k GFX Pack Video Also Released iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 Advertisement So there you have it. If you were looking for a reason why iOS 10.3 feels faster than previous releases, you have your answer with you now. Animations aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but when they are being overdone, it just doesn’t feel right. If you can recall the launch of iOS 7, things were painfully slow, with Apple pushing the throttle forward with every new release. Sitting currently at version 10.3, Apple’s mobile OS does feel snappy as ever. However, I personally believe there’s a lot that can be done in this area to further improve things. For instance, a simple slider to adjust animation speed can go a long way in fining tuning the overall user experience. Related Resident Evil 4 HD The Castle Release Now Available For Download There’s a chance Apple might actually do something about this problem (if you consider it that) with the release of iOS 11. But till that happens, you can rely on Apple’s mercy to adjust animation speeds to anything they like. iOS 10.3, however, is available to download over the air as a free update for all iPhone and iPad devices that are compatible. For more details, download links and even a downgrade guide, check out the links below. iOS 10.3 for iPhone & iPad Released – Final Download Now Available How to Downgrade iOS 10.3 Final Version to iOS 10.2.1 Let us know in the comments section what you think about iOS 10.3 and its snappy nature.

Sean O'Reilly (TMFBuckeye) Mar 31, 2017 at 3:12PM Believe it or not, technology juggernaut Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the best performing stocks of the past year. Had you purchased shares in AAPL last May, when shares bottomed out at about $90 per share, you would be sitting on a 60% gain as of the time of this writing. That's a fantastic gain for any stock, let alone one of the largest companies in the world. After all, the bigger the business, the harder it is to move the needle. Today, Apple's shares sit at what is essentially an all-time high, valuing the enterprise that was started in a garage 41 years ago at $780 billion dollars. Where's the enterprising investor to turn? Surely shares can't possibly be as good of a buy today as they were last May, even if there are whispers of Apple becoming the first trillion-dollar company. While there are certainly many intriguing stock buys out there, for reasons that we shall soon learn, one stock has a lot to offer tech investors in the marketplace today: Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA).  Introducing Acacia Acacia is a relatively new entrant into the networking and connectivity industry. Its corporate motto, "Connecting at the Speed of Light," more or less tells the tale of just what exactly Acacia does. The company was founded in 2009 to design and manufacture silicon-based interconnects for fiber optic networks, which vastly improves the performance of cloud and other communications networks. Acacia is quickly earning a reputation as a forward-thinking organization that's pushing the envelope of how our world is connected. There perhaps is no better proof of this than in its financial results: Quarterly results  Metric Q4 2015 12/31/2015 Q4 2016 12/31/2016 Percentage Increase Revenue $68.5 million $142.4 million 107% Net income $4.6 million $53.9 million 1,071% Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Annual results Metric  FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Revenue $146.2 million $239.1 million $478.4 million Net income $13.5 million $40.5 million $131.6 million Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. As any technology investor will tell you, creating a worthwhile product is hard enough, but to do so while generating fantastic growth and solid returns on invested capital is something special. Can Acacia continue to execute in the long term as well as tech giant Apple?   Competitive position Acacia Communications was founded for one purpose -- to take advantage of an opportunity to take the world's cloud-focused networks to the next level. As described in its 2014 IPO Prospectus, global internet traffic was projected to grow from 2.0 exabytes per day to 5.5 exabytes per day in 2019 -- a 23% annual increase. This massive amount of data, 5.5 exabytes being equal to 5.5 billion gigabytes of data, will require increasingly advanced networks in order to run smoothly. This is where Acacia's founders and scientists come in. Over 45% of the company's 290 employees hold a Ph.D. or other advanced degree, as of 12/31/2016. As described in the company's recent 10-K filing: Traditional techniques for transmitting information via light signals over a fiber optic network used simple 'on/off' manipulation, or modulation, of the light signal. These traditional techniques are adequate for transmission speeds up to 10 Gbps ...At transmission speeds in excess of 10 Gbps, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to compensate for the degradation of light signals using traditional techniques. The industry's solutions to the problems associated with high transmission speeds is a more complex method of decoding the light signals in a fiber optic cable: coherent communications. As you might imagine, the sheer complexity of these methods is enough to make the most advanced engineer's head spin. And that's where Acacia comes in. Image Source: Getty Images. Through its suite of products, Acacia offers network providers high-speed coherent interconnection products that reduce the complexity and cost of transmitting data at higher than 10 Gbps. Its products are so good that its customer base has grown from eight of the world's leading network equipment manufacturers -- think Cisco and Infinera -- to more than 25, as of last year. A few words of caution While it's clear that Acacia has a lot to offer its customers at present, its success may attract competition. The risks associated with investing in any technology company apply doubly to Acacia. Not only does it need to worry that its technology offerings will one day become obsolete, possibly in the blink of an eye, but also that it will one day be felled by a more advanced competitor. By the company's own admission, Acacia currently attracts competition from some of the very same companies it currently counts as its top customers: As noted in its latest annual report, Acacia actually competes with the coherent interconnection solutions from the likes of Nokia, Ciena, Huawei, Cisco, and Infinera -- all of which are currently included in a list the company's 25 major customers. Should any of these players decide to go a different direction and cease their relationship with Acacia, or simply invent a superior solution, it could spell trouble for the young start-up. Foolish final thoughts Tech is a tough industry to succeed in. Competition is fierce, and relentless improvement is the name of the game. Failure to do so spells doom. Acacia Communications represents a unique way for investors to bet on the continued growth of internet usage globally -- the prospect of which is practically guaranteed. Is it possible that it gets outcompeted and stamped into irrelevance? Yes. But that's true of any technology-based business. With shares currently trading hands at $58 as of the time of this writing, which values the company at just 20 times forward earnings-per-share estimates -- low for a business with Acacia's growth history -- Acacia Communications is a fantastic technology stock to consider adding to a portfolio.

Warren Buffett has historically not invested much in the tech sector, but here are three big exceptions. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Mar 31, 2017 at 4:07PM Warren Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), have historically avoided investing in tech stocks, simply because Buffett doesn't understand tech very well, and he doesn't like investing in businesses he doesn't understand. However, these days there are a select few tech stocks in Buffett's portfolio -- all of which have Buffett-like qualities. Company Recent Share Price Number of Shares Berkshire Owns Value of Berkshire's Stake Apple $140.64 133,000,000 (est) $18.7 Billion IBM $173.83 81,232,303 $14.1 Billion Sirius XM $5.10 166,639,941 $850 Million Data Source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings as of 12/31/16, except for Apple, which was revealed by Buffett in an interview with CNBC. Share prices as of 3/26/17. Berkshire's tech stocks and why Buffett likes them Image source: The Motley Fool. 1. Apple Berkshire first invested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about a year ago, but the initial purchase represented a relatively small investment for Berkshire. Since then, the stake has roughly increased by a factor of 20, and now represents one of Berkshire's largest stock investments. The massive increase in Berkshire's Apple investment didn't come as much of a surprise to many investors. In fact, in a December article, I said that Apple was a stock Berkshire should double-down on. Apparently, Buffett and company agreed, and then some. There are lots of reasons Buffett likes Apple, such as its dominant market position, pricing power, large and steady cash flow, and its 12-figure stockpile of cash. Apple also has "stickiness" -- a favorite term of Buffett's -- as it has one of the most loyal customer bases of any company in the market. Multi-generational iPhone users typically don't just decide to go buy a Samsung phone, for example. 2. IBM International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), better known as IBM, was Berkshire's first big venture into the tech sector. Berkshire started building its stake in 2011, and has added to it several times since. In fact, IBM is now one of Berkshire's largest stock investments. Buffett's purchase of IBM came as a surprise to many investors, however his reasons for buying IBM made sense. As he said in a 2011 CNBC interview, "...we went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned and why they made the decisions they made. And I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness..." As my colleague Tim Green pointed out in an in-depth article about Buffett's IBM investment, most of IBM's revenue comes from clients who use multiple IBM solutions, which creates big switching costs (this is what Buffett means by "stickiness"). And, the company has done a great job of evolving and investing in new areas of technology, such as cloud computing. 3. Sirius XM Satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is the newest addition to Berkshire's portfolio out of these three tech stocks, with the stake added during the fourth quarter of 2016. And while we don't know for sure why Buffett chose to add Sirius XM, the company does have a lot of qualities that Buffett loves. For one thing, Sirius XM has a dominant position in an industry whose barriers to entry are high. Think about it -- can you even name the number two satellite radio company (hint: there isn't one). And, the company has begun to demonstrate steady, sustainable growth, and consistent earnings power with revenue rising by about 10% per year for the past three years. Additionally, the company offers high-demand original content that gives it an edge over other subscription-based streaming services. Howard Stern (who will host his show through at least 2020) is the prime example, but there are a number of popular original programs offered by the service. Buffett won't buy just any tech stocks The takeaway here is that Buffett and his stock pickers are less concerned with the industry they're investing in, and more worried about whether or not the company they're buying has the qualities Buffett looks for. It just so happens that most tech companies have generally produced inconsistent earnings and faced tremendous competitive pressures, which have steered Buffett away. These three companies are exceptions. Matthew Frankel owns shares of Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares). The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple A word of warning to anyone who hasn’t already updated to iOS 10.3 Zach Epstein @zacharye March 30th, 2017 at 6:57 PM Share Tweet Earlier this week, Apple put an end to the beta madness and released iOS 10.3 to the public. Don’t worry, a new developer beta — iOS 10.3.2 — was promptly released the very next day. We already told you about all the best new features in iOS 10.3, and we also drew attention to one feature in particular, a hidden change that gives the iPhone and iPad a nice little speed boost. If you haven’t already updated though, there’s one feature that we should warn you about because we’ve received a handful of emails from people who have run into some serious problems. Don't Miss: Samsung’s Galaxy S8 tried to copy a signature iPhone 7 feature, but failed miserably Among the behind-the-scenes changes in iOS 10.3, Apple’s move to a new file system is clearly the biggest. Prior to iOS 10.3, all iOS devices used the popular HFS+ file system. Beginning with iOS 10.3, however, Apple has moved to the more modern Apple File System (APFS). There are a number of advantages to switching to Apple’s new file system, but the big ones are better optimization for NAND flash storage and SSD storage, more accurate time stamping, and support for stronger encryption. HFS+ is 30 years old at this point, so it was clearly time for a change. Here’s the problem, however: once you update your phone to iOS 10.3 and your file system is converted to APFS, you can no longer roll back without wiping your phone and reinstalling an older iOS build. Why is that significant? Because if something goes wrong and you roll back to an older build, you’ll no longer be able to recover data because everything will have been converted to APFS. So, a word of warning: Back. Up. If you haven’t already upgraded to iOS 10.3, be sure to back up all of your data before you do. This can be done either with iCloud (Settings > iCloud > iCloud Backup > Back Up Now) or by backing up using iTunes. It might take a little while, but waiting a few minutes while your iPhone backs up is much less aggravating than losing some or even all of your data.

The next iPhone, which still hasn’t been announced, will feature a “full spectral sensing” ambient light sensor allowing for True Tone display, says Barclays. True Tone display, currently featured in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, alters the appearance of the screen based on the surrounding light. The display of the iPad also changes whether your inside or outside. Currently, Night Shift mode is available on iOS devices, however it doesn’t work the same as a True Tone display. Night Shift mode, a feature available in all iOS 9.3 devices and above, limits how much blue light is emitted from the display. While Night Shift mode is good for the night, True Tone is designed to make looking at the screen easier on your eyes regardless of time or location. We’ll most likely find out more about True Tone display and the new iPhone devices at some point this Fall. Until then, however, here’s how enable Night Shift mode on your Apple iPhone.

U dont realize how good it is, until you put it side by side beside something that doesn’t have it. Eluder My experience is opposite to be honest, haven’t really noticed any advantage, but then again, I’m not outside with my iPad Pro ever. Brad Fortin You can experience the difference indoors. First disable the feature, then go to a sun-lit area and turn it on to notice the mild difference in sunlight. Then, turn it back off, go to an artificially-lit area, and turn it on again. The effect is more noticeable with warm temperature lights.

We’ve seen it time and time again with Apple’s iPhone lineup since all the details always leak months in advance, and now we’re seeing it with Samsung’s hot new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Android fans lost count of all the leaks as they flooded the web in the weeks ahead of Samsung’s big Unpacked press conference on Wednesday, and we’ve seen photos and videos leak time and time again. Once people actually saw the full Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ picture come together on stage yesterday, however, they knew they were watching something special. We already gave you an extensive hands-on preview of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, and we also ran through a number of the duo’s most exciting new features. In this post, we’re going to focus on the five new Galaxy S8 features people just can’t stop taking about, and we’ll also cover two fantastic new Galaxy S8 features that most people don’t even realize were added to the new phones. Don't Miss: 10 new Galaxy S8 features you won’t find on any iPhone Design This is obviously the big one, and for good reason. After spending just a couple of hours with Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, we can already state conclusively that these new flagship smartphones are the sleekest, most elegant, best-designed handsets the world has ever known. Just a few short years ago, Samsung was still releasing flagship phones made out of thin plastic that felt flimsy and cheap. Fast-forward to 2017 and the company’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are unmatched. Apple’s iPhones have always been considered the gold standard of design — they are the most copied handsets on the market, after all — but Samsung has bested Apple in nearly every way. First and foremost, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ have narrow bezels and a screen-to-body ratio of 83%. As a result, Samsung has fit a monstrous 6.2-inch Super AMOLED display into a phone the same size as Apple’s 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. In fact, at 5.8 inches, even the smaller Galaxy S8 has a bigger screen than the iPhone 7 Plus. Then you’ve got the rounded edges on the front and back of the phones, which makes them fit perfectly in the hand. It also makes Samsung’s new phones feel incredibly thin despite actually being a tiny bit thicker than Apple’s iPhones. Photos will never do the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ justice. When you finally get the chance to check these hot new handsets out in stores, you’re going to be blown away. Bixby The second most talked-about Galaxy S8 feature has to be Bixby. This is Samsung’s attempt to combat the rise of digital assistant products like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and the one that started it all, Apple’s Siri. This is one of the hottest spaces in consumer tech right now, so it’s no mystery why Samsung would want in on the action. It’s obviously far too soon to compare Bixby to any other virtual personal assistant products out there, though a number of gadget blogs out there have inexplicably already tried to do so. Early impressions generally seem positive though, and we’re looking forward to putting Bixby through the paces when we review Samsung’s new phones. Bixby Vision Bixby Vision is an extension of Bixby that brings the physical world around you into the picture. Literally. Using the camera on the Galaxy S8 or S8+, Bixby Vision allows the phones to “look” at their surroundings and offer useful information to users. Bixby Vision can also “see” printed text and instantly translate more than 50 different languages. Samsung DeX Samsung isn’t the first company to bake a desktop experience into a smartphone, but it is the first company to bake a desktop experience into a smartphone that people actually want. Microsoft and its partners like HP have offered a similar feature on Windows phones, but they were, well, Windows phones. What’s more, Samsung’s implementation with DeX is shockingly fast. It looks and feels a bit like Chrome OS, but the idea of having one device with all of your data, logins and more is compelling. Unless you need specialized software that’s only available for Windows or macOS, Samsung’s DeX solution can easily replace the need for a desktop PC for many people. Read More Here’s a video that shows Samsung DeX in action: Processors To be honest, it’s a bit odd that there’s so much chatter out there surrounding the processors in Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Specs are important, of course, but they hardly tell the whole story. In the case of the Galaxy S8 and S8+, however, the processors are more important than normal because these are the first new smartphones to sport next-generation 10nm chipsets. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Samsung Exynos 8895 use a process that is more compact than any other mass-market processors. They’re also more energy-efficient and more powerful than any other processors on the market. In terms of multi-core performance, they absolutely crush everything else on the market and people are excited to check them out. Two features almost no one is talking about Most people were so enamored with Samsung’s new design that they apparently didn’t bother to really dig into the details. We can’t blame them, to be honest — these new smartphones are just so gorgeous. There are two features involving the Galaxy S8’s wireless connectivity that users should be very excited about, and we’ll quickly cover them here. First up, the Galaxy S8 will be the first widely available smartphone with Bluetooth 5.0. This next-generation wireless technology is better than current versions of Bluetooth in literally every way. It’s more power efficient, it has four times the range, and it supports two simultaneous independent streams. That means you can play a video and stream to two separate pairs of Bluetooth headphones at the same time. Last but certainly not least, the Galaxy S8 will be the first phone to support gigabit LTE speeds. That’s right, 1Gbps data transfers on your phone. Good luck holding onto your tiered data plans in the future… Here’s a video from T-Mobile that shows off some crazy speed tests: Trending right now: Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update will be released soon as a free download Go get these crazy MacBook deals while you can Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ hands-on: Samsung finally out-designed Apple’s iPhone See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next NASA finally thinks it knows where all of Mars’ water went BGR News A word of warning to anyone who hasn’t already updated to iOS 10.3 BGR News We're sorry this is all we were able to find about this topic.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 1, 2017 03:25 AM In this day and age, a lot of teardowns  on popular devices can be found on the Internet. While these are, most of the time, helpful for anyone who is trying to repair a device, it can also be enlightening to anyone who is just plain curious. Of course, right now, there is only one place anyone can get the latest teardowns on some of the latest electronic gadgets and that is iFixit. Yesterday, the product teardown in question is for the new iPad that was released a few days ago. In the said teardown, one can see that the internals of the new iPad is pretty similar to the original iPad Air. From the internal frame divisions down to the actual arrangements of the components, they are quite identical. Which now begs the question, is Apple getting tired of the iPad? When the iPad was first released, it was thick and heavy. In the succeeding releases, Apple made it its mission to redesign the iPad to something very light and portable, hence the release of the iPad Air. Then after that, apart from the iPad Pro, everything stayed pretty much the same. From the looks of it, Apple is finally facing a hard task of finding the next best thing for the iPad. In fact, the only main difference of the new version to the Air model is that it now has a TouchID sensor. New iPad and iPad Air (via ifixit.com) In addition to the fingerprint scanner, Apple just added a few upgrades on the RAM, processor and storage. The display is still the same as the older version of iPad Air or iPad Pro. The only good news about the release is the fact that Apple decided to cut its markup on the device. At a mere $329, the new iPad is quite cheap considering that it has a 32GB flash storage. Apple seems to be running out of good ideas for its product. It seems like the design of the iPad will remain as it is for a very long time. Consumers should not expect to see any major design changes on the tablet for quite a while. Unless Apple suddenly decides to make the iPad foldable, which is a totally new concept altogether. For more updates on the new iPad, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of the next iPhone generation using True Tone display tech. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. True Tone iPhone: A new rumor claims that Apple will be using True Tone display technology in its 2017 iPhone devices, reports 9to5Mac. According to the rumor, the tech company will use the True Tone display technology in all of its 2017 smartphones coming out later this year. That includes the rumored iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and iPhone 8. AAPL was previously expected to introduce True Tone display tech in the iPhone 7 line, but didn’t. It first started using the technology with the introduction of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro last year. Retail Positions: Apple is planning to cut several retail positions from its physical stores, MacRumors notes. The company is reportedly planning to remove the “Business Manager, Business Events Lead, Events Coordinator, and Events Lead” positions. Employees in these positions started being told about the change earlier this week. They have been given the option to take a lower level job with less pay, or two months worth of severance pay. 911 Fix: Apple’s most recent update for iOS fixes an issue that could cause problems for 911 workers, reports BGR. The problem in the older version of iOS allowed a string of code to be executed that would tell an iPhone to repeatedly call 911. The problem was discovered by a teenage developer that posted the code online. He was later arrested after a flood of 911 calls hit emergency workers. The new update makes it so that users are now prompted twice before calling a number sent in a text message, which is how the exploit was executed.

A Barclays investment report appears to hint at three new iPhones expected to come out this year with True Tone displays, according to MacRumors. If true, this would mean that the (yet to be announced) iPhone 7S/7S+ and/or iPhone 8 may get displays that were previously exclusive to Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro.  Wait, what's True Tone? True Tone adjusts white balance on the iPad's screen in accordance to ambient light around the user, ensuring they see the color on their screen as close to accurately as possible. For example, the display might adjust the amount of orange you see to match using the device in a warmly-lit room, or use cooler colors when you take the device outside or somewhere with bright LED lighting. This feature works similarly to how Apple's Night Shift feature cuts out blue light to aid in getting a good night's sleep, though True Tone is primarily used by artists and photographers that need to know exactly how an image looks. Though still in the realm of speculation, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple continues to step up its display game in time for the iPhone 8. For example, we've seen other reports claim that the iPhone maker's next batch may also dabble with a flexible OLED screen. Strapped for space?

The paywall’d article cites three people briefed on the hiring as saying that Rajaraman will help shape Apple’s video strategy to take on established players like Amazon and Netflix. “Mr. Rajaraman will also be working on the look and feel of Apple Music, Spotify’s top rival, as well as on Apple’s other media products, including news and books,” reads the story. Sources believe he may also help the Siri team advance the personal assistant. Here’s an excerpt from the report: Apple executives have debated how to go forward in video. One idea that has been discussed is to bundle its music, news and book offerings with new video and cable services that could be activated via the iPhone and work on Internet-connected TVs. The executive will report to Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet software and Services who is also one of at least three people at Apple in charge of brokering deals with content owners. According to Rajaraman’s LinkedIn profile, he worked as YouTube’s Product Manager for eight years and at Spotify as Vice President of Product between 2014 and 2016. At YouTube, he helped cut content deals with Disney for streaming. “At different times, he ran every individual part of the YouTube team,” a former colleague told The Information. During his stint at Spotify, the executive was credited with striking content partnerships with Disney and other industry players like Time Warner and NBC. He also helped Spotify develop alternative content such as podcasts. Prior to joining YouTube in May 2010, Rajaraman worked as Twitter’s Senior Product Manager for a brief six months. In February 2017, Apple hired former Amazon Fire TV head and Netflix executive Timothy D. Twerdahl to head up its Apple TV business.

"Serial" is considered the first big radio hit in the history of podcasts, audio files that can be downloaded from the internet and listened to at any time. Put online in October 2014, it has been downloaded tens of millions of times. On Friday, it was still in second place in the list of the most downloaded podcasts on Apple's iTunes. "Serial" tells a true story over the course of a season in weekly chapters. The first season looked at a murder committed in 1999 in Baltimore and at the man convicted of the crime, Adnan Syed, who was sentenced to life imprisonment and insisted he was innocent. The investigation by the journalists of "Serial," from the creators of "This American Life," a weekly public radio show, turned up several troubling elements in the case. On that basis, a Baltimore judge ordered a retrial of Syed in June 2016. The success of "Serial" led to a second season, based on a true story on a totally different subject, that of a US soldier in Afghanistan. A third season is in the works, the producers say, without revealing the subject or release date. In the meantime, they launched an independent production company, Serial Productions, which created the new podcast "S-Town." Both "Serial" and "S-Town" are free to download. Put online Tuesday, "S-Town," which stands for the subject's nickname for the rural Alabama town of Woodstock where he lives -- Shittown -- is now at the top of the most downloaded podcasts in the United States on iTunes. According to Apple's iTunes Charts, it is also leading the charts in Australia, Britain, Canada and Germany. The central character in "S-Town" is John B. McLemore, a reclusive antique horologist who asked "This American Life" executive producer Brian Reed to investigate a potential murder in his town. The seven-episode podcast, which begins somewhat like "Serial" by looking into a murder, expands into a fresco of life in America's Deep South, hosted by Reed. Producer Julie Snyder explained that the team wanted to create a podcast with the feel of a novel, while "Serial" is more like a television show. "You can enter their specific world, and you don't know really know what it's about or where it's going," she told the website Wired. "But hopefully you're compelled to stay in it the whole time."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Google eclipses Apple as most valuable brand of 2017 Brand Finance has released its list of the 100 most valuable American brands, and there’s a new No. 1. Google has taken the top spot from Apple. It’s now considered not only the country’s most valuable brand, but the world’s, as well. The company held the top spot previously in 2011. Its brand value is pegged at $109 billion. Brands are assed on a variety of factors, including “what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand.” Part of Google’s rise to the top is the stagnation of Apple’s technological innovation and branding efforts. Brand Finance explains in a press release: 2017 has already delivered one major shock to the branding world: Apple has seen nearly $40 billion wiped off its brand value. Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers by failing to maintain its technological advantage and delivering tweaks to existing products rather than genuine innovation. Brand value has fallen 27% since early 2016 to $107 billion, meaning that for the first time in over five years, America (and the world) has a new most valuable brand. Other brands have been hit with negative public perception as consumers turn toward healthier eating choices, and reject fast food, soda and sugar. Brand Finance says: Coca-Cola’s brand value was $43.1bn in 2007, making it the most valuable brand in America and the wider world. Today, however, its brand value now stands at just $31.8bn, putting it 16th in the US and 27 th internationally. Increasing concerns over the links between carbonated drinks and obesity have begun to undermine what the Coca-Cola brand has represented for over one hundred years. Pepsi is similarly suffering, falling 4% to $18.3 billion. The same trend is evident in the fast food industry. The brand values of McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway and Domino’s have all fallen due to heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market, with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers.

Contact me at: apeck@thinkprogress.org | (202) 741–6363 Mar 31 The new podcast S-Town is here, it’s great, and it’s already over Binge culture crosses over from your television to your iPhone. Producer Julie Snyder and host Brian Reed of the new podcast S-Town. (Credit: Elise Bergerson/Serial Productions) Four thirty in the morning is a strange time to drop the series premiere of a hotly anticipated show. Stranger still, it was actually the season finale of the new podcast S-Town that appeared first in iTunes’ podcast store. Like antique clockwork, every 15 minutes until 6:00 a.m., another episode dropped — seven in all. In many ways, S-Town—the latest production from the dream team of audio storytellers behind This American Life and Serial—is an unusual, groundbreaking show. It was billed as a natural successor to the first season of Serial, the hit show many credit with launching the podcast renaissance we’re currently living in, but it’s better treated as more of a distant cousin. What starts off as a murder mystery very quickly transitions into something else entirely and, well, you should do yourself a favor and give it a listen. I am not here to talk about the narrative arc of S-Town, though. I want to talk about that strange 4:30 a.m. rollout. What gives? That question has a technical answer and a philosophical one. Despite the growing appetite for podcasts, Apple has managed to retain the largest share of podcast listeners by several orders of magnitude. By some estimates, more than 80 percent of podcast listeners listen on an iPhone, and of that group, more than three quarters use Apple’s built-in Podcasts app to manage their shows, despite an abundance of free (and better) alternatives. So when a new show debuts, it must be tailored with the technical demands of Apple’s Podcasts app in mind. It’s for this reason that Episode 7 of S-Town went live first: the app displays new episodes in reverse chronological order, so when people woke up Tuesday morning and opened their app, Episode 1 was at the top of their list of unplayed episodes, not Episode 7. That’s the technical solution, but it’s one necessitated by the philosophical choice made by the show’s producers: to drop the entire season all at once. For years, we’ve been binge-watching entire seasons of Orange is the New Black and Transparent over a single weekend, but S-Town might be the first instance of a podcast designed to be consumed over a period of days instead of months. “It was an aesthetic decision,” said Julie Snyder, one of S-Town’s producers. This American Life and Serial—Snyder is also a producer at both—adhere to the traditional weekly format, both out of necessity (This American Life is still a radio show, after all) and a desire to enhance the narrative. But S-Town felt different. “It didn’t feel like that did anything to make the story experience better,” she said. “This wasn’t that kind of story, it’s a little bit more of a ruminating novel. The world of it was very specific.” S-Town host and producer Brian Reed. (Credit: Sandy Honig/Serial Productions) Like its predecessor Serial, S-Town is a case study in investigative journalism. Producer and host Brian Reed spent years digging into a story sent in by a listener to This American Life, taking trips to the titular “Shit-town” in rural Alabama and speaking to dozens of people along the way. And like Serial, S-Town probes serious accusations and presents carefully constructed theories of its own. But unlike Serial, S-Town leaves little room for conversation, either within the show itself or on the periphery. Halfway through their first season, the makers of Serial found themselves fielding new information in real time, prompting them to tweak episodes they had been working on for months in a matter of days. With S-Town, revelations from episode one had no bearing on episode six. “That was one of the main considerations,” said Snyder. “In the story, there are a lot of accusations. If we were a weekly show, everybody has to go back to the people in the show for comment and it would disrupt the production schedule.” If Serial is the unfolding news story, S-Town is the full-length magazine feature. But when your subjects lose the ability to engage, so too does your audience. When the first season of Serial debuted, it quickly spawned an entire cottage industry of fan sites. Subreddits sprang up wholly dedicated to discussing and unraveling every episode. Adnan Syed’s guilt or innocence was the water cooler topic du jour in office parks around the country. There were even entire podcasts created solely to discuss the podcast. In other words, Serial’s success as a podcast manifested itself in much the same way a successful television drama does: by dominating the cultural conversation for months as listeners eagerly waited for the next episode to come out. The Complicated Ethics Of ‘Serial,’ The Most Popular Podcast Of All Time thinkprogress.org You can expect to hear and read a lot about S-Town and how great it is in the coming days. But what will its staying power be a week from now, when there’s nothing new waiting for you when you wake up on Tuesday morning? Binging is hardly a new phenomenon in television. Since Netflix began producing its own programming, audiences—particularly younger audiences—have grown accustomed to being able to watch three, four, or five episodes in a single sitting. “When people are allowed to consume what makes them happy, they have more enjoyment,” said Dr. Pamela Rutledge, the director of the Media Psychology Research Center. “I don’t need someone to tell me when I’m ready for the next chapter…We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of having our own agency and the ability to act.” Studies bear this out. Consulting firm Deloitte found that 70 percent of U.S consumers binge watch at least some television, and on average, binge watchers plow through five episodes in a single sitting. This shift hasn’t done away with traditional episodes, though. On Netflix, shows like House of Cards are still broken up into hour-long episodes. Even S-Town adheres to a traditional episodic format, with slight variations in length between episodes but all falling between 45 and 65 minutes. Why even bother with producing distinct episodes if people are choosing to consume media by binge-watching? Snyder likens it to the chapters of a book. It’s an apt comparison, and one that speaks to the way we’ve consumed stories since long before television, according to Dr. Rutledge. “An episode, like a chapter, has some psychological meaning,” she said. “You expect it to have some kind of resolution, some kind of rising action, some kind of conflict. Something is going on that makes sense in the course of the larger story.” Even if television networks wanted to mimic binging when releasing prestige shows—one can imagine AMC releasing an entire new season of The Walking Dead over a fall weekend, for example—there are business considerations that keep them from doing so. Networks are able to sell ads against their highest rated shows for months when a 22-episode season is spread out week to week. And although Netflix notoriously declines to release any viewership numbers for its content, it’s not hard to imagine a show steadily losing viewers from hour to hour as people get burnt out. Networks, on the other hand, can (and do) tweak their marketing to build audiences as a season progresses. But even when business concerns aren’t a factor, networks also have editorial concerns about the binging model. “We feel the best way to grow our audience is to embrace the viewer’s enthusiasm for weekly discussion around the virtual watercooler,” said Stephen Boulton-Wallace, the senior vice president of Consumer Insights & Analysis at HBO, the premium cable channel that doesn’t run ads. “This is especially true in our dramas. If you look at three of our most recent — The Night Of, Westworld and Big Little Lies — you can see social engagement around the shows grow as each progresses. That chatter then drives word of mouth. The results are more viewers visiting our various platforms to catch up on what they feel they’ve been missing. We don’t believe that would be happening at the same level if the all episodes were made available at once.” HBO’s Game of Thrones is another example. Like Serial, entire subcultures emerge around every new season of GOT, from podcasts to reaction videos to entire television shows about the television show. Compare that to Netflix’s equally well-received Stranger Things, which debuted last year. Try to think of one conversation you had between episodes of Stranger Things that didn’t involve either spoiling a later episode for someone else or having an episode spoiled. When everyone watches at his or her own pace, communal enjoyment becomes harder. Unless, of course, you treat it like a book. Dr. Rutledge is quick to point out that doling out new chapters in a story week-by-week on television (and radio drama before that) was itself a new phenomenon a century ago. “Episodic television was a disruption of an older model, which we refer to as the book,” she said. “When Dickins was first published, we were allowed to read Dickens all at once if we wanted to.” “There are still book clubs, there are still best sellers, reading clubs that get together,” Rutledge added. “I don’t see that community being deterred at all by the ability to control the media.” If anyone wants to form a podcast club for future seasons of S-Town, my contact information is at the top.

Apple hopes to celebrate the unique experiences of those on the Autistic spectrum with new classes at retail stores and with a dedicated App Store page. Starting off, Apple has created a new Autism acceptance page sharing some of the best electronic accessibility content in its stores. Apps like Proloquo4Text, Otsimo Child, and books like Uniquely Human are found here. Apple has even included a multitude of podcasts and iTunes U courses that dive deeper into what living with and around autism is like. Apple also updated its retail Field Trip landing page to include the Skoog music and sound cube. Field Trips at Apple retail are small classes tailor-made for K-12 students and teachers. The experiences help students learn what they can create using Apple products at the store during a 60 to 90 minute session. By including the Skoog, Apple has opened the in-store Field Trips to include those with disabilities in the music creation process. Last year during Autism Acceptance Month, Apple shared two videos following a young man named Dillan. In them, Apple showcased the immense impact accessibility products can have thanks to devices like the iPad.

Today Is The Last Day To Snag Discounted USB-C Adapters From Apple Thorin Klosowski Apr 1, 2017, 5:00am ⋅ Filed to:  cables dongles macbook macbook pro usb usb-c Share A little after Apple launched its new MacBook Pro, it also cut the price on its USB-C cables and adaptors since the switch to the new technology meant that most people needed to buy a goofy amount of dongles and converters. Today, that sale ends. All of Apple's own adaptors have been on sale since December. Third-party peripherals sold from Apple have been 25 per cent off as well. Here's everything you should grab from Apple today if you need them: Multiport adaptor with HDMI, USB and USB-C goes from $75 to $129 Multiport adaptor with VGA, USB, and USB-C goes from $75 to $129 USB-C to Lightning cable (1m) is currently $25 USB-C to Lightning cable (2m) is currently $45 USB-C to traditional USB adaptor goes from $12 to $29 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adaptor is currently $45 While plenty of other options for cables exist, Apple does make high quality stuff, and that's necessary for a lot of uses. If nothing else, it's probably worth snagging a couple of the USB-C to regular USB adaptors while they're just $12. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple Hires Former YouTube Executive Shiva Rajaraman Ken Manbert Salcedo International Business TimesMarch 31, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple has reportedly hired Shiva Rajaraman, a former executive at YouTube and Spotify. The employment of Rajaraman has sprung speculations on what exactly Apple is planning for its own original video content. The former YouTube and Spotify exec will be reporting directly to Apple’s SVP of internet software and services Eddy Cue, according to The Information. The report also reveals that Apple is still debating on which direction it wants to take its video efforts. One of the options that Apple is contemplating on is bundling music, books and news with its planned video and cable services. The mentioned video and cable services are also said to be activated through the iPhone and will work on “internet-connected TVs.” With Apple hiring Rajaraman, the tech giant might be looking into his expertise on the matter considering his career in online video. Rajaraman worked for YouTube for eight years and was in charge of securing licensing deals from various media companies. During his two-year stay at Spotify, he also did the same thing but for both videos and podcasts. It’s previously been reported that Apple has had a rough time securing licensing deals from major TV networks. This one of the main reasons why its planned live cable TV service, or Netflix-style streaming service, is taking a long time to actually launch. Apple’s hire of Rajaraman might make a difference. The tech giant’s music streaming service, Apple Music, has functioned as a portal where the company is able to show its original video content. So far, the company has officially announced “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke.” Rajaraman will also work on improving Apple Music’s video services as well. Sources have indicated that the newly hired official might be getting other projects. One of this is his possible involvement with Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, according to Apple Insider.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE ProBeat: Samsung bravely gives the Galaxy S8 a headphone jack Emil Protalinski@EPro March 31, 2017 10:30 AM Tags: Apple, galaxy s8, ProBeat, Samsung, Samsung Galaxy S8 Image Credit: Ken Yeung If Apple had “courage” last September to announce the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus without a headphone jack, then Samsung this week was brave to unveil the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ with a headphone jack. In short, Samsung didn’t copy Apple just for the sake of copying Apple. By removing the headphone jack, Samsung could have kept its phones the same thickness as Apple did or even shaved off a few precious millimeters. Instead, the company made the S8 and the S8+ slightly thicker than their predecessors. By removing the headphone jack, Samsung could have launched a line of wireless headphones and then sold them separately like Apple did. Instead, the company included $99 AKG by Harman earbuds in the box. By removing the headphone jack, Samsung could have told customers that wireless is the future, like Apple did. Instead, the company is apparently including a feature that allows streaming music to two headphones at once. Samsung wants to “overcome Apple” — but it’s not going to do it by making decisions that inconvenience its customers. Smartphones should shed the headphone jack when a superior alternative has emerged. Apple is showing that it believes the way to get users to embrace alternatives is by removing the original functionality. Samsung is showing it believes in offering alternatives alongside the original functionality and letting the best option win. Apple tells customers what they want. Samsung listens to customers and overdelivers. Nothing lasts forever, but there’s more than one way to usher in the future. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

So Apple enthusiasts should probably take a seat before they read the latest piece of gossip reverberating through the Apple rumour mill. EPA 3 Apple will probably release the iPhone 8 in September this year 3 An artist’s impression of the iPhone 8 Industry experts have claimed the iPhone 8 and the Samsung S8 will share one major thing in common: a cool “infinity screen”. The latest Samsung mobile features a OLED screen which wraps around the entire front of the gadget. Tech experts believe Apple is planning to roll out similar tech, raising the prospect that the iPhone 8 and Samsung S8 might be more similar than they have ever been before. Apple prides itself on the excellence of its engineering, with its phone routinely named the best in the world. AP:Associated Press 3 The new Samsung Galaxy S8, left, and Galaxy S8 Plus mobile phones are displayed in New York The Sun gets a first look at the brand new Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone But JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall fears Apple fans could be left disappointed if they buy the iPhone 8 after trying out the S8. "While Apple's new OLED form factor looks similar, current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less 'infinity' screen form factor," he said in a briefing note published by The Street. Of course, Apple is not likely to sit back and let it's arch-rival claim the limelight with its flash new screen. We won't know for sure what the iPhone 8 will look like when it's released, but that hasn't stopped a lot of rumours and gossip from doing the rounds. We pay for your stories!

The new ad is titled “Live Bright” and highlights using the Apple Watch to live an active and healthy lifestyle. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Throughout the ad, the Apple Watch is shown in a variety of different environments, including swimming, running, and even skydiving. The new ad also showcases features that can help improve a sedentary lifestyle, such as the Stand feature of the Activity app and the Breathe app. The new ad seems destined for TV with its 1 minute length. This is opposed to some of Apple’s recent ads that have been geared more towards social media, such as the iPad Pro’s Twitter-based ads. In the video’s description on YouTube, Apple touts that Apple Watch is the perfect companion for living a healthy life. Built-in GPS. Water resistance to 50 meters. A lightning-fast dual‑core processor. And a display that’s two times brighter than before. Full of features that help you stay active, motivated, and connected, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect partner for a healthy life. As for music, the ad is set to Beyoncé’s song Freedom, which features rapper Kendrick Lamar. Most of Apple’s ads for the Apple Watch have been fast-paced, each highlighting a specific feature or capability of the device. Today’s ad is more generic and focuses on integrating Apple Watch into all aspects of your life. Watch the new ad below and let us know what you think of it in the comments.

This includes the LG UltraFine 4K & 5K displays. The discounts were done to help ease customers into the transition to USB-C. Apple’s discounts end at the end of March, which means today, March 31, is the last day customers are able to take advantage of the offers before prices go back up. Today is the last day to purchase the UltraFine displays which are up to 25 percent off, giving customers a deep discount, especially on the 5K display. The 5K display costs $1,299.95 normally but has been discounted down to $974. Non-Apple endorsed USB-C accessories are also discounted, which includes hard drives, cables, adapters, and more. The deal was originally set to expire on December 31, 2016 but was extended until March 31, 2017 after extensive delays on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Apple could potentially extend the sale again but it’s best to make your USB-C purchases today as it’s unclear if Apple will ever make the sale again.

Cupertino City Originally Published By: It is the giant ring bigger than the Pentagon and is designed with the obsession with detail that is behind every iPhone — right down to the toilets. This is the building where Apple will create its next big thing. The Apple “Spaceship” that will soon be home to 12,000 employees is set to be the world’s next architectural icon. Four months before his death in 2011, Jobs’ final public event was not standing on a stage promising “one more thing” as he might have wished, but rather sitting at a desk putting the case for the new Apple campus to the Cupertino council in California. Jobs told the council of his vision for the building, alongside the 280 freeway, on the site of a former Hewlett-Packard headquarters. “We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,” he said with trademark hyperbole. “It’s a little like a spaceship landed.” Apple, in typical secretive fashion, has not put a price tag on the building’s construction, although estimates have ranged from $3 billion in 2011, all the way up to $5 billion, according to MacWorld.co.uk. Nicknamed the Spaceship during its construction, the 70-hectare site that opens to Apple employees next month has been formally named Apple Park. The exterior of the Apple Campus is made of huge pieces of curved glass.Cupertino City Its details are stunning at both ends of the scale, from the world’s largest panels of curved glass that make up the walls to the smallest details such as the design of the door handles that reportedly took 18 months of meetings to choose and involved measurements down to the nanometer. Reports of the brief to the building’s architects show how Jobs’ insistence on perfection in design has extended from Apple’s products to its headquarters. No seam, gap or paintbrush was allowed to show; every wall, floor and ceiling had to be highly polished and the wood used in fittings had to be a specific type of maple and only the wood from the heart of each tree was allowed to be used. The 3.7 miles of glass used on the exterior walls was bent and framed in Germany, using machines specially designed for this project, and then shipped over. The campus is more than just the iconic four-story-high ring of glass. It also has a stage from where Tim Cook will unveil the next iPhone in a 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theatre built under a man-made hill beneath a glass cylinder entrance that is a 20 feet high and 165 feet wide. Tim Cook discusses the Apple Campus in 2016.AP Apple’s fitness focus, which is evident in the Apple Watch, extends to the building, with a “wellness center,” reportedly costing nearly $100 million, able to cater to Apple’s 20,000 employees who work in Silicon Valley. The British architect firm Foster+Partners, who designed the building, also boast major projects including Wembley Stadium, London’s Millennium Bridge and New York’s Heart Tower. Foster+Partners chairman Norman Forster has said the inspiration for the design was a London square where houses surround a park, although Jobs’ appreciation of the Main Quad at Stanford is also cited as a reference point. The main building has a 17-megawatt solar rooftop, making it one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. It is also one of the world’s largest naturally ventilated buildings, designed to run for nine months of the year without heating or cooling. The site is 80 percent green space and has been planted with 7,000 native plants and fruit trees including 1,000 trees dug up on the original site and stored during construction.

According to Steven Aquino, a journalist who covers accessibility topics, Apple will offer field trips to retail stores that will host music events designed to include children with disabilities. Kids will be able to participate in the events using the Skoogmusic Skoog 2.0 Tactile Musical Interface, one of the many accessibility-oriented accessories Apple sells in its online store. Skoog is a tactile cube that lets children with disabilities control sound through touch. Along with special Apple Store events, Apple has created an Autism Acceptance App Store section that includes dozens of important accessibility apps organized into sections like Apps for Every Day, Apps for Learning, Books, Podcasts, and iTunes U courses. Some of the apps included are Proloquo2Go, :prose, Keeble Accessible Keyboard, Assistive Express, TouchChat HD, RocketKeys, and more. Accessibility has always been hugely important to Apple, and the company has aimed to make its devices accessible for everyone, with in-depth accessibility settings to meet a range of needs. Back in October, Apple launched a new Accessibility website that highlights accessibility features across all of its products.

I think this is a great idea overall. Rating: 6 Votes WarHeadz 11 hours ago at 01:31 pm I love that Apple is so socially active. Some people say they should just stick to business, but I disagree. Rating: 4 Votes brendu 13 hours ago at 10:44 am Interesting they call it autism acceptance when I've always heard of it as autism awareness month. As a special education teacher I like "autism acceptance" as much as awareness. Good for Apple for spreading the word. Rating: 3 Votes goonie4life9 8 hours ago at 04:14 pm FYI: Just so you know, autism is a genetic disorder, not a "mental handicap." I kind see article as a comparison as to what Apple did with the Apple Watch and having wheelchair measurement capabilities. Apple took in consideration that not everybody is mobile due to handicap restrictions and they went out a step further thinking though of those who were handicap with Apple Watch, with those who wanted to participate in physical activity. Same concept applies here with someone who is mentally handicapped, they're using technology to help those who don't have the ability some of us do to interact and learn. Rating: 1 Votes Cineplex 10 hours ago at 02:15 pm It's like you think we've never heard of or encountered Autism. Is this month for the people with Autism or for the people who buy a pin and lie to themselves that they are making a difference and actively helping people? Ya, I don't think this is for anyone but the do nothing do gooders who like to tell you how to think.

 Apple is opening fewer stores in Europe and focusing on China instead Julien Rath Mar. 31, 2017, 12:37 PM 707 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple is slowing down the rate at which it is opening stores in Europe in favour of new stores in China, according to a note from a UBS analyst. Apple has set the maximum of stores it is opening in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain at 20 per country, UBS suggested. According to the note, Apple is looking to grow in markets where iPhone penetration is low. France is the only country of the four to have reached 20 stores, all of which but one are in France's largest cities, which points to Apple's strategy to focus on metropolitan areas. UBS analyst Charles Boissier said in the note that "Apple has adopted a consistent strategy in other markets of relatively similar size." By limiting itself to 20 stores in large metropolitan areas, Apple is focusing on creating an immersive retail experience, where the physical space serve as a way to showcase products that can be purchased online, which is how Apple used its stores for the launch of the Apple Watch. Apple is increasingly positioning its stores as meeting places for customers, rather than just selling and services stores. France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are clearly under the 20 store limit. UBS Apple has seen difficulties with iPhone sales in China, where the company is rapidly losing market share. Opening new stores in the region would help it grow sales of its products. For the launch of its red iPhone in China, the company dropped the (Product)Red branding in an effort to avoid conflict with the Chinese government, according to Apple Insider.

An iPhone. That would not ordinarily be news, but given the security concerns about the risk of hack attacks on the prolific White House tweeter, the shift is significant. Cybersecurity specialists say Trump’s decision to transition from his Android device details of which were never disclosed but which was believed to be an unsecured, older-model Samsung is positive for security, but doesn’t eliminate risks from hackers. “I can guarantee the Russians and Chinese will try to figure out an attack,” said John Dickson, a former Air Force cybersecurity officer who now works for the Texas-based Denim Group consulting firm. ADVERTISEMENT White House social media chief Dan Scavino confirmed the smartphone shift this week, tweeting that Trump “has been using his new iPhone for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting!” Dickson said security will depend on how the president is using the device whether it is exclusively for tweeting and if it is plugged into an enterprise management system that can “wall off” vulnerabilities. “If it’s a single-purpose device, the risk is minimal,” he said. “But as soon as you start clicking on things, downloading apps, granting access, that’s when things matter tremendously.” Mobile devices can be hacked to allow an attacker to listen via the phone’s microphone, access its camera, monitor geolocation or even take over the handset remotely. Former US President Barack Obama carried a BlackBerry, and later a different smartphone, with security modifications that limited its functions. Trump’s switch comes despite his call for a boycott a year ago of the iPhone maker for refusing FBI requests to help hack a device for a probe into a deadly California attack. More secure?   Some analysts say Apple devices may offer more security because the company controls the hardware and software, and frequently updates its operating system. Apple did not respond to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) query on Trump’s decision. ADVERTISEMENT Betsy Cooper, executive director of the University of California’s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity said that despite Apple’s reputation, recent research has shown “that both iPhones and Android can be abused by hackers.” Cooper said it remains unclear how the president’s social media is managed, what devices are used and who has access to his personal @realDonaldTrump and official @POTUS handles on Twitter. From a security standpoint, “it would be better to eliminate the personal accounts and use only government devices and government-protected social media accounts,” Cooper said. Concerns of hacking come following Trump’s unverified allegation that his phones were tapped during last year’s election campaign, and after leaked documents from former contractor Edward Snowden showed US tapping of German leader Angela Merkel’s personal phone. Some phones are marketed as “hardened” or secure devices for people in power, but it wasn’t clear if these are used at the White House. Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the California-based International Computer Science Institute, said Trump’s phone swap “massively reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the security risks.” Phone as ‘honeypot’?   But while he agreed foreign governments are likely to try to hack the phone, Weaver said US intelligence services may have modified it to be “a nice honeypot to trap attempted attacks.” A honeypot is a technique used to lure hackers and attackers to identify them and find ways to neutralize or punish them. Weaver said in a blog post earlier this year that Trump’s use of an older Android device opened massive security risks and that “the working assumption should be that Trump’s phone is compromised by at least one probably multiple hostile foreign intelligence services.” At the time, it was not clear what type of handset Trump was using, but a New York Times report after the inauguration said he was using “his old, unsecured Android phone.” Last month, Rep. Ted Lieu of California called for an investigation, saying Trump’s phone use may be “jeopardizing national security.” Dickson said that even with strong security, the president could fall victim to an attack if he uses his phone for e-mail and web browsing. This could be in the form of “spearphishing,” or a message disguised to look as if it’s from a trusted aide or family member, but which contains malware. “This is what sophisticated attackers do,” Dickson said, and because the president’s activities are widely known, “he would be an easier target for spearphishing.”  —AFP play_circle_filled Duterte cusses at Inquirer, ABS-CBN for ‘slanted’ reports March 30, 2017 play_circle_filled Church’s secondhand shops fund youth scholars, livelihood March 30, 2017 play_circle_filled Alvarez admits having GF, says he's unfazed with disbarment threat March 30, 2017 play_circle_filled Duterte drops the ‘F bomb’ on EU anew March 30, 2017 TAGS: Cybersecurity, Dan Scavino, Donald Trump, hackers, security risk For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

Our Early Verdict The iPad 9.7 may not be the most innovative product Apple has ever created, but it looks to be a slight upgrade on the iPad Air 2 and make for a fantastic option at an even lower price than iPads of years past. For Cheaper price Beautiful 9.7-inch screen Against Thicker than the Air Only A9 chipset Innovating in the world of tablets is a difficult task right now, even for Apple. The iPad Pro brought about a new way of working and a variety of accessories to complement your 12.9-inch or smaller slate, but what if you don’t want those features? This new iPad is the device designed for you, with a premium spec, a great looking design and top of the range features, but at a lower price and without all the productivity extras. It’s much like the five star iPad Air 2 – the device it replaces in Apple's lineup – but there are a few key upgrades that make this an all round better tablet. iPad 9.7 price and release date Out now directly from Apple - other retailers to follow Cheaper than iPad Air 2 at $329/£339/AU$469 The new iPad is cheaper than the iPad Air 2 was when it was on sale through Apple’s website. That's notable as affordable Apple products are hard to come by, especially when the iPhone only seems to raise in cost with each passing generation. This new version of the iPad starts at $329/£339/AU$469 for the 32GB Wi-Fi model and goes all the way up to $559/£559/AU$799 if you want to get one with 128GB of storage and cellular connections. There’s no 256GB version of this latest iPad, so you’re going to have to choose between 32GB or 128GB. You can buy this directly from Apple right now and we expect to see other retailers start to stock the iPad in the coming weeks. Design and display Similar design to previous iPads, but still looks great Thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 If you’ve used an iPad Air 2, you’ll know what the design of the new iPad is like. This new version is a touch thicker than the Air 2, but that’s barely noticeable considering it’s still only 7.5mm thick, which makes it easy to hold in the hand. It’s only 469g, so if you plan to carry this device on your commute you should find it light enough to hold onto without any stress. You may want to use two hands though, as at 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm it’s not particularly easy to grip onto with only one hand. The back of the iPad has a metal body that feels smooth on your fingers but is still easy enough to grip. There’s no denying the iPad is still the best looking tablet you can buy, and the rounded corners makes this a gorgeous device to hold. We’d recommend buying a case to ensure it won’t get scratched when putting it in your bag though. When it comes to color choices, the new iPad is available in gold, silver or space grey. Sadly Apple hasn’t seen fit to include a new red version of the iPad to match the new brightly colored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Just below the screen on the new iPad there's a home button that features Touch ID, so you can keep all your data securely stored away behind a fingerprint lock. It’s not particularly easy to reach with your thumb though unless it’s lying down, so we’d usually just use a passcode instead. When it comes to the screen, the iPad has a 9.7-inch display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536. That gives you 264 pixels per inch, which is the same picture quality as either iPad Pro model. The picture on this iPad looks stunning, with a bright display also making everything we’ve watched look vibrant. This will be especially useful if you’re planning to watch a lot of movies on your new tablet. Specs Under the hood of the new iPad there's an upgraded chipset, but it’s not the top of the range offering we’d hoped to have from Apple. It features the A9 chip alongside the M9 coprocessor, which is the same setup as we saw on the iPhone 6S. That's not something you should worry too much about though, as from our limited testing we found the new iPad to be particularly snappy and everything loaded quickly. For connectivity, you have all the options such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that you’d hope for, but there’s also a cellular version available if you want to be able to stream video while on the move. The new iPad also runs iOS 10.2 software and is easily upgraded to the new iOS 10.3 software that launched a few days after the announcement.  We expect this to get some upgrades for the following few years as well and Apple is particularly skilled at getting new software onto all of its products at the same time, so you shouldn't be kept waiting for new versions of iOS. If you’re interested in the camera, know that there’s an 8MP shooter on the back and a 1.2MP front-facing sensor for video calling and selfies. We’ve yet to test out either, but we'll be sure to take a look in our upcoming full review. Battery is also an important aspect when it comes to your new tablet, but Apple doesn’t reveal the size of its cells so we don’t have much data on how long it can last just yet. Apple has claimed that it can last for up to 10 hours of video watching or web browsing over Wi-Fi though, which is the same claim it makes for the iPad Pro 9.7, so life is likely to be similar. In any case, you can be sure we’ll extensively test this for our full review. Early verdict You won’t want to buy this if you already own an iPad Air 2. It’s very similar to that five star tablet from 2015 and the upgrades here are minimal. But if you have an aging iPad or you’re looking to buy your first iOS tablet, this could be a great device for you to start off with. That reduced price is a big highlight of the new iPad and almost everything that made the iPad Air 2 such a winner is on offer here, plus an upgraded chipset. Be sure to check back for our full review of the iPad 9.7 very soon. What is a hands on review?

The note explains that the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 will all feature the True Tone technology, which was first introduced with the iPad Pro 9.7-inch. The report also offers new information regarding the 3D sensors that Apple is expected to include in the iPhone 8 for facial recognition and augmented reality features. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The note obtained by 9to5Mac was compiled by analysts Andrew Gardiner, Hiral Patel, Joseph Wolf, Blayne Curtis, and Mark Moskowitz. It claims that the new iPhones introduced this year will feature a “full spectral sensing” ambient light sensor, thus giving the devices the “True Color” display. Barclays expects that the ambient sensors will be supplied by Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS. It was widely expected that Apple would implement its True Tone technology into the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus display, but this turned out not to be the case, making it all the more likely that this could be the year. Apple first introduced its True Tone display technology with the iPad Pro 9.7-inch model last year, marking a point of differentiation between the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. At the time, Apple explained that this means the display automatically adjusts color temperature based on the room environment. We’ve noted in our time with the 9.7-nich iPad Pro that the True Tone display technology is very impressive. For instance, in a normal room with yellow-orange halogen light, an iPad Air 2 without the True Tone technology looked distinctively blue, whereas the 9.7-inch iPad Pro looked closer to a true white. This is because of how the True Tone ambient sensor is able to detect the lighting in a room and adjust the temperature color of the display to make it as natural as possible. One of the headlining features of the iPhone 8 is said to be its OLED display, but True Tone coming to all three of the new iPhones will give Apple the ability to market all three as featuring improved display technology. The combination, however, of OLED and True Tone should offer one of the best displays in a smartphone and is definitely something that will make the device standout from the competition. The report also builds on previous supply chain intel noting that Apple is expected to use 3D sensing technology for features such as facial recognition and augmented reality applications. Today’s note from Barclays adds that the device will include two custom 3D sensors with structured light cameras on both the front and back of the device. That’s a change, Barclays notes, from earlier speculation about how Apple will implement the new sensors: The key to Apple’s 3D sensing ambitions will, in our view, be two structured light cameras, one each on the front and back. This shift represents a change from our earlier assumption of a structured light camera on the front and advanced depth mapping Time-of-Flight sensor on the rear (for detail on the characteristics of such parts, please see the Appendix). We now think the 3D sensing for facial recognition (front) and augmented reality (rear) will be conducted via two custom modules, with ams/Heptagon providing significant content on the transmit side and STMicro on the receive side. Earlier this week a separate report from JP Morgan analysts noted iPhone 8’s OLED display will likely not be as curved and edge-to-edge as Samsung’s Galaxy S8 introduced earlier this week. That report also said to expect a higher overall ASP and a $1000 price tag on the OLED model, something that could help Apple control high demand and offset its BOM.

The research notes states that both Apple’s rumored all-new iPhone 8 model with an active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display and the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will each include a “full spectral sensing” ambient light sensor to support a “True Color” screen. The sensors are expected to be supplied by Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS. Here’s an excerpt from the note, compiled by Barclays analysts Andrew Gardiner, Hiral Patel, Joseph Wolf, Blayne Curtis and Mark Moskowitz: For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00. True Tone is all about achieving better contrast for reading. To combat situations when display contrast decreases as the light around you gets brighter, and vice versa, True Tone technology on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro uses four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in its environment. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro does not have a True Tone display, but its successor should adopt the technology. Apple says the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s screen offers 25 percent greater color saturation and deeper blacks than that found on iPad Air 2. iPhone 7 has adopted a wide color gamut display from iPad Pro, but not the True Tone technology. DisplayMate speculated that an iPhone with a True Tone display would improve screen performance and readability in high ambient light. “True Tone could be added if Apple upgrades the ambient light sensors so they measure color in addition to brightness,” said DisplayMate.

Currently, Apple’s True Tone display is only available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. True Tone displays can alter the appearance of the screen based on the lighting conditions. So when you’re in a room with yellow bulbs or outside in sunlight, your display will look different — and be easier on the eyes. True Tone is similar to Night Shift in some ways, but Night Shift is solely designed to limit the amount of blue light you take in during evening hours, not as a 24-hour solution. Barclays says True Tone will be available on all three of Apple’s iPhones, which it’s referring to as the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and iPhone 8. Hopefully that naming structure isn’t the case, or it’ll make for a very confusing fall.

Apple releases new colorful Apple Watch ad Posted 14 hours ago by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story The post office will now email you photos of your mail before it’s delivered Apple just released a new video ad on its YouTube channel for the Apple Watch Series 2. There are two interesting things about this ad. It’s a colorful, cheerful clip that wants to turn the Apple Watch into a pop culture symbol. And it focuses on the fitness features of the Apple Watch, proving that Apple thinks about the device as an activity tracking device first and foremost. Apple chose Beyoncé’s “Freedom” as the soundtrack. The ad shows many different Apple Watch users practicing their favorite sport in a world dominated by a single, bright color. Real life doesn’t really look like that, but I’ve got to say that it was a bit more convincing than a boring description of different practical Apple Watch use cases. A couple of shots show Apple’s quirky 3D emojis and the Apple Watch’s meditation feature. But the vast majority of the shots show Apple’s Workout app and activity rings. While I like those two features, I use the Apple Watch mostly for notifications and calendar apps. I hope it doesn’t mean that Apple wants to turn the Apple Watch into a Fitbit. Maybe it’s an easy selling point and works well for an ad, and that’s why Apple emphasizes those features. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Watch Description Apple's smart watch.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Apr 01, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple Pay wins against Aussie banks Bloomberg A man uses an iPhone 7 smartphone to demonstrate the mobile payment service Apple Pay at a cafe in Moscow on Oct. 3 last year. Photo: Reuters Apple Inc has prevented efforts by Australian banks to form a negotiating bloc over the introduction of Apple Pay, a win for the US technology giant in the global battle to control the future of mobile payments technology. In a final ruling released yesterday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that it was upholding its preliminary decision in December last year to refuse the banks permission to negotiate collectively. “The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets,” chairman Rod Sims said in a statement on the regulator’s Web site. The banks, which have invested in their own mobile technology in recent years, fear being shut out of the fast-growing Australian payments market and hoped to negotiate as a group to boost their bargaining power. Apple accused the banks — Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australia Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd — of attempting to “delay or even block” the introduction of the technology. The banks said they were “disappointed” by the ruling and would now individually review and determine their future strategy for mobile payments. “Apple has a stated desire to own the entire mobile wallet, and will use the beachhead into mobile wallets, afforded to them by complete control over mobile payments on iPhone, to exert control over the rest of the digital wallet,” the banks said in an e-mailed statement. Australians are the world’s biggest users of contactless payment technology, according to data from Visa Inc. In their submission to the regulator, the banks all pledged to participate in the roll-out of Apple Pay in Australia in return for being granted access to the iPhone’s near-field communications antenna — the technology that makes payments on contactless readers possible. Without this, Apple would have a “stranglehold on this strategically important future market,” they said. Apple’s technology bars any other app apart from its own from accessing the antenna’s functionality. In its submissions to the ACCC, Apple said this ensures the security of its customers and that it “will not modify its global approach” on the access issue in Australia. Apple is the worldwide leader in mobile in-store payments, although in the US it has been facing increasing competition. It has also been facing headwinds in China where local rivals Alipay (支付寶) and WeChat Pay (微信支付) dominate. This story has been viewed 1819 times. Comments will be moderated.

These include the new water resistance of Apple Watch Series 2, activity tracking, and the meditation reminders of Breathe. The new spot aligns with Apple's recent pivoting of the Apple Watch from a fashion accessory to a health and fitness tool. The ad also features the Beyoncé song "Freedom." Yesterday Apple shared another collection of Twitter-based iPad Pro commercials, in which the company references real Tweets complaining about technology to highlight various features of the iPad. The newest ads focused on the light weight of the iPad, the advantages it brings to students in school, and its all-day battery life.

Rating: 27 Votes Rickjames74 15 hours ago at 09:32 am I think this is rad. The constant shadowing of the characters reminds me of the old iPod commercials. Rating: 12 Votes profets 14 hours ago at 09:56 am great commercial - if i was a misinformed shopper i'd buy an apple watch for working out. But we all know there are far more accurate GPS options with longer battery life and tracking of sports metrics - Garmin, SUUNTO, Polar, etc. I workout almost daily. Variety of strength training, running, cycling and swimming. I've used my Apple Watch through multiple long distance runs and triathlons. The Apple Watch is an excellent option that will only get better. Eventually all these dedicated fitness watches will go the way of standalone GPS devices. [doublepost=1490979413][/doublepost] I remember when Apple ads used to be about........wait for it..............................computers. I mean, technically the Watch is a computer. And when you think about the internals and what they've managed to build in terms of an actual computer in that tiny device, it's pretty remarkable.

Here’s how Apple describes Theater Mode: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. SiriKit was announced alongside iOS 10 originally, and is now available on the AppleWatch. SiriKit is an API that allows developers to integrate Siri into their applications. This means users can ask their Apple Watch, “Send $100 to Josh using PayPal,” for example.

He will reportedly help refine the company’s video strategy for Apple Music. Shiva Rajaraman joins Apple to focus Apple Music’s video efforts Insider sources speaking with The Information said Rajaraman will report directly to senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue. One of his objectives is to bring clarity to Apple’s content efforts. Apparently Apple hasn’t been able to settle on exactly what it wants in the video space and has been considering making content packages that include video, music, books, and news that stream to internet-connected televisions. That idea hasn’t gone very far, it seems, because so far Apple’s executive team hasn’t been able to come to a consensus. Presumably Rajaraman will be able to help with that, and possibly score new content deals, too. Prior to joining Apple, he spent eight years landing content licensing deals for YouTube and later he did the same for Spotify. Rajaraman isn’t the only recent high profile hire for Apple. The company hired Timothy Twerdahl to head up Apple TV marketing so Pete Distad can focus on landing content deals. Prior to joining Apple, Twerdahl was Amazon’s Fire TV director and general manager for four years, and before that he held senior positions at Netflix and Roku. Apple TV is no doubt part of Apple’s broader content plan, so it’s no surprise to see the the company bringing seasoned experts on board to help shape that. And with Rajaraman on the job, odds are we’ll see Apple Music content deals that go beyond Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke.

Apple's discount is set to expire at the end of March, meaning today, March 31, is the last day to make a purchase before prices go back up. At the current time, all accessories and LG displays are discounted by upwards of 25 percent, which is a major price drop. On the 5K LG UltraFine Display, for example, that cuts the regular $1,299.95 price down to $974. For the 4K display, the price drops from $699.95 to $524. All of Apple's own USB-C accessories are available at a discount through the end of the day, with prices listed below: - USB-C to USB Adapter - Was $19, now $9 - Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter - Was $49, now $29 - USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter - Was $69, now $49 - USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter - Was $69, now $49 - USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) - Was $25, now $19 - USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m) - Was $35, now $29 Non-Apple USB-C accessories are also discounted, with price drops on hard drives, SSDs, adapter cables, and more. Apple's sale was originally set to expire on December 31, 2016, but after availability issues with the 5K LG UltraFine Display, it was extended until March 31, 2017. Apple could potentially extend the sale again, but it's best to make purchases now if you've been holding off on getting a monitor or a new USB-C accessory. Related Roundups: Displays, Apple Deals [ 62 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) bitfactory 15 hours ago at 09:11 am Almost pulled the trigger on the monitor, but the reviews have been so 'meh' (even after the shielding fix) - that I can't bring myself to do it. When Apple left the display business, a little part of me died. Rating: 18 Votes nwcs 15 hours ago at 09:25 am I'll be curious to see if Apple does raise the price as significantly as that. Regardless of how it came about that the price went down it's now seen as "the price" by most. So going back up that much for a 4-6 month old product may not pan out. Rating: 10 Votes konqerror 14 hours ago at 09:49 am Apple's displays are made by LG. The panel is made by LG. But there's a lot more to a display than the panel, like the housing, video electronics, power supply, USB, microphone, speakers and webcam pieces. We all saw how LG screwed up the video electronics here. Rating: 6 Votes WinstonRumfoord 15 hours ago at 09:19 am They discounted it because it is ugly, and conflicts with Apple's traditionally not-ugly designs.. Simple as that. Rating: 4 Votes JMacHack 14 hours ago at 10:19 am Even at discounted priced they're still more expensive than competition adapters. Way to go Tim. Rating: 3 Votes cityboy-100 14 hours ago at 09:41 am My 5k display has such buggy software. It never recognizes my keyboard after waking from sleep. The speakers are also terribly set up. It's barely worth the $9xx it cost, I don't see how anyone could pay $1300 for one; at that point just get an iMac. Rating: 3 Votes konqerror 9 hours ago at 02:43 pm Right, and Apple offering a $1k display with USB 2.0 speeds in 2016 is ok as long as it looks "pretty".

Joke of the year lol Rating: 2 Votes cityboy-100 14 hours ago at 09:51 am 4K and 5K are old news when 8K is now available for 8K photography and RED video. I'm assuming sarcasm here, but just to be clear: There's almost no (no?) end-user hardware to display 8k. A 8K desktop monitor would be superfluous because 5K is already too dense for eyes to resolve individual pixels on a 27" display, about the largest desirable desktop monitor size. Someone close to me has an 8K RED and we both know it's primarily useful as an interstitial format in media production or for commercial projection, but I don't see how it's that valuable as a resolution for consumer hardware. There aren't even any standard cable protocols for 8k signals that I know of: DisplayPort 1.3 can't even handle 5k@60Hz@30bpp in one stream and DP 1.4 doesn't boost the max bandwidth per stream.

Huawei, founded by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei three decades ago, has emerged as one of China’s most recognizable consumer brands. A relatively new entrant in mobile devices, it’s rapidly grabbed market share from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with premium phones and is now ranked third globally. But that expansion comes at a cost, as the company boosts spending to keep up.  Its main business of networking equipment is also slowing as phone carriers rein in network rollouts and prepare for the advent of faster 5G standards. And smartphone competition at home from the likes of Oppo is intensifying. Net income inched 0.4 percent higher to 37.1 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in 2016, the Shenzhen, China-based company said on Friday. That was its slowest pace of growth since a profit decline in 2011. Its net margin dipped to 7.1 percent, from about 9.3 percent the previous year. Going forward, that level of profitability is “appropriate,” said Eric Xu, the current rotating chief executive. Huawei said Friday it spent 14.6 percent of its 2016 revenue on R&D and will set aside $10 billion to $20 billion annually for that purpose as it ramps up research into everything from artificial intelligence and wireless technology to cloud computing. But it’s also begun keeping a closer eye on the bottom line. Xu pledged in December to cut extravagant marketing events and warned against “blind optimism and rhetoric.” Mounting expenses would damage efficiency and profitability, he said in a memo to staff. “We’re paying more attention to efficiency and scaling back on investments that cannot bring value,” Xu, who under the current rotation will cede the helm on Friday, told reporters after releasing its annual report in Shenzhen.  © Bloomberg News BC-HUAWEI-EARNINGS-SLOW-1 The company blamed a rapidly expanding consumer business for weighing on margins. Revenue grew 32 percent to 521.6 billion yuan, said Huawei, a closely held company that discloses only basic finances. That was a tad ahead of its own expectations. But the consumer division outstripped that pace, growing revenue 44 percent to 179.8 billion yuan by shipping 139 million smartphones in 2016. Huawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones. About 56 percent of its sales came from the telecoms-carrier business last year, down from about 60 percent in 2015 and about two-thirds in 2014, according to previous reports. It’s declared its intention of becoming the world’s largest smartphone player within half a decade and Huawei is said to be aiming for $33 billion in 2017 revenue for its consumer electronics business, which include smartphones, tablets and wearables. But that business is under assault at home. It lost its top position in China’s smartphone market last year to Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co., which attacked rural areas and lower-tier cities. And Vivo ranked just behind Huawei domestically in the December quarter, according to IDC. While Huawei has voiced ambitions to expand abroad, it remains heavily reliant on its home market. China contributed 45 percent or 236.5 billion yuan of revenue last year compared with 42 percent in 2015. A little over half of its smartphones were shipped within the domestic market in the quarter ended December, according to data from research firm IDC. Deputy Chairman Guo Ping will now become CEO after Xu’s 6-month tenure ends Friday. Guo, 51, started as a project manager at Huawei nearly 30 years ago and once headed the smartphone business. Huawei employs a unique rotating-CEO mechanism after Ren excused himself from daily operations more than five years ago. Ken Hu, who used to lead information security and U.S. businesses, is the other executive in the rotation. He’s expected to take up the role after Guo’s term ends around September. 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 Revenue (bln yuan) 521.6 395.0 288.2 239.0 220.2 203.9 Rev. growth 32% 37% 20.5% 8.5% 7.9% 11.7% Net income 37.1 36.9 27.9 21.0 15.6 11.7 Net growth 0.4% 32.5% 32.7% 34.4% 34.1% -52.8%   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Latest posts by Thomas Wellburn (see all) Apple iPhone 8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8 - 16:33, 31 Mar 2017 Samsung Bixby Faces Tough Battle For AI Supremacy - 15:27, 30 Mar 2017 Samsung DeX is Another Constrained Mobile Experience - 11:52, 30 Mar 2017 Now that the Samsung Galaxy S8 has been announced, all eyes are on the Apple iPhone 8 and what Tim Cooks team will bring to the table. With the Samsung Galaxy S8 so well received by critics, the pressure is on for Apple to really ramp things up with the iPhone 8. Rumours are rife about a bunch of technology to be implemented in Apple’s upcoming device which, if true, will amount to a very impressive device indeed. The Design Apple is expected to debut a device that follows very closely to what we’ve seen in the Samsung Galaxy S8. This means a near-bezeless display which stretches to the edges of the device and no physical home button. It’s still unclear whether Apple is expected to keep this on the front or move it to the rear, however the company is reportedly working on a technology that will embed the button into the panel itself. The sensor is expected to be ultrasonic, which would be a big jump over previous technologies. Currently, only the Xiaomi Mi5s carries such a feature. Ultrasonic fingerprint readers are able to handle wet and greasy hands much better, meaning unlocking your handset in the rain or after some dirty fast food will be greatly improved.

According to Japanese website Mac Otakara, the iPhone 8 will come in two variants. The standard iPhone 8 will carry and aluminium and glass finish, while the more expensive “iPhone Edition” will incorporate ceramic materials. Much like current Apple devices, the product will be as minimal as possible, with “few visual interruptions to its sleek design”. A Revolutionary Camera The Samsung Galaxy S8 has played it pretty safe with the camera, confirming a sensor but not much else. During the Unpacked event on Wednesday, the company quickly brushed over any mention of the camera, leading many to believe that the S8 will not feature a dramatic improvement in imaging technology over the Galaxy S7. Apple on the other hand are rumoured to be investing a lot of time into the iPhone 8 camera, with mention of a vertical arrangement and revolutionary “3D sensing” technology. This news was initially broke by International Business Times, who quoted a report from renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo. He went on to say that the production of a redesigned 3D camera sensor is “expected to begin in September”, which coincides very nicely for the Apple conference in October. The Little Things Samsung has done a fantastic job of cramming in several less-important features that all add up to a comprehensive package. Bluetooth 5.0, IP68 waterproofing and wireless charging are all catered for here. Apple on the other hand has always chosen to keep the iPhone rather light, even removing the headphone jack on the most recent 7. It’s suggested that the iPhone 8 will go against history and include wireless charging plus an OLED panel. The latter would greatly improve battery life and allow Apple to implement an always-on display. There’s also talk that the iPhone 8 could jump Samsung and include IP69 waterproofing, which is essentially the highest rating you can get. Related Post  OnePlus 2 fingerprint sensor will be 'twice as fast as any iPhone' Reception There’s no doubt about the fact that Samsung are back on track with the Galaxy S8. Earlier this year, South Korean news site The Investor cited that the company expects to ship 60 million combined units. Samsung has also gone on record to state that the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will surpass the previous generation, though they’re hardly going to say the opposite. On the other hand, iPhone 8 are expected to be equally huge. Morgan Stanley analyst Kate Huberty has gone on record to say that unit sales will rise by 20% in 2018, purely because of the iPhone 8 launch. This is a big jump after the record low experienced in early 2016. Naming Conventions The truth is, nobody knows if this elusive “iPhone Edition” even exists. Nor do we know if it will be a feature-packed super phone that aims to piss all over the competition. Rumours in this area have been so congested that it’s easy to get lost in a bucket full of names and monikers. What we do know is this. Apple will likely launch a iPhone 7s variant first that is more on a par with the current Galaxy S8. It’s anticipated that some of the features expected to debut in the iPhone 8 will also be included on the 7s, such as a 3D camera sensor. We can assume this due to the rumours citing that production will begin in September. Price The Samsung Galaxy S8 has seen a small price hike over the S7, with US launch prices quoted at between $720 and $750 (UK TBA). It’s fair to say that if the iPhone 8 undergoes a radical design change from previous versions, the price will also rise here. The standard iPhone 8 isn’t expected to increase by much, while the “iPhone Edition” could cost over $1,000. If they also release a Plus model, expect to be paying a lot of money. More From Us...

You can edit the name, description and geolocation of all your photos and be assured that your original photo will remain intact as the app uses a copy for all edits. To claim your free copy of Panols, get the official Apple Store app on App Store. Launch the Apple Store app, tap the Discover tab at the bottom and scroll halfway down until you spot the Panols offer underneath the Featured App heading. Tap “Download now for free” and you’ll see the screen with basic information about Panols. Tap the blue Download now for free button at the bottom. A prompt pulls up, asking if you’d like to finish redeeming your gift inside the App Store app. Tap Continue, then hit Redeem in the upper-left corner of the item’s App Store page. Once you’ve successfully redeemed your code, tap Done. With Panols, you can split any photo from your photo library into three squares to post into Instagram. With the ability to see metadata information, you can edit and organize your photos with tags, descriptions and titles. The app accurately splits your panoramic photos into three separate shots that fit Instagram’s standard three-across display view. And with non-destructive editing, edits to photos sync with your Photos library without effecting the original. Here’s a scrollable panorama I posted to Instagram using Panols.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Google Beats Apple As Most Valuable Brand In The United States Posted: Mar 31 2017, 9:57am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Mar 31 2017, 10:47am CDT, in News | Latest Science News   Google leaves Apple Behind in being Best Brand in the United States   It seems that Google has left Apple far behind in the popularity stakes. It has snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by being the best brand in the United States. According to a novel ranking system, Google has achieved the rare feat of being the best brand in all of America. This grand-daddy of search engines beat several other brands to become the top cat. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! Such brands which were left biting the dust include Apple and Amazon. Google delivered far more bang for the buck than these other brands. This was tabulated by a firm named Brand Finance.   Google happens to be worth its weight in gold. It has assets amounting to $109 billion which is indeed a whopping sum of cold hard cash. This company has become an ever-present reality in today’s computerized society. The very word “Google” is linked with search engine basics. It has become a virtual household word and is on everyone’s lips from the four year old child to the eighty year old grandparent. Google’s advertising branch rakes in some very lucrative profits each year.  Apple which had held the top position since the past half a decade or so, took a dive and is now worth $107 billion. So it is two billion dollars behind Google in the race for the information technology bonanza that we find ourselves in today. Last year, Apple was worth $146 billion. However, it has let its reputation slip and so is now behind Google on the road to progress. Apple’s recent blunders concerning the exploitation of its clientele led to the dismal result. Rather than live up to the reputation of its genius founder, the late and great Steve Jobs, Apple has only managed to fine-tune its erstwhile products a little in recent times. This left a bitter aftertaste among its main customers who thus decided to pursue fresher pastures.    Amazon meanwhile has the third position after Google and Apple. Its net value stands at $106 billion, according to Fortune.com. It has made a quantum leap of 53% over its profitability last year. Next year, Amazon may well overtake Apple to become the #2 brand in America. The top 500 brands in the US are worth a total amount in cash that clocks in at $3 trillion. This represents an overall increase since last year by 11%. Some of the other conglomerates that count in the economic pie besides Google, Apple and Amazon are: AT&T, Microsoft, Verizon, Walmart, Facebook, Wells Fargo and, last but not least, that symbol of fast food with its Golden Arches, McDonald’s.   This story may contain affiliate links.

The aim of this is to enable budding developers to create more apps for Apples platforms. In this program, Apple experts will lead briefings and provide one-to-one app reviews for developers building apps for iOS, watchOS and tvOS platforms. The facility will also provide support and guidance on Swift, Apples new programming language for these platforms. Apple Technology Evangelists will be providing specialized briefings for over 500 developers every week and also offer detailed app analysis and feedback as they work on their apps. Speaking of the new program, Phil Schiller, Apples senior vice president of World Marketing said, We are impressed by the great entrepreneurial spirit in India, and are excited to provide a platform for these developers to share their innovations with customers around the world. In just the first few weeks, weve already seen some incredible developers here at the App Accelerator Bengaluru, including Practo and Reliance Games, create innovative apps that can meet the needs of customers in India and around the world. The App Accelerator Bengaluru is free to attend.

Which found in tests of 67 laptops that Apple was the only manufacturer to deliver greater than promised, while other manufacturers delivered as little as half the claimed life. As with the previous report, though, I’m struggling to understand the stated results … NordVPN Which says that a 13-inch MacBook Pro delivered 12 hours of battery life against the claimed 10 hours. Unhelpfully, the organization doesn’t specify which specific model this relates to, stating only that the results apply to laptops tested since January 2016. This means that it could be the old Retina model, the 2016 model without Touch Bar or the 2016 model with Touch Bar. The result isn’t as crazy as those from Consumer Reports, and the testing regime does sound reasonable. We test laptops for battery life while actively browsing the web over wi-fi, running the laptop in this fashion until the battery is fully drained […] Each laptop we judge goes through our battery tests at least three times. We […] drain the whole battery from start to finish, several times over, during various tasks. One test involves watching films until the battery finally shuts down, another continually browsing websites over wi-fi. But neither I nor any of the colleagues at 9to5Mac I asked are seeing anything like this with our 2016 models. If I shut down unwanted apps and run at four notches below maximum brightness, I typically see 6-7 hours. If I keep all my usual apps open, and run at my standard brightness of two notches below maximum, that falls to 4-5 hours. In a poll we ran back in December, the largest group of readers were seeing five hours or less from their new machines. I honestly cannot understand how either organization is seeing greater than 10 hours unless they are setting the screen brightness crazily low. But for what it’s worth, the laptops with the most misleading battery life claims were these: Lenovo Yoga 510: Claimed battery life: 5 hours, Which? tests: 2 hours, 7 minutes HP Pavilion 14-al115n:  Claimed battery life: 9 hours, Which? tests: 4 hours 25 minutes Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Claimed battery life: 7 hours, Which? tests: 3 hours 58 minutes Acer E15  Claimed battery life: 6 hours, Which? tests: 2 hours 56 minutes Since it’s been a while since that first poll, and readers will now have a lot more experience with their machines, we’re running a fresh poll to get updated figures.

Read on for the iPad Pro 2's likely release date, specs, new features, design & UK price rumours. by David Price | 31 Mar 17 The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer until we see it announced. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and equipped with a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the new iPad Pro 2 for 2017, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models for 2017, including the recent suggestion of an iPad Pro 2 with an 120Hz display, along with our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. You might be reading an outdated version of this story - Click here to read the latest version of this article. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK When will the iPad Pro 2 come out? "Reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors claimed that Apple would announce new products in late March 2017, with the most likely dates between 20 and 24 March. While the source was partly correct, as Apple did introduce a new iPad along with a new iPhone 7 colour option and a host of other changes, the iPad Pro 2 was absent. So, when should we expect the second-generation iPad Pro? DigiTimes quotes "Taiwan-based supply chain makers" who say production of the planned 10.5-inch iPad has been brought forward to March (from a previously planned May-June schedule) and will be unveiled at an event in early April. This event will mark the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus, the site says. (Apple has announced that Apple Park will open in April 2017, although work on the headquarters will continue for some time afterwards.)  During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until later in 2017. However, DigiTimes believes Apple will delay the release date of some 2017 iPads: namely the new 10.5in iPad, which we go into detail about below, and the iPad Pro 2. The site claimed that Apple would announce a cheaper 9.7in iPad to replace the iPad Air 2 at an event in March (which ended up being true). However, while the new 9.7in iPad will ship fairly soon after the announcement, sources claim the iPad Pro 2 and 10.5in iPad won't be released until May or June. Time will tell, and we'll keep you in the loop. One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Both theories have downsides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch iPad Pro together) in Spring 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours Will Apple launch a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro? The latest rumours suggest that after the lack of an iPad Pro update in autumn 2016, Apple will make up for this in 2017 by launching an entirely new size of iPad. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch regular iPad and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three other iPads, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus means Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. Ming-Chi Kuo has reiterated his prediction in a January 2017 report, once again claiming that new iPad models for Q2 2017 will be 12.9-inch, 10-10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch.  He notes that the 12.9-inch model will be "the second generation of the existing 12.9" iPad Pro," that the new in-between size will be "the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design," and that the 9.7-inch model will be "the low-priced option." The first two will run on a new A10X chip, with the latter on an A9 chip. With that in mind, it looks like the likeliest outcome would be for the 12.9-inch model to be a new iPad Pro 2, the 10-10.5-inch model to be a smaller Pro, and the lower-price 9.7-inch model simply branded as the iPad. Once again, there was no mention of a successor to the 7.9-inch mini, adding fuel to the speculation that it will be phased out by Apple - unless it plans to stick the 'mini' name on the 9.7-inch model. Kuo also notes that while he expects another decline in the volume of iPads shipped in 2017 - down to 35-37 million - this is set to be a smaller decline than seen in 2016, and will be offset by a rise in the average selling price of the devices, leading him to conclude that the "worst has passed for Apple's iPad." Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. What design changes will we see in the iPad Pro 2? Let's talk next about the iPad Pro 2's design. Apple Pencil changes Mac Observer has reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. This rumour was backed up in January 2017, when a report by the Czech-language website LetemSvetemApplem also claimed that magnets will enable you to attach the Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pro 2, citing "information directly from suppliers in China". The site also predicts that the next Apple Pencil will have a clip on the side, like a pen, which would stop it from rolling away across the nearest table - and also mean you can clip it to your pocket. Read more: Apple Pencil 2 rumours Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working exclusively on tablets presently seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. 'Touch Bar' menu bar An odd but increasingly widespread rumour proposes that the iPhone 8 will feature a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Now the rumour has mutated - apparently the iPad Pro 2 is going to get a Touch Bar function area too! It's not an immediately compelling concept, given that the Touch Bar on the MacBook offers a mini touchscreen strip between the non-touch-sensitive main screen and non-customisable keyboard - a sort of overlap between the two - so you don't need to reach up to use a full touchscreen and get tired arms, but on iPhone/iPad there's no such compromise to be made. The entire screen is accessible, and this would appear to be a reduction in functionality compared to a full-chassis conventional touchscreen. The thinking seems to be that this will take the place of the Home button and lower bezel area of the iPad, replacing these with a customisable touch-sensitive area that will ordinarily be occupied by frequently used menus and icons. What isn't clear is whether this area will be accessible when viewing photos and videos full screen. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. What tech specs will the iPad Pro 2 include? Let's look next at the internal changes expected from the next iPad. Display In addition to the possible design changes mentioned above, a recent update to Apple's Xcode software hints that Apple's next-generation iPad Pro may feature an upgraded 120Hz display. For reference, existing models of iPhone and iPad max out at 60Hz. The higher the refresh rate, the more frames the display can process every second: a 60Hz display can process up to 60 frames per second, while a 120Hz display can offer double the amount at 120 frames per second. It's why some PC gamers opt for a 144Hz display. In terms of the iPad, a higher refresh rate would provide a smoother experience when playing graphically intense games or when using accessories like the Apple Pencil.  Discussing the find on Reddit, user Jakouf noticed that the FPS counter maximum had increased from 60 to 120fps following the Xcode 8.3 update.  “When only having one View where I will render into it, the normal 0-60 FPS Counter comes up,” Jakouf explained on Reddit. “When having multiple views which will be rendered by OpenGLES at the same time, the counter switches to the 0-120 Counter.” Of course, it doesn't confirm anything at this point, but it begs the question as to why Apple would upgrade the Xcode FPS counter if a 120Hz display-enabled iOS device wasn't on its way. Processor This is an easy one. We strongly expect the iPad Pro 2 to include a modified version of the A10 Fusion chip featured in the iPhone 7 - a strategy Apple usually follows with the iPad it releases shortly after a new iPhone. This modified processor will probably be called the A10X, or A10X Fusion. The Chinese-language site Anzhuo agrees, predicting "iPad Pro 2 will be equipped with A10X chip". RAM The iPad Pro came with 2GB of RAM (in the case of the 9.7-inch model) or 4GB (on the 12.90-inch version). We're fairly sure Apple will offer 4GB across the iPad Pro 2 range, but some believe it might be more generous. Anzhuo, in the same article linked above, thinks we can expect 4GB and 6GB options - matched presumably to the medium and large-screen models, although the site doesn't specify this. Leaked photos, videos and concept illustrations of the iPad Pro 2 This is where we will post the best and most convincing leaked photos and concept designs and videos created by artists and designers. Still from iPad Pro 2 concept video Concept video of iPad Pro 2 We'll start with this stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro 2 in all its (imagined) glory. The iPad depicted here has a 10.5-inch, 4K screen and a dual-lens rear-facing camera, and comes in six colours: adding white, purple ('wine'), and the black and Jet Black options from the iPhone 7 to the currently available gold and Rose Gold. Photos of iPad Pro 2 AppleInsider has published two photos ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, which were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article.

The news comes in as Apple Pay rollout in the country has been slow due to disagreements between the banks and Apple. Due to anti-cartel laws, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are required to negotiate with Apple individually as apposed to a group. This makes sure that competition is fair and there’s no monopoly. ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement that there are more cons than benefits for negotiating with Apple as a group: “The ACCC is not satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits would be outweighed by detriments.” The ACCC’s decision is a good one, however. Hopefully this is the end of the battle and Australian banks can simply move forward and start allowing Apple Pay within the country.

Announced in May 2016, the Apple-SAP partnership aims to help reinvent business processes and workflows. The SDK lets developers build native iOS apps in Swift, Apple’s modern programming language, and integrate them with SAP’s Cloud Platform. For the uninitiated, SAP is a German business software maker that writes enterprise software for managing business operations and customer relations. The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS lets developers build, extend and run iOS apps, powered by the SAP Cloud Platform and enterprise backend data. There are more than 2.5 million developers in the SAP community. A whopping 76 percent of business transactions touch an SAP system. Apple highlights these benefits: Seamlessly connect to back-end processes—With the SDK, developers can easily take advantage of a company’s aggregated data held in the SAP Cloud Platform and enterprise systems. The apps can also tap into the services and functions defined in the SAP Cloud Platform, and include specific business and security rules to protect sensitive data. Take advantage of native iOS technology—As one of the key building blocks of the SDK, developers can access native iOS frameworks and technologies to build incredible apps. This means that apps can take advantage of the latest interface technologies and built-in sensors to provide the context and experience that users expect. An SDK built on Swift—The SDK is built on Apple’s powerful and open source programming language, Swift. This means that when you’re working in Swift, you can seamlessly call into the SDK and leverage it’s frameworks, UI elements, and APIs. And everything will look and feel the way it should, making the developer experience as natural as accessing native iOS APIs. The toolkit also comes with a Mac-based app, Assistant, that helps you easily set up projects and connect to the SAP Cloud Platform. Tap into a design language developed by SAP for iOS—SAP created the new Fiori for iOS design language to bring together business user needs and the principles of iOS design using Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. The SDK will include UI elements for the new design language, including reusable controls, UI patterns, templates, and access to back-end services. This will help developers quickly tap into reusable design components to build a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps. The training and support you need—Apple and SAP have partnered to provide resources to help you get started. The SAP Academy for iOS is designed to help developers learn about connecting to SAP systems, leverage the SAP Fiori for iOS design language, and take advantage of iOS design and development best practices. You can register for the SAP Academy for iOS on Apple’s website. SAP is currently building native iPhone and iPad apps for industries ranging from manufacturing to retail, designed to transform core work processes. The first of these, called SAP Project Companion, is planned for release today. Find more information at developer.apple.com/sap or visit SAP’s developer website.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday April 1, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Big banks trumped by bigger Apple Elizabeth Knight 31 Mar 2017, 11:30 p.m. Australia's largest banks versus Apple; there's no contest. Australia's largest banks versus Apple; there's no contest. Apple was always going to be a winner. It is certainly a strange twist that, even if three of our large banks had been allowed to band together to negotiate, they would still have been the David rather than the Goliath. They had sought, but on Friday failed, to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to allow them to collectively deal with Apple in an attempt to get access to iPhones' near-field communication controller - which is akin to its internal antenna. As far as Apple is concerned, this is its proprietary stuff and the world's biggest company has never been one for sharing. It hasn't let any other bank around the world into this tent and it's frankly fairly strange that the Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank, Westpac (plus a couple of smaller banks) thought that, even together, they could muscle in. In essence, the ACCC thought a deal between the banks and Apple would be anti-competitive. This is not to say that the banks can't sign up for Apple Pay. They can and ANZ already has. They key difference is that ANZ has paid Apple to allow its cards to be used via the Apple Pay app. In other words, ANZ's card is allowed to communicate with Apple's app and enable the phone to operate as a tap-and-go payment mechanism. The other banks were seeking access to the Apple's antenna inside the iPhone so they could use their own bank apps and their own digital wallets on the iPhone - which is not surprising given they have spent billions developing them. In this case, the iPhone would just become a conduit. And, as importantly, Apple Pay is more expensive because it takes a fee on all transactions it is used for. Unlike Apple, Google's Android phones offer open access and allow banks' proprietary apps but Australians are big iPhone users so there is plenty of pressure from customers who want to use their iPhone instead of carrying around plastic in their wallets. The question is whether the banks without Apple Pay will have no choice but to go back to the negotiating table. It's a fair bet that the answer will be yes.

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage Ford Just Hired 400 Blackberry (???) Employees (????) Michael BallabanYesterday 10:21am Filed to: The Morning Shift TMS Ford Blackberry 280 3 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo credit: Getty Images Good morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift, your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know. Advertisement 1st Gear: Blackberry, Still A Thing Long, long ago, before you were born, before anyone was alive, there was a company called “Blackberry.” Blackberry was a victim of the Phone Wars, and it was utterly crushed by the belligerents Apple and Google, its once fruitful crops plowed asunder, its hopes and dreams turned to ashes in its mouth. So it switched from making phones to making software. Advertisement Part of that move involved making automotive software for Ford, which happened way back in 2014, but now Ford is building that partnership by hiring 400 Blackberry employees wholesale, according to Bloomberg: Ford Motor Co. agreed to hire 400 employees from BlackBerry Ltd. to help develop wireless technology at the automaker, deepening an ongoing partnership between the two companies involving in-car connectivity. The shift doubles the number of connected-car engineers at Ford and will help the U.S. company build its own wireless products in-house, said BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney. At the same time, it helps the Canadian tech company pare costs as it completes a shift to selling software instead of phones. “The move enables us to focus all our resources on the new strategy,” McKinney said.﻿ This is silly. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are fine. Google and Apple won the war. Just give it to them. Every car infotainment system is bad anyway. Stop trying to do it all in-house, car companies. Just give up. Embrace the sweet release of automotive software death. It’s easier on everyone this way. Sponsored 2nd Gear: Ford CEO Got A 19 Percent Raise How much of a raise did you get this year? Was it 19 percent? Were you already making more than $18 million? No? Weird. You must not be the Ford CEO. Huh. Too bad, says Automotive News: Advertisement His total compensation was $22.1 million, up from the $18.6 million he made in 2015, according to the company’s annual shareholder proxy statement, released Friday. That includes a $1,787,500 base salary, a $2,736,000 million cash bonus and $14,298,356 worth of long-term stock and performance-based equity awards, making the value of the compensation awarded to Fields during the year — excluding changes in pension value and other costs — $18.8 million, up 8.4 percent from the prior year.﻿ Two million of Mark Fields’ new dollars are due to a rise in the value of his pension, which Ford doesn’t really control. But Ford does control the use of Fields’ private jet, on which it spent almost $300,000. For the record, Jalopnik barely spent half that on its own private jet this year. We’ll be filing a union complaint. Advertisement 3rd Gear: The Problem With Dividing GM Shares Okay, this gets a little wonky, but bear with me. A little while back, a hedge fund guy named David Einhorn proposed separating GM stock into two classes of shares in a scheme designed to boost the company’s stock price. The thinking behind it, so it would seem, is that it would allow for two types of investors. One type of investor would be looking for short-term profits and dividends, and the other type would be in it for the long haul. Everyone would win, depending on what type of investor you are. Right? Right? Advertisement Advertisement Not so fast, Reuters says, because there’s an inherent conflict of interest there: One obstacle cited by legal and financial advisers is the probable conflict it presents for GM’s directors, who under Delaware law are required to be loyal to all shareholders. That could get tricky under Einhorn’s plan as directors would oversee two classes of stock that each have voting powers but competing ambitions for use of company capital. For instance, directors would have to square voting to raise quarterly payouts, which would exclusively benefit the dividend stock holders, versus allocating more toward capital expenditures or stock repurchases, which would benefit the growth stock camp. “It puts the board in an odd position,” said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware corporate governance professor who also sits on the board of restaurant chain Bob Evans Farms Inc (BOBE.O). “Do you plow money back into the business, or buy back the stock? You end up penalizing at least one of the stock holders. It gets messy.”﻿ Legally speaking, GM’s executives have to act in the interest of all shareholders at all times, as any company’s executives must do. This plan would create the opposite of that. Also, it’s a little weird that Einhorn would want to do it with GM, of all companies, since car companies by their very nature need to operate on relatively vast corporate timescales. Cars take a long while to develop, is what I’m saying. Advertisement GM rejected Einhorn’s proposal, but he still says he’s going to fight for it. 4th Gear: Aston Martin’s Going To Do Some Financial Re-Tooling This is a bit of a nutty concept in today’s day and age, but Aston Martin is still a (relatively) independent small car company. The number of high-end automakers that can claim that sort of independence can nominally be counted out before you run out of fingers. To stay in business, it needs to do some work with its debt, Bloomberg says: Advertisement Advertisement The U.K. luxury auto maker needs to refinance almost $600 million in debt coming due next year and is seeking to replace it with 530 million pounds in new dollar and sterling-denominated bonds. At stake is the next step of a revamp of the product range to revive sales and the company has burned cash every year since 2008, according to research firm CreditSights. Aston Martin has funded this with repeated capital raising, including a 200 million pound issue of preference shares in 2015, and the debt it’s seeking to replace — 304 million pounds of secured notes issued in 2011 and a 2014 issue of payment-in-kind notes on which $219 million is outstanding.﻿ If everything goes smoothly – which it probably will – Aston will be just fine. You’ll get your DBX. If you can afford it. 5th Gear: Change At Volkswagen Will Be Hard Advertisement Dieselgate was the result of a number of factors at Volkswagen, ranging from profits to egos to who-the-hell-knows-what, but one of those factors was the corporate culture. And in a company as vast as VW is, changing that culture will be hard, Reuters reports: VW is hamstrung by the different interests of its stakeholders - which include a powerful role for trade unions - and a lack of new leaders, he added. CEO Matthias Mueller has been with VW for nearly four decades and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch was previously its long-term finance chief. [Volkswagen head of HR Karlheinz] Blessing said VW wanted to put an end to managers shifting accountability to others and would ensure the best qualified people were handed responsibilities - something that might not always have been the case under a top-down management style.﻿ I, for one, support full radical anarchic democracy at Volkswagen. TRULY A PEOPLE’S CAR. Reverse: TIL Knute Rockne Had A Car Named After Him Advertisement Advertisement On this day in 1931, Knute Rockne, the legendary Notre Dame football coach and namesake of the Studebaker Rockne line of autos, is killed in a plane crash near Bazaar, Kansas, at the age of 43.﻿ Neutral: Can’t Infotainment Systems Be Easier? At this point, I’m wondering why Ford or GM or Honda or BMW or whomever doesn’t just go to Google or Apple or whomever and be like “screw it, you wanna just do the whole infotainment system? Not just the phone stuff, the whole shebang. We’ll pay you money. It’s fine.” Advertisement I suspect it has something to do with pride.

Bloomberg reports that Apple stands with “many of America’s biggest corporations” such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart in standing by their earlier promises to address climate change issues, including switching to clean energy sources and renewable energy supplies. Following an order signed by President Trump earlier this week essentially reversing Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Apple issued a joint statement along with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, expressing support for the original policies We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. Apple’s continued commitment to the spirit of the Clean Power Plan comes as little surprise as the company has long set goals to become a clean energy company globally, issuing supplier environmental responsibility reports annually, and having reached a point where over 93 percent of its operations worldwide are already powered by renewable energy, and in fact 100 percent renewable energy being used in 23 countries, including the United States, as well as working to dramatically reduce its carbon footprint through more efficient manufacturing processes.

Brown Norm Rothery Jason Heath Barry Choi Home Investing When investing, copy what works When investing, copy what works Jared Ali is making up for lost time with his TFSA. Here’s how   3 by Julie Cazzin March 28th, 2017 Online only.   3 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Jared Ali AGE: 38 PLACE: Calgary TFSA TOTAL: $91,753.63 STRATEGY: Warren Buffet’s classic value style Me and my TFSA Jared Ali, a graphic designer in Calgary, is the first to admit he started investing in his TFSA rather late—2011 to be exact. That’s when his dad let him in on the great tax benefits of investing in a TFSA. “I didn’t understand its value as an investment vehicle for quite a while,” says Ali. “I had been investing in RRSPs for years but once my dad explained the tax benefits of TFSAs—that money invested in them can grow tax-free for life—I realized it was a no-brainer and opened one right away.” Ten TFSA questions answered » Right now, Jared has a self-directed TFSA worth an impressive $91,753.63 and for the last six years he’s had one strategy: copy Warren Buffett. “I wanted to find things that were undervalued and follow Buffett’s classic value style of investing. It’s worked for me as I’ve almost doubled my money in six years.” In fact, Jared invests by one of Buffett’s most popular mottos: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.” But Jared also likes the fact that Buffett favours investing in what he understands. “I remember this one particular story where Buffett was at a a Dairy Queen with his grandkids. Of course, everyone eats Dairy Queen ice-cream so he invested in the company. He also saw his grandkids and their friends with Apple iPhones so he invested in Apple. I think what I like best is the the way he takes into account the emotions of the consumer. That intrigues me.” Sign up for our Investing newsletter » Following Buffett’s lead, Jared’s himself bought Apple shares—10 to be exact—in April 2012 for $590 each, adjusted for the exchange rate and trading fees. He bought more Apple shares in 2013 and 2014, raising his position to 30 shares. (After a 7-for-1 stock split on June 2014 he held 210 shares). In October of that same year, he sold 105 shares for US$105, netting $12,215 total when converted back to Canadian dollars. “I still have 105 Apple shares in my TFSA today and plan to hold those indefinitely,” he says.

Click here to email us » For the last couple of years, Jared has focused his stock buying on what he believes to be undervalued oil and gas stocks. “I started buying Crescent Point Energy, Talisman Energy (before it was bought out by Repsol SA in early 2015) and Calfrac Well Services when oil was trading at around US$45 a barrel and dollar cost averaged several share purchases. I still hold shares in Calfrac and Crescent Point today,” he says. Why your TFSA needs a successor holder » He also bought 125 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company, last summer for US$60 a share after Opdivo, a promising cancer drug, failed in a key study as the company attempted to extend it’s usage for lung cancer patients. “It immediately fell US$10 a share after that announcement and I immediately bought 125 shares,” says Jared. “I invested US$7,509 at that time and it’s worth about the same today.” His last major holding is 138 shares in Icahn Enterprises, an American conglomerate. “It’s a multi-limited partnership and has a dividend yield of over 11%,” says Jared. Jared’s dream with his TFSA? “To buy a Ferrari. If I get my TFSA to $1 million, my wife may allow me to that. She’s the responsible one in the family, but I think I have a lot more fun.” JARED’S TFSA HOLDINGS CANADIAN HOLDINGS VALUE Calfrac Well Services $9,575.00 Crescent Point Energy $25,353.60 TD Investment Savings Account $17,449.00 Cash $34.19 Sub-total $52,411.79 U.S. HOLDINGS VALUE Apple $14,677.95 Bristol Myers Squibb 7,147.50 Icahn Enterprise 7,657.62 Cash 546.58 Sub-total $30,029.65 Total Portfolio Value* $91,753.63 * U.S. stock values were converted into Canadian dollars (exchange rate $1.31) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (3) 3 comments on “When investing, copy what works” love this story, thank you for sharing his exact holdings! and the tfsa room calculator is great, haven’t seen one before! Reply ↓ Amy on March 29, 2017 at 8:38 am Check the return on apple over the last 5 years and it doesn’t even beat the s&p500…basically ties it (without being compensated for having a lot more risk ) Disappointing the article doesn’t mention the main reason why his TFSA is so high is because the CAD dollar dropped badly since 2012. (approx 33% currency boost gain + rising US stock market) For example, HXS, s&p500 in CAD including dividends, is up 144% over the last 5 years. Seems lucky he didn’t get burned with such lack of diversification. Alpha doesn’t come by believing in “Warren Buffett” , but his name does attract people to read. Reply ↓ Jungle on March 29, 2017 at 9:40 pm Hi Jungle, you’re absolutely correct that I did benefit from a devaluation of the CAD dollar, that was also a calculated move under the (correct) inference that the Canadian Dollar would not stay at or above parity forever. With respect to the “lack of diversification” that you mention, while correct for the time being, takes into account only the current holdings in the account… and not several of the others which were not disclosed to the author of the piece but still contributed to the gains, including FEN, LULU, RAD, POT, AMD and ERF. Although you don’t appear to be a fan of quotes from other successful businesspeople/investors, I’ll share one more with you… “Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket”, from Andrew Carnegie. To that end, I’m not sure if you’ve been following the Great TFSA Race that MoneySense ran for the last couple years, but, if you had, you may have noticed that many of the other featured (and, far more successful investors) had achieved their success through the purchase of a SINGLE OTC stock or other extremely speculative investments… See below for links to those articles, for your reference. http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/1st-place-rick-maureen-1m/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/2nd-place-shafik-262000/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/3rd-place-philippe-100021/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/the-great-tfsa-race-penny-stock-investor/ Best of luck with growing your TFSA!

There for a chat with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford to talk about his finalist in the BBC singing competition, he distracted the presenters with his decision to wear a hat, sunglasses and earphones during the interview. It turned out his earphones were a clever product placement for his tech line with Apple, called Buttons.  The 42-year-old explained: 'I have phone calls, it's so don't have to take my phone out.'  However, viewers were left unimpressed by his blatant plugging, branding him 'shameless' and 'rude' Will.i.am sparked a flurry of complaints when he appeared during a television interview on This Morning wearing sunglasses, a hat and earphones Will told Eamonn and Ruth that his earphones were part of his tech range with Apple, called Buttons Viewers were left unimpressed and fumed at his 'rude' behaviour but Will defended himself saying he was 'sleepy' Even Eamonn was left baffled over his guests unusual decision to cover his eyes for the interview.  But the Black Eyed Peas singer defended himself, saying: 'If you're wondering why I have sunglasses on it's because I have sleepy eyes.'

Share this article Share Ruth questioned whether he would actually answer any phone calls while on air, but Will snapped back: 'You guys have in-ears right?'  'I have a similar situation. This is my product, you buy them at Apple stores and they have AI in them.' The Voice judge and mentor was on This Morning to talk about his finalist Michelle John but the majority of the interview focused on what Will was wearing Ruth responded by laughing: 'We have very irritating people in our ears all the time.' With a little direction from Eammon, Will eventually went on to discuss Michelle John, who he has been mentoring through The Voice. It's not the first time the singer has been criticised for being overly focused on technology while on air.  Will didn't seem too bothered about the fuss he had created, instead going on to talk about The Voice and an encounter he had previously with Eamonn and Ruth During the first live show of this series of The Voice, he was seen with his iPhone out, pointing it at the stage (and himself), live streaming the show on Instagram. The Black Eyed Peas musician seemed to be distracted by his own broadcasting efforts, taking a long time to answer host Emma Willis' questions and appearing to be a little vacant. This even led to Emma asking him what he was doing. 'Will, are you broadcasting us, broadcasting you?' she asked him, to which he replied: 'I'm broadcasting you, broadcasting'.     This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am Share or comment on this article e-mail 114 shares Most watched News videos Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack CCTV captures milkman killing tuk-tuk driver with a BRICK Most adorable kitties get treats when they ring their bells Tourists abuse hotel staff after kids get trapped in lift Jaw-dropping moment a great white shark catches a seal 'Boxing champion' driver threatens dad on dual carriageway Maid hangs from window before dramatically falling seven floors Oddly satisfying deep cleaning of a very dirty car seat Entrepreneur flies impressive Iron Man-like flight suit Gran starts heated debate with anti-Brexit campaigners Trump exits oval office without signing executive orders on trade Dashcam of Police chasing after suspected Stourbridge stabber Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer...

ComputerCare has been an authorized service provider for Apple's range of iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and more since 2008, and first earned the prestigious Premium Service Provider title in 2016 after meeting Apple's strict standards for exceptional customer experience and repair support. ComputerCare is one of only ten Premium Service Providers currently in California. "Only the highest performing Apple Authorized Service Providers are awarded the Premium Service Provider title," said Georgia Rittenberg, President of ComputerCare. "Over the past year our skilled technicians have consistently delivered exceptional repair services to all of our clients. We are thrilled and honored to once again be recognized by Apple for our continued commitment to technical support and customer care." In 2016 ComputerCare successfully launched a same-day iPhone display repair service in the Bay Area that now repairs hundreds of iPhones every month. In addition to the company's roster of corporate clients, a growing proportion of ComputerCare's business is being driven by a recently launched Apple Support app that allows consumers to make a repair appointment directly with a nearby Authorized Service Provider instead of waiting for help at a Genius Bar. Being the only Premium Service Provider in the Santa Clara area, ComputerCare appears at the top of that list. In addition to being an Apple Premium Service Provider, ComputerCare is also a Premier Authorized Service Provider for Lenovo and is certified to provide warranty service and repair for Toshiba and HP devices. ComputerCare handles all repairs from start to finish, eliminating the need for IT departments to rely on manufacturer support, phone troubleshooting, coordination of shipments to depot, and store appointments. About ComputerCare Founded in 2004, ComputerCare offers warranty and non-warranty hardware repairs for the world's leading technology companies, including Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba and HP. The company also provides a variety of managed services tailored to the needs of small businesses up to enterprise level accounts, delivering specialized hardware support to supplement or manage any IT needs. With a free pick-up and delivery service for business clients' device repairs, and completely free repair services for warranty products, ComputerCare promises exceptional convenience, cost savings and turn-around times.

The Bakery Bar in downtown Orlando is a must if you enjoy desserts and cocktails. The difference with this bar is that the dessert is the cocktail. From the Crème Brulee Cake Martini (my favorite) to the Apple Pie Old Fashioned (this drink has that wonderful cinnamon flavor and an apple slice garnishes the glass rather than a cherry), it is the perfect place to go to after dinner at a local restaurant or to satisfy a sweet tooth after a show at the Dr. Phillips Center or the Amway-both within walking distance. The Bakery Bar opened last January to great reviews and is owned by Adam Zaintz, son of Richard and Alison Zaintz formerly of Oviedo, and his girlfriend, Victoria Tanzi. Located at 41 W. Church St., it is down an ally between Church and Pine and up one flight. A totally family affair, Zaintz and Tanzi got the idea for this bar from a similar place in Savannah after a trip there with his parents. Tanzi's mom, Wendy Tanzi, former manager of The Club at Firestone, runs the bar because both Zaintz and Tanzi have full-time jobs-Zaintz, a graduate of Oviedo High School is an online car salesman and Tanzi, a graduate of Hagerty High, is the assistant general manager of Burberry at Premier Outlets. The tastefully delicious drinks are the creation of mixologist Amanda Dixon, best friends with Tanzi since kindergarten. She broke down what made each flavor using various liquors and then figured out the right portions. Tanzi and Dixon learned bartending under the guidance of Wendy while working at Firestone. In addition to the cocktails, The Bakery Bar also serves craft beers-again, all sweet, like Orange Blossom Pilsner, Wells Banana Bread and Terapin Liquid Bliss. I'm not a beer drinker, but I think I'd try the Terapin as it is chocolate peanut butter beer! All of the beers are known bottled brands. Amanda Dixon mixing a signature cocktail. And if you only want a taste of sweet, there are the candy bar shots. The Snickers shot is the most requested, but there is also Butterfingers, Twix and other popular candies. These are like the small desserts offered at various upscale restaurants-just enough to satisfy the sugar craving. And you have to lick the rim! The atmosphere is relaxed chic with cow-print covered tub chairs arranged for conversation as well as a few high tables. The walls are simply decorated with kitchen items and the two televisions are tuned in to the food network. It really is the perfect place to relax, talk with friends without shouting over loud music and enjoy a scrumptious cocktail. The Bakery Bar is open from 6 p.m.-1 a.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. Happy hour is from 6 p.m.-8 p.m. Wednesdays through Fridays with $3 off signature cocktails and $3 craft beers. For more information about The Bakery Bar, visit their site on Facebook.

Apple releases iOS 10.3 as well as macOS, watchOS and tvOS updates Posted Mar 27, 2017 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Android creator Andy Rubin teases first look at Essential’s bezel-less smartphone It’s patch day at Apple. The company just released four new versions of its four operating systems for all its devices — iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2. Some of those updates are more important than others. Let’s start with iOS 10.3. The new version adds Find My AirPods, and we already covered what you can expect from the new feature. You can see them on a map if they’re connected to an iOS device or you can play an alarm if you have an AirPod hidden below a stack of magazines. And if they’re not around, you can see the last location when your phone was connected to your AirPods. With iOS 10.3, Apple is rethinking ratings in the App Store with native review prompts and the ability to reply for developers. iOS 10.3 also adds a couple of new Siri features, such as cricket sports scores. There also are various improvements, such as a thread view in Mail and dynamic app icons. Finally, Apple is secretly updating all iOS devices to APFS, a new file system. This should be completely transparent for the user, but it’s a major change as this new file system has been designed from the ground up to work with mobile, always-on devices with flash storage. In watchOS 3.2, Apple is finally updating Siri to let you use Siri with third-party apps, just like on your phone. For instance, you could order a Lyft or call someone using WhatsApp from your Apple Watch. There’s also a new Theater Mode button so that the screen remains dark in a movie theater. On macOS, Apple is bringing Night Shift. Just like f.lux, it favors warmer colors at night. This should allegedly improve your sleep. Real-time collaboration in iWork on macOS and iOS is out of beta. tvOS 10.2 doesn’t add much except the ability to rent a movie on an Apple device and watch it on another, such as your Apple TV.

Bengaluru is the home of India’s startup scene. The populous country has some of the most vibrant and entrepreneurial iOS development communities in the world. Apple also published useful resources at developer.apple.com/accelerator, including information pertaining to local iOS development scene. Announced in May 2016, Apple conceived the App Accelerator as a way of lending official support to local engineering talent and accelerate growth in India’s iOS developer community, which counts tens of thousands of iOS programmers. Indian developers have already created nearly 100,000 apps for App Store worldwide. Attending the App Accelerator is free. To register, developers must sign in to the schedule page with their Apple ID associated with their Apple developer account. ”The App Accelerator will help you fast-track your apps so you can become part of this thriving app economy,” writes the Cupertino firm. Apple has teams of engineers in India tasked with instructing developers on best practices regarding iOS development, with weekly briefings providing one-on-one app reviews for developers, support and guidance on Apple’s Swift programming language, app frameworks, interface design and more.

And a flyover of the mothership has revealed the finishing touches being given to the massive $5 billion (£4 billion) Campus 2 site. The incredible drone video footage shows that, while there is still work to be done, an amazing amount of progress has been made at the California complex. Scroll down for video An amazing amount of progress has been made at the California complex which will become Apple's new high tech headquarters. A new drone flyover has revealed the finishing touches being given to the site (pictured) A GREEN SPACESHIP  Apple Park replaces 5 million-square-feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, and is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.  With 17 megawatts of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world.  It is also the site of the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. Officially now called 'Apple Park', staff will begin moving into the new Cupertino campus next month - with office chairs and tables now visible inside some the site's buildings. The process of moving more than 12,000 people will take over six months, and the new footage shows staircases have now been installed at the base of the main building to provide staff with access. Construction of the buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the summer, with preparation work for a pond and evidence of landscaping all visible in the footage. Apple previously revealed that a new theater on the site - expected to be used for the firm's product launches, possibly beginning with the 10th anniversary iPhone in September - will be called the Steve Jobs theater.  Before his death in 2011, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs - who would have turned 62 on Friday, February 24 - set out to create one of the most futuristic buildings ever created. 'Steve was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness,' said Laurene Powell Jobs, speaking earlier this year.

Before his death in 2011, he set out to create one of the most futuristic buildings ever created  A new 1,000-seat auditorium is being named in his honor. The Steve Jobs Theater (pictured) is situated on one of the highest points within Apple Park, overlooking meadows and the main building. It is expected to open some time this summer 'It was his favourite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well.'  'He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.'  To 'honour his memory and his enduring influence on Apple and the world', the theater at Apple Park will be named the Steve Jobs Theater, Apple has said.  Opening later this year, the entrance to the 1,000-seat auditorium is a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fibre roof.  The Steve Jobs Theater is situated on top of a hill — one of the highest points within Apple Park — overlooking meadows and the main building. Apple Park will also include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees, secure research and development facilities  The new drone footage shows construction is very nearly complete on a number of these buildings. Once completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees The firm's fanatical attention to detail is seen throughout the footage. That includes this parking garage (pictured), which features solar panels on the roof 'Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us.  'He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.  'The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment. We've achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.' The campus' ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass, and the firm's fanatical attention to detail is seen throughout. Apple said it will take six months to move all 12,000 staff into the $5 billion (£4 billion) 2.8 million-square-foot campus, and construction work will continue over the summer more videos 1 2 3 Watch video VR headset helps ostrich take flight in Samsung #DoWhatYouCant ad Watch video The Panther transformer drone that can maneuver in air and land Watch video Dutch company invents remarkable dog poo detecting drone Watch video Bugatti reveals its first bicycle to partner Chiron supercar Watch video Badgering on!: Footage captures Badger burying a COW carcass Watch video NASA tests robots that can drill through and collect ice Watch video SpaceX SES-10 makes history by launching recovered Falcon 9 rocket Watch video Hands on with the new eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S8 Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner completes first flight Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner assembly Watch video Tourists abuse hotel staff after kids get trapped in lift Watch video 911 call: Man tells police he's shot two intruders with an AR-15 'Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments, said Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer. 'We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterise our products.' 'Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together.  'We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.' The Steve Jobs Theater is situated on top of a hill. Opening later this year, the entrance to the 1,000-seat auditorium is a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fibre roof The campus' ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass Apple Park will also include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees, secure research and development facilities. The parklands offer two miles of walking and running paths for employees, plus an orchard, meadow and pond within the ring's interior grounds.    Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded.  With 17 megawatts of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. It is also the site of the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project.   More than $1 billion (£800 million) was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley.  KEY FEATURES OF APPLE'S SPACESHIP-LIKE CAMPUS 2 Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Bugatti reveals its first bicycle to partner Chiron supercar Watch video VR headset helps ostrich take flight in Samsung #DoWhatYouCant ad Watch video Dutch company invents remarkable dog poo detecting drone Watch video The Panther transformer drone that can maneuver in air and land Watch video Badgering on!: Footage captures Badger burying a COW carcass Watch video NASA tests robots that can drill through and collect ice Watch video SpaceX SES-10 makes history by launching recovered Falcon 9 rocket Watch video Hands on with the new eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S8 Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner completes first flight Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner assembly Watch video Thug appears to threaten a mother in angry rant at a restaurant Watch video President Trump rearranges items on a table Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies.  The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.  The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut'.

When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description.  The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees.  Apple acquired the campus from Hewlett-Packard, although little remains except an original century-old barn. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages The new campus will be located at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, which is part of the world-renowned Silicon Valley. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics.

'With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,' he said. 'You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.'   The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product Drone footage taken above the site reveals the vast extent of the construction, with hundreds, if not thousands of lorries and diggers involved Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms.  Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products.  The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But Mr de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example Architects working on the building say that many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Much of the construction time has been spent in placing small tiles along the walls of one of the access tunnels 'They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,' Mr de la Torre said. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies Technology companies have long favoured generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. Pictured left is Apple's current Cupertino campus Covering 175 acres, Apple's 'Campus 2' headquarters will replace its current offices at 1 Infinite Loop (pictured) 'The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple,' the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm.  'We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before,' the former construction manager said.  Signage also required a delicate balancing act, as Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency.     more videos 1 2 3 Watch video The Panther transformer drone that can maneuver in air and land Watch video VR headset helps ostrich take flight in Samsung #DoWhatYouCant ad Watch video Bugatti reveals its first bicycle to partner Chiron supercar Watch video Badgering on!: Footage captures Badger burying a COW carcass Watch video NASA tests robots that can drill through and collect ice Watch video SpaceX SES-10 makes history by launching recovered Falcon 9 rocket Watch video Hands on with the new eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S8 Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner completes first flight Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner assembly Watch video Dutch company invents remarkable dog poo detecting drone Watch video Thug appears to threaten a mother in angry rant at a restaurant Watch video President Trump rearranges items on a table This image is an artist's impression of what the Apple Campus 2 will look like from above when its complete.

It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design (pictured). The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff. Pictured are artist's impressions During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light (pictured). Pictured is an artist's impression The cafeteria will additionally feature an outside dining and picnic area (pictured).

The Silicon Valley giant has released the system, which offers a host of new features, to device owners across the globe. The new features include the ability to find your AirPod headphones with Find My iPhone and Siri support for an array of queries. But buried in the release is a feature that could make a big difference for people with 16GB or 32GB iPhone models who are always running out of storage space, Mirror Online reports. iOS 10.3 introduces a new file system called APFS, which is more efficient at optimising how storage is used by the operating system and apps. This means that, even though you have exactly the same software running on your iPhone, it takes up less of the allocated storage space. A man using his iPhone Read More The best places to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy S8 - from EE, O2 and Three The hidden feature was first spotted by Apple Insider . After upgrading a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus from iOS 10.2.1 to 10.3, the tech site reported a jump in available space from 75.45 GB to 83.26 GB - an increase of 7.81 GB. People using a 16GB or 32GB iPhone shouldn't expect quite such a big jump in storage capacity. As Apple Insider explains, the more memory you have, the more free space iOS 10.3 will reclaim. But as we all know, every little helps, and updating to iOS 10.3 means squeezing a few more photos and videos onto your device then it's well worth it. Read More Bank customers warned over 'smishing' scam after Coventry man caught out - but what is it? Be warned though, the new file system means that installing the update takes time. In some cases it may require 30-50 minutes to complete. Another positive side effect of the update is that many iPhone users are reporting their devices feel noticeably faster and more responsive after installing iOS 10.3 According to Apple iOS engineer Renaud Lienhart, that's because animations have been tweaked and shortened - presumably to use less memory.

Before you install, make sure your iPhone is plugged in, and connected to WiFi. Then go to Settings > General > Software Update and tap on "Download and Install" to begin the update.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Patent Describes using Liquid Metal (Metallic Glass) for the Backside of an iPhone | Main March 31, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals Future Apple Watch with New Three-Dimensional Digital Crown Input   Yesterday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that relates to advancing Apple Watch with a new Digital Crown that could provide three-dimensional input as noted in our cover graphic.   Apple's patent filing notes that their invention relates to sensor arrangements for enabling inputs for manipulating a user interface on a wearable electronic device (Apple Watch) using a mechanical rotary input (e.g., a crown).   In some examples, the user interface can be scrolled or scaled in response to a rotation of the crown. The direction of the scrolling or scaling and the amount of scrolling or scaling can depend on the direction and amount of rotation of the crown, respectively.   In some examples, the amount of scrolling or scaling can be proportional to the change in rotation angle of the crown. In other examples, a velocity of scrolling or a velocity of scaling can depend on a velocity of angular rotation of the crown. In these examples, a greater velocity of rotation can cause a greater velocity of scrolling or scaling to be performed on the displayed view.   In some examples, tilting movements such as moving the crown up-and-down or side-to-side can allow more opportunities for a user to interact with a user interface of the electronic device. In order to detect tilting movements of the crown, sensors can be added to the electronic device, or sensors capable of detecting rotation of the crown can be configured to further detect tilting movements.   Apple's patent FIGS. 3A-3B illustrate components of an optical encoder that can be used to receive crown position information; FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate an exemplary top view of an encoder arrangement for detecting three-dimensional movement of a crown.   Apple notes that "Though the device is illustrated as being a watch, it is understood that the examples of the disclosure can be implemented in devices other than watches, such as tablet computers, mobile phones, or any other wearable or non-wearable electronic device that can include a rotary input such as a crown."   For the record, the idea of the digital crown for use with other iDevices is an established concept for Apple. In 2016 Patently Apple posted two reports (one and two) regarding the digital crown being considered for use on an iPad and beyond. So the revelation of the digital crown delivering three-dimensional input could also extend to other iDevices such as an iPad.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

(AAPL) Will Lose Its App Store Crown to Android Samsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity Display View All Posts Having conquered online retail, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become increasingly adventurous with its expansion plans. AMZN has pushed into streaming video and music services, it sells a growing range of consumer electronics (including the popular Echo smart speaker), the company’s AWS servers seem to power half the internet, it’s begun opening Amazon bookstores and it’s even experimenting with its own grocery stores. Source: Amazon Now there is a report the company is mulling additional physical Amazon store options, including potentially going head-to-head against Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Store. Amazon’s Expansion Into Physical Bookstores AMZN has been blamed for the demise of many brick-and-mortar bookstores, from independent bookshops to the Borders chain. The company’s ruthless pricing, open 24/7 website and Kindle e-books have been an unstoppable force. So it caught many people off guard when an Amazon store selling books opened in Seattle in 2015. This was an actual, physical bookstore — just like the ones it had been methodically putting out of business. There are now five of these Amazon Books locations open, with more to come. AMZN stocks them with best-seller titles, and uses them to showcase its devices. But with its growing hardware aspirations and the success of the Echo, there could be a new kind of Amazon store in the works. The New York Times ran an in-depth piece over the weekend that details AMZN’s growing physical retail ambitions. The article suggests that while many observers have been focused on Amazon’s experiments with grocery stores, the company has been exploring the possibility of taking on one of the most successful retailers of all: Apple. Apple began its own expansion into physical retail stores 16 years ago. The company has grown its Apple Store into a retail juggernaut with nearly 500 locations worldwide and it consistently tops the list of sales per square foot. According to the NYT article, AMZN is exploring the idea of an Amazon Store that uses the same concept as the highly successful Apple Store. It would showcase Amazon’s growing offering of hardware. This has grown from Kindle e-readers to include tablets, Fire TV video streamers and the surprise-hit Echo smart speaker. Like Apple, AMZN could give customers hands-on demos of the products and also use the devices to showcase its subscription video and music streaming services. The stores could also include a selection of top-selling consumer electronics from Amazon.com. The company is also reportedly considering physical Amazon Stores that would sell furniture and appliances. This approach would let customers examine the products first-hand — essentially turning Amazon into its own show-rooming experience. It might also include a virtual reality element, with VR technology being used to show what the furniture might look like in a customer’s home.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Mar 31, 2017 at 9:16AM Didi Chuxing, the China-based ride-hailing company, is just coming off a year where it raised $7.3 billion in funding from Apple, Tencent Holdings, and others (Apple pitched in $1 billion alone). But a recent Bloomberg article reported that Didi may receive another $6 billion round of funding backed by the Japanese telecom giant SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF). The new round comes as Didi has been hit hard by new ride-sharing regulations in China and as it attempts to create a global transportation company with an increasing focus on driverless cars.   Image source: Getty Images. What Didi could do with all that cash There are a few reasons why Didi would want to raise so much capital. First of all, the company said late last year that it wants to become a global company and has made several moves to make that happen. It purchased a stake in Brazil's largest ride-sharing company earlier this year, has invested in an Indian ridesharing company called Ola and has an investment in Lyft.  You may also recall that Didi Chuxing bought Uber's business in China last year, which marked one of the company's most important moves to date. All of this expansion is costly and it comes at a time when Didi's core business in China is undergoing major changes. Recently, Didi has run into some problems with increasing ride-hailing regulations in China. The government is cracking down on drivers who live in different cities than they work, and are starting to require various forms of licenses to prove that they're allowed to work in the city.   In response, many drivers have stopped working so they don't have to pay fines, and Didi has cut drivers out of its app. The result has been a shortage of Didi drivers in some cities. Having extra capital on hand could help Didi weather the current regulation storm in some Chinese cities while it works with local governments to get its business back on track.  The Bloomberg report also noted that the influx of new cash could be used for research and development for Didi's autonomous car plans. It's no secret that the world's tech companies and automakers have big plans for driverless cars and Didi wants to make this technology a priority, too. The company just opened up Didi Labs in Mountain View, California, this month and has already hired some self-driving car experts away from Uber.   Didi's growing dominance Didi is valued at about $35 billion after its big funding round last year, and its valuation could go up again this year if the SoftBank round actually happens.  It's worth noting that if Didi goes through a new investing round, some current investors, like Apple and Tencent, might also participate. Bloomberg mentioned that these companies might invest on a pro rata basis (which would give them the same level of their current Didi ownership) so that their stake in Didi isn't diluted by the new investing round.  What's becoming increasing clear is that Didi continues to garner a lot of interest from technology companies, and a new investing round could make the company even stronger. Didi is already in 400 cities across China, has 300 million customers, and delivers 20 million rides every day. And an extra $6 billion could go a long way toward helping Didi build out is ride-hailing business and driverless car ambitions even more.    Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Ciara Lee reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A bite size victory... in a global fight. Apple has won its bid to stop banks from introducing their own contactless payment services on its devices in Australia. The decision by Australia's competition watchdog, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on iPhones and Apple Watches. The banks had hoped to avoid transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps. And that would have been lucrative. Australia's contactless payment market is worth an estimated $84 billion a year. The banks involved - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank- have yet to allow use of their cards with Apple Pay. A win for them would have given them more negotiating power. A loss, making them potentially vulnerable to higher Apple fees. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS, MARKET ANALYST, MICHAEL HEWSON, SAYING: "Ultimately these four banks, by adopting a court case against Apple, could well find that it actually becomes more expensive for them to actually gain access to Apple's devices. So I think on a long-term basis, this is probably good for Apple, probably not so good for the Australian Banks in the short term." A win might also have sparked similar appeals for access to Apple's systems in other parts of the world. Apple does not allow any of its 3,500 bank partners in 15 global markets access to the technology behind its payment system.

market research and analysis of their activities in the consumer electronics, computer software, and online services industries.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160330/349511LOGO ) For

The affective computing market is forecast to increase from USD 12.20 billion in 2016 to USD 53.98 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 34.7%. The market is escalating rapidly, owing to rising digitization and continuous advancements in the field of cognitive science and computer science that are shaping the way for a new technology. However, the cost incurred in making affective computing systems is more and the tangible return on investment is low, thereby posing a major restraining factor for the market's growth. "The new research portal provides up-to-date statistical and analytical information on Apple's performance in the affective computing market, and their activities in the wider telecommunications and computing industry," says Ross Glover, CEO of Research and Markets.

ComputerCare has been an authorized service provider for Apple's range of iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and more since 2008, and first earned the prestigious Premium Service Provider title in 2016 after meeting Apple's strict standards for exceptional customer experience and repair support. ComputerCare is one of only ten Premium Service Providers currently in California. "Only the highest performing Apple Authorized Service Providers are awarded the Premium Service Provider title," said Georgia Rittenberg, President of ComputerCare. "Over the past year our skilled technicians have consistently delivered exceptional repair services to all of our clients. We are thrilled and honored to once again be recognized by Apple for our continued commitment to technical support and customer care." In 2016 ComputerCare successfully launched a same-day iPhone display repair service in the Bay Area that now repairs hundreds of iPhones every month. In addition to the company's roster of corporate clients, a growing proportion of ComputerCare's business is being driven by a recently launched Apple Support app that allows consumers to make a repair appointment directly with a nearby Authorized Service Provider instead of waiting for help at a Genius Bar. Being the only Premium Service Provider in the Santa Clara area, ComputerCare appears at the top of that list. In addition to being an Apple Premium Service Provider, ComputerCare is also a Premier Authorized Service Provider for Lenovo and is certified to provide warranty service and repair for Toshiba and HP devices. ComputerCare handles all repairs from start to finish, eliminating the need for IT departments to rely on manufacturer support, phone troubleshooting, coordination of shipments to depot, and store appointments. About ComputerCare Founded in 2004, ComputerCare offers warranty and non-warranty hardware repairs for the world's leading technology companies, including Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba and HP. The company also provides a variety of managed services tailored to the needs of small businesses up to enterprise level accounts, delivering specialized hardware support to supplement or manage any IT needs.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone Apple’s Premium iPhone Officially Named iPhone Pro By Necta Casiple on March 31, 2017 10:21 PM Reports have been sparse about what Apple might call its next iPhone with some claiming it’s called the iPhone Edition and others calling it the iPhone X or just iPhone 8. However, the official name for the handset turns out neither of the two: the tech giant officially named it the iPhone Pro. This is the first time the Cupertino-based company revealed one key detail about its upcoming handset before its launch. But it actually gave subtle hints in the past about the iPhone 7 successor’s moniker. In a question and answer portion of its annual shareholders meeting at its headquarters in Cupertino last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook mentioned patrons can expect them to “do more in the Pro area.” “The Pro area is very important to us,” Cook said. “The creative area is very important to us in particular.” Brand Unity Indeed, we can recall they have already started rebranding several product lines. MacRumors notes that Apple discontinued the MacBook Air line this year, leaving the MacBook and MacBook Pro brand for its laptops. While some MacBook Air models are still on the shelves today, the company won’t be releasing any more updates to the machines. The iPad Air got scrapped too, although the iPad Mini is still available in the Apple Store. Now, they’re getting rid of iPhone numbers in favor of the same Pro line. The next batch of iPhones will simply be called iPhone with the year of release as the identifier. Obviously, the premium models will boast the “Pro” title just like in MacBooks and iPads. We’ll then only have iPhone and iPhone Pro as the company also chose to let go of the SE and Plus line for a total brand unity. iPhone 8: Apple will rebrand its smartphone line for brand unity. It remains unclear if the same applies to the Apple Watch and Mac OS. Its smartwatches notably sport the sub-label ‘Series’ while its operating system was originally called Mac OS X. However, it’s worth mentioning that Apple already dropped the ‘X’ from the latest Mac OS release. iPhone Pro (2017) With the new iPhone name, it’s clear that Apple is going to take the device in a new direction specs-wise too so we can expect a pretty big revamp. Currently, we hear an OLED display, augmented reality support, wireless charging, USB-C port, and re-positioning of the Home button and Touch ID sensor. Those all makes sense, with the expected $1000 price alone. Then again, as the company has not confirmed the specs yet, they should be taken with a grain of salt. At least, we got the official name of the next iPhone now. To get the full details, read Apple’s iPhone Pro announcement here. What do you think of iPhone 8’s official name?

 Apple's latest hire is a sign that it's focusing on services, not devices Shona Ghosh Mar. 31, 2017, 8:21 AM 2,585 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple services chief Eddy Cue high-fives Drake. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple's latest hire should give you a good clue about where its priorities as a business lie. The new guy doesn't have anything to do with phones. Or watches. Or cars. Or augmented reality glasses. Apple's newest employee is Shiva Rajaraman, a veteran product manager who most recently worked at Spotify, and Google before that. According to his LinkedIn profile, Rajaraman was responsible for Spotify's end-to-end consumer experience, "including our apps, features, and user experience". At Google, he worked across a number of areas including helping creators make money on YouTube, and recommendations and search. In short, Rajaraman has helped two of the best software companies right now get to where they are. Shiva Rajaraman. YouTube/Greylock Partners That matters for Apple. Revenue from its e-commerce (or "services") business — Apple Music, iBooks, and the App Store — was up 18% to $7.1 billion (£5.6 billion) in the first quarter of this year. That's more revenue than the iPad, and faster growth than any other product category including the iPhone. It's also much more revenue than the Apple Watch, which is lumped into the "Other" category in Apple's financial filings. As you can see below, revenue from that category was $4 billion (£3.2 billion). That's actually down 8% year on year. Apple The tech press doesn't focus on this because it just isn't as sexy as Steve Jobs pulling out the first iPhone. Physical gadgetry, like an augmented reality headset, is much more exciting than user interfaces. That's despite the fact that Apple's biggest hardware play in recent years, the Apple Watch, is a niche product at best. An analyst note sent by Raymond James to investors on Thursday predicted that growth in Apple's services business will be "impressive", even though it only accounts for about 10% of the company's revenues for now. "Although iPhone is the dominant contributor of gross margins today ... the higher margin services business should meaningfully positively impact gross margins in the future," according to analysts Tavis McCourt and Mike Koban. No one raves about Apple's software in comparison to its hardware, but the idea of hiring people like Rajaraman is to change that, and the put the company in the same league as content giants Netflix and Spotify. He'll be focused on improving the user experience of services like Apple Music and to shape the company's video strategy, according to The Information.

The Australian Competition Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced on Friday that it had rejected a request by four of the country’s largest banks to negotiate with Apple over mobile payments. The National Australia Bank, Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank had been trying to negotiate with Apple to allow iPhone users to make payments from their own integrated digital wallets instead of through Apple Pay, without paying Apple fees. Read more Apple Pay, now 2 years old, looks for ways to be more useful The Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology enables users to make contactless payments through their phones from a bank card digitally registered with Apple Pay. Each transaction then enables Apple Pay to charge a fee to the respective bank. The banks sought to bargain over connecting the payments technology with their individual apps used in iPhones. This, they said, would have been of significant public benefit because it would have increased competition and consumer choice in digital wallets and mobile payments. However, ACCC competition regulator chairman Rod Sims said Apple Pay would increase competition between the banks, making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers by “limiting any ‘lock-in’ effect individual bank wallets may cause”. Mr Sims also listed the rapid change in the development of this emerging market as a reason for the ruling because it is “uncertain how competition may develop”.

Mr Sims told Reuters that if they had ruled against Apple, it could “force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other”. Customers of the four banks had up until now been prevented from using Apple Pay, launched last year in Australia, because the banks had not yet reached an agreement on the conditions with Apple. Another Australian bank, ANZ, which uses Apple Pay, said that it had already seen customer numbers increase as a result of the payment technology. Following the latest decision, the banks will be able to negotiate with Apple on an individual basis but the ruling means they have lost their power to bargain collectively. In a collective statement cited by Reuters, the banks said they were disappointed “given our considerable effort to demonstrate the public benefits inherent in open NFC access”.

The company told the paper that 3,500 banks in 15 markets now use Apple Pay.

The iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and fourth-generation iPad came out in 2012 and 2013, and have all since been discontinued. However, the iPhone 5 in particular is still a popular handset. All three devices use an A6 system-on-chip, the last of Apple’s hardware to be built on a 32-bit architecture. Apple made the jump to 64-bit with the launch of the A7 system-on-chip, and the latest version of iOS now warns users attempting to open 32-bit software that “This app will not work with future versions of iOS.” Apple hasn’t officially announced the demise of the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and fourth-generation iPad, and all of them received the recent iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update in still being tested, so it’s perfectly possible that Apple will add support for the older devices closer to its actual release date.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Apple is getting serious about selling AR smart glasses, report claims Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 27th, 2017 at 12:02 PM Share Tweet The notion of Apple releasing augmented reality glasses may have seemed ludicrous even a few months ago, but a new report from the Financial Times suggests that Apple is dead serious about making such a product a reality. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design According to the report, Apple began investigating the feasibility and utility of developing smart glasses a little bit more than a year ago. Presumably, Apple’s initial research in the area has been promising because the company is now eyeing the possibility of “taking it from a science project towards a consumer product.” As its engineers have become more adept at miniaturisation technology with products such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the iPad’s Pencil, AR seems to have overtaken Apple’s secretive car project as the company’s top priority for its next big launch, beyond the iPhone. Previous reports have said that Apple’s AR research team now boasts hundreds of researchers and engineers with broad experience in fields like Augmented Reality, head-mounted displays, optics and more. As a prime example of the talent Apple is attracting and bringing in-house, Apple last year hired Zeyu Li, a vision algorithm engineer from Magic Leap. It’s also worth noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook has been uncharacteristically effusive when discussing the potential for augmented reality. Given how notoriously tight-lipped Apple tends to be when it comes to discussing new technologies, Cook’s willingness to heap unrestrained praise on the technology is definitely worth paying attention to. Not too long ago, Cook said that Apple is “high on augmented reality for the long run” and that the technology may ultimately prove to be as impactful as the smartphone itself. In a similar vein, Cook said the following about AR during an interview on Good Morning America about six months ago. “Maybe it’s something we’re talking about,” Cook said, “maybe it’s someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there’s a lot of really cool things there.” As intriguing as all of this is, Apple isn’t likely to launch a pair of smart glasses for at least another year. A previous report from Bloomberg claimed that Apple a few months ago placed an order for “small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing” and that a finished product might appear on store shelves as early as 2018. That projection, however, might be a tad too optimistic. Incidentally, Robert Scoble earlier this year claimed that Apple will eventually release a pair of Augmented Reality glasses via a not-so-secretive partnership with Carl Zeiss AG, a reputed German company with decades of expertise and experience in developing a myriad of advanced optical systems.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 Apple Watch Tipped For Front Camera And Smart Fabric Band Posted: Mar 31 2017, 5:32am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     FaceTime may finally land for the Apple Watch The current Apple Watch is the Series 2 and wearable fans are wondering what 2017 might hold in store for the Apple smartwatch. Presumably the new generation of wearable from Cupertino will be called the Apple Watch Series 3 and there are a few rumors floating around that hint at what might come on the new device. Rumors suggest that the next Apple Watch will keep the same basic design as the current models. This is good news since that will likely mean that the same accessories will work. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! One rumor suggests that the Apple Watch Series 3 might get a glass-film touchscreen. Current Apple Watch Series 2 models use a touch-on-lens screen. The problem with the current screen is that the company building them for Apple, TPK Holdings, won't make them for future models due to low yield rates. Replacing TPK will be either General Interface Solution or Biel Crystal Manufactory for the glass-film solution reports AppAdvice. It's unclear if there will be any end-user benefits to changing the screen tech at this time. The only real improvements for Apple Watch fans for Series 3 are likely to be longer runtime from better power management and possibly increased battery size. Overall performance improvements are expected as well. Series 3 wearables are expected to be made by Quanta, the same company that has made the past two generations of the Apple Wearable. Another place where power savings for the next Apple Watch could come from is a new Micro LED display tech. This screen tech was acquired by Apple back in 2014 with the purchase of LuxVue Technology. This screen tech has better brightness levels and better color gamut. It's also more power efficient because no backlight is needed with the tech. Another cool rumor suggests that new watch bands could be available for the next generation that have icons that glow for specific activities taking place. One interesting Series 3 rumor suggests that Apple might add cellular connection to the next Apple Watch. That would mean the ability to connect and perform functions without needing to have your iPhone with you. This is great for active people who like to wear their watch, but not take a smartphone with them during workouts. Barron's reports that Susquehanna Financial Group analyst for semiconductors Christopher Rolland has offered up a new investor note that talks about what he thinks will happen with the Apple Watch. Rolland says that he has heard that the next Apple Watch will have its own cellular chip inside. This rumor has made rounds before, but this rumor is notable because Rolland follows major chipmakers Broadcom and Qualcomm, both firms sell components to Apple. The source of Roland's rumor comes from unnamed sources in the supply chain. Rolland wrote in his note to investors, "We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company’s AirPods (now on back order till May) to make and receive phone calls (perhaps a small win for Maxim with amps in each ear bud). Positive QCOM, MXIM." Operability with AirPods is important, there will be no headphone jack and if you need Air Pods to make phone calls with the Apple Watch, that means it may have no microphone of its own. Another Apple Watch Series 3 rumor that has surfaced claims that the wearable might get a reversible USB-C port for charging. It won't be strictly a USB-C port though, 9to5Mac claims that the Apple Watch Series 3 will have a hybrid Lightning/USB-c port on board. Word also suggests that the LTE chip inside the watch will be a low-power CAT-M1 unit supporting LTE and VOIP while helping to mitigate battery concerns. The Apple Watch Series 3 for 2017 might get something else that fans of the wearable have been hoping for. Sources are claiming that the Apple Watch will get a front camera. That front camera will allow users to take selfies with the watch, but the more important feature is that the camera will allow for video calling. We would assume that means FaceTime support would come to the Apple Watch Series 3. That is something that would transform the capabilities of the wearable and let you feel like Dick Tracy. Some other cool rumors about smart bands for the watch have also turned up reportd by MarketExclusive. These rumors suggest that the new Apple Watch could have a watch band that uses smart fabric. Some details of the plans Apple has for this turned up in a patent related to a smart fabric wristband. The patent outlines a watchband that could display the time, weather updates, and notifications. Exactly why you would want the time on a watch band when that is a function on the watch itself is unclear. Perhaps this feature would be intended to help save battery life by not having to wake the watch up to see the time. Rumors suggest that the Apple Watch Series 3 would be released alongside the iPhone 8 in September. Pricing is rumroed at around $350 for the standard versions of the watch. You can bet there will be high-end versions that would cost more, just as there are with the Apple Watch Series 2 available now. This story may contain affiliate links.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 MacBook Air Rumors: Killed Off Or Updated? Posted: Mar 31 2017, 6:32am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Kaby Lake processor update would make the MacBook Air run longer per charge One of the biggest questions in the Apple world for notebooks right now is what will happen to the MacBook Air. Some rumors suggest that the machine might be discontinued while others suggest that the machine might get an update for 2017. There are some rumors out there that suggest Apple will be rolling out a new MacBook Air soon. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! The rumors of a replacement are bolstered by retail outlets that have reduced the price of the Air in stores to clear out inventory. This often happens when a new model is coming. Another thing that also happens when a new updated Apple device is coming is that some outlets will return unsold stock ahead of the new model launch. This is exactly what we have seen in the past with returned previous generation iPhone SE models before the iPhone SE 2017 update that brought 64GB devices to market. Best Buy cut prices of in stock MacBook Air machines sparking rumors that a new model might be coming. I think if we look at recent trends, better proof of a new model coming might be if Best Buy starts returning unsold stock. An updated MacBook Air would likely get some of the same upgrades expected in the MacBook Pro line for 2017. Namely the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Kaby Lake would bring with it a more power efficient design equating to longer battery life, and the opportunity for the MacBook Air to gain support for more RAM. A more power efficient design for the processor would also mean better battery life without having to increase the size of the battery. The svelte profile of the MacBook Air has always been one of its big selling points and with Kaby Lake on board perhaps Apple could even reduce the size of the battery and provide the same runtime resulting in an even thinner profile. Other updates that could happen in 2017 according to The Christian Post for the MacBook Air include the addition of a USB Type-C port, Apple Pencil Trackpad, Touch ID with Force Touch and the addition of a retina display. More connectivity would go a long way to making the MacBook Air more popular with power users, the challenge with adding ports to the machine comes in messing up the slick profile of the Air. Assuming Apple doesn't go the other way and discontinue the MacBook Air for 2017, the launch could come in May of 2017. What we do know is that if Apple wants to succeed with the Air, it needs to offer a much more compelling update for the series than it did last year when the Air line was updated to 8GB of RAM in the 13-inch model and the 11-inch model was discontinued.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Apple fans were surprised last week to hear that the Cupertino based tech giant has launched a brand new tablet. The device in cause has been simply named as iPad and it will only ship in the 9.7 Retina display model. What makes this iPad special is the fact that it’s quite affordable being priced at $329. What’s surprising is that the new tablet is competing against Apple’s other 9.7 inch iPad Pro. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone but the tablet industry isn’t as profitable as it used to be. The only company that still manages to keep its profits growing when it comes to tablets is Apple. The reason behind this is that Apple keeps on refreshing its iPad lineup with new and higher performing devices. Nonetheless, today we’re going to take a look at what the new iPad and iPad Pro have to bring to the table. Size and Weight First off, obviously both of these gadgets ship with a 9.7 inch retina display and this is what puts them in the same category. In addition, both devices measures in at 240mm in length and 170mm in width. The only difference that we can see is their thickness. iPad 2017 features a thickness of 7.5mm while iPad Pro measures in at 6.1mm. Now onto weight, the Wi-Fi only iPad 2017 model weighs in at 469 grams which is significantly heavier that the iPad Pro that weighs 437 grams. On the other hand, the Wi-Fi + LTE iPad 2017 model weighs in at 478 and the Wi-Fi + LTE iPad Pro weighs in at 444 grams. Additionally, both devices have been built with aluminum alloy. We think it’s safe to say that iPad Pro has a slight advantage when it comes to portability. Accessories One of the reasons why Apple’s iPad Pro lineup is so highly popular is because it ships bundled with a Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil stylus. Sadly, the new iPad 2017 doesn’t support Apple’s special keyboard. However, customers can always acquire a third party snap-on keyboard but the problem is that it will be connected via Bluetooth and it will need to be charged separately.

Apple product owners should be happy to know that iOS 10.3 has officially started rolling out. However there’s a downside to this update, it includes an unexpected surprise. Apple’s fan community has been taken by surprise after upgrading their device and receiving the unannounced feature. Today we’re going to clear things up by covering everything that iOS 10.3 brings to the table. iOS 10.3 Upgrades Slower than Usual It all started when Apple fans started reporting that iOS 10.3 is updating slower than usual. The reason why this matters is because iOS 10.3 only weighs in at 600MB and the designated device should upgrade in a matter of minutes. Reports are showing that older devices such as iPad Air 2, iPhone 5C and 5 require up to 50 minutes of time in order completely upgrade themselves. Because the update is loading so slowly, the progress bar seems to not move at all. This caused many concern among the Apple fan community and the Cupertino based tech giant was forced to clear this issue by telling its customers to not panic and to just let their iOS powered device to load. Many Apple product owners have stopped the update believing that it wasn’t working and this caused the device to take damage. New File System On the bright side, there’s a good reason why iOS 10.3 is loading at this rate, it contains a new file system. This feature comes under the “Apple File System” name and it replaces the already existing HFS+ system. In addition, the new system will also be rolled out to macOS, tvOS and watchOS during the upcoming future. Apple confirmed that this new system is going to completely enhance the way iPhones, iPads and iPods work from now on. The aforementioned devices will benefit from a bunch of hardware performance tweaks, SSD optimization and even improved backups. As a result of the optimization that’s being brought by the new file system, Apple devices will be able to store more files than usual on their memory.

The most talked about topic in the world right now is Marsha Blackburn’s internet privacy bill. The House Representative has sponsored a bill that will allow ISP (internet service providers) to sell private customer internet history without asking for their permission or even announcing them. Well, it looks like Apple is having none of that since iOS 10.3 brings a new file system that encrypts files. iOS 10.3 File System The new file system has been first unveiled during last year’s Worldwide Developers Conference. However, the Cupertino based tech giant didn’t talk too much about this feature and it didn’t even include it in iOS 10.3’s patch list. In fact the Apple community has been question why does iOS 10.3 takes so much to load, well it seems like the new file system is the reason. File Encryption Apple product owners should be happy to know that this new feature encrypts their files and makes them safer. Additionally, tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 are also equipped with the new feature. The new file system seems to have been built around the idea of modernization. This was quite necessary since the previous HFS+ file system is very old, it was first developed around the floppy disk era. Safety isn’t the only thing that this new feature brings, Apple products will now also be able to manage files better. This should be great news especially for owners of 16GB iPhones because their smartphones will be able to store even more files than usual. Full-Disk Encryption The reason why we believe that ISP will not be able to forcefully get access to private internet information from iPhone owners is because the new system has been fitted with a “strong full-disk encryption”. This information has been confirmed by Apple itself and it brings sensitive meta data security to another level. Apple stated that the new system will help Apple product owners keep their integrity while browsing the web and that they should not feat Marsha Blackburn’s internet privacy bill.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Leaks and rumors are pointing towards the fact that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will feature a completely innovative design. These leaks are leading analysts to believe that this is going to be Apple’s best year yet in terms of sales percentages. Rod Hall who is an analyst at JPMorgan has announced that Apple will sell 260 million of iPhone 8 units this year. What’s interesting is that the Wall Street Journal thinks the otherwise. The Street’s analysis takes in consideration the fact that Apple managed to upset its fan-base last year when it decided to not change the way its iPhone lineup is designed. On the other hand, Rod Hall has taken a closer look at all the leaks regarding iPhone 8’s features and came to the conclusion that Apple is going to be the number one smartphone manufacturer when it comes to profits. Even though 260 million units might sound like huge number, readers should that it’s entirely possible since last year Apple managed to sell 211 million iPhone units. Leaks and Rumors iPhone 8 is expected to be priced around $1000. The reason why the smartphone is going to be so expensive is because it will feature an innovative edge-to-edge OLED display. Even though there is no official leaked picture, prototype pictures are showing that iPhone 8 is going to be quite good looking. In addition, the flagship smartphone is expected to ship with a light augmented main camera that’s going to allow users to refocus already snapped pictures. The front side hasn’t been forgotten at all and iPhone 8 will be equipped with a 3D facial recognition selfie camera. More interestingly, Rod Hall is hinting towards the fact that iPhone 8 is said to ship without a physical home button. Apple will actually embed a fingerprint sensor beneath the display instead. Let’s just hope that Rod Hall’s predictions come true and Apple’s upcoming smartphone flagship is going to be as impressive as marketed. We should also mention that Rod Hall has a positive record when it comes to predicting profits. Nonetheless, Apple will surely have to up its game since Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will be equally impressive.

Today Apple has officially announced the opening of its App Accelerator in Bengaluru. The main aim of the accelerator will be to provide special support and tools to developers and to improve their skills to transform the design, quality and performance of their apps for iOS. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple said, “We are impressed by the great entrepreneurial spirit in India, and are excited to provide a platform for these developers to share their innovations with customers around the world. In just the first few weeks, we’ve already seen some incredible developers here at the App Accelerator Bengaluru, including Practo and Reliance Games, create innovative apps that can meet the needs of customers in India and around the world.” The App Accelerator is open for all iOS developers in India through a sign-up process. According to the company, each week experts from Apple will brief close to 500 developers as well as provide one-on-one app reviews and proper analysis. The accelerator will provide resources and guidance around Apple’s programming language ‘Swift’ which is used to create apps for iOS, Apple TV and the Apple Watch. This move will help Apple’s team to work, teach and inspire developers of this startup breeding city and others to hone their skills in a way that will help them work around or build innovative products around iOS, Mac and other Apple software.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 was released earlier this week, and simply put, it’s probably the best smartphone we’ve ever seen. Samsung has thrown so many new features at the Galaxy S8, it’s hard to know where to start – but the edge-to-edge ‘Infinity’ screen, a buttonless design, and new AI assistant are the main things you need to know about. Therefore, Apple will have to make the iPhone 8 relatively revolutionary, and new report from iDrop suggests it’s starting with a new vertical camera. The rumour comes from a Foxconn source, and states that the new iPhone 8 Edition will have a vertical dual-camera, rather than a horizontal one. iDrop says the iPhone 8 will also feature a double camera set up above its screen too. Interestingly, iDrop’s source says the iPhone 8 won’t have an under-screen Touch ID sensor, but will use an OLED screen, with an edge-to-edge display just like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Everything else we know about the iPhone 8 1. There will be THREE new iPhone 8s See related  New MacBook Pro release date, features and rumours: MacOS Beta code points to new Kaby Lake models New rumours suggest those models will be joined by a third, higher-end model. According to a report from the Japanese website Mac Otakara, this new phone will be called the iPhone Edition, in the same way the higher end Apple Watch is called the Apple Watch Edition. Fast Company previously suggested the next iPhone would cost over $1,000, and it’s possible this is the handset its source was talking about. What’s not yet clear, is how the iPhone Edition will be different from the other two handsets. A look at the Apple Watch line-up reveals the only difference between the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition models is the use of a high-end ceramic finish, and it’s possible Apple could be bringing the same ceramic finish to the iPhone 8. For the last few years Apple has concentrated in giving consumers more choice – when it comes to colours and finishes at least – so this rumour is certainly viable. 2. We pretty much know the iPhone 8 (7s) release date Apple hasn’t announced anything about the iPhone 8 (7s) yet, but we already have a good idea of when it will be released. Apple tends to stick to a pretty rigid timeframe when it comes to iPhones, and a quick look at previous iPhone release dates will give a very good idea of when the next iPhone is due. Apple tends to release an iPhone every year in the last two weeks of September, so we should see the iPhone 7 around this time next year. 3. It should be easier to get an iPhone 8 (7s) when it is released A new report by BlueFin Research Partners, and reported on by MacRumors, suggests that Apple will begin making the iPhone 8 earlier than usual – but states that it doesn’t necessarily report to an earlier release date. Instead of changing the release date, it looks like Apple will begin production earlier, this time round, so it has more handsets available when then expected September release date does roll around. 4. The iPhone 8 won't have Touch ID According to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 is going to feature a bezel-less display – just like the LG G6 and Samsung S8. That way, Apple will be able to give the new iPhone a larger screen, without making the handset itself larger. However, it looks like the Home button is going to be the first casualty in the new change, and according to Kuo, Apple is set to replace it with a new function area. This new area of screen could work like like the MacBook Pro’s TouchBar, giving users relevant controls when needed, but disappearing altogether when watching something like a movie, for example.  5. The iPhone (8) 7s could feature wireless charging This year the iPhone 7 debuted water-resistant capability, something already seen on Android phones for the past few years – and it’s possible Apple will follow the Android crowd with another feature, too. Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 feature wireless charging, and it’s possible Apple will introduce that feature in the next iPhone. Apple tends to wait a while before introducing new technologies, and the introduction of wireless charging could provide a good incentive to get the updated iPhone. 6. The iPhone 8 (7s) should cost the same as the iPhone 7 Apple hasn’t changed the price of the new iPhone recently, and that looks set to continue for the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t end up shelling more for the iPhone 7s: Apple may have kept the prices the same, but it’s also dropped and added storage options over the iPhone range. That’s forced owners to buy a smaller-capacity iPhone – or upgrade to a larger-capacity, more expensive model than before. 7. The iPhone 8 (7s) could finally use an OLED screen For the past few years we’ve expected Apple to put an OLED screen in the iPhone, and now the Sharp CEO, Jeng-wu Tai, has pretty much confirmed the iPhone 8 (7s) will have one. Late last year, Tai said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS to OLED panel. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation.

According to a report, Kharge said, "In less than a month, we will have something out - Apple will start assembling and making its high-end iPhones at its plant in the city. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp will help Apple in doing so." Kharge said making iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices, which will help it gain a foothold in the fast growing Indian market. SEE ALSO:  MTNL offers 2GB data at Rs. 319 He further said that "Assembling and making of iPhones in Bengaluru will boost Apple's chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market because it will allow the company to lower prices," report added. However, it was reported earlier that after denying the demands, the Government is once again working on options to accommodate demands in which the company is looking for the concession to set up its manufacturing unit in the country. The tech giant is asking for incentives from the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (Diety). Apple had asked for tax concessions including lower import and manufacturing duties, and certain policy exemptions from the Government for setting up a manufacturing unit here in the country. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). Apple had informed the government this year in January that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India but wants fiscal concessions.

By: Chandrika Jana Updated: Friday, March 31, 2017, 17:58 [IST] With Samsung recently launching its flagship smartphones Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, now all the focus is on its main rival Apple. While fans have been speculating about its features since some time now, a new leaked image reveals that the iPhone 8 is coming with a vertical dual-camera setup. iDrop, the website which published the image, also claims that the upcoming iPhone 8 is going to be called 'iPhone Edition'. It even came up with a mockup of the iPhone 8 based on the feedback given by sources aware of Apple's future plans. Also Read:Apple to end support for several devices this year As per the image, the iPhone Edition looks quite similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8. The device sports a dual-curved screen with minimal bezels on top and bottom accompanied by an OLED panel with 2.5D glass protection. The image also discloses that the phone will feature a LED flash unit just at the bottom of the vertical camera capsule unit. Further, iDrop has claimed that the fingerprint scanner will be placed at the rear instead of the front. As usual, Apple has remained tight-lipped about this whole thing. The OLED screen is not much of a surprise as previous reports had hinted the same. OLED screens are said to consume less power and provide better clarity. The device is also rumored to provide its users with a lot of facilities including a new sensor system, wireless charging, and screen embedded touchID button. All of these updates will inevitably increase the price and reports claim that the device is going to come with a price tag of around $1,000.

Retail revenues from recorded music in the U.S. grew 11.4 percent to $7.7 billion in 2016, driven by the doubling of paid subscriptions to music streaming services, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). But revenues are still about half of what they were in 1999 and physical sales and digital downloads continue to decline. Streaming service revenues were up 68 percent year-on-year in 2016 to $3.9 billion, and for the first time accounted for the majority of the music industry's sales in the U.S. Revenues specifically from paid subscription services like Spotify and Apple music rose 114 percent year-on-year in 2016 to $2.5 billion, the RIAA said. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images But the organization – which has had a rocky relationship with streaming businesses – said that current licensing and copyright laws are allowing some actors to get away with paying artists less than others. "It makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams," RIAA CEO Cary Sherman, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. "Why does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services — including many new and small innovators — cannot. It may be the same song requested by the user, on the same device, but the payouts differ enormously because of an unfair and out-of-date legal regime." YouTube has not responded to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. RIAA's concern is around the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and it's something that they have been attacking YouTube over for a while. The issue is over copyright-breaching content appearing on YouTube. The RIAA's members complain that as soon as they issue one takedown notice to YouTube, another video breaching copyright appears, creating an "endless game of whack-a-mole". This means that essentially record labels and artists are unable to negotiate deals with YouTube because their content is on there in some form without their consent. "The way the negotiation goes is something like this: 'Look. This is all we can afford to pay you,' YouTube says. 'We hope that you'll find that reasonable. But that's the best we can do. And if you don't want to give us a license, okay. You know that your music is still going to be up on the service anyway. So send us notices, and we'll take 'em down as fast we can, and we know they'll keep coming back up. We'll do what we can. It's your decision as to whether you want to take our deal, or whether you just want to keep sending us takedown notices," Sherman told Recode in an interview last year. This is in contrast to the likes of Apple Music and Spotify which negotiate individual deals with record labels. Last year after the RIAA made similar complaints, YouTube released a blog post in which it didn't deny that it paid less than Spotify and Apple Music, but said that it's not right to compare it to the streaming services. "The next claim we hear is that we underpay compared to subscription services like Spotify. But this argument confuses two different services: music subscriptions that cost $10 a month versus ad-supported music videos. It's like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi," Christophe Muller, head of YouTube international music partnerships, said in the post. "So let's try a fair comparison, one between YouTube and radio. Like radio, YouTube generates the vast majority of our revenue from advertising. Unlike radio, however, we pay the majority of the ad revenue that music earns to the industry. Radio, which accounts for 25 percent of all music consumption in the U.S. alone and generates $35 billion of ad revenue a year, pays nothing to labels and artists in countries like the U.S. In countries like the UK and France where radio does pay royalties, we pay a rate at least twice as high." The battle between the RIAA and YouTube doesn't look likely to be over soon as the organization continues to push for changes to the DMCA and looks to get growth and revenues back to the industry's heyday levels. "A year of growth in the U.S. music business is welcome news. It suggests that years of patiently nurturing a nascent streaming marketplace has begun to pay off. But it does not erase 15 years of declines, or continuing uncertainty about the future," Sherman said. Arjun KharpalTechnology Correspondent Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change GOOGL ---
Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's App Accelerator Officially Opened Today in Bengaluru India | Main | Apple Patent Reveals Future Apple Watch with New Three-Dimensional Digital Crown Input » March 31, 2017 Apple Patent Describes using Liquid Metal (Metallic Glass) for the Backside of an iPhone   On Thursday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that revealed the use of liquid metal on an iPhone. Liquid metal has always been filed in mysterious patent filings with only vague references to devices that might use the material but never a direct link to a specific product until now. In fact, in one very specific patent point reveals that the backside of an iPhone may be made of a metallic glass substrate with an added metallic glass coating for extra strength. Could this be what Apple will use for the iPhone 8 in order to make the glass crack proof? Only time will tell.   Apple's Patent Background   Apple notes in their patent background that Metallic glasses (also referred to herein as amorphous alloys and glassy alloys) are metallic alloys that do not have a crystalline structure. Instead, their structure is amorphous. Metallic glasses have a number of beneficial material properties that make them viable for use in various engineering applications.   Metallic glasses having specific cosmetic properties can be difficult to design. Cosmetic properties of a metal or metallic glass are properties of the surface chemistry of the metal or metallic glass. Further, metallic glasses can be difficult to use as a surface coating in conventional methods.   Micro Alloying   Apple's invention generally relates to metals comprising a metal coating on a metal substrate and methods for applying a metal coating onto a metal substrate using micro-alloying.   In one aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of micro-alloying a metallic glass onto a metal substrate. In one embodiment, a metallic glass coating is deposited on a metal substrate to form a metallic glass coated surface. Pulsed radiation is applied to the metallic glass coated surface to adhere the metallic glass to the metal substrate. In certain variations, the pulsed radiation is a pulsed electron beam. In some variations, the metallic glass diffuses into the metal surface. In certain variations, the metallic glass can form a concentration gradient in the metal substrate surface.   In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of modifying the chemical composition of a metal substrate.   Apple further notes specifically that "In some embodiments, the metal substrate may be a metallic glass substrate. In some embodiments, a metallic glass coating is deposited on a metallic glass substrate to form a coated metallic glass. Pulsed radiation is applied to the coated metallic glass to form a metallic glass with altered chemical composition."   The single paragraph noted above within the patent is the key should Apple use this method to create the glass back panel of the iPhone 8.   Apple adds in their filing that in certain variations of the methods, the pulsed radiation is a pulsed electron beam. In certain further variations, the resulting metal or metallic glass has an altered chemical composition from the original substrate. In additional variations, the coated metal or chemically altered metallic glass has a different color than the original metal or metallic glass substrate. In other variations, the coated metal or chemically altered metallic glass can have a greater hardness than the original metal or metallic glass substrate. The metals and metallic glasses can be further treated, such as by oxidation, to have altered cosmetic properties.   According to Apple's patent FIG. 4 noted above, the image depicts a portable electronic device having a micro-alloyed metallic glass coated metal substrate on a housing component.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time. The filing date of the patent filing would strongly suggest that the use of liquid metal is for a future iPhone and not designed for the iPhone 7.   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's iPhone 8 with Glass Backside may use Physical Direct Connection Technology to Enhance Wireless Charging." The report noted that "Since metal chassis will create interference with the wireless charging's induction coil, glass or ceramic type of chassis has become popular among smartphone vendors that are looking to release wireless charging smartphones." Using a super strong glass methodology such as metallic glass or liquid metal makes a lot of sense. We'll see in September if in fact this process was chosen by Apple.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Apple had a record fourth quarter in 2016 shipping 78.3 million iPhones globally, surpassing Samsung in overall smartphone market share. Huawei shipments reached record 139 million units with 28 per cent year-on-year growth, Counterpoint Research said earlier this year. India registered 109.1 million units of smartphone shipments with a marginal 5.2 per cent annual growth in 2016. With a wide pipeline of products to cater to various market segments, both Huawei and Honor have put the needs of the Indian consumer first and have focused on channel, retail, brand, marketing and services, to strengthen the business base and streamline operations and customer service. Samsung continued to lead the Indian smartphone market with 25.1 per cent share despite a 13.1 per cent sequential decline in the fourth quarter of 2016. But Samsung's annual shipments grew 3.2 per cent in 2016, driven majorly by the J-series. --IANS anuj/sm/vt (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

TECHNOLOGY Please Stop Making Boring Email Subject Lines and Do This Instead I am asking people to test out whether a better subject line actually works. Here's how you can get involved. By John Brandon John Brandon is a contributing editor at Inc. magazine covering technology. He writes the Tech Report column for Inc.com. @jmbrandonbb Contributing editor, Inc.com@jmbrandonbb WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The email subject line is dead, long live the email subject line. Few of us bother to read them, since we're so inundated with messages on email, chat, social media, and collaborative apps like Slack and Microsoft Teams. What works instead? It's better to think of an email subject line as more like a headline (for example, the one for this article). You have to get really creative. Recently, I tried this as an experiment. For an article about the Apple iPad, I wanted to find an analyst who can comment about whether the tablet is starting to lose momentum with consumers. (By the way, it is.) I decided to send out ten emails. For half of them, I stuck to a boring headline: "Apple iPad sales slump, care to comment?" As you might have guessed, only one person responded. Yet, it's strange because that subject line is similar to 99% of the subject lines that arrive in my inbox everyday. We have this tendency to explain what is in an email as we were taught to do when we first learned how to use email. That no longer works. For the second batch, I got a lot more creative. And why not? In the age of social media, contributed content, and digital overload we all have to figure out how to cut through the noise. For the second batch, I used this subject line: "Apple sent me to you." Now, all five of the recipients responded. Even more interesting, two of them responded within seconds. A couple more took maybe 30 minutes, and one took all day. The headline is 100% accurate (I've written before about why it's important not to contribute to the fake news problem these days) but punches through an invisible barrier. It sounds urgent and important, sure. More importantly, there's a FOMO (fear of missing out) element. And, I named Apple. Maybe that was the real key. We all recognize that name. How can you change your subject lines? I'd like to try an experiment with you. You may work for a startup, or maybe you have a product to pitch. Doesn't matter. Take the time to create a new email with an attention-grabbing subject line. Now let's see if that leads to a response...from me. If you don't hear from me in 24 hours, assume it didn't work and try another one. (Please don't try more than two, we don't need to create an email nightmare.) I promise to be as helpful as possible. What can we all learn? For one, email is here to stay for a while. I hope it dies out soon. Since we all know that's unlikely, you have to figure out how to make it work, and the subject line is your key to success. If you manage to cut through the threshold, I'll be sure to reply. Ready? Get set? Go. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Mar 27, 2017 Advertisement
Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Reportedly Working on a New Social App for Collaborative Picture Editing March 31, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Opera Mini for Android Goes Smart with New Download Feature and More Google to Facelift PlayStore with the Reshuffling of My Apps Section Apple won’t be the sole tech behemoth to introduce social photo editing app, it seems. Google too is likely to join the bandwagon with a social app for picture editing. And if reports are to be believed, work on the app has already got cracking. The unnamed app, which is currently being experimented along with other apps will incorporate many of the features that will be present in Apple’s Clips app including AI backing and image recognition features. But Google will take a further deviation by involving a deeper social angle by letting users edit picture in groups. The app will reportedly let users create groups and share pictures in them so that the group members can collaboratively edit the picture and send them across to other social media. The ability to collectively edit pictures should be the salient feature of the new app, and this combined with Google’s expertise should make the app alluring for the mass. Google is likely to include a host of its feature like its image recognition technology to enrich the app. Google has been constantly developing its AI powered image recognition features, and it recently also introduced a new API for object recognition in YouTube. With the feature, Google’s upcoming app will automatically identify objects in images to tag them and categorize them so as to be helpful in future searches. There are no further details available about the app. But Google has confirmed the development of the app, which indicates a possible debut during the I/O conference in May like it did with its previous suite of social apps including Allo and Duo.

Among the many things I find frustrating about the Apple TV experience—and yes, there are more than a few—the Siri Remote is near the top of the list. The small slab of metal, glass, and plastic was billed as one of the marquee features of the new set-top box when it debuted back in fall 2015, but my experience with it has been largely underwhelming. I was, at the time of its introduction, hopeful about the Siri Remote’s potential. Apple went so far as to call it “the only remote you’ll need.” After using it—or mostly not using it—for the last two years, I feel pretty confident in saying that it most emphatically is not. Function falls short of form The Siri Remote is an example of Apple’s idealistic design. Were the Apple TV the only device connected to my TV, the remote might very well be fine. I would still have a bone to pick with its annoyingly symmetrical design, the fact that it’s small and easily misplaced, and the annoyance of trackpad scrolling, but there are aspects I wouldn’t find wholly objectionable. Unfortunately, the Apple TV doesn’t exist in a vacuum. I’ve easily used up all four HDMI ports on my HDTV, and the Xbox One and the Fire TV get a fair share of attention. Since the Siri Remote doesn’t accommodate either, and their remotes don’t work with the Apple TV, I’m already in trouble. So even though my Logitech Harmony universal remote may not be quite as attractive as the Siri Remote, it wins out on functions. It’s comfortable to hold, and I can easily tell which way is up without looking at it. Mostly, it works with all of my connected devices, which is the biggest utility win of all. Talking to the TV The Siri Remote, however, does have some features I miss on my Harmony remote: the clicks on the edge of the trackpad to jump back or forward 10 seconds, for example. Scrubbing on the trackpad is also a lot easier than the fast-forward and rewind buttons used on other set top boxes, which are largely unchanged from what we used for VHS tapes. Apple I do find the Siri Remote preferable to using my iPhone as a remote, though obviously the Apple TV Remote app on iOS makes text entry far more pleasant and efficient than picking out letters one-by-one from an onscreen menu. Then there’s Siri itself. The other week I was watching a Netflix series and found myself sick of the opening credits by episode two. So I picked up the Siri Remote and was about to scrub forward when I remembered Siri was supposed to be able to handle this. “Skip forward one minute” I said, and sure enough, it jumped to almost the exact end of the credits. (How great would it be if you could just ask it to skip the opening credits?) But as much as I like the potential of Siri on the Apple TV, I would prefer it if it were built not into the remote but into the box itself. That way I wouldn’t have to cast around for the remote when I want to use Siri, and it would be easier to replace the remote with a universal option for all the other times when I don’t want to use Siri. This would also potentially save on some of the cost of the Apple TV. Right now, replacing a Siri Remote costs $79—more than half of the cost of the entire box. Perhaps it would make more sense to provide the Siri Remote as an upgrade option, and offer a cheaper remote for a more entry-level box—maybe even the model that shipped with the previous Apple TV. A “Hey Siri” option for the Apple TV would be quite welcome and, I believe, entirely doable. There are challenges, but if the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and even iPhone can listen for “Hey Siri” as they’re playing back audio, it seems to me an Apple TV—with the right microphone technology—could handle this as well. As far as false positives go, Apple’s already made some movement in this direction with the voice-training it uses on the iPhone. Admittedly, it would have to be slightly more complex on something like a set-top box, which will get used by more than one person in a household, but I would be surprised if the company isn’t investigating this already. I don’t think broadening Siri’s utility or replacing the remote will fix all of what ails the Apple TV, but I do think that they’re both critical pieces of how we interact with our TVs, which is different from how we interact with our phones, tablets, and computers. There’s no one-fits-all design approach here, and the Apple TV should get just as much thought as Apple’s other platforms.

According to a latest PTI report, the company will start making iPhones in the country from April. The news comes a month after government of Karnataka welcomed Apple’s proposal to begin “initial manufacturing operations” in Bangalore. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told PTI, Apple is ready to start assembling high-end iPhones in less than a month. This will boost its chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market. In less than a month, we will have something out – Apple will start assembling and making its high-end iPhones at its plant in the city. Taiwanese contract manufacturer company, Wistron Corp will help Apple in in the process. Earlier this month, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, the government has not accepted ‘most of the demands’ of iphone maker Apple which wants to set up manufacturing unit in India. Apple India has sought concessions including duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service/repair for a period of 15 years. In January this year, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” Kharge said if the Centre is keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players as well such as Samsung and Lenovo.

The employment of Rajaraman has sprung speculations on what exactly Apple is planning for its own original video content. The former YouTube and Spotify exec will be reporting directly to Apple’s SVP of internet software and services Eddy Cue, according to The Information. The report also reveals that Apple is still debating on which direction it wants to take its video efforts. One of the options that Apple is contemplating on is bundling music, books and news with its planned video and cable services. The mentioned video and cable services are also said to be activated through the iPhone and will work on “internet-connected TVs.” With Apple hiring Rajaraman, the tech giant might be looking into his expertise on the matter considering his career in online video. Rajaraman worked for YouTube for eight years and was in charge of securing licensing deals from various media companies. During his two-year stay at Spotify, he also did the same thing but for both videos and podcasts. It’s previously been reported that Apple has had a rough time securing licensing deals from major TV networks. This one of the main reasons why its planned live cable TV service, or Netflix-style streaming service, is taking a long time to actually launch. Apple’s hire of Rajaraman might make a difference. The tech giant’s music streaming service, Apple Music, has functioned as a portal where the company is able to show its original video content. So far, the company has officially announced “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke.” Rajaraman will also work on improving Apple Music’s video services as well. Sources have indicated that the newly hired official might be getting other projects. One of this is his possible involvement with Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, according to Apple Insider. Apple is considering to bundle its music, news and books with its planned video and TV service.

(AAPL) Will Lose Its App Store Crown to Android Samsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity Display View All Posts A new report has been released with comprehensive stats for the global market for mobile apps. App Annie says that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) served up a fraction of the downloads of Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for 2016, yet continued to dominate the revenue side of the business. Source: Apple Apple’s App Store revenue is predicted to continue topping Google Play as the most lucrative through to 2021. It’s expected that all Android app stores combined will overtake Apple’s App Store sales at some point this year. Report on Mobile App Downloads and Revenue App Annie is a firm that tracks global app downloads and app store revenue. A detailed report — which was made available on AppleInsider — sheds light on what’s currently happening in the mobile app market, along with forecasts to 2021. According to App Annie, AAPL’s App Store revenue is about to be surpassed for the first time by the combination of Google Play and third party Android app stores. While Apple remained on top for 2016, with $34 billion in app sales versus a combined $27 billion for Android, in 2017 the lead is expected to shift. Apple App Store revenue is pegged at $40 billion, while Android app stores are on track to book a combined $41 billion. Apple continues to be on top as the single largest app store by sales, with its $40 billion for 2017 expected to nearly double second place Google Play’s $21 billion. Apple’s iOS also stays firmly in the lead as the platform where users are most likely to pay for apps. Apple’s $40 billion in revenue is expected to come from 30 billion downloads. Google Play’s $21 billion will come from 114 billion downloads, making Apple’s App Store a much more lucrative prospect for developers. The App Annie numbers show that Android’s sheer numbers advantage, however, is once again showing results. Apple App Store Revenue Explains Super Mario Run One of the best recent examples of how the difference between app downloads versus app purchases plays out was Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)’s (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Super Mario Run. This was Nintendo’s first full-fledged foray into mobile gaming. Built around one of the most recognizable Nintendo characters of all time, smartphone owners salivated at the chance to play. When the game was released in 2016, if one platform was going to have an edge at getting Mario first, sheer numbers would say it should have been Google Play. With more than double the downloads of the Apple App Store, Google Play would have put Super Mario Run onto a lot more devices. But Nintendo chose to make Super Mario run an iOS exclusive instead. Despite there being far fewer iPhones out there than Android smartphones, AAPL’s App Store revenue shows that those iPhone users are far more likely to pay for a game. Android users had to wait until last week to finally get their hands on the title. And that’s been the model that many premium app developers continue to follow, despite Google Play’s numbers lead. If it’s a high-profile app that cost a lot to develop and you expect people to pay for it, the Apple App Store tends to get it first — if Google Play gets it at all. Will the Shift to Android Dominance Hurt Apple? Services — which includes App Store revenue — has become an increasingly important division for AAPL. It posted the highest growth of any of Apple’s divisions last year and AAPL netted $3 billion in revenue from app downloads last December alone. Is that revenue in jeopardy? That shouldn’t be the case, for three reasons.

The App Accelerator in Bengaluru, which is the home of India’s start-up scene, will inspire the next generation of Indian developers, the company said. “Each week, Apple experts will lead briefings and provide one-on-one app reviews for developers,” the statement said adding that the facility will also provide support and guidance on Swift -- Apple’s programming language created to build apps for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. Swift, says Apple, enables developers to write safer, reliable code, save time and create richer app experiences. “India has one of the most vibrant and exciting iOS developer communities in the world and already tens of thousands of developers in India make apps for iOS. The App Accelerator Bengaluru will help to further enrich the iOS app ecosystem,” it said. It will feature Apple technology evangelists who will provide specialised briefings for over 500 developers every week. They will also offer detailed app analysis feedback for developers as they work to enhance their apps, the statement added. “Each week, Apple’s team will guide developers on design best practices, refine their skills to create amazing iOS apps and transform the quality and performance of their apps on iOS,” it added. tags Apple iOS app developers Bengaluru App Accelerator more from business Power Min crosses 13000 village electrification milestone Mar 31, 2017 16:08 IST Investors cheer as Sensex gains 17% in 2016-17 on reforms, global cues Mar 31, 2017 16:07 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still a Value Play The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement Jefferies Thinks Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is a Buy — Should You? View All Posts Gotham Asset Management co-founder Joel Greenblatt certainly thinks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) provides good value for buyers of AAPL stock. Source: Shutterstock In a recent interview, Greenblatt talked about how expensive the markets are at the present moment: “When we think about the S&P 500, we go back over the last 26 years where we have good data and look at the entire market from a perspective of bottom’s up valuation. Right now the S&P 500 is in roughly the 17th percentile of expensive during those 26 years, meaning it’s been cheaper 83% of the time.” To beat the index Greenblatt buys the cheapest S&P 500 stocks and shorts the most expensive. And wouldn’t you know it, but AAPL stock is one of his largest holdings — 31st out of 925 positions in a $7.8 billion portfolio — at 337,952 shares as of December 31, 2016. For Greenblatt, it’s all about cash flow and the price you pay for it: “We’ve owned Apple for a long time … They generate lots of cash flow, and we don’t have to pay a big price for it. That’s what’s attracted recent investors like Warren Buffett, where he’s looking at both that mix between growth and value … We figure out what a business is worth and try to pay a lot less.” Is AAPL Stock a Value Stock? He believes the markets are still valuing AAPL stock as a hardware company when in fact it’s very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer also feels Apple’s service business is underappreciated by investors, thoughts I shared with readers in early February when Apple was trading around $129; up almost 10% since then. InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau recently discussed how Apple stock hasn’t come close to peaking. I couldn’t agree more, which is why I asked the rhetorical question back in February of how AAPL stock got to $200. Apple’s service revenue accounted for about 9% of overall sales in Q1 2017, growing 18% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Annualize that and we’re talking about almost $29 billion. That’s huge when you consider Piper Jeffrey analyst Gene Munster estimated in 2016 that Apple’s gross margins on its service revenues were 60% and that operating margins could hit 50% in the coming year. If that’s accurate, Apple’s operating profits in fiscal 2017 could be as high as $15 billion or $2.86 per share for this small part of its business.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Analyst: Apple Investors Should Heed These Major Warning Signs March 31, 2017 6:44am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Tony Sagami: Every one of my four children has an iPhone, but I’m a committed android (Samsung Galaxy) user. Why? Mainly because my aging eyes prefer a bigger screen and because I’m too cheap to pay the premium prices that iPhones command. The iPhone fans turned out in droves last week when Apple opened three new retail stores: Miami, Florida; Cologne Germany; and Nanjing, China. Apple store openings have turned into big media events with thousands of customers eagerly waiting in line to be a part of the excitement. In China, customers started queuing on Thursday, two days BEFORE the Saturday opening. Apple understands the gigantic opportunity in China. In 2016, it sold a whopping 476 million smartphones in China. To put that 476 million in perspective, it is 2.86 times the Apple phones sold in the U.S. market. Moreover, the size of the smartphone market in China is huge — 33% of the world’s total sales — and it grew by 11.4% in 2016. No wonder Apple is aggressively expanding into China. The new Nanjing store stands as its 41st foothold in the Land of the Red Dragon. However, all those Apple stores aren’t translating into booming sales. Apple sold 18% fewer iPhones in China in 2016 — 43.77 million — than it did in 2015. And it saw market share slide to less than 10%, making it only the fifth-largest mobile-phone seller in China. Yes…fifth place! After… 1st Place: Hauwei, which sold 2.02 million units in January alone and which has an impressive 23% of the Chinese market. 2nd Place: Oppo. 3rd Place: Vivo. 4th Place: Xiaomi. Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have a combined market share of 55.5%. The reasons for Apple’s struggle are simple: China is full of cost-conscious consumers, like me, and all of the above four companies offer substantially cheaper smartphones. In general terms, Chinese smartphones offer approximately the same level of technology and features for half the price of an iPhone. Yup … half the price. My point is that Apple is doing very poorly in the largest, most-important smartphone market in the world. And that has some serious long-term implications for Apple investors. If you own Apple shares, you should consider the following: Trouble Sign #1: Apple shares have appreciated by more than 30% (market cap gain of $150 billion!) since Samsung’s phones started catching on fire. Samsung’s global sales fell from 83.8 million to 72.5 million in the last year. But Samsung will return to recover some of its lost market share and that is going to put even more pressure on Apple. Trouble Sign #2: Apple is spending about $6 billion a quarter to buy back its stock. Hey, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with stock buybacks. Heck, I think they’re great! However, a thriving tech innovator grows its profits through rising sales, not a falling share count. Trouble Sign #3: The once red-hot iPad isn’t so hot anymore. Sales of iPad fell to 13.1 million in the fourth quarter from 16.1 million during the same period a year earlier, an 18.6% decline. Moreover, sales are so bad that Apple chopped prices in desperation to goose sales. Trouble Sign #4: Did you know that Al Gore sits on the Apple board of directors? And did you know that Gore sold $29 million worth of his Apple stock in February? I’m not talking about an inconsequential number of shares, either. Gore sold 215,437 shares and now owns 230,137 shares, which means that he sold almost 50% of what he owned. Whenever an insider dumps half of his stock … pay attention! Trouble Sign #5: $5 billion for headquarters … really? Apple will soon open its new 2.8 million-square-foot, ring-shaped headquarters. I’m sure the millennials will love this new high-tech campus … but come on! $5 billion for a building?! Trouble Sign #6: Over the past 12 months, Apple reported per-share-earnings of $8.35, which means that it is now selling for 17-times earnings. That may not sound expensive, but it is the most richly valued that Apple has been in the last five years. If you are an Apple investor, I’m not suggesting that you rush out and sell all your Apple shares tomorrow morning. What I am saying is that Apple isn’t the red-hot growth stock that it used to be and that smart investors should have a strategy to protect their gains if more signs of trouble continue to pop up. The mobile, smartphone market isn’t dead. Quite the contrary; it is going to explode, but Apple is far from the best way to invest in it. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell $0.4 (-0.28%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 24.27%, versus a 5.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The world’s biggest contract manufacturer of electronics reported a 30 percent increase in net income to NT$68.8 billion ($2.3 billion) in the three months ended December, according to Bloomberg calculations derived from previously released data. That surpasses the NT$48.8 billion average of analysts’ estimates. Hon Hai, better known as Foxconn Technology Group, derives about half its sales from Apple, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The world’s most valuable company shipped an unprecedented 78.3 million iPhones during the December quarter, despite its latest device representing a modest update on its predecessor. Optimism around Apple’s iPhone for 2017 -- the 10th anniversary of the iconic device -- has driven the Taiwanese company’s stock close to a decade-high. A turnaround at Japan’s Sharp Corp., which Hon Hai and other units of Foxconn bought last August, is also contributing to the bottom line. The Osaka-based company last month reported its first quarterly profit in over two years. “The growth came mainly from current iPhone products. New iPhone production will continue to drive Hon Hai’s sales when it starts to make the devices in coming quarters,” said Annabelle Hsu, a supply chain analyst for IDC based in Taipei. “Also, Hon Hai’s investments in other areas are starting to pay back. The business of robots and robotic arms is doing very well.” Hon Hai has defied a flat-lining mobile market on expectations Apple will use that milestone to introduce its most advanced and popular device yet. Its revenue could climb 43 percent in the second half of this year from the first as the company starts to assemble the next-generation gadget, Citigroup Inc. analyst William Yang wrote ahead of the earnings. The Taiwanese company’s biggest client may ship 110 million next-generation iPhones in the second half of 2017, up from his earlier estimate of 100-million units. Among the bells and whistles anticipated in the next iPhone are a sharper, power-efficient organic light-emitting diode screen; glass casing; wireless charging; a second front-facing camera; and enhanced waterproofing, according to Citigroup’s Yang. Hon Hai’s valuation hasn’t quite reflected the full impact of the new iPhone, particularly if it becomes the sole assembler for an OLED-equipped device, he said.

Billionaire founder Terry Gou is re-tooling Foxconn for the future, installing robots to shore up its manufacturing prowess, while investing in emergent fields from virtual reality to artificial intelligence. He spearheaded the acquisition of Sharp, transforming the ailing Japanese giant into a company that’s more than tripled in value and is now jointly investing billions.  Shares of Hon Hai finished mostly unchanged in Taipei at NT$91 on Friday, before the results were released.  “The expected iPhone shipment growth for 2017 and 2018 should be a growth engine for Hon Hai’s earnings,” David Hsu and Raymond Hsu, analysts with Taiwan Ratings, wrote in a report ahead of the earnings release. — With assistance by Yuan Gao Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Bengaluru | Published:March 31, 2017 4:34 pm Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Philip Schiller said the company does not try and make some devices more affordable in certain markets. (Image source: Apple) If you were hoping that Apple phones will have cheaper price points whenever the tech major starts local manufacturing in India, you could be in for some disappointment. On a short visit to India to launch App Accelerator Bengaluru, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Philip Schiller said the company does not try and make some devices more affordable in certain markets. Terming product pricing a complex affair, Schiller told indianexpress.com that Apple has a strategy of pricing the products globally. “We don’t try to price to it differently in differently markets and make it as affordable as possible in each market. We don’t say let’s try and make it more affordable in this market in comparison to another,” he said. Schiller explained there are a number of factors that go into how a product is priced. “There is the cost of the product, there is the cost of the channel, the tax situation… many things that go into building up what is the price of the product.” A made for India product like what the Chinese smartphone makers have been offering is also unlikely. “What we try to do and has worked well for Apple is to create products for the entire world that has benefits of that engineering focus and that scale, while also making sure they excel at the needs of the local market.” Also read: Apple’s first App Accelerator starts in Bengaluru, Phil Schiller says will boost developer community Schiller joined Apple in 1997. He said not many might remember how Apple was the first company to include all of its languages for releases around the world on one product. “That allowed us the flexibility to build products for the whole world. We try to understand what is best for our products in India and bring that learning to all our products,” he said, adding that this would mean being better at localised language and user experience to supporting the different fonts and dictionaries to doing a better job on maps and navigation, better job with music and media. “We want to do all of that to ensure that our products are best for the user here, but then that is something that is already built into the product that we deliver worldwide.” While he is not involved with the manufacturing plans for India, Schiller said there was a very competent team working with the government to get the best product to users in India. On Apple’s older products still being popular and even driving volumes, he said customer preferences vary regionally and that is why they offer customers the complete range in each market.

Everyone who uses a computer or any other computing device—tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, game consoles—know about bugs. These are glitches in an operating system or application that can cause something to go wrong. The name was given when a malfunction on an early electromechanical (pre-transistor) computer was found to have been caused by a moth. Bugs can be just an annoyance, or they can prevent an app or operating system from performing its tasks. You may find that, say, a window doesn’t display as it should, which is a small problem, or that a specific app doesn’t run, or can’t accomplish a feature you need. In some cases, you can move on and continue what you wanted to do. Some bugs are random, and only happen occasionally, but others are “reproducible;” they occur every time you perform a certain sequence of actions. No software is bug-free. Like typos in books, there are always bugs to be found. (I have formulated the Law of the Preservation of Typographical Errors, which states that, when proofreading a book, “For every typographical error that is discovered, another one will generate spontaneously.”) We accept that software has bugs, and, in most cases, we live with it. But there are bugs that prevent us from using our software or hardware, and those are very annoying. Developers work hard to deal with bugs, and Apple is no stranger to this problem. To manage bugs and software, Apple has the Apple Bug Reporter at bugreport.apple.com. This portal allows developers and users of Apple’s public beta software to file bug reports, explaining what went wrong, with which app, and under which circumstances. It’s a useful tool, but not without problems. Developers have long complained about Apple’s Bug Reporter, and for cause. While it was redesigned in 2013, its interface harkens back to Apple’s Aqua interface for the early versions of Mac OS X combined, perhaps, with iOS 6. I refrain from showing screenshots of this interface, because developer accounts are governed by a non-disclosure agreement, but it’s depressing to see this design. It’s not just that it doesn’t look good, it’s also impractical. The text fields are all small, holding at most three lines of text, and they are not resizable. Popup menus are frustrating, because you cannot navigate them from the keyboard. And entering text in the form that Bug Reporter uses seems perilous; it’s the kind of form where you want to make sure you’ve got a copy of your text, just in case something goes wrong. For this reason, many developers write their bug reports in a text editor, then paste the text into the various fields. Once you’ve filed a bug, it proceeds down a twisted road of uncertainty. You may never hear back from Apple. You may see bugs you’ve filed years ago that have neither resolution nor feedback. They’re not closed—which means they’ve been addressed—nor has Apple asked you for any further information. That’s if your bug isn’t a duplicate of one someone else has filed. For many if not most bugs, you’ll get a reply saying: “Engineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.” Or Apple will tell you that the feature “works as expected,” which is a passive-aggressive way of telling you that your bug really is a feature. This, too, is frustrating. You may spend half an hour writing a bug report, assembling logs, and preparing screenshots, only to find that Apple already has a report for that same bug. If you could search existing bug reports before filing a bug, you would save a lot of time, both for yourself, and for Apple. But you can’t see the bugs that others have filed. A private initiative called Open Radar allows developers to file their bugs in a public database, so others can search for their own bugs, but not everyone uses this. (Radar is the internal name of Apple’s bug reporting system.) Bug reporting is essential to the longevity of software, and Apple should make this process smoother, and also provide more feedback. Many developers spend a lot of time reporting bugs, and feel irked by the lack of response. If Apple improved the Bug Reporter, they would, perhaps, get more and better bug reports. We’d all benefit from that. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

This post is here to remind you that today is March 31st, which means it’s your last chance to pick up some USB-C gear from Apple at a reasonable price. For reference, here’s the list of all of Apple’s discounted stuff, with some helpful links. USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Additionally, all third-party USB-C peripherals sold by Apple receive around a 25 percent price cut. Only Apple’s USB-C charging cables aren’t included in the discount. And while there are plenty of third-party accessories out there, Apple’s own branded ones — while typically expensive — tend to offer a certain measure of safety and reliability, making them worth the purchase if prices are equal (like they are with the current discount).

Cloud storage roundup Ben Lovejoy - Oct. 3rd 2013 6:07 am PT @benlovejoy iCloud Apple iOS Tips and Tricks Android Comments (61) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With former MobileMe customers losing their additional 20GB of free storage a couple of days ago, there are probably a bunch of new people eyeing the paid iCloud upgrade options and wondering whether or not to hand over their cash. So we thought it would be a useful to take a look at the other major cloud storage services out there, to see how they compare. As none of them are trying to hide the filesystem in the way Apple does, they all essentially work in the same way: providing you with a virtual online drive that you treat just like a local folder. There are also OS X and iOS apps for each. Let’s start with the obvious: if you want something that is totally integrated into both OS X and iOS, and which Just Works, then iCloud is king. Although the 5GB you get free doesn’t sound like a lot, you actually get more than this in practice – because Apple doesn’t count the space used by any of your iTunes purchases (apps, music, movies/TV shows or books), nor does it count the 1000 most recent photos you get to store in Photostream. If most of the content you want to store came from Apple, and all you want to do additionally is sync your contacts, calendar, notes and so on, the free storage is probably all you need. iCloud is also a seamless way to store documents if you use Apple’s own iWork software: Pages, Numbers and Keynote. By opting to save documents on iCloud, they are automatically available to you from your Mac(s), iPad and iPhone – as well as on the web. But if you have a lot of documents, you can pretty soon start bumping up against that 5GB limit. Which is where iCloud’s costs and limitations start to show up …  NordVPN First, costs. After that first free 5GB, here’s what Apple charges for upgrades: 10 additional GB (15 GB total): $20/year 20 additional GB (25 GB total): $40/year 50 additional GB (55 GB total): $100/year Those prices are pretty high compared to competitor services. But even if you’re happy to pay a premium for the convenience of a one-stop solution, there’s a second problem: iCloud only allows you to store certain types of document. Microsoft Office documents are supported, but you have to convert them to Pages/Numbers/Keynote to edit them, and if you use non-standard software like me (I love Scrivener for writing, for example), you’re out of luck. The good news is that there are now a whole host of cloud-based storage services, most all of them based on the freemium model, which means – just like iCloud – your initial allocation of space is free. I’ve taken a look here at the four biggest competitors to iCloud. All prices are shown per year, with any $99-style pricing rounded up by a dollar for ease of comparison. Dropbox was the first cloud storage service to achieve mass-market adoption. It’s tried-and-tested, and offers some very convenient touches – like a Public folder that allows you to share a file with anyone you choose by right-clicking to copy a link. It does, however, have the most miserly amount of free space – just 2GB. There are no limits on individual file-sizes, and a great many apps have built-in Dropbox support – so half the time you don’t even need to manually access your Dropbox folder. We also recently did a how-to on using Dropbox to store your photos. It’s not the cheapest service out there, but it is the ‘nobody ever got fired for buying IBM’ safe option. Free space: 2GB (but up to 16GB available via referrals) 50GB: N/a 100GB: $100 200GB: $200 Larger options available Compared to iCloud: $100/year buys you 100GB instead of 55GB Google has a finger in pretty much every pie, so it’s no surprise that it offers its own cloud storage service in the form of Google Drive. If you have a Google account (and, let’s face it, even as an Apple user it’s hard not to have one these days), you already have Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com. You get a generous 15GB of free space, and as you can upload files of up to 10GB, you’re unlikely to hit any file-size problems. Google Drive also offers as much storage as anyone could ever want, with options of up to a massive 16TB (at an equally massive $9600 a year). But the more modest paid options are very competitively priced. Free space: 15GB 50GB: N/a 100GB: $60 200GB: $120 Larger options available Compared to iCloud: $60/year buys you 100GB, instead of $100 buying you 55GB SkyDrive is Microsoft’s offering. As the Windows equivalent of iCloud, this would be the no-brainer option for Windows users, but it’s equally suitable for Mac users. Again, if you have a Microsoft account (including the confusing number of legacy accounts, like Hotmail), you will already have a Skydrive account at https://skydrive.live.com. You get 7GB free, with paid options of up to 200GB. Perhaps surprisingly, SkyDrive is the cheapest of all the major cloud storage services. Microsoft also gives you your free 7GB on top of the paid space, hence the odd numbers below. Free space: 7GB 57GB: $25 107GB: $50 207GB: $100 Compared to iCloud: $100/year buys you 207GB instead of 55GB Finally, SugarSync, though less well-known, is one of the oldest services around, having launched in 2008 (and with a photo-only service dating back to 2006). It’s a little different to most cloud storage services in that it is, as the name suggests, designed to synchronise files between devices. It can do this in a more flexible and powerful way than a simple online drive shared between devices, and this fact is reflected in its pricing. The bad news is that there’s no free storage option with SugarSync. You can, however, get a 30-day free trial of its 60GB service. Pricing is very similar to Dropbox but with the more powerful device synchronisation options. Free space: None (30-day free trial with 60GB) 60GB: $75 100GB: $100 250GB: $250 Larger options available Compared to iCloud: $100/year buys you 100GB instead of 55GB Which service offers the best deal? If you can manage with 15GB, then Google Drive gets you that for free. You can also get up to 16GB by referring friends to Dropbox: you get 500MB extra for each friend you refer, even if they only take the free option. If you need more space, then SkyDrive offers the most competitive pricing, while SugarSync offers the most features. 0.000000 0.000000 Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

Kyle Sus (@Hawk_Ky) - 3 years ago Reply I definitely recommend looking at Bitcasa as well. Unlimited storage for a pretty reasonable price. They also have really great iOS apps too. Paul Threatt - 3 years ago Reply Another vote for Bitcasa. MaximumPC just compared TONS of services in their latest issue, and Bitcasa came in as a strong leader. Their $99/year unlimited space service seems like a great deal, and their upload download speeds were good. Paul Threatt - 3 years ago Reply Oh yea, and Bitcasa uses AES-256 to encrypt your files. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply You guys are ahead of me: I’m going to be writing a feature on online backup services, which will feature Bicasa :-) You can, of course, use it as a dumb cloud storage service too. lycius84 - 3 years ago Reply I use SkyDrive simply because I got the 25GB free as an early adopter. If I ever run out of room I’ll use Google Drive, as you said, who doesn’t have a Google account. I use iCloud for basic iPhone/iPad needs. Great article by the way. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Thanks, Lycius Michael Napier (@NapMan) - 3 years ago Reply I also have 25GB and use Skydrive most of the time. I just wish the iOS app had a way to automatically upload all photos like Dropbox does. I hate having to go through and check every single photo to upload it. lycius84 - 3 years ago What I did on my PC is: Installed iCloud Control Panel, made the Photo Stream folder be inside the SkyDrive folder on the PC as I use the SkyDrive on my PCs. Then when the photos on the phone get uploaded to Photo Stream and my PC gets turned on, the photos go to SkyDrive. I know is not an instant thing, but I don’t have a need to back up as soon as I take a picture. Gabriel Rozendo - 3 years ago you can use ifttt ( https://ifttt.com ) so you can upload each new photo (or front camera or rear camera or screenshot or new photo in album) automatically for one or more cloud service. There are some options, including skydrive. It is a automatically option directly from iphone without user interaction. Gabriel Rozendo - 3 years ago and I have a google legacy plan + 20gb $5/yr and I use picasa in my pc, so there’s a option, when iphone is connected to my pc, picasa automatically upload to a folder and cloud photo service (g+ photos). Even the G+ ios app in iPhone can automatically upload every photo to G+ Photos like backup (in options you can choose if only wifi or 3g/wifi for photos and for videos) and it being in privately mode, so if you like you can share after, already on the internet… Stefano Trono - 3 years ago Reply I recommend to have a look at Wuala. 5Gb free, up to 15 by referals. tpetaccia - 3 years ago Reply Another SkyDrive tidbit .. if you are an Office 365 subscriber .. that includes 20 Gb of additional SkyDrive space. tpetaccia - 3 years ago Reply addendum .. like lycius84 ..

Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Useful to know, thanks tpetaccia - 3 years ago Sorry .. bad math .. total is 45 Gb .. they didn’t add 25 to the 7 .. just made it 25 .. still nice cloud space Τριαντάφυλλος Καραγιάννης - 3 years ago Reply As much as I like Apple’s online services when it comes to backing up my iPhone stuff (contacts and the contents of a few odd apps), I dread the thought of using iCloud to store + organise my files. iCloud’s idea of storing files per file type is in stark contrast with my (and I believe many will agree) habit to store files per topic / project. So I have one folder with all the files related to task A, then another for task B. iWork stuff, images, PDFs, scripts etc. iCloud takes all that and breaks things up per application. ARGH!!! You have a few Pages files from task A and a few from task B under Pages (potentially grouped together per task), all visible only through THAT app. Likewise for numbers and so on. Now, if I have a few images I want to store in either task, bam. I have to attach them to some Pages document or something. Or what if one time I want to open the file with one app, then next time with another one? Store copies in each app? No Apple, thanks. That’s NOT my idea of organising stuff, and for that reason I’ll stick to pretty much any other service (I use Google Drive a lot, but I’ve used most of them). So, iCloud: good for backing up your phone, terrible for anything that needs even BASIC organisation Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply I’m with you on that, though I do use Pages as a very handy way to continue articles when I’m on the move. For example, when writing this, I started in WordPress on my MBP, pasted into Pages on the same computer then continued in Pages on my MBA before doing the reverse when I got back. Leslie Hall - 3 years ago What’s an MBA? Feeling quite ignorant…thanks! Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Sorry, MacBook Air Ryan Gibson - 3 years ago Reply I’m looking forward to a time when photos stored in iCloud don’t have to be physically stored on my devices (like Facebook). This is one reason while I still pay for Dropbox and wouldn’t consider a larger iCloud plan. claytonkimball - 3 years ago Reply For longtime MobileMe users like my mother it is the email that really eats into your 5gb. I feel lucky I went the gmail route for email, using icloud only for syncing contacts/calendars and backups. Chookalana (@Chookalana) - 3 years ago Reply I use both box.com (10GB free) and copy.com (15GB free). Carter M - 3 years ago Reply What about Cubby? I have have an account but still use DropBox mostly since I have 26GB of free space. Cubby I’m actually looking at for a paid service. 100GB for $48 for a year. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Yep, there are loads of alternatives out there. I would personally tend to stick with the big names from a reliability perspective. Chris Giordano (GraveSpy720) - 3 years ago Reply This is a great article, but the Google Drive info, I believe, is incorrect. If you have a Google account in general you get 25 GB free. This is because they removed the “walls” of storage between your gmail, google drive, and other google services so all “platforms” now share 25GB of storage. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Google says you get 15GB, but many of these services have offered higher amounts at different stages, so earlier adopters tend to have more Gabriel Rozendo - 3 years ago I use a Google legacy plan, +20gb $5/yr. Google Storage shows: 36 GB total storage Your plan 20 GB Early adopter bonus 1 GB Paid user bonus 15 GB After they changed plans, free storage had incresead. but it is still a good deal for me… Stephen Funck - 3 years ago Reply The day after I put my Priority list on iCloud, it was dinged and would not open. There is no back up, no way to find the older version. I was totally out of luck. Fortunately I had not turned on my Macbook so I was able to find it on that time machine. I would never use iCloud for anything I needed to keep. Miguel Gomez - 3 years ago Reply What about Box.net? Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply There are literally scores of these services, and it would be impossible to cover them all. This piece is aimed more at those who know there are other options out there but haven’t had a chance to look at any of them. Richard Getz (@RichGetz) - 3 years ago Reply Does the Google service just sit on NSA servers? :P danbridgland - 3 years ago Reply I’d happily part my camera roll backup from iCloud but is there a seamless cloud backup solution out for the iOS camera roll that doesn’t involve regular manual interaction? I have 12GB of free Dropbox storage, Sadly I currently have 19GB in iOS photos and video I’d quite like to keep the last 6 months with iCloud backup (not photo stream) and store the remainder in the cloud… Again without having to manually interact with the process. Is that currently available anywhere? Kevin A (@kevinsky) - 3 years ago Reply Copy.com seems like a pretty solid offering too, though I haven’t used it enough to know if it has any issues. You get 15gb free to start, and can get 5gb for each referral – not sure how much of a limit there is on that. You also get another 5gb for signing up via someone else’s referral link, but I won’t post mine because I know that’s probably taboo :) Todd Lagerberg (@okayTodd) - 3 years ago Reply How can you leave out PogoPlug Cloud? It is $49.99 a year and give you UNLIMITED storage! This is the best deal out there. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply ‘Unlimited’ is generally shorthand for ‘See small-print for details’ :-) Barry Dudley - 3 years ago Reply Completely recommend Cubby, the offering from LogMeIn, It works well in the background, iPad and iphone apps work well and there are options to lock specified folders for added security. You can get it here: https://cub.by/i/01_6uN-4r0VInj Jael X Baez - 3 years ago Reply I understand that Apple wants Cloud to be more about syncing and not so much about the storing. And in my opinion, no other service syncs everything as seamlessly as iCloud. But I’m sure many iCloud users, such as myself, are very dissatisfied with their storage features. It’s all separated by file type, and you can only upload files to the iCloud that are supported by Apple apps. Lame. My solution: Add one more app to iCloud. It can be called, iDrive, iVault, iLocker, or whatever they want to call it. This app will strictly act as a basic storage service that allows you to store any file you want and organize it in how many folders and sub-folders you want! This would work just like Google Drive and SkyDrive, and the files stored here would be completely detached from the syncing side of iCloud (such as Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.) That way, Apple can have their cake and eat it too: they can specialize in seamless syncing between all devices AND provide the open storage features that all other competitors provide. They’ll be even better because they’d be the only one to offer both at such a quality level. Of course, it goes without saying that they would have to offer MUCH BETTER choices for storage plans!! Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply A lot of people miss iDrive for exactly that reason. pedroquintero - 3 years ago What about the possibilities of sharing documents. iDrive had that feature long ago. And it was my most used one. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Dropbox is very good for sharing documents: put the file in your public folder and right-click it to copy the public link Clark Tiberius (@Boardplank) - 3 years ago Reply Bitcasa & Spideroak for Anything private. All the others just fall into the NSA or Other can & will & do* scan as needed. Different needs for different law-abiding people. I personally, will choose to keep as much control of My Data as possible, and as I choose. Palmer Paul (@pzp1997) - 3 years ago Reply BitTorrent Sync is pretty good too, as well as mega.co.nz another option is Box The Girl Nextdoor. (@SomeYellowChick) - 3 years ago Reply What about the service Copy? 15gb for free as well Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Yes, there are loads of alternatives – we can’t cover them all, so focused here on the main players Brian Victor - 3 years ago Reply Dropbox for on-the-go and certain critical backups that you absolutely cannot afford to lose ever. I really wish Apple offered what Dropbox does: file organization, access to deleted files for a 30 days, easy file sharing, that sort of thing. In fact, I’ve wondered why Apple doesn’t buy Dropbox up. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply Apple seems pretty committed to the idea that a file system is a 20th Century concept … Ryan Gibson - 3 years ago I think it’s a matter of controlling content, how people use it, and in the end how people buy it. Total freedom of storage allows users to store and access content in more flexible ways. I’m thinking of HTPCs off the top of my head… pedroquintero - 3 years ago Reply I “back you up” in that proposal. If Apple is “uncappable” of offering a higher experience of cloud service, they should buy Dropbox or Box (which offered iOS users a 50gb lifetime storage… only to screw it with a limit of 100mb per file) Nicolas Grilly (@ngrilly) - 3 years ago Reply Apple tried to buy Dropbox, without success. The story is told in Steve Jobs biography. William Luckie - 3 years ago Reply Did you forget Dolly Drive? Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply There are many, many such services, so I covered the biggest names Teatum Jones - 3 years ago Reply Can anyone tell me what is the best option to automatically back up directly from my iPhoto’s and videos all of which are on my iPad and iPhone…and will keep them synced between my devices too? Or is iCloud the only option to do that? Ie. would I have to upload all of my photos/videos from iPhoto into google drive in order to use the google drive as that option? Just stalling at the moment because of icloud’s high costs but I don’t want to risk loosing valuable files whilst I wait! Thanks! Randy Sigler - 3 years ago Reply I believe Dropbox actually syncs your photos from your iOS device if you allow account interaction. I am about to test this feature myself 😉 (https://www.dropbox.com/help/289) I have a 16GB iPad that I have loaded several times, and then cannot delete them without losing the photos (30 days) from iCloud if I forget to “manage” them to a real storage cloud. Larry McJunkin - 3 years ago Reply A little late to the party here, but one very important thing that is always left out of every review I read about iCloud is its organizational inadequacies. I’m a huge Apple fan, and I would “rather” convert all my MS Office for Mac files to iWorks files, except for one problem. I need some organization. If I have a project named “Test” that includes some spreadsheets, documents, PDF files, and text files I’m relegated to adding a “Test” folder (in iCloud) in Pages, Numbers, Preview, and TextEdit. At least in Google Drive (and all the other cloud storage services) I simply have one folder named “Test” and throw all my files into it. Until Apple figures out a way to tie all this together…they won’t have my cloud business…even though I’d like them to. Randy Sigler - 3 years ago Reply I really like Dropbox features such as sync with my 1Password and Dropbox. “Dropbox is the best cross-platform sync solution you can use right now with 1Password. It allows you to sync your 1Password data securely with 1Password for Mac/Windows on computers and on mobile devices; iOS, Android and Windows Phone! In addition, Dropbox also lets you use 1PasswordAnywhere on their website, allowing you to use the web interface of 1Password on any computers with a modern web browser.” Hédel Nuñez Bolívar (@hedelnb) - 3 years ago Reply I offer you update the post, because is really very complete, but Google Drive cut prices the last month (http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html) and now you can get 1TB for U$D 9.99 / month, that is 120 USD/year for 1 TB!! Also remember that space is shared for Gmail, Drive and Google+ Photos. I use it with my domain, and even if I hate ‘Big Brothers’ like Google, I must say they have a very good service. Ben Lovejoy - 3 years ago Reply That is indeed a very good deal – thanks for the update Andy Cobb - 3 years ago Reply Hi Ben Lovejoy, Here I will like to introduce you to Oogwave.com, simpler Team collaboration and File sharing solution. Great for SMB and teams within. Free to start. Will be happy to show you or answer question. andy.cobb@oogwave.com (solution specialist, Oogwave) D.A.H.

Tomek Bawey - 3 years ago Reply with copy.com you get 15GB right away and unlimited referrals +5GB each. registering https://copy.com. Other features are cool too: mobile / desktop clients, versioning, fair sharing (15GB shared folder's disk usage is split among the collaborators, making it eg. 5GB for each if they are three). ncacace - 1 day ago Reply If You purchase the premium iOS devices with the most memory you should get more free Apple iCloud space.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Samsung Galaxy S8: Top 8 trump card features that make Galaxy S7 heir superior to Apple iPhone 7 series March 31, 2017 15:57 IST By Rohit KVN Samsung Galaxy S8 series Infinity DisplaySamsung Newsroom Leading smartphone-maker Samsung on March 29 launched the new Galaxy S8 series. The initial reaction from the tech critics and fans has been overwhelmingly great. We believe the South Korean company will definitely shed the proverbial monkey (Galaxy Note7) off its back and look forward for a prosperous 2017. Thanks to the void left by the suspension of Galaxy Note7 sale, Apple raked in huge revenue from not-so-inspiring iPhone 7 series in the holiday season (October-December 2016). Also read: Android-creator Andy Rubin teases enticing new phone; here's what you need to know about iPhone X, Galaxy S8 challenger With the launch of the Galaxy S8, the battle for smartphone market supremacy just got fiercer, as the former comes with a boat load of new features, which make Apple iPhone 7 look outdated already. Top 8 features that give clear edge for Samsung Galaxy S8 series over the Apple iPhone 7 series: Dual-edge Infinity Display: The most interesting aspect of Samsung Galaxy S8 series is its gorgeously designed screen. The company, which aptly calls it the 'Infinity Display' is a game changing feature. Although Samsung has increased the height of the display in terms of dimensions, 80 percent of the space is dedicated for viewing purposely only. It has even taken off the "Samsung" branding, which used to dot on top every flagship phone. With this, users will find it handy while using the spilt screen feature to type message, while watching a YouTube video. The screen has been stretched in the top and bottom sides, while horizontally, it cascades to the back, leaving almost zero-space between the display and the chassis. This apparently has created 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which no other smartphone in the industry can boast off. [Note: Recently released LG G6 with FullVision display boasts 18:9 aspect ratio] And, also its WQHD+ (2960x1440p) resolution screen, is another industry first, which guarantees ultimate cinematic viewing experience. Further, the Galaxy S8 series is the world's first smartphone to boast Mobile HDR Premium certification awarded by UHD Alliance. Samsung DeX: Extending the use of wide screen on Galaxy S8, the company has launched a companion accessory Samsung DeX (Destop eXtension) dock, which when the phone is stationed on it can transform a monitor to a large screen Galaxy S8. Add a couple of peripherals in to mix, such as a mouse and a keyboard, you get to have a full fledged Android-powered computer. It will offer new adaptive user experience on a big screen with optimised look and behaviour of apps as per usage preferences of the customer to provide a PC-like experience. Samsung Dex peripheralsSamsung Newsroom To start working, users simply insert their Samsung smartphone into the DeX Station, which connects the smartphone to an HDMI compatible monitor, and connect to any Bluetooth-enabled, USB or RF-type keyboard and mouse. You can perform basic functions ranging from composing mail to editing Microsoft Document, create power point presentation and attach it and send it on mail, and do more activities. Guess what, Samsung DeX via Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which will be made available by the end of June, will allow users to remotely and securely access virtual desktops through partner solutions, including Citrix, VMware and Amazon Web Services. Samsung DeX comes with two USB 2.0 ports, an Ethernet port, USB type-C power-in and a cooling fan. The DeX Station also features Adaptive Fast Charging (AFC) technology to charge Samsung smartphone while docked. Iris & Face Recognition: Samsung had already demoed the capabilities of Iris scanner in the Galaxy Note7. However, the company, in a bid to make Galaxy S8 more secure, has added face recognition technology. Samsung Galaxy S8 series with Iris scanner featureSamsung Newsroom "The technology works by utilizing an immense amount of data to recognize patterns, such as small differences in facial features," Samsung claims. With the dual bio-metric software, smartphone detects, aligns, extracts and compares facial landmark points such as the width of the user's nose or the distance between their eyes to stored data to grant or deny access. Samsung Galaxy S8 series with Face Recognition featureSamsung Newsroom "As the user continues to utilize the feature more and more, the phone gets better at recognizing them, despite small changes in the angle or position of their face during the verification process," Samsung added. Bluetooth 5.0: This is another major game changing feature, Samsung, probably not wanting to elongate the keynote presentation, skipped to make a mention in Galaxy S8 launch event. With Bluetooth 5.0 certification, the Galaxy S8 series will be able transfer files between connected phones for up to 2mbps wirelessly. And also the distance range has quadrupled, meaning the Galaxy S8 owners can maintain connectivity between compatible headphones, speakers and fitness trackers, for up to a staggering 800 feet. Another notable aspect of this feature is that the Galaxy S8 will also be able to stream audio to two Bluetooth headsets or speakers at the same time. Fast & Wireless charging technology: Fast charging technology is not that new in the smartphone industry. It's been here for more than two years and yet Apple, a company that revolutionized smartphone industry in 2007, which eventually led to downfall two biggest mobile-makers Nokia and BlackBerry, has not embraced the fast and wireless charging yet. Whereas, Samsung previously accused of copying Apple features, has leapfrogged the arch rival, in this aspect. Gigabit LTE connectivity: Even Gigabit LTE connectivity support is also not that new in the smartphone industry. Earlier in year, Chinese telecommunication major ZTE and also Sony unveiled smartphones—Gigabit and Xperia XZ Premium, respectively boasting this feature. But, Samsung, if it keeps the promise of releasing the phone on April 21, will beat them and become the world's first commercial smartphone to support the Gigabit LTE, which allows device owners to download files at an astronomical speed of 1gbps. 3.5mm headphone jack: Many think that having 3.5mm audio jack port might not give Galaxy S8 any edge over Apple iPhone 7 series, but this humble feature offers nostalgia of listening to music the proper orthodox way via headphones. See, what Apple has done to iPhone 7 users by shedding the audio jack. People have to buy the tiny wireless AirPods separately, which are also prone to getting lost. Yeah, Apple has released 'Find my AirPods' feature in the iOS 10.3 update, but still it will not help that much, if it goes missing a crowded public space. Further, Apple iPhone 7 package, which also comes with Lightning Connector and a Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter, users still won't be able to listen to music while charging the device. Some Apple fans went little too far by drilling a hole in their new iPhone 7 series. Read more: Apple iPhone 7 owners fall victim to viral YouTube video, drill 3.5 mm hole to get back audio jack Honorable mention: MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission): The MST feature, which has been seen even in mid-tier Samsung phones for many years, is a handy feature that enables wireless transaction. Apple Pay, which leads the global smartphone market in terms wireless cash transaction uses only the NFC (Near Field Communication) based technology, thereby limiting its use only in developed market. With MST, Samsung Galaxy S8 series will have an edge in emerging markets like India, where digital transaction has just started gain pace. There, PoS (Point-of-Sale) machines are still using the old MST feature for transaction. Bixby digital assistant: For those unaware, Samsung Bixby digital assistant is made by the South Korean company in collaboration with its newly acquired start-up Viv Labs, which by the way is co-founder by the original co-creators of Apple Siri. Before to the acquisition, Viv Labs had already demoed a near-completed digital assistant dubbed as the "Viv". It was intuitive enough of having a normal conversation with another person and get the service delivered, without the user having to open an app and choose options on the screen. Now, those people have come with the new Galaxy Bixby that will do more than rivals such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana and even the Apple Siri. Instead of just throwing information on the screen for a query as done by rival assistant, Samsung Bixby goes an extra mile of completing a given task. It is said to be capable to support almost every task that the application is capable of performing using the conventional touch gesture command. Currently, the rival digital assistant have mastered in a few select applications leading to confusion among users which commands works via touch and voice. Samsung has promised to make Bixby perform functions and compatible with more third party apps in coming days. Samsung Bixby is also expected to be introduced to older devices via software update soon.

One of them is the exploit that caused iPhones to repeatedly call 911, thus overwhelming the emergency service. Apple has fixed the issue that caused iPhones to call 911 and summon the police, fire department or EMS services, according to The Wall Street Journal. Back in October last year, an 18-year-old iOS developer from Arizona discovered and published code that caused iPhones to repeatedly dial 911. The only way to get iPhones to stop dialing 911 was to reportedly turn them off. The bug only worked on Apple’s smartphones, and the code exploited an iPhone feature that allowed users to start a phone call immediately after tapping on a phone number. Apple finally found a fix The teenager was later arrested, but after the code was published online, thousands of such 911 calls were placed all across the United States, thus severely disrupting emergency services. Fortunately, Apple has found a fix for the issue and introduced it in the iOS 10.3 update. Apple’s iPhones now require users to provide a secondary confirmation before automatically calling a number by using the method of simply tapping on the screen. iPhones that run iOS 10.3 will now place calls only after they receive a secondary confirmation, thus fixing the vulnerability that overwhelmed emergency services in the US. Apple stated that it initially worked with app developers to fix the issue, and found that some applications already received an update to fix the problem. iOS 10.3 also brings features like Find My AirPods and lots of other security fixes. A recent report detailed a Siri prank that convinced many iPhone users to call 911 emergency services by saying the number “108” to Siri. Police already urged iPhone users not to abuse the feature, as emergency lines could get potentially tied up. #Apple#iOS 10.3#iPhone#Find My AirPods subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Might Have Ended Support for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c with iOS 10.3.2 Apple Outs First Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 & tvOS 10.2.1 Siri Rumored to Get iMessage and iCloud Integration in iOS 11 iOS 10.3 Officially Released with Find My AirPods, Apple File System, and More Windows 10 Version 1703 Cumulative Update KB4016250 Now Available for Download iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel XL and Sony RX100 V: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Galaxy S8 with Exynos 8895 Outscores the Model with SD835 in Benchmark Meteor Review: Best Android App to Test Your Internet Speed in the Real World Let’s Chat: Android vs. iOS as the Next Destination for Windows Phone Users Busy Month Ahead: Microsoft to Launch Windows 10 Creators Update, Kill Vista No Surprise: Windows 7 Still Number One on Windows Desktop Get to Know the Windows 10 Creators Update with These 150 Screenshots    iPhone 7 Plus dial screen new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Outs First Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 & tvOS 10.2.1 more on: iOS 10.3.2 Beta i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By The Motley Fool  31 Mar 2017, 10:55 Updated: 31 Mar 2017, 11:16 - Apple's growth story is considered to be one of the stock market's greatest rags to riches story, but what if I told you there is one FTSE 250 company that has achieved a better return than the US tech giant for investors over the past five years? The company in question is Domino's Pizza Group(LSE: DOM). Until this month's profit warning, over the previous five years, shares in the fast food giant had produced a return of 174% compared to Apple's return of 70% over the same period.  Go back further, and the return is even better. Since the end of 2008 to the beginning of March 2016, shares in Domino's returned around 700% excluding dividends compared to Apple's 900%. Even though for the longer term Domino's has fallen behind, there's no denying that these figures are extremely impressive. But can the group continue this performance? There's nothing to say that it can't. So far the company has managed to avoid and outmanoeuvre the competition, which has only intensified recently as fast food apps reach more customers. The apps have helped connect thousands of smaller pizza shops to customers in their local areas, but Domino's has continued to dominate.  At the same time, it has managed to remain relevant in an era where consumers are presented with hundreds of different takeaway options as well as options to eat out in restaurants.  The firm's recent results confirmed this trend with statutory revenue rising 13.8% and statutory profit before tax increasing 9.9%. Overall system sales grew 14.5% and underlying profit before tax was up 17.1%. Unfortunately, these figures did not quite meet lofty city expectations and the shares fell following the release. Nonetheless, the results clearly show that Domino's growth isn't going to slow any time soon. Consumers also appear to be spending more with the company. For 2016 average sales per address in new stores grew 15%. Meanwhile, online orders have grown rapidly and now represent 72% of system sales, up 21% year-on-year. Further growth ahead City analysts are expecting Domino's to report another strong year of growth for 2017. They have pencilled-in earnings per share rises of 11% for the year. If the company hits this target, it will have doubled earnings per share in six years. Further growth is expected for 2018 with an expansion of 11% expected. Considering its historical and forward growth potential, shares in the company deserve to trade at a premium valuation multiple, and they do.  They currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.1, which may look expensive at first glance, but it is below the five-year average of 23.4. To put it another way, shares in Domino's currently look cheap compared to history. With this being the case, and considering the company's historical growth record, I believe the shares are attractive at current levels. Make money not mistakes  Before investing in any business, you should always conduct your own due diligence as failing to do so can cost you thousands. And while Domino's has outperformed Apple over the past five years, there's no guarantee this will continue.

Reuters/Maxim Zmeyev The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has required the banks to individually reach an agreement with Apple before their customers can use Apple Pay. The watchdog's decision was in line with its draft ruling in November 2016. Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank applied collectively in July 2016 to negotiate the use of Apple Pay. They argued that the application prevented them from developing their own digital wallets for iPhones. The ACCC said that declining the move for collective negotiation of the banks was significantly based on the three detriments pointed out by ACCC chairman Rod Sims. Participating banks that raised the argument to ACCC wanted to access Apple's near field communication (NFC). The NFC has the ability to communicate with the payments machine to make a transaction. The banks wanted to access it to enable contactless payments to be made through them. However, Sims said that Apple depended on NFC and allowing the banks to access it would affect the company's current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems. If this would happen, there would be an impact on how the company competes with Google. Sims also pointed out that digital wallets and mobile payments were in their infancy that was subject to changes. Because of the unstable future of the payment system, Sims said that it was uncertain to predict how competition would be developed. He said that there was a range of alternative devices being released allowing mobile payments including fitness device and smartwatch. Access to the NFC would only hamper the innovations that currently occurring around the devices for mobile payments. Another point that Sims explained was the possible increase in competition between banks. He said that the increased competition could lead to customers switching between card provider and limiting any lock-in effect bank digital wallets may cause. A spokesperson for the group of banks said that they were disappointed by the decision. He said that the case has always been about consumer choice. He said that the banks made the application to ensure that they could participate in the future of mobile wallets. He said that the banks did not aim to have the course of development for mobile wallets in Australia dictated by a single overseas corporation. An Apple spokesperson said that they believed the decision made by the ACC was great for Australians who wanted the easiest, most secured and private payment experience that Apple Pay could provide.

Gao Yuan Huawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones. Photo: AFP Beijing: Huawei Technologies Co.’s earnings grew at their slowest pace in five years, as China’s biggest maker of telecommunications gear sank money into research and a marketing blitz to gain ground on Apple and Samsung in smartphones. Huawei, founded by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei three decades ago, has emerged as one of China’s most recognizable consumer brands. A relatively new entrant in mobile devices, it’s rapidly grabbed market share from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with premium phones and is now ranked third globally. But that expansion comes at a cost, as the company boosts spending to keep up. Its main business of networking equipment is also slowing as phone carriers rein in network rollouts and prepare for the advent of faster 5G standards. And smartphone competition at home from the likes of Oppo is intensifying. Net income inched 0.4% higher to ¥37.1 billion ($5.4 billion) in 2016, the Shenzhen, China-based company said on Friday. That was its slowest pace of growth since a profit decline in 2011. Its net margin dipped to 7.1%, from about 9.3% the previous year. Going forward, that level of profitability is “appropriate,” said Eric Xu, the current rotating chief executive. Huawei said on Friday it spent 14.6% of its 2016 revenue on R&D and will set aside $10 billion to $20 billion annually for that purpose as it ramps up research into everything from artificial intelligence and wireless technology to cloud computing. But it’s also begun keeping a closer eye on the bottom line. Xu pledged in December to cut extravagant marketing events and warned against “blind optimism and rhetoric.” Mounting expenses would damage efficiency and profitability, he said in a memo to staff. “We’re paying more attention to efficiency and scaling back on investments that cannot bring value,” Xu, who under the current rotation will cede the helm on Friday, told reporters after releasing its annual report in Shenzhen. The company blamed a rapidly expanding consumer business for weighing on margins. Revenue grew 32% to ¥521.6 billion, said Huawei, a closely held company that discloses only basic finances. That was a tad ahead of its own expectations. But the consumer division outstripped that pace, growing revenue 44% to ¥179.8 billion by shipping 139 million smartphones in 2016. Huawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones. About 56% of its sales came from the telecoms-carrier business last year, down from about 60% in 2015 and about two-thirds in 2014, according to previous reports. It’s declared its intention of becoming the world’s largest smartphone player within half a decade and Huawei is said to be aiming for $33 billion in 2017 revenue for its consumer electronics business, which include smartphones, tablets and wearables. But that business is under assault at home. It lost its top position in China’s smartphone market last year to Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co., which attacked rural areas and lower-tier cities. And Vivo ranked just behind Huawei domestically in the December quarter, according to IDC. While Huawei has voiced ambitions to expand abroad, it remains heavily reliant on its home market. China contributed 45% or ¥236.5 billion of revenue last year compared with 42% in 2015. A little over half of its smartphones were shipped within the domestic market in the quarter ended December, according to data from research firm IDC. Deputy Chairman Guo Ping will now become CEO after Xu’s 6-month tenure ends Friday. Guo, 51, started as a project manager at Huawei nearly 30 years ago and once headed the smartphone business. Huawei employs a unique rotating-CEO mechanism after Ren excused himself from daily operations more than five years ago. Ken Hu, who used to lead information security and US businesses, is the other executive in the rotation. He’s expected to take up the role after Guo’s term ends around September.
