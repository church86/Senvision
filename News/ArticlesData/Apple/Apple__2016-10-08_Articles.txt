Probably not… by Juan Carlos BagnellOctober 9, 2016 3:09 pm Contents Full Article Rating Comments Advertisement A recently story popped up from our pals at GSMArena regarding the performance differences between various models of iPhones. Comparing the base model 32GB iPhone 7 against the 128GB iPhone 7 and the 64GB iPhone 6S, they found the base model couldn’t read and write to storage as quickly as the mid tier iPhones. The hypothesis: Apple is using “slower” storage in the base model phones. Now, it’s tricky gauging overall performance from synthetic benchmarks, and happily GSMArena also included their own video test to confirm the performance deficit, but we’re not entirely sure we’re all arriving at the right conclusion. From testing a handful of iPhones, we think the iPhone 7’s performance is entirely consistent with previous Apple releases, and how flash storage works in general. Conducting a quick round up with the the 16GB iPhone SE, 16GB iPhone 6S, and the 32GB iPhone 7 (all base model phones) we see very similar read and write performance across all three phones. No appreciable benefit or loss across model years, if maybe an advantage to the newest iPhone for reading data stored on the device. Does this mean Apple has always “punished” people buying the base model iPhones? Sort of? Maybe? Probably not? The issue might land on how flash storage works, and for that we can look at desktop Solid State Drives. As a general rule, larger SSDs perform better than smaller drives. Is it because larger drives have higher quality “faster” flash memory chips? Nope. It’s because larger drives use MORE of the same chips, and the controller on that drive can read and write more information in parallel. As a poor metaphor, a smaller drive is like having one really nice work truck to move stuff around. If you double the storage, you aren’t doubling the size of the truck, you’re now using TWO trucks to move stuff around. This is likely what’s happening on the iPhone. GSMArena found an almost eight-fold increase in write speeds between the 32GB and 128GB models of iPhone 7. That’s not inconsistent with the notion that Apple might be using two 64GB chips, or maybe even four 32GB chips (less likely), to increase the storage. We honestly won’t know until someone tears apart a more expensive iPhone, but we doubt Apple has a single 128GB NAND chip in there which can perform eight times better. Is it unfortunate that Apple can’t normalize performance across all models of the iPhone? Yes it is. We just don’t see this as much of a scandal given how computers and flash storage work. We don’t see any evidence to suggest that Apple is using “cheaper” components on the base model iPhones. Yet, it’s another example though, where we’re always inclined to recommend people invest in at least the middle tier iPhone, if they can, to really maximize their smartphone investment.

In 2015, Apple's authorised shops were well-lit with attractive decorations and opened at mid night to a cheering crowd reminiscent of the long queues seen in the past just after the launch of a new iPhone in the West.

But of course, by default, Apple clutters up both your Menu Bar and Dock with shortcuts for Siri. If you followed our recent tutorials for setting up a Siri keyboard shortcut or enabling “Hey Siri” on your Mac, then you don’t really need those clickable shortcuts anymore, so here’s a quick tutorial for removing the redundant shortcuts. Removing Siri from the Dock If you’ve been using the Mac platform for a while, then you’re probably already very familiar with removing icons from the Dock. All you’ve got to do is click on the icon and drag it a few inches away from the Dock until you see the “Remove” label. When you do, simply release your click and the icon will disappear. You can still access Siri with a keyboard shortcut, if you set one up, or from the Menu Bar icon. Additionally, you can easily put the Siri icon back on your Dock by dragging the app icon from your Applications folder back into the Dock. Removing Siri from the Menu Bar Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as a back and white Siri icon for your Menu Bar, so you’re stuck with one oddball colored icon and the rest are lacking any color at all. Looks weird; doesn’t it? There are two ways you can remove the Siri icon from the Menu Bar, so we’ll show you both ways below. Method one: click and drag The easiest way to remove the Siri icon from your Menu Bar is to hold down on the Command ⌘ key on your keyboard while simultaneously clicking and dragging the icon a few inches away from the Menu Bar. When you do, you’ll see an X icon that indicates you’re about to remove the icon: When you see this icon, simply release your click and the icon will be removed from the Menu Bar. Method two: from your Mac’s settings The other way to remove Siri from your Mac’s Menu Bar is to follow System Preferences → Siri and un-check the Show Siri in menu bar option: Even though you’ve removed the Siri icon from your Menu Bar, you can still access Siri from the Dock icon (if it’s still there), or with a keyboard shortcut you set up. You can easily put the Siri icon back in the Menu Bar if you want to by putting a check mark back in the Show Siri in menu bar box under System Preferences → Siri.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are now available in India - we saw lines forming outside Apple stores for the 7pm launch on Friday, showing that there's a fair amount of demand for these handsets in India. The iPhone 7 price starts at Rs. 60,000 and the iPhone 7 Plus starts at Rs. 72,000, but there are still plenty of deals you can go for to get a slightly cheaper phone. Aside from the new iPhone models, the Apple Watch series 2 is now available in India as well, from Rs. 32,000 onwards.Apart from the various e-commerce deals, Airtel and Reliance Jio are also giving special offers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Airtel's infinity plan is offering users 120GB of free 4G data, while Jio's iPhone offer gives users 12 months of free services including 20GB of data per month, and access to Jio services - a total bundle that the company pegs at being worth Rs. 18,000 for the year's use. Airtel has another offer where it is iPhone 7 at Rs. 19,990 and you can check out all the details here. Our own review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be coming soon, but first impressions have been very positive. You can also see exactly what all is inside the package you get through these unboxing photographs, or see the video below. A word of caution for all prospective buyers - the phone does not come with a 3.5mm audio jack - something that worried people into being willing to try anything. Including being fooled by a viral video that tricked them into drilling into their brand new phones. Don't drill holes into your phone, and instead check out our picks for alternatives you can use with your new iPhone. (Also see: Best Headphones to Use With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus) If the iPhone release was big news in India, then Google had the attention on the global scale with the launch of the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL phones. The Pixel phones will be up for pre-order in India from next week, with the smaller Pixel being available at Rs. 57,000, while the Pixel XL starts at Rs. 66,000. The two phones are identical on all fronts except for the battery and screen - the Pixel has a 5-inch screen while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch screen. Both phones are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels. The two phones also have some software tweaks that are exclusive for now, including early access to things such as Google Assistant and Android 7.1, and some features that will not trickle down, such as free, unlimited backup for pictures and videos. See full specifications of Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. (Also see: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) Google also announced the launch of the new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Wifi, and Google Daydream View. Apart from the iPhone, we saw another high profile phone launch in India this week - the Moto Z and Moto Mods. The phone was first launched in June but the global rollout started in September. Now, the phone has launched in India, with a starting price of Rs. 39,999. The cheaper Moto Z Play starts at Rs. 24,999. You'll be able to buy the phones from October 17, along with the Moto Mods - modular components that can dramatically add features to your phone. The Moto Mods connect to your phone via the 16-dot connector interface, and a number of them are going to be available in India. The JBL Soundboost costs Rs. 6,999, the Moto Insta-Share Projector costs Rs. 19,999, the Hasselblad True Zoom costs Rs. 19,999, the Incipio offGRID Power Pack costs Rs. 5,999, the Wood and Ballistic Nylon Motorola Style Shell costs Rs. 1,099, while the Leather Style Shell costs Rs. 1,599. These will all be available with a slight discount if you buy them with the phone. Other launches this week included the Lyf Wind 4S with 4000mAh battery and the Lyf Flame 7S with a 4-inch display. There was also the Asus ZenPad Z10 tablet with a 9.7-inch display and 4G LTE support. The Zen Cinemax Force also launched this week as did the Oppo F1SDiwali Edition that comes with a redesigned rear panel and Diwali theme. The Intex Aqua Strong 5.2 with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage also launched, and the Vivo Y55L with a 5.2-inch display. Sony also launched two premium cameras, the A6500 and Cyber-Shot RX100 V. The week also saw the big online sales coming to an end, with Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon all reporting great sale numbers. Flipkart says customer saved over Rs. 1000 crore during its Big Billion Days Sale, while Amazon registered strong growth in mobile shoppers and Prime subscribers. Snapdeal says it saw total number of shoppers increase four times in the sale. The latest round of spectrum auctions also concluded this week, falling short of its target by a large margin. The auction began on October 1, with the goal of shoring up gaps in spectrum holdings, and Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said the next such sale may not happen for "quite some time". However, on day 2 the auction appeared to slow down and on day 3 the auction for the 700MHz and 900MHz bands saw no takers. These 4G bands continued to be ignored by operators on day 4, and on the final day the 900MHz band still saw no takers. (Also see: What Is Spectrum, and Why Is It Being Auctioned?) Aside from this, another interesting event this week was Oculus Connect 3, Facebook's virtual reality event. Facebook is making a Web browser for VR and it showed off a lot of developments from Oculus. It showcased the Oculus Touch motion controllers, which will be available from December, and finally brought up room-scale VR, which is a pretty big development. The company also talked about a VR device that fits between the PC-powered Oculus Rift and the mobile-powered Gear VR. At OC3, Facebook talked about a standalone device that would offer experiences somewhere between these two extremes, with inside-out positional tracking. Zuckerberg also showed off Oculus Rooms and the concept of "social VR", as he showed a demo of people hanging out, holding a conference, and watching movies together using the Oculus platform. And in news you're not likely to believe - a Nokia phone saved a man's life as it stopped a bullet. And no, it wasn't the old unbreakable seeming models either, but a modern Nokia featurephone. This is actually not the first time that a Nokia phone achieved this feat. In 2014, a Nokia Lumia 520 stopped a bullet fired at a Brazilian policeman, though the handset – predictably – got destroyed in the process.

All the teams run by Apple executive Eddy Cue — Siri, Maps, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple News and parts of iTunes and Apple Music — are headed to Apple’s headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California. Currently, the offices for these services are spread around Cupertino and nearby city Sunnyvale in various office parks. With the move, Apple reportedly hopes to improve its cloud services and make them more competitive with Google and Amazon’s offerings. The sources added that Apple is also moving towards its own hosting, with a potentially self-hosted photo storage system in the works, and a software code-named ‘Pie’ that would move the infrastructure of its services onto a single proprietary system. Currently, Apple’s cloud services are handled in part by Amazon and Google. An Apple-hosted photo storage system could be a smart move for the company, considering Google took a jab at the company’s paid subscription method by offering free unlimited photo storage on its new flagship Pixel smartphone, which was revealed on October 4th.

Smanny Apple was too busy with making more money instead of building better things. 😉 Jon Shopping I do not like Apple…But this made my day 😀 Do Do Last time I tried it I couldn’t find any of my pictures online, if it’s not that simple it’s not “cloud” as I understand cloud. Daniel Lui Even Microsoft’s OneDrive is a lot better than iCloud. I personally use OneDrive and find it really good in terms of user friendliness and the amount of storage I get for free mainly because I got the loyalty bonus before Microsoft scrapped it. It’s a shame that Microsoft reduced the amount of free storage for new signups from 15GB to only 5GB. Google Drive is okay well but I personally prefer OneDrive. iCloud is rubbish. Once you upload photos to iCloud, it’s a nightmare to retrieve them. From my experience, to try and retrieve photos from iCloud, you have to manually download and save each one of your photos individually and that’s a pain and so on my iPhone, I disabled iCloud and instead have my photos sync to OneDrive because OneDrive makes it a lot easier to download multiple photos simultaneously from your cloud storage. Martin Chan OneDrive plan pricing is pretty good too. Daniel Lui It’s pretty good but I just looked up the Google Drive storage price plans and the Google Drive plans seem to be a slightly better deal than the ones for OneDrive. On OneDrive, $1.99 gets you 50 GB while $1.99 gets you 100 GB on Google Drive. Smanny Also Google Drive supports a number of Linux versions. OneDrive does not. Daniel Lui I don’t use Linux anyways so that’s not a concern for me. So with that said, I have the option to use either Google Drive or OneDrive. I use Google Drive occasionally but my main cloud storage service of choice is OneDrive. Sweet They have no choice but to try to improve iCloud if they want to count on it as a growth area. It’s always had a reputation for being crap and it competes against free cloud services. It won’t make much of a difference to their revenue, though, because it’s only available to Apple’s platforms, and iOS continues to lose market share (currently below 14%) and its device sales continue to decline. it’s only a matter of time before the iOS userbase starts shrinking, for several reasons, including the fact that the quality of iOS products has plummeted while the prices have skyrocketed and users are keeping their phones longer and opting for cheaper phones.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Restoring forgotten history Sunday Oct 9, 2016 at 3:53 PM Oct 9, 2016 at 3:53 PM By L.J. GamboneApple Valley Review Eureka! Eight months ago, Apple Valley resident/antique trunk restoration expert Randall Barbera truly hit the mother lode of opportunity when he was hired to restore a collection of vintage Louis Vuitton trunks that once belonged to publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst. According to Brian Kenny, director of collections and archives for The Hearst Corporation, the trunks had been left in storage and forgotten about for years. The company sought out Barbera last December through his Apple Valley-based company Antique Trunk Restoration & Design. Kenny said he soon realized Barbera was the right man for the job. “We came across a number of antique Louis Vuitton trunks,” said Kenny. "Not knowing much about the restoration of antique luggage, I was amazed by the work that Randall Barbera did and did not think such work was possible. Astounding.” Barbera said when he received the the trunks, they were quite beat up and in need of extensive repairs. Thankfully, the Hearst Corporation gave him plenty of time to complete the job. "The Hearst Corporation told me to take as much time as I needed, which was good news because the trunks were in bad shape,” said Barbera. The project included a full-sized wardrobe trunk, a large striped canvas courier trunk from 1875, and an early gray "Trianon" pattern from 1854, which is said to be of the first generation of Louis Vuitton trunks ever produced. “I think that one might have belonged to Louis’ mother, which is incredible.” Upon completion of the trunk restorations, Barbera admits he was sad to see them go. Nonetheless, the experience created wonderful memories for Barbera and his wife Lisa. “The Hearst Corporation invited us to Hearst Castle and we also went to some cool parties they hosted,” said Barbera. “We were treated wonderfully and are so grateful for the opportunity we were given.” Antique Trunk Restoration & Design was originally located in Manhattan Beach. Barbera, a native of North Carolina, said he decided to move his business to Apple Valley in 2015 in order to expand his space, as well as escape to a more peaceful and quiet lifestyle. “My wife Lisa and I were kind of burned out on Manhattan Beach,” said Barbera. “We thought it would be cool to go to the desert and at first, we checked out Tucson. But then we realized it was too far from L.A., so we started looking at properties in Apple Valley and found exactly what we were looking for. “These past few months have been great and being here seems like it’s just what the doctor ordered. It’s a refreshing change.” According to Barbera, every trunk he restores is meticulously reworked and repurposed into a one-of-a-kind work of art. He said he uses Old World-style building techniques with the same tools that built the original trunks hundreds of years ago. "My antique trunks are one-of-a-kind works,” said Barbera. “On average, six weeks or more are spent on each project and an antique trunk in not considered complete until every design possibility has been examined and then exhausted. “Punctuating the original design by taking it one step further to enhance personality is the ultimate goal." Prices for Barbera’s trunks range from several hundred dollars to upward of $1,500. Styles include steamer trunks, cabin trunks, toy chests, wooden chests and more.

What’s the best MacBook for your money? By Matt Smith — November 1, 2016 9:02 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) MSRP $1,399.00 DT Editors' Choice Learn More Also mentioned Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Apple MacBook (2015) Acer Swift 7 SF713-51-M90J Apple’s October 27 “Hello Again” event introduced us to the long-awaited MacBook Pro updates with the OLED Touch Bar and improved hardware under the hood. It wasn’t the gigantic update a lot of users were looking for, but it did bring the CPUs up to a more modern 6th-generation offering. We’ve only had a few minutes with the Touch Bar that replaces the function keys, and if you’d like to read up on that check out our hands-on. We’ll make sure to update this guide once we have a full review on the new MacBook Pro, which is forthcoming. For now, just know that the hardware update makes the MacBook Pros more recommendable. There’s now a huge number of configurations across five different laptop models, although all of the changes only affect the MacBook Pro, so the MacBook and MacBook Air are still jockeying for a spot in Apple’s modern computing line. The MacBook is thinner than the Air, but the Air is more powerful, so choosing the right system isn’t an easy call. Related: Looking to buy a new laptop? The answer is Dell’s XPS 13 Instant elimination Here are the five models of MacBook currently available, counting different display sizes as distinct models. MacBook MacBook Air MacBook Pro 13-inch MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Touch Bar) MacBook Pro 15-inch (with Touch Bar) While that may not look like a vast selection compared to prolific brands like Dell or HP, it’s fairly swollen as far as the MacOS world is concerned. Blake Patterson/Flickr Right away, we can remove the MacBook Air from our list of eligible systems. It’s not bad, but it hasn’t aged particularly well. It has a lackluster resolution of 1440 x 900, and is still stuck on the 5th Generation Intel platform. While it holds up the bottom end of the lineup as a budget option, it’s hard to justify at the price. You can simply get a lot more mileage about of $1,000 elsewhere. If you absolutely need a MacBook Air though, you can always buy a refurbished model at a discounted price. Related: Four generations of Intel HD graphics tested But if what you want is the thinnest 13-inch laptop available? Look no further than the Acer Swift 7. It’s currently the thinnest laptop in the world — about half as thick as a MacBook Air — and it’s got a black-and-gold style that’s sure to turn heads. Oh, and it’s actually on par in terms of performance, with a Core i5 and a 1080p display. Why not the 12-inch MacBook? With the MacBook Air out of the running, the real battle begins. Let’s start with the slim and shiny MacBook. You might expect the MacBook to easily walk over its older siblings. It’s slimmer, lighter, and more portable. Fanless and wafer-thin, the MacBook looks like a laptop from the future. But it has some glaring flaws. The first problem is the processor. Intel’s Core M is pretty advanced for a mobile processor, but it’s also meant for extremely slim systems that are often passively cooled. That means it can’t be as quick as its siblings, or it’ll melt itself into a puddle of goo. In our initial review of the MacBook, we found it offers roughly three-quarters the performance of a standard fifth-generation Core, which is two generations behind the most recent processors from Intel. Related: Intel’s Core M is efficient, but doesn’t ace benchmarks Then there’s the port problem. The MacBook offers two: a single USB-C for all peripherals and for charging, and a headphone jack. Because of this, using a MacBook with any third-party peripherals will prove far more difficult than with its siblings. There is one argument in favor of the MacBook, and that’s portability. It’s the lightest and smallest laptop Apple has ever produced. But even here there’s a tradeoff, because the MacBook is quoted at 10 hours of battery life, while the Air can last up to 12 hours and the 13-inch Pro can also hit 10. It’s easier to pack the MacBook, but it won’t last as long as other models on a single charge. Alternatively, you could pick up a similarly priced Dell XPS 13. It’s solid, professional, and comes with a slick display and impressive aluminum-and-carbon-fiber construction. It offers a similar form factor, high build quality, and much better performance. You’d even save about $150. Related: Apple’s new MacBook asks if you can handle a one-port future? What if you’re thinking of going Pro? Now that the two less powerful options have been dispatched, only the freshly redesigned MacBook Pro remains. The high-end machine packs in 6th Generation Intel processors, PCIe SSDs standard, and a Retina display in all models. In that sense, the MacBook Pro sets itself apart from the low-power options further down the ladder. Whether it competes with other systems in its price range is another story. The 13-inch version competes most directly with the Dell XPS 13. The slim PC is one of our favorite laptops, and unfortunately undercuts the MacBook Pro 13’s price fairly seriously in terms of base model, starting at $799 to the MacBook Pro 13’s $1,500, which is the model without a Touch Bar and only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. To top it off, the Dell sports a higher screen resolution, newer processor, and touch screen capabilities once the price reaches the same level as the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 15 is in a better position, despite the higher price. Its most obvious competitor is the Surface Book Pro with Performance Base, which starts at the same $2,300 price point. The Surface Book with Performance Base once again beats out the MacBook Pro 15 in terms of graphical and processor performance, screen resolution, and of course is a 2-in-1 with a touch screen and stylus. However, the MacBook Pro models fight back with large touchpads, an optional unique Touch Bar, excellent hard drive performance, and forward-looking ports. It’s a very expensive system, and arguably not a great value. But then again, Macs have never been the budget option. If you want a Mac, the MacBook Pro is the one to get, and the 15-incher is particularly attractive. And the winner is… There was just an update to the MacBook Pro line, so if you really want something that runs MacOS, that’s the only system to consider. If you need a Mac and you’ve got the cash, the 15-inch Pro is the way to go. Its size improvements maintain its status as one of the slimmest high-end notebooks around, if you don’t mind a bit of touchscreen envy. Please enable Javascript to watch this video There’s serious hardware under the hood, too. The Retina display offers roughly twice the number the pixels as the Air, the processor’s base clock is 1.1GHz quicker, and RAM is doubled from four to eight gigabytes. The latest Pro also comes with the same Force-click touchpad found in the MacBook, two or four USB Type-C instead of just one, and the OLED Touch Bar, if you pay a little more for the privelige. Related: The new MacBook vs. the Dell XPS 13 — which is the king of portable laptops With a full suite of connectivity, high-end computing options, and a more competitive value than the smaller notebook, the MacBook Pro 15 is the best choice for anyone looking to pick up a MacOS laptop, who doesn’t mind trading value, and a touchscreen, for the Apple logo. If you don’t have that much to spend, you’re probably better off reaching for a Windows PC, or purchasing a refurbished Mac.

Now it's here. But it's got an unfamiliar moniker. James Martin/CNET Why the Pixel phone isn't called the Google Phone 0 Share: Mobile by Richard Nieva October 5, 2016 2:17 PM PDT @richardjnieva Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech It's finally here: the Google Phone. Well, not quite. It's officially called "Pixel, Phone by Google," and the search giant unveiled it Tuesday during a much-hyped event in San Francisco. The Pixel, available with either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, is a grown up Google phone, meant to compete with the top brass of the smartphone world, including Samsung and Apple. It's a sharp strategic shift for Google, which has until now been content with selling phones through its Nexus program. For that, Google farmed out some of the hardware design to other manufacturers -- like LG, Asus and Huawei -- who put their brands on the phone alongside Nexus. For tech watchers, the Pixel ends years of speculation about when Google would actually build a premium phone. The rumors started the moment Google bought a tiny mobile software startup called Android in 2005, a move that eventually pit it against Apple's iOS software for the iPhone. It prompted Apple's Steve Jobs to declare he was willing to spend every bit of his company's cash on fighting a "thermonuclear" war to destroy Android. The phone has Google's signature G on the back.Photo by James Martin/CNET So when Apple announced its own foray into the smartphone market in 2007 with the iPhone, we knew something was missing, an archrival. Coke has Pepsi, the Lakers have the Celtics, Tupac had Biggie. The iPhone needed a worthy competitor, someone even more formidable than Samsung, the world's biggest maker of phones. That's why a Google phone has been a long time coming. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, said in an interview Tuesday. More on Pixel Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner Google Pixel cautiously rolls dice with Verizon exclusivity Google Pixel makes a bid for Android history But dreams of this hypothetical clash of the tech titans typically envisioned the iPhone (a name that Apple bought from Cisco, by the way) fighting against the Google Phone. Or maybe the Gphone, as Android co-founder Andy Rubin called it in 2007. Something you could picture in lights on a marquee or in headlines on review face-offs. Instead, we got iPhone versus...Pixel. It's not exactly epic, like Superman versus Batman (the superheros, not the movie). Google insists Pixel is the right name for its new phone. "For us, it's always represented the best of hardware and software designed and built by Google," Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said on stage Tuesday. That's because Pixel isn't a new name. There are already Pixel Chromebook laptops and tablets that Google designed in-house. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, introduced the new phone.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, it's pretty much an unknown brand. And that may be the point, said Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based brand consultant. For most people, Google means search. The Google name doesn't have the "panache" to carry a high-end phone. "The reason the phone isn't called Google is the brand doesn't stretch that far," he said. "If you stretch a brand too far, it snaps." Plus, Google thinks people will come to know it as "the Google phone" anyway, despite its proper name, a company spokeswoman said. She points out that it says "Phone by Google" on the box and the phone itself has a big G on the back. "Phone by Google" is also printed in teeny tiny, nearly illegible letters on the bottom of the back of the phone. "People know who built this phone," Rakowski continued. "It's quite clear. We're not being shy about it." A 'most-loved' brand Maybe you're thinking it's unimportant to dissect a name, that it's just semantics. Shakespeare wrote, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But remember, Romeo and Juliet died because of their names. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management Google knows better than anyone that branding and marketing matter. Just look at the ill-fated Google Glass, which failed because, among other things, the company couldn't get the story right as to why you'd spend $1,500 on awkward eyewear. If Google wants to go up against a heavyweight like the iPhone with this new phone -- and by all accounts, it does, given the Pixel's starting price of $650 and Google's exclusive deal with Verizon as the wireless provider -- then the company needs to nail everything, including the marketing. And the name. There are probably several reasons why the company wanted to call it something besides the Google Phone. Maybe Google didn't want to scare its hardware partners, which are still deeply important when it comes to Android, by jumping into the deep end with a full-on, branded phone. Or, if the phone is a flop, it would be tough to give it a second try with another Google phone if the company has already played that name card. Google made its own premium phone to showcase its software and services.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, the Google name is a world-class asset. It's the most valuable brand in the world, according to the BrandZ Top 100 list, a study by the branding and advertising agency Kantar Millward Brown. Who's No. 2? Apple. And when it comes to the world's most-loved brands, Google is No. 4, according to the YouGov BrandIndex. Apple is close behind at No. 6. Interestingly enough, the study also lists the iPhone as its own brand. It's No. 8. Maybe Google hopes Pixel will join the list. The ranking suggests people tend to think good things when they hear Google. What do people think when they hear Pixel? Maybe that Adam Sandler movie that got a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 27 on Metacritic. But if Google didn't choose Pixel because Pixel could help its brand power, it could be the other way around, said Jan Dawson, CEO of Jackdaw Research. "If Google does a phone named Pixel, and it's successful, then it makes Pixel successful," he said. Or maybe there's something more subliminal at work here. A pixel, literally, is a kind of unit of measurement for images on a screen. On phones, pixels are the building blocks of software as manifested on a display. And software has always been at the heart of Google. So even though you're holding a shiny rectangle in your hand with Google's signature G on the back, Google wants to remind you that it's in the business of software. Pixels, not atoms. And in fact, that's how Google executives, standing under a digital banner that declared "Made by Google," explained it on Tuesday when they discussed why it's time for Google to make its own hardware: Software and data are bigger parts of people's lives than ever. Said Osterloh: "The rise of volume and complexity of all the information makes it so that this is the right time to be focused on hardware and software."

Unofficial Remixes Now Available On Spotify And Apple Music Home News Sudipti Khatry October 9th, 2016 - 2:50 PM Buy music on this topic at | Amazon Spotify and Apple have both made deals with Dubset, a music rights management service, in order to release unofficial remixes on their sites. From the deal, the owners of the remixes will get paid for their content being on these company’s sites. One release that has arrived on Spotify and Apple is DJ Jazzy Jeff’s remix of Anderson .Paak’s “Room In Here”. With this streaming option available from Spotify and Apple, Anderson .Paak will get paid for his work. Anderson .Paak has recently announced a debut album called Yes Lawd! for his new band NxWorries. To ensure that the right artist is credited for their work, Dubset will scan the song and match it with the original beats of the original content. This process will all be based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. According to The Fader, the CEO of Dubset, Stephen White, told TechCrunch the following: “Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with. Some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid!” With this new release, the competition between Soundcloud could possibly reduce, even though there has been some type of small deal made between Soundcloud and Dubset to allow short form mixes.   Tags Anderson Paak Apple Spotify Share this article Tweet Comments Sudipti Khatry Share this topic Story Page 300 x 250 Ad Middle Follow @mxdwn mxdwn Story Page 300 x 250 Ad Bottom Click here - to select or create a menu © mxdwn.com 2001 - 2015.

French Company Sues Apple Because of Improper HTML5 Support in iOS GO Company wants Apple to open iOS for other browsers Oct 9, 2016 21:15 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Nexedi, a French software development company, is suing Apple in a French court because of the sorry state of HTML5 support on iOS, and because Apple actively prevents third-party browser engines from running on iOS. The company filed a civil lawsuit in France because a local law gives it the best chances of succeeding in its effort. A local French law passed a few years back prevents large companies from imposing unbalanced contracts on smaller businesses. Nexedi says that Apple forces software developers to sign an unfair contract when submitting an app to the iOS App Store that states that all web content should be handled by a WebKit-based browser engine. The French company's problem is that the WebKit engine is seriously lagging behind when it comes to supporting modern HTML5 features. Because Apple forces iOS app developers to use WebKit-based browsers, developers must invest serious time and effort into porting modern apps to work with the limited version of HTML5 supported in iOS, indirectly cutting down their profits. There are two possible positive outcomes Nexedi hopes that this lawsuit will force Apple to invest more in upgrading the WebKit engine to support the same modern HTML5 features supported by other browser vendors such as Google, Microsoft, or Mozilla, all of which have better browser engines than Apple. This wouldn't be a problem if these browsers, and their subsequent engines, wouldn't be banned from the iOS App Store. A second option that Nexedi would accept is if Apple allowed other browser engines on the iOS App Store, so software developers can run their web content in modern browsers and not the ancient Mobile Safari currently supported on iOS devices. While Chrome and Firefox are available for iOS, they are not actual Chrome and Firefox, but empty UI shells that run on top of the old WebKit engine. While Chrome was initially built on the WebKit engine, Chrome development switched to the newer Blink engine developed in-house at Google. Apple criticized before for the poor state of WebKit development This is not the first instance when developers are driven mad by Apple's lack of attention for WebKit and Safari development. Last year, Nolan Lawson penned a scorching blog post which concluded that "Safari is the new IE." The article criticized Apple staff for ignoring Safari development, which resulted in WebKit failing to support the latest Web standards. Currently, WebKit (and inherently Safari) don't support modern web technologies like service workers, Web RTC, or the WebM video format, just to name a few. These are critical features in today's web. "In the early 90s I have been an Apple developer myself," Jean-Paul Smets, Nexedi CEO writes. "At that time Apple personal computers had the best support for TCP/IP and the Web. Other platforms such as Windows were lagging behind. Apple platforms could support more multimedia formats than others, even including Unix workstations. Nowadays it seems to be the opposite." #Apple#Safari#WebKit#HTML5#iOS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Sneak Peek: Firefox's Upcoming Form Autofill Feature Chromification Continues: Firefox May Use Chrome's PDF and Flash Plugins Firefox Gets Floating Video and Web Screenshot Support via Test Pilot Program W3C Set to Publish HTML 5.1, Work Already Started on HTML 5.2 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Apple's Safari HTML5 support is terrible Related Apps Arovax SmartHide: An application that can hide IP address on the very high level, so that there you no longer need to worry about personal privacy Willing WebCam: Webcam app that records live streaming video any time of the day or night, with support for a frame grabber, email notifier and FTP uploader AccessToFile: Export Access data to several output formats by turning to this lightweight application that features a session manager and a task scheduler VidMasta: Now you can watch and download movies as well as television titles in any format (TV, DVD, 720p, 1080i/p) with the help of this simple utility Remote Desktop Manager Enterprise Edition: Easily manage remote connections and virtual machines, while accessing your data from an offline location or browse cloud repositories Wonder Lister: A useful application for the eBay users who need to manage their products, offers, inventory and sales by using an online client MyToTxt: Export data from MySQL databases to multiple document formats, schedule tasks and perform batch operations, with this handy application Reader comments Mozilla Announces Quantum, a New Browser Engine for Firefox more on: Quantum i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

NICK SMIRNOFF / FOR TEHACHAPI NEWS After measuring and winners were determined, children picked up and collected all 1,000 apples. Tehachapi continues to plant seeds that will grow forever after another successful Apple Festival filled the streets downtown and Railroad Park on Saturday and Sunday. Now in its fourth year, the Apple Festival drew large crowds, with a mix of both local folks and out-of-town visitors who came to celebrate everything about the fruit. There were apple pies, apple fritters, caramel apples and apple cider, to name a few of the apple delicacies sold by the many participating vendors. Adults sat down and competed in an apple pie eating contest. A popular feature of the festival, the contest included a number of contestants who scarfed down the confection in the age-old traditional way. Children lined up to "bob" for apples in ongoing contests throughout Saturday. "The apple kept slipping away," laughed Riley Dison, 12, of Bakersfield, who won her contest for taking the most bites out of her apple as it dangled from a string, which was not as easy as it sounds. "I come here every year," said Dison, an Actis Junior High student. New to the festival this year was the Red Car Show featuring both vintage as well as unusual autos lined up between Green and Curry streets on Saturday. Returning to the festival was the Lion's Club Apple Drop on Sunday. Children gathered at the Kid's Zone, and bounced the day away in the numerous bounce houses. "My favorite part was the bouncy houses," said Dexter Kitchen, 5, of Bakersfield. Vendors sold a variety of food, with long lines found waiting amid enticing aromas. "I sold a lot of pies today," said Agnes Lowder of TehachaPie. +11 Who has best pie?

Devindra Hardawar , @devindra 10.05.16 in Personal Computing Comments 998 Shares Share Tweet Share Save ZenBook 3 Get more info More 76 Scores Engadget 76   Critic Not yet scored   Users Not yet scored   Key Specs Type  Ultraportable Bundled OS  Windows System RAM  4 GB Maximum battery life  Up to9 hour Pointing device  Trackpad From $749.00 Buy Now Apple's tiny MacBook was a revelation when it debuted last year. It was thinner and lighter than most ultraportables on the market, and its refined design brought over some cues from Apple's mobile hardware. So it was only a matter of time before a PC maker took a swing at a similar design. Enter the ASUS ZenBook 3, a minuscule machine that promises to be just as portable as the MacBook while packing in much faster hardware. But while ASUS has proved it can sell powerful machines for far less than the competition, it's less experienced when it comes to delivering truly premium hardware. The ZenBook 3, while attractive on the surface, is a reminder that ASUS still has a lot to learn. Gallery: ASUS ZenBook 3 review | 10 Photos 10 +6 Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key ASUS ZenBook 3 from $749+ Buy Now 76 Pros Thin and light design comparable to the MacBook As fast as other high-end ultraportables Vibrant screen Comes with a mini-dock for extra ports Cons Keyboard and trackpad are difficult to use Fingerprint sensor placement makes no sense Build quality is suspect Summary The ZenBook 3 does a decent job of mimicking the MacBook's design while also cramming in faster hardware. But the combination of a hard-to-use keyboard and trackpad, along with build quality concerns, make it difficult to recommend. Hardware At first glance, the Zenbook 3 screams luxury. Its aluminum alloy case is smooth and sleek, and it measures an impressive 11.9mm at its thickest point. I particularly liked the deep shade of blue and the gold accents, which are classy in a subtle way. ASUS's ZenBook line is unquestionably "Apple-inspired," with an emphasis on thin profiles and all-metal cases. But the ZenBook 3's design in particular looks like a mixture of the MacBook and the 11-inch MacBook Air, right down to the small notch below the trackpad and the look of the speakers above the keyboard. That's one way to evoke a premium feel, I guess. But it would have been nice to see some actual innovation, as with HP's sexy new Spectre. With a 12.5-inch display, ASUS managed to outdo the MacBook by half an inch. But Apple's laptop boasts a higher-resolution 2,304 x 1,440 display, as compared with 1080p on the ZenBook. At least it's a good-looking display, though; it's bright enough for outdoor use, while colors appear vibrant and mostly accurate. Though it's not a touchscreen display (that's to be expected with such a thin laptop), ASUS covered it in Gorilla Glass 4 for extra protection. After testing out plenty of touchscreen Windows laptops over the past few years, though, I'm surprised by how much I missed that feature here. While the two-pound ZenBook 3 feels light and sturdy at first, it wasn't long before I started noticing flaws. Applying a bit of pressure around the laptop's keyboard leads to some seriously disturbing creaking noises, as if the seams around the bottom of the case are rubbing against each other. It's not something you might ever do to your laptop, but this also doesn't bode well for long-term durability. If a bit of force from my hands can disturb the case's integrity, how can I ever trust it in a book bag with other heavy items? Then there's the keyboard and trackpad, which present a different set of issues. The ZenBook 3's buttons have more travel than those on the relatively flat MacBook, but the feedback you get when pressing them is mushy and insubstantial. Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

Our review unit came with a Core i7-7500U, which offers speeds between 2.7GHz and 2.9GHz, and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked at 2,133MHz. ASUS says it worked with Intel to achieve that memory speed, which is faster than any other ultraportable on the market. It even exceeds the maximum 1,866MHz RAM speeds Intel officially supports for its latest chips. The MacBook, on the other hand, is still stuck with slow Core m3 and m5 CPUs and a maximum of 8GB of RAM. Apple might refresh it soon, now that the seventh-gen Intel CPUs are available, but for the time being, ASUS wins the spec battle. The ZenBook 3 felt just as zippy as other high-end ultraportables. It didn't skip a beat during my typical workflow, which involves having several browsers open with dozens of tabs each, plus Slack, Spotify and Photoshop. And thanks to the video-decoding capabilities in Intel's new processors, the CPU usage managed to stay below 20 percent when I streamed 4K video from YouTube. Basically, you're not sacrificing any performance here. Battery life ASUS ZenBook 3 9:45 Surface Book (Core i5, integrated graphics) 13:54 / 3:20 (tablet only) HP Spectre x360 (13-inch, 2015) 11:34 Surface Book (Core i7, discrete graphics) 11:31 / 3:02 (tablet only) Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2015) 10:47 HP Spectre x360 15t 10:17 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Lenovo Yoga 900 9:36 Apple MacBook (2016) 8:45 Samsung Notebook 9 8:16 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 HP Spectre 13 7:07 Huawei MateBook 6:35 Razer Blade Stealth 5:48 Dell XPS 15 (2016) 5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger) When it comes to real-world battery life, the ZenBook 3 also outshines some recent ultraportables I've seen, like the Huawei MateBook and the Lenovo X1 Yoga with OLED. It typically lasted an entire workday, and sometimes it even had juice left over by the time I got home. In our typical battery test, which involves looping an HD video until the power dies, it lasted around nine hours and 45 minutes. Given that Intel is stressing video decoding with its new chips, though, that figure might not be directly comparable to other ultraportables. I'll be testing the ZenBook 3 with other battery benchmarks soon and will report back with the results. Configuration options and the competition You have two choices with the ZenBook: the $1,099 model with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; or the more powerful $1,599 version with a Core i7-7500U chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The latter model was the one I tested, so keep that in mind if you're hoping to achieve the kind of performance reflected in our benchmarks. Apple's MacBook, which is really the only direct competitor, starts at $1,299, with a significantly slower Core M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Bumping up to $1,599 gets you a Core M5 and more storage, but you'll still be stuck with 8GB of RAM. If you can live with something slightly heavier, then you've got a wealth of ultraportable options to choose from, including HP's revamped Spectre 13 (2.45 pounds), the fantastic Dell XPS 13 (2.6 pounds), and even Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. All of those machines will likely get upgraded soon with Intel's seventh-gen CPUs, so it might be worth waiting a bit (or snap up one of last year's models if they're on sale). Wrap-up Ultimately, with the ZenBook 3, ASUS did what it does best: pack in plenty of powerful hardware for a cheaper price than the competition. But the company's inexperience at crafting truly high-end machines shows, with some truly worrying durability and usability issues. I give ASUS credit for building such a thin and powerful device, but what does that matter if the keyboard and trackpad are a pain to use?

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Life after death for Apple’s Xserve Some of our readers still get use out of hardware Apple left behind. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 9, 2016 6:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 132 Enlarge / Some of our readers are still even using PowerPC Xserves, if you can believe it. David Clark Apple put the final nail in the Xserve’s coffin in January 2011 when it officially stopped selling rack-mounted servers. Instead, the company started pushing server customers toward Mac Pros and Minis. On Sept. 20 of this year, Apple lowered that coffin into the ground when macOS Sierra dropped software support for the systems. And while Xserves running El Capitan will keep getting security updates for a couple of years and the current build of the macOS Server software still runs on El Capitan, the hardware will soon be completely buried. For a few years after the Xserve’s death, the company offered Mac Pro and Mac Mini Server configurations (PDF) that could do some of the same things, but even those options eventually disappeared. Even though Apple never offered true server-class hardware again, that doesn’t mean the hardware isn’t still out there doing its job. In our Sierra review we asked those of you who are still using Xserves to get in touch, and plenty of you did. Why Xserve? macOS Server started getting simpler not long after Apple discontinued the Xserve. For many of those simple tasks, a quad-core Mac Mini with two hard drives got the job done while keeping stored data safe-ish. But the Xserve’s hardware had a few unique things that Apple’s repurposed consumer desktops couldn’t replicate. The most prominent of those features is probably Lights Out Management (LOM), a hardware feature that allowed administrators to remotely monitor temperature, fan speeds, and other sensor data. Servers are often kept in remote locations and not connected to monitors, so being able to keep an eye those numbers was valuable. But because LOM requires a separate coprocessor, it was never added to the Mac Mini or Mac Pro servers. Because virtualization conserves power and simplifies server replacements, upgrades, and administration, it became a popular way to consolidate hardware around the turn of the decade. The Xserve’s number of processor cores and large banks of RAM made it a good fit for virtualization. “We have five 2009 Xserves still in use, all running [VMWare] ESXi 6 as a cluster,” writes Elizabeth Harvey-Forsythe, a senior systems engineer at the MIT Media Lab. “Want a Mac VM? It’s relatively rare compared to Linux around here, but some of our students do, and for that you need Apple hardware, and we have little room for anything we can’t rackmount or that we can’t put fibre channel and 10Gbps Ethernet cards inside.” Alex Clay, a software development manager at Suran Systems, uses an Xserve to virtualize Mavericks so that he can virtualize Mac OS 9. It’s a creative and convoluted solution that is nevertheless “a heck of a lot more reliable and stable than swapping out 10 plus-year-old hardware every time an HDD goes belly up.” “Though it won’t run Windows, to my surprise, Xserves can actually run VMWare ESXi flawlessly,” wrote Nick Neely, another satisfied Xserve user. “From there I can run whatever operating system I want. Currently, multiple instances of Windows Server 2012. Blasphemy, I know.” Firsthand reliability, secondhand prices The Xserve’s reliability was mentioned by more than one person. Which makes sense, since server hardware has to be built to be more robust and stand up to more use than your standard consumer PC. Clay mentioned that his shop at Suran Systems had already moved its production servers to Mac Minis, but praised Xserves for being “beasts [that] ran with very little maintenance required.” Neil Miller, an administrator at an ad agency with around two dozen Mac-centric users, told us that the “end is in sight” for his Xserve, but that “it’s not here yet.” “Our Xserve still works, although not every single part of it—yeah proprietary drives/sleds, we’re talking about you!” he wrote to Ars. “The Xserve is a really, really well-built piece of kit, and I’ll be sorry to see it go.” More than one person who bought Xserve hardware secondhand for cheap told us that finding secondhand parts to make fixes isn’t too difficult. Turns out that totally discontinuing a product and drastically simplifying the software that runs on it is a good way to make something drop in value. “It’s pretty easy to find earlier Xserve models on eBay for next to nothing (under $100), because people seem to think that they’re stuck running Lion on the things,” wrote Neely. “I’m running an Xserve 2.1 [the early 2008 model] with dual quad-core Xeons, and I got a really good deal on it last year at $75.” Though some of those older Xserves were dropped long before El Capitan and Sierra, Neely says “install[ing] a basic graphics card and trick[ing] the installer into running all the way up to El Capitan” is relatively easy. And a few of the Xserves still in operation are out there because the IT world is a slow-moving place, where migrating from one platform to another can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. “I still have four Xserve’s in production,” wrote network administrator Dave Walsh. “Two are just because they haven’t failed yet, so I haven’t moved DNS onto a newer Linux box. But two are still online because we still use Network Homes, and that requires an OpenDirectory server to maintain.” “Network Homes” were Apple’s version of Windows’ “Roaming User Profiles,” and they’re used mostly to make hopping from one computer to another easier. Sign in to any of your business’s Macs with your network account and the Mac knows to look on the server for your user profile and files instead of the local drive. Walsh says that his school has been pushing students and staff away from Network Homes over the last few years, but the process isn’t finished yet. “Once I can put the last nail in the coffin of Network Homes,” Walsh told us, “then I can move full steam into Linux and a VM environment. But until then I’m stuck maintaining legacy gear.” Expand full story Page: 1 2 Next → Reader comments 132 You must login or create an account to comment.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Earlier this year, Apple clashed with the FBI after refusing to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook. Now, the FBI has run into a similar situation, which could see the agency clash with the Cupertino company once again. At a press conference in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Friday, FBI special agent Rich Thorton revealed the agency is in possession of Dahir Adan’s iPhone and is seeking a way to unlock it. Adan stabbed 10 people in a Minnesota mall in the name of ISIS before he was shot and killed by police. Because his iPhone is locked with a passcode, the FBI is unable to search the device’s contents for relevant information. According to Thorton, the FBI is currently assessing its legal and technical options as it works toward gaining access to the device. This past spring, a Court Order was issued to Apple to unlock the iPhone 5c of the San Bernardino shooter, but Apple still refused. Apple CEO Tim Cook responded to the order by saying the implications of creating brute force software were “chilling.” Here’s a part of Cook’s letter that discusses why Apple was holding firm in its decision not to unlock the device: If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone’s device to capture their data. The Justice Department called Apple’s refusal to comply a marketing stunt. If the FBI is unable to force its way into Adan’s iPhone, the agency could potentially seek another legal battle with Apple. It’s unclear if the FBI has been in contact with Apple but it’s very likely the battle over privacy and encryption is far from over.

Almost every move by Apple, Google or Facebook is seen through the lens of offence or defence, either against each other or towards a nimbler startup trying to turn them into yesterday’s news. But as well as competing directly, these clashes between titans have manifested themselves collaterally into a series of ideological arguments. Take the battle between privacy and progress: Apple, for example, has taken a strict line on using customers’ information, while others are more relaxed, partly because their use of data has allowed them to make great strides in areas such as artificial intelligence. Another one of these religious splits has been in the idea of “open” against “closed” systems. The first is the idea that technology should be infinitely tweakable and free of bias. It is the libertarian foundation of the world wide web: democratic rather than dictatorial. Closed means that the technology is less flexible, that decisions are taken by those who know better, rather than letting the user run amok. It is authoritarian, if largely benevolent. Google Pixel: hands on review Play! 00:36 Those that worship at the altar of open include Wikipedia and Mozilla, which develops the Firefox web browser. At the other end of the spectrum are Nintendo, which has tightly controlled both its video game software and hardware, and Facebook, which rigorously controls how its users experience the social network. But it is the two biggest tech companies that best represent this divide. In the open corner is Google, which was born on and is dependent on the web, and dreams of indexing the entire world’s information for everyone. On the closed side is Apple, which is obsessively devoted to simplicity and as a result shields its users from having too many choices. Google’s Android mobile software, which runs on thousands of smartphones, is free and massively customisable. iOS, Apple’s operating system, runs on one mobile - the iPhone - and uniform across devices. One is open, one is closed, and that is how it has been since both existed. Until last week, at least. For on Wednesday, Google took a leap into the unknown by unveiling its first phone. The Google Pixel is intended to be a direct competitor to the iPhone (as the frequency of Google’s potshots at Apple during its presentation showed). At its heart is the Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence designed to respond to millions of voice queries and demonstrate the power of the company’s smarts. google biggest failures It is a rare foray into hardware for Google, which has traditionally left the job of making Android phones to other manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC. This has served it fairly well, with Android accounting for four in five phones sold globally, so why do it, especially in 2016, as growth in smartphone sales peters out and innovation seemingly dries up? Partially, at least, the answer lies in frustration at the state of the equipment manufacturers that Android relies on. HTC is in dire financial straits, and others such as Sony are losing market share. Samsung also appeared to be in trouble a year ago, and although has enjoyed a rebound in sales recently, Google had made the decision to sell its own handsets by then (now that the Korean group has been thrown into turmoil by defective handsets, the decision looks tremendously prescient). The fastest growing phone makers are in China, where Android has no Google services due to the company’s blackout of the country. Google has also been frustrated at the endless tampering with Android by manufacturers, who have often promoted their own apps and relegating Google’s. It is partly why the company requires that its search engine and web browser be installed on any Android phone that wants to use the Google Play app store, a directive that has landed it in hot water with EU competition regulators. The history of Google Play! 02:31 The new Google Assistant software that features in the Pixel is a crucial element of the company’s future: computing is moving away from the web searches that make the majority of the company’s money and towards artificial intelligence that can talk and answer questions, so naturally Google is desperate to control this new channel. So ask yourself: if you were Google, and needed Assistant to be a success at this crucial juncture, would you leave it to unreliable third parties or take things into your own hands? Suddenly, being a little less open and (whisper it quietly), a little bit more like Apple, starts to look attractive. Control both the hardware and the software, and you can be sure that customers are getting what you intend them to. Google’s ambitions go beyond the phone: the internet giant is also set to release the Google Home, a voice-controlled smart speaker that also puts the company’s AI at its heart. The two products will work together as well as with the Chromecast, its internet TV device. Gradually, it is building an “ecosystem” of products, seamlessly tied together with its software: another strategy that Apple’s iPhone, iPad and Mac have used to great effect. While it will protest that it has not abandoned its open ideals, Google has taken a big leaf out of the Apple playbook.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 9, 2016 at 12:05PM Wall Street analysts are sharply divided in their expectations for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Some are predicting a return to solid iPhone sales growth in the current quarter (Q1 of Apple's fiscal 2017). Others expect iPhone sales to continue declining for now. Indeed, there are reasons for optimism as well as reasons for caution regarding Apple's Q1 iPhone sales. However, on balance, the evidence suggests that Apple will report a solid increase in iPhone sales for the quarter ending in December. Analysts' estimates increase -- but there are plenty of pessimists A month ago, most analysts had very modest expectations for the iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus. After all, iPhone sales have been declining for nearly a year, and the new iPhones don't offer any revolutionary upgrades. Early demand for the new iPhones has been solid. Image source: Apple. However, since then, a variety of good news has trickled out. All four big U.S. wireless carriers reported record iPhone pre-orders. Additionally, various supply chain sources have indicated that Apple is raising its iPhone component orders. Finally, the iPhone 7 Plus in particular has a long order backlog. As a result, analysts are slowly but surely raising their iPhone unit shipment estimates for Q1. Most of the analysts who have revised their forecasts in recent weeks now expect Apple to sell more iPhones in the current quarter than the 74.8 million it moved in last year's first quarter. Still, some remain skeptical of Apple's near-term prospects. For example, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz recently cut his Q1 iPhone shipment estimate to 67.8 million units. That would represent a nearly 10% year-over-year decline. Moskowitz thinks that after the initial burst of sales to early adopters, iPhone 7 demand could quickly peter out. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities -- often lauded as the most accurate Apple analyst -- is also skeptical about iPhone sales. Kuo recently raised his Q1 shipment estimate from his initial forecast of 65 million to a range of 70 million to 75 million, but that still implies that sales will be flat or down year over year. Two reasons for optimism So which analysts are right? Two major factors point toward a year-over-year increase in iPhone shipments. First, Apple's fiscal first quarter has an extra week this year: something that happens once every five or six years. In each of the past two years, Apple has shipped an average of more than 5.7 million iPhones per week during Q1. Thus, the extra week represents a big sales tailwind. Second, lead times for all iPhone models remain significant, three weeks after the new iPhones went on sale. Apple's online store is quoting a two to three week wait for most iPhone 7 configurations. For the iPhone 7 Plus, it's an even longer wait, topping out at six to eight weeks for the new Jet Black finish. Additionally, as of a week ago, U.S. Apple Store locations still had virtually no availability of the iPhone 7 Plus for walk-in purchases. In China, retail availability is scarce even for the regular iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus is out of stock at most retail outlets. Image source: Apple. The apparent shortage of iPhones and the reported increases in Apple's component orders point to a strong demand environment. That bodes well for sales this quarter. Two reasons why growth could remain elusive However, there are two reasons why long lead times and the extra sales week might not translate into a big sales gain. First, Apple significantly increased its iPhone channel inventory last fall, boosting shipments. It then had to undergo a painful inventory correction over the next two quarters. To avoid a repeat of that scenario, Apple may look to exit the current quarter with a lower level of channel inventory, weighing on Q1 iPhone shipments. Second, low supply may be the main reason why retail stocks are low and online lead times are long. iPhone 7 Plus adoption is running at a similar rate to last year's iPhone 6s Plus, but iPhone 7 adoption has been noticeably slower relative to the iPhone 6s, according to Fiksu. Whether due to manufacturing hiccups or a deliberate plan by Apple to build fewer iPhones this fall, fewer devices are getting into users' hands relative to the last two iPhone product cycles. iPhone demand is clearly greater than supply right now, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is high enough to drive year-over-year sales growth. A return to growth is the more likely outcome It's important to recognize that low supply could be making iPhone demand appear stronger than it really is. That said, iPhone sales aren't running that far behind last year's pace, while wait times seem to be longer. Apple showed two years ago that it can rapidly increase production if demand is better than expected. That process has already begun. With production rising and an extra week of sales, it would be very surprising if Apple doesn't return to iPhone sales growth this quarter.

 Apple's school for programmers on the coast of Italy has a lower admissions rate than Harvard Kif Leswing Oct. 5, 2016, 5:27 PM 4,847 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook with former Italian premier Mario Monti AP Apple's school for app developers on the Italian coast opens its doors on Thursday. But if you were hoping to snag a seat at the Apple-funded and designed school, you face long odds. For the first year, about 4,000 people applied for spots, and only 200 were accepted, the Guardian reports.  That's roughly a 5% admissions rate — about the same as Harvard, Stanford, and other elite colleges.  Next year, the center plans to admit 400 students.  Apple's iOS development center is located in San Giovanni a Teduccio, a suburb of Naples. The program is a nine-month course focused on improving students' software development skills using Apple products and tools.  The Guardian reveals that Apple has been very involved in the program, even going so far as to dictate details such as the lighting of the classrooms and the color the walls were painted:  The layout of the large, open-plan classroom was designed by Apple. “The didactic model is very new [for us],” Angrisani said. Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world. The University of Napoli Federico II Apple first announced the center in January, shortly after it reached a tax deal with the Italian government. The company plans to open other app development centers in countries such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia.  Although construction on the campus isn't complete, according to the Guardian, Apple's partner, the University of Napoli Federico II, has released a series of photos looking at where the Apple-funded classes will take place.  Take a look at the picturesque campus while you prepare your application for next year.  SEE ALSO: Apple is opening a school for 600 programmers on the coast of Italy NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

USA TODAY In this Sept. 9, 2015, photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 6S during an Apple media event in San Francisco. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — What could be the finale to the five-year-old Samsung-Apple patent dispute heads to the nation's highest court this week. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear oral arguments on financial damages the South Korean smartphone behemoth owes Apple for alleged violation of design patents. It could eventually decide damages and, more important, define the value of design work, which is increasingly  valuable in the tech industry as products like smartphones become commodities. The court typically issues decisions three to four months after hearing arguments. "If you asked people six years ago about design patents, they would have shrugged," Stanford Law professor Mark Lemley says. "This case has brought the topic into focus, and we’ve seen an increase in the number of lawsuits. It is seen as a strong method of protecting some kinds of innovation." A jury in 2012 decided Samsung infringed on three of Apple's iPhone design patents (covering smartphones with a rectangular shape, curved corners and 16 colorful circles on a black screen), based on their look and not function. Apple was awarded nearly $1 billion — Samsung’s profits from the allegedly infringed phones — though the award was reduced on appeal to $584 million. Samsung attorneys argue not all of a smartphone’s value is in its design. Utility patents, essentially the phone’s features, also are of value. The jury’s decision to award all of Samsung’s profits based on design infringement is a misreading of an 1886 patent law, they say. Apple declined to comment on the case, the first before the Supreme Court, but it has made no secret it believes Samsung blatantly ripped off the iPhone design. It has repeatedly said Samsung in three months produced copycats of the iconic smartphone it took three years to create. The acrimonious battle between the world's two most successful smartphone makers, which began in April 2011, could redefine a 130-year-old design patent law and upend the tech industry, say legal experts. It is being watched closely by others, many of whom have a stake in the outcome as they compete with Apple for smartphone sales. Facebook, Google, Dell and Lenovo are among those backing Samsung; Apple has the support of more than 100 designers from companies such as Nike and Calvin Klein. Last week, Google announced Pixel, a new smartphone line, aimed squarely at Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy. In the hour-long session with eight Supreme Court justices, Samsung lawyers will make their case for 25 minutes, followed by the Solicitor General’s office for 10. Apple’s legal team will have 25 minutes to respond. Samsung reps might then be called on for a final rebuttal. Complicating matters: The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, reducing the court to eight members. Senate Republicans refuse to consider President Obama’s choice, Judge Merrick Garland. Predicting an outcome may be a coin flip because the court is currently locked in a 4-4 split along ideological lines, says Georgetown Law professor Rebecca Tushnet.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 9, 2016 at 12:05PM Wall Street analysts are sharply divided in their expectations for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Some are predicting a return to solid iPhone sales growth in the current quarter (Q1 of Apple's fiscal 2017). Others expect iPhone sales to continue declining for now. Indeed, there are reasons for optimism as well as reasons for caution regarding Apple's Q1 iPhone sales. However, on balance, the evidence suggests that Apple will report a solid increase in iPhone sales for the quarter ending in December. Analysts' estimates increase -- but there are plenty of pessimists A month ago, most analysts had very modest expectations for the iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus. After all, iPhone sales have been declining for nearly a year, and the new iPhones don't offer any revolutionary upgrades. Early demand for the new iPhones has been solid. Image source: Apple. However, since then, a variety of good news has trickled out. All four big U.S. wireless carriers reported record iPhone pre-orders. Additionally, various supply chain sources have indicated that Apple is raising its iPhone component orders. Finally, the iPhone 7 Plus in particular has a long order backlog. As a result, analysts are slowly but surely raising their iPhone unit shipment estimates for Q1. Most of the analysts who have revised their forecasts in recent weeks now expect Apple to sell more iPhones in the current quarter than the 74.8 million it moved in last year's first quarter. Still, some remain skeptical of Apple's near-term prospects. For example, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz recently cut his Q1 iPhone shipment estimate to 67.8 million units. That would represent a nearly 10% year-over-year decline. Moskowitz thinks that after the initial burst of sales to early adopters, iPhone 7 demand could quickly peter out. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities -- often lauded as the most accurate Apple analyst -- is also skeptical about iPhone sales. Kuo recently raised his Q1 shipment estimate from his initial forecast of 65 million to a range of 70 million to 75 million, but that still implies that sales will be flat or down year over year. Two reasons for optimism So which analysts are right? Two major factors point toward a year-over-year increase in iPhone shipments. First, Apple's fiscal first quarter has an extra week this year: something that happens once every five or six years. In each of the past two years, Apple has shipped an average of more than 5.7 million iPhones per week during Q1. Thus, the extra week represents a big sales tailwind. Second, lead times for all iPhone models remain significant, three weeks after the new iPhones went on sale. Apple's online store is quoting a two to three week wait for most iPhone 7 configurations. For the iPhone 7 Plus, it's an even longer wait, topping out at six to eight weeks for the new Jet Black finish. Additionally, as of a week ago, U.S. Apple Store locations still had virtually no availability of the iPhone 7 Plus for walk-in purchases. In China, retail availability is scarce even for the regular iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus is out of stock at most retail outlets. Image source: Apple. The apparent shortage of iPhones and the reported increases in Apple's component orders point to a strong demand environment. That bodes well for sales this quarter. Two reasons why growth could remain elusive However, there are two reasons why long lead times and the extra sales week might not translate into a big sales gain. First, Apple significantly increased its iPhone channel inventory last fall, boosting shipments. It then had to undergo a painful inventory correction over the next two quarters. To avoid a repeat of that scenario, Apple may look to exit the current quarter with a lower level of channel inventory, weighing on Q1 iPhone shipments. Second, low supply may be the main reason why retail stocks are low and online lead times are long. iPhone 7 Plus adoption is running at a similar rate to last year's iPhone 6s Plus, but iPhone 7 adoption has been noticeably slower relative to the iPhone 6s, according to Fiksu. Whether due to manufacturing hiccups or a deliberate plan by Apple to build fewer iPhones this fall, fewer devices are getting into users' hands relative to the last two iPhone product cycles. iPhone demand is clearly greater than supply right now, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is high enough to drive year-over-year sales growth. A return to growth is the more likely outcome It's important to recognize that low supply could be making iPhone demand appear stronger than it really is.

Apple TV LED TVs Apple Discontinues 3rd-Gen Apple TV: Is it Preparation? Tyler Lacoma October 9, 2016 Shares Apple is narrowing its set top box line up. If you’re an Apple fan, you know that Apple likes to update its generations pretty quickly – which has the downside of discontinuing support and production for older generations very quickly as well. That catch-22 was bound to catch up to the Apple TV before long, and now it has: In other words, if you’re looking for a set-top box to accompany your top 70-inch TV with all it’s new 4K glory…don’t pick the third-gen Apple TV. The third-generation Apple TV was a massive upgrade compared to earlier versions, but it’s four years old now, so it’s no surprise that Apple sent an email to its staffers that announced that it will be discontinuing the product. Of course, this doesn’t just mean that the third generation will be impossible to find in stores after a while – it also affects the way that Apple updates its products. If production is discontinued, you can bet that support won’t be too far behind, which means that third-gen Apple TVs will eventually become useless, unable to play the latest apps or content. Unfortunate, but that’s the deal you make with technology like this. Apple is keeping the 4th-gen TV but getting rid of the 3rd. The good news is that Apple has given the Apple TV some huge improvements in later generations, and the fourth-gen model is no exception. It provides its own App Store, a little Siri Remote, game support, and a lot of other advanced features. So don’t feel too bad about upgrading if you liked your third-generation model but want to move with the times. The fourth-gen model starts at $149, and is generally worth it for Apple fans. Of course, there’s always the chance that Apple is getting ready to release a fifth generation model soon. If that interests you, you may want to wait a few months before making a decision.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeFeaturedThis Patent Hints at a Home Button-Less iPhone 8 (AAPL) This Patent Hints at a Home Button-Less iPhone 8 (AAPL) Not content on nixing the headphone jack on the iPhone; Apple may eventually do away with the iconic Home button on future models. October 9, 2016 WSP Planning to spend your hard earned $$$ on the newly launched iPhone 7? Hold off the upgrade until next year because the iPhone 8 is shaping up to be everything that its older sibling is not. Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumored flagship 2017 smartphone is expected to feature exciting new technology, not the same old same old that the Cupertino-based company has been feeding fan boys for years. Apart from virtual reality [VR] capabilities, the iPhone 8 may come with a new fingerprint sensor, one that’s capable of getting accurate readings of your fingertips through the screen. The patent was announced by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and it’s expected to change the way you use your iPhone. For one thing, the new tech will eliminate the need for the traditional Home button, arguably the most used feature on the iPhone. The Home button has been a part of the iPhone’s anatomy since the smartphone launched in 2007 and it’s unthinkable to abandon it altogether. Initially, the Home button was used to direct users to the home screen but over the years, this feature has evolved to accommodate more functions, including fingerprint scanning thanks to the integration of TouchID. Unfortunately, the Home button is also one of the most abused features of the iPhone so it has been a source of problems for many users. According to the patent filing, the technology is a “capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens,” which allows users to activate the iPhone through the display, not via a dedicated button. Essentially, the sensor conducts authentication all over the display. What’s more, the tech is better at reading a user’s fingerprint than the existing finger print scanner on older iPhone models. As described by Apple, the new tech addresses “an interest in avoiding assigning valuable surface space exclusively to a component that may only be used briefly during the process of identifying the user.” Since the new sensor eliminates the need for the home button, Apple can adopt an edge-to-edge display to expand the screen’s surface area.  Without the Home button, engineers are given more room to redesign the smartphone’s display without increasing its size. So, how does the new sensor works? The electrostatic lens is used to prevent electric fields from blurring, which may result in inaccurate readings or errors.  The lens features several conductive layers that bend around a user’s fingerprint, boosting accuracy. The new tech sounds exciting and it is expected to solve a lot of design issues that plague older models but here’s the thing: there’s no saying if the tech will be implemented on the iPhone 8. As with most companies, Apple has been filing multiple patents every year and most of them remain unused. It is fairly common for tech companies to file patents to eliminate the competition and this could be just another technology that Apple is hoping to snuff.

Lasta Oct 9, 2016 | 7:46 AM Many Apple fans expected that the MacBook Pro 2016 will be unveiled at the same time as the iPhone 7 was launched last September. That didn't happen apparently, much to the dismay of fans waiting for the latest edition of the laptop. In fact, the company hasn't even mentioned anything about a new version of the MacBook Pro. That's not to keep people from writing about MacBook Pro 2016 rumors regarding the specs, dimensions and features of the device. Here are some of them. New Features TechRadar says the MacBook Pro 2016 will run on SkyLake processors. These processors were developed by Intel back in 2015; a microarchitecture redesign over the previous Broadwell architecture. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit A new feature that is said to debut in the 2016 MacBook Pro is the OLED panel which will replace the physical function buttons at the top of the keyboard. The panel is also rumored to be fully customizable, which means that instead of function keys, the panel can show shortcut symbols to your favorite apps, for example. The Macbook Pro 2016 is also rumored to feature TouchID, which means fingerprint security may be available for this latest MacBook, much like the latest iPhone. MacBook Pro 2016 will also have a slimmer and sleeker design. This is according to Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities analyst. He said Apple will use specialized hinges for this to happen. The sleeker design will come from "shallower curves around the edges," according to Tech Times. Specs The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a 15-inch 5K Apple display (equivalent to 5120 x 2880 screen resolution) and will come in various colors. It will also have the Lightning port for audio and four USB-C ports. It will also have AMD Polaris GPUs. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also rumored to have a 13-inch variation. Rescheduled Apple Event The rumored launch date of the MacBook Pro 2016 was set at an October event. However, Apple announced that this event will be moved at a later date because they re-scheduled their 4th quarter earnings call. Along with the announcement of the MacBook Pro 2016, it was also rumored that Apple was supposed to announce other products and product upgrades. The launching date could be moved next month, November, and rumors have already surfaced that the MacBook Pro will be launched by then. Price The MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to be worth at least $1099 for the 13-inch variation, and $2,099 for the 15-inch; pretty hefty prices but with all its rumored features on hand, that may be justified.

The issue first came to light via an extensive iFixit report that surfaced earlier that month. The Apple community highly respects iFixit who is famous for their quick product teardowns that reveal every component and more with precision and carefully taken photos. It's like hardware forensics. Once their report pointed to a growing issue with the iPhone 6 Plus that they dubbed "touch disease' it was evident that a legal firm would jump on this and start a class action.   On October 2, Patently Apple posted another report on the matter titled "New iPhone 6 'Touch Disease' Class Action Lawsuits Filed against Apple in Canada is a Troublesome Trend."   Yesterday the latest news on this issue came to light courtesy of a new report by 'Motherboard' titled "Three Law Firms Join iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' Lawsuit against Apple."   The report begins by stating that "There is increasing pressure on Apple to explain why it's ignored the fact that touchscreens on thousands of iPhone 6 Plus devices have stopped working, leaving consumers on the hook to replace devices that have a fundamental engineering flaw. Lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit against the company in California earlier this fall have signed on three additional law firms to support their case, and an additional class action lawsuit related to the issue has been filed against Apple in Utah."

Skip to content 52 Tiger Menu Home Begin Here Contact RSS feeds Search for: Apple Watch Series 2’s shifting focus October 9, 2016 / Dave Caolo / Leave a comment Apple released the second iteration of its Apple Watch — called Apple Watch Series 2 — about a month ago. This update is in line with the company’s preference of small, steady improvements over huge leaps forward. It looks almost identical to its predecessor and features nice changes like on-board GPS, dramatically increased water resistance, a faster processor and an improved display. All in all, it’s a sweet piece of kit. Is it enough to warrant upgrading from the original model, which is just 18 months old? I don’t think so. It does, however, offer two things: a renewed focus on athletic owners, and a strong incentive for those who passed on the original. That’s the sentiment I’m seeing in the initial reviews. Writing for CNN Money, Samantha Murphy Kelly notes that, while still a splurge at $369, “…the Apple Watch is finally getting closer to where it should have been all along.” I should note here that the original model is still available with a price drop and improved processor. That’s more affordable, but it lacks the swim tracking, superior water protection, brighter screen and built-in GPS that make its successor so appealing. Over at Ars Technica, Valentina Palladino calls the Series 2 “…still optional, but pleasantly defined.” Meanwhile, The Verge‘s Lauren Goode hits on something I want to examine further. With this update, she notes, the Apple Watch is first and foremost fitness tracker: “The Apple Watch Series 2 is exactly [a fitness tracker]. It’s what Apple had resisted calling its wearable for the past year and a half, even declining to categorize it as such when citing industry rankings, opting for the ‘smartwatch’ category instead. It is, definitely, still a smartwatch. But the Watch now has focus, and that’s a good thing.” Apple even announced a partnership with Nike, resulting in the Apple Watch Nike +. It comes with a few exclusives, including a perforated sport band, Nike-themed watch faces and a list of unique Siri commands, as well as deep integration with the Nike+ Run Club app. Apple’s renewed focus on the Watch as a fitness device is notable because it contrasts earlier marketing efforts and speaks to its future. Fitness When Apple Watch was introduced, Apple positioned it as a fitness tracker but also as a fashion accessory. You’ll remember that model model Christy Turlington Burns joined Apple CEO Tim Cook on stage in 2015 for the device’s introduction. It was a smart move, as Christy — a model and marathoner — represents both fashion and athletics. Christy then posted a series of videos chronicling her use of the Watch in a half marathon. But really, fashion was the real push. In October of 2014, shortly after the original device’s announcement, Vogue China featured supermodel Liu Wen sporting the Apple Watch on its October cover. In the following weeks, the Watch appeared on the pages of Vogue France, Vogue USA, Self (USA), and Style (UK). It was a smart move, as it allowed Apple to court an industry that was foreign to the tech giant. You could argue that is was also a bit of misdirection away from the original model’s deficits: No GPS capability, moderate water protection, a screen that’s hard to read in bright sun. With Series 2, Apple has addressed those issues and is all about touting the device to athletes. Built-in GPS is great for runners who don’t want to drag an iPhone along. A screen that’s twice as bright as version one means its easier to read outdoors. The real benefit here is for swimmers. Apple Watch Series 2 is water resistant up to 50 meters. The Workout app tracks both pool swims and open-water swims, recording laps, distance and stroke. When you opt to start a swim workout, the Watch locks its touchscreen display so that you won’t accidentally engage it during your workout. When you’re done, turn the crown and hit “End.” The speaker then ejects water that was collected while you were in the water. But really you needn’t be a swimmer to reap this benefit. A water-lock feature is available outside of swimming workouts by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Ever use the shower at the gym? Now you don’t have remove your Apple Watch and pray that no one finds it. Should you buy? What does this all mean for making a purchase decision? If you’re main focus is fitness, and you don’t own an original Apple Watch…and you have $400 lying around…Series 2 is a great way to go. Apple’s renewed focus on fitness bodes will for the device’s future. Those looking for a one-stop wearable should consider the lower-cost Apple Watch. Current models have a faster processor than the those sold in the first go-round and start at $269. Finally, WatchOS3 has made many original Watch owners — myself included — feel like we got a new device. So I’m happy with my OG Watch. As for the device itself, it’s just a bit thicker and heavier than the original, but it’s not noticeable on the wrist. It’s still available in the same case sizes (38mm and 42mm), as well as aluminum and stainless steel. Note that a new high-end material, ceramic, has replaced the gold model. Smartwatches will likely never be as essential as smart phones (especially as long as they rely on a Bluetooth tether for internet connectivity), but they’re maturing into the useful accessory that manufacturers want them to be. Apple Watch Series 2 is a nice step towards that goal.

Projecting the Giants' inactives Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 09, 2016 at 7:01 AM, updated October 09, 2016 at 7:57 AM comments GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Giants should get some much-need reinforcements in their secondary for Sunday night's game at Green Bay. Cornerback Dominique Rodgers (groin) said he expects to play after dressing but not seeing action in Monday's loss to the Vikings. Cornerback Eli Apple (hamstring) made progress this week after missing Monday's game. Apple could be active in an emergency role on Sunday night like Rodgers-Cromartie was last week. The Giants will officially announce their inactive list 90 minutes before Sunday's 8:30 p.m. kickoff. Here's my projection for who will be inactive: •RB Rashad Jennings: For the third straight week Jennings was limited in practice with a thumb injury. ESPN reported Saturday that it is unlikely Jennings will play. It looks like the Giants will again lean on Orleans Darkwa, Bobby Rainey and Paul Perkins as Jennings continues to recover. Giants need creativity •DT Robert Thomas: Thomas returned to the practice field for the first time in four weeks after dealing with an illness. He may help the Giants eventually, but he could probably use another week to build up his conditioning. If Thomas is active, I'd expect  defensive tackle Montori Hughes to sit. •QB Josh Johnson: I expect Johnson to be a healthy scratch for the fifth straight game. Johnson is strictly an insurance policy, as Ryan Nassib remains Eli Manning's backup. •TE Larry Donnell: The starting tight end has been ruled out with a concussion. Donnell suffered the injury in Monday's loss to the Vikings. There is no timeline for Donnell's return. Will Tye will take the majority of tight end snaps with rookie Jerell Adams playing a bigger role. •S Darian Thompson: The starting free safety has been ruled out for the third consecutive game with a sprained foot. The injury won't require surgery, but Thompson remains in a walking boot and is being evaluated on a week-to-week basis. •S Nat Berhe: Thompson's backup has been ruled out for his second consecutive game with a concussion. Berhe has not practiced in the past two weeks. There is no word on Berhe will be ready to return. Rookie Andrew Adams is in line to make his second straight start at free safety. •RT Marshall Newhouse: The starting right tackle has been ruled out for the third consecutive game with a calf injury. There is no timeline for Newhouse's return. Bobby Hart will make his third straight start at right tackle. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

Richard BurrRichard BurrFive unanswered questions after Trump's upset victory Republican Burr prevails in NC Senate battle SENATE: Republicans defy odds to keep majority MORE (R). Laurene Powell-Jobs, the widow of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, tech venture capitalist Brook Byers and tech executive Amy Rao have all donated $2,700 to Ross, the maximum allowed. Paul Haahr, a top engineer at Google, has also donated $2,000 to Ross via the Bay Area based PAC, WomenCount. ADVERTISEMENT Burr, meanwhile, received virtually no donations from tech donors in San Francisco and surrounding areas like Palo Alto, Atherton, Los Altos and Woodside during the last two fundraising quarters.  The tech industry has clashed with Burr over encryption and privacy issues. After the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December, the FBI requested that Apple create software to allow it access into one of the shooter’s iPhones. Apple refused on the grounds that creating such a backdoor could pose a security risk to customers. Burr has subsequently worked on a bill with Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinFBI under fire from all sides 5 races for tech to watch DOJ pledges to review new Clinton emails 'expeditiously' MORE (D-Calif.) that would grant law enforcement easier access to consumer data. Tech companies, privacy groups and other tech interests vocally opposed it. "Deborah also hears people in North Carolina echo the same concerns that the tech industry has raised,” a Ross campaign aide told The Hill. “Those are concerns she takes seriously." Still, Ross has not firmly come out against the bill that Burr negotiated with Feinstein — something the Republican’s campaign was quick to note. "Deborah Ross has refused to take a position on the Burr-Feinstein bill, whether she would require tech companies to provide unencrypted data for terrorist’s phones," said a Burr campaign spokesperson to The Hill. "She was asked three times about that on ‘Capital Tonight.’ Three times she refused to take a position. I think that’s telling to Deborah Ross’s desire or her philosophy when it comes to combating terrorism." The 2016 race in North Carolina, which Burr has previously said will be his last, is an unexpectedly close one, and could help decide the Senate majority in 2017.  The Real Clear Politics polling average has the race as a toss up, with Ross ahead by just 0.2 points.  Ross had little name recognition going into the race and experts did not think she would have much of a chance. Republican political consultant in North Carolina Carter Wrenn told Reuters that he attributes the closeness of the race, in part to Republican presidential nominee Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump faces decisions and opposition on counterterrorism proposals ‘Simpsons’ nods to 2000 election prediction Trump: 'I'll take a year' as president MORE. “We’re not sure it’s a wave here for Democrats, but it’s beginning to look that way,” Wrenn said. “Any Republican running down here ought to be very concerned about Trump’s impact.”  Though many in tech are excited about the prospect of a Ross victory, she has not staked out a firm stance on encryption issues.  “Deborah will work to make sure that our intelligence community has the tools they need to keep our communities safe,” said Ross’s Press Secretary, Cole Leiter when asked about Ross’s views on encryption and privacy. “She also recognizes it is crucial there are strong checks and balances on those tools to prevent their abuse and to protect the privacy of individuals.” Privacy and encryption supporters are optimistic because of Ross’s past work as a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. “That suggests she would come in pretty strongly in favor of encryption,” said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF). The ITIF is affiliated with the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association in Washington, D.C., that represents tech companies like Dell, Facebook and Google.  A policy analyst at an advocacy group focused on tech policy and civil liberties who asked to not be named offered a more simple rationale for hoping Ross wins. “The most important thing is that she’s not Sen. Burr,” the analyst said. “I can’t overstate the value of removing an obstacle on these issues in the Senate. From what I have seen and heard from her campaign, I’m confident that she will be good on these issues,” they said.   Though tech firms haven’t publicly commented on the North Carolina race, in April, coalitions representing companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook blasted Burr and Feinstein's legislation that would give law enforcement more access to user data. A representative at one major tech company who is not authorized to speak on the election and asked not to be named said his company and tech interests in general had been frustrated with Burr’s refusal to listen to them on privacy matters. ITIF Vice President Castro expressed similar sentiment. “The Burr encryption bill is something that people in tech were really frustrated by,” he said. “I think it misunderstood encryption and how it can be resolved. It gave unfair weight to law enforcement side. It tried to say how American companies should put in encryption in their products.” Overall, Burr’s policy stances seem to be at odds with the ethos of Silicon Valley. “[Burr’s bill] tried to say how American companies should put in encryption in their products,” said Castro. “Silicon Valley believes that the private sector should be free to create.”  This story was corrected to reflect that the ITIF is affiliated with the Information Technology Industry Council.

Tech giants race for edge in artificial intelligence AFP 09/10/2016 Glenn Chapman © Provided by AFP Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung © Provided by AFP Samsung moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook © Provided by AFP Facebook is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M" Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPhone 8 Rumors Already All Over the Web, How Far Could the Company Go? Let’s See! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 10, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» We’ve already seen that Apple are still willing to go against the grain and aren’t afraid of some criticism when they do what they feel is right. The removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 is still being talked about, and it actually looks like the topic isn’t going to die down anytime soon. And even though the iPhone 8 is still definitely a long, long time away, this hasn’t stopped some people from speculating about the device and discussing what Apple could do next. Many people are expecting the company to possibly do something even more drastic this time, but nobody seems quite sure what to expect in this regard. Some of the rumors about the device talk about a bolder approach to its physical design, such as taking away the bezels as much as possible, perhaps even getting rid of the Home button. It would be strange to see an iPhone without the iconic round button under the screen, but on the other hand, it would also free up a lot of space that’s currently going unused. The camera of the device could see a significant upgrade as well, with talks about an improved sensor but also better durability. There are not many complaints about the hardness of the iPhone 7’s camera glass at the moment, so we are not sure where these rumors are coming from, but regardless, they are out there. Other than that, there are also some claims that Apple might be looking to make the next iPhone a particularly special device, as it’s arriving at a special time. 2017 would mark ten years since the iPhone arrived to the market, and it wouldn’t be surprising if Apple are preparing an event to celebrate that. And what better way to remember the original iPhone than to launch a brand new one that reminds everyone why they joined the platform in the first place? If Apple were to design a new iPhone with a more classic approach to its design, keeping everything that made the device so iconic in the first place and throwing on a fresh coat of paint, we can definitely see it becoming a huge hit on the market. As for the controversial headphone jack, we somehow don’t expect to see it coming back, at least not immediately. Apple might eventually decide to reverse their decision, but it would be too early if they did it straight away with their next device. It would show indecisiveness, something which nobody wants to see from the company right now. Apple have traditionally been seen as an industry leader, helping push innovative trends forward, so if they give up on something so easily, that wouldn’t be in their style. Then again, the company has obviously changed a lot over the years, and they are not exactly the same as they used to be. The changes in their leadership have definitely had an impact on the quality of the devices we’ve seen on the market, and some fans are claiming that the change hasn’t been for the better. But on the other hand, despite the huge controversy around the iPhone 7, the device still managed to score some great reviews and positive responses across the board, so it’s clear that Apple still have plenty of supporters no matter what they choose to do. With that in mind, they should definitely go for some riskier decisions when designing the iPhone 8.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iOS 10 Brought Many of the Changes People Wanted, What’s Next? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 10, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Some have been critical of the progress Apple have made in iOS 10, claiming that things have been coming along too slowly. But it’s clear that Apple have a vision for the system and they are moving forward with their ideas, so all fans can do is look towards the future and wait for even more improvements. iOS 10 is actually quite good in many aspects, according to critics, and the operating system delivers nicely in aspects which were a bit poorly realized before. It became more polished and refined, and even though the most major improvements are under the hood and not directly visible, people were still generally pleased with the way things work as a whole. The OS became more consistent in its visuals, something which was a bit of a poor feature for it before, at least in the last few iterations. Apple seem to have had some internal conflicts regarding the looks of iOS 9, but that’s no longer the case, as the new version looks fresh and tight. On the other hand, some of the company’s decisions in this regard have been brought under question, such as the redesign of the action center. Perhaps these are temporary quirks that will get ironed out eventually, as otherwise the operating system gives a great impression with the way its menus look and feel. Performance has seen a strong improvement as well, although iOS 10 also requires adequate hardware in order to benefit from those new speeds. Those who do more active multitasking on their devices should notice a more consistent and reliable experience when switching between apps, although it’s of course hard to quantify the exact range of those improvements. Security is another aspect that has been a major priority for Apple recently, and this is becoming even more obvious with iOS 10. The company has been putting a lot of effort into locking the OS down and preventing people from tampering with it. And while this should come as good news to most of their fans, some are actually displeased with the situation. The new security improvements have reportedly made it even more difficult to jailbreak iOS devices, continuing a long debate between the company and its fans that has been going on for quite a long time so far. Many people claim that Apple should actually stop fighting against jailbreakers, and let people do what they want with their iOS devices, accepting all risks. However, we’ve seen some incidents over the last few months which made it obvious that there is actually a point in Apple watching over all of their users carefully to prevent incidents like this. A series of malware attacks targeting iOS jailbreak users made it clear that there is a need for the added security that Apple have been fighting for, although some still claim that there might be a reasonable middle ground that doesn’t involve keeping the system so tightly restricted. Apple have already been putting some effort in this regard as well though, such as allowing their users to sideload apps under certain conditions. It may not be perfect, but it’s probably the most the company can do right now in light of the overall situation. Perhaps in the future they will be able to open up iOS even more, once they’ve implemented some more advanced security features that block attackers from gaining serious access to the system’s internals.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPad 2017 Rumors Keep Adding Up, Fans Are Left Confused! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 10, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Anyone who’s been following Apple for a longer time should know very well that the company’s products are constantly surrounded by speculation, and it’s quite hard to browse the Internet without regularly running across rumors about them. This can make it very hard to figure out what to expect from the company with their upcoming releases, and some fans prefer to just avoid rumors altogether and wait for the official announcements to arrive. On the other hand, some actually enjoy taking part in the speculation, and recently we’ve seen some interesting discussions about the next release in the company’s iPad line. What are Apple planning for 2017 in this regard, and are they going to surprise us with any unusual releases? One of the biggest questions on many fans’ minds right now is about the future of the iPad Mini. A lot has been said about the tablet over the last months, and it’s clear that many see it as a questionable entry in the company’s line-up at this point. Apple themselves might be starting to doubt the future of the device, as they haven’t said much about it recently. There are rumors that there won’t be a new iPad Mini in 2017, as the company will instead announce that they are killing off the brand and are going to focus on the standard iPad, possibly also on its advanced editions. There are also rumors claiming the opposite – that not only is the iPad Mini alive and well, but that we’re even going to see a dual release with another tablet next year. It remains to be seen which of the two is true – if it’s even one of those rumors at all – but the situation is definitely very confusing right now. And to top it off, there are multiple claims going around regarding the specifications of the 2017 iPad. Some expect the company to release a device that’s very heavily focused on multimedia, with features like a larger screen, multiple speakers, and more. On that note, some have also been wondering about the headphone jack – in some cases jokingly, while others seem to treat this as a more serious issue. The removal of the 3.5mm jack from the iPhone 7 caused a lot of controversy among Apple’s fans, and we’re still seeing some discussions about it today. The main argument in favor of the move was that Apple were able to save physical space inside the iPhone, but that shouldn’t be such a major concern with the design of the much larger iPad. In fact, Apple can not only potentially keep the headphone jack intact, but also add some new sensors or other pieces of hardware to the device in order to improve its range of features. Of course, that’s just wishful thinking, and it also assumes that we know the exact reason for the removal of the headphone jack. There are other theories about the situation as well, such as the suggestion that Apple want to control the market for their own peripherals. But that’s a different topic altogether. For now, discussions about the iPad are more concerned with other features, even though there are definitely lots of people who’re asking about the headphone jack as well. Some are curious if the next tablet is going to get an even larger resolution in its screen, as this is one of the things Apple have been pushing for the hardest.

Did Yahoo spy on its users for the US government? 0 Share: Internet by Laura Hautala October 5, 2016 9:22 AM PDT @lhautala Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Time to quit Yahoo? Site reportedly spied on emails for US government An unsettling report says Yahoo complied with government requests to scan all incoming user emails, and even wrote a special program to do so. Between this news and the massive data breach, how can consumers trust Yahoo with their privacy? by Bridget Carey 2:17 Close Drag Enlarge Image Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer reportedly chose to obey the government's demand.Photo by ChrisFarina, Corbis via Getty Images Yahoo built surveillance tools last year after the National Security Agency or the FBI issued a secret directive to scan all customers' incoming emails, according to a Reuters report. The agencies asked the internet company to search for "a set of characters," according to the report, which cited anonymous former Yahoo employees. That could be a phrase, for example, or an attachment, sources told Reuters. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer chose to obey the directive, Reuters reported, a decision that prompted then-Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos to leave the company in June 2015. Stamos reportedly told people working for him that a programming flaw could give hackers access to customers' stored emails. He is now Facebook's security chief. Reuters was not able to confirm whether any other company had faced the same secret directive Yahoo complied with. "Yahoo is a law-abiding company and complies with the laws of the United States," a Yahoo spokesman said in an email Tuesday. The FBI and NSA didn't respond to requests for comment. Even so, the company disputed the Reuters report. "The article is misleading," Yahoo said in a statement Wednesday. "We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure. The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems." Yahoo's alleged acquiescence would be in stark contrast with the tech industry's public stance on consumer privacy. In January, Apple showed a willingness to defy an FBI request to write custom code that would break encryption on an iPhone tied to the San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. In March, more than 40 top tech companies signed amicus briefs supporting Apple in a court case that was resolved without a final ruling. 'We would fight it' Stamos declined to comment on the reasons behind his departure from Yahoo, but Facebook said it has never seen a directive like the one allegedly served to Yahoo. "Facebook has never received a request like the one described in these news reports from any government, and if we did we would fight it," a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. Others among tech's biggest names echoed that sentiment, often emphatically. "We have never received a request of this type," an Apple spokesman said in a statement. "If we were to receive one, we would oppose it in court." Twitter noted that it is suing the US government for the ability to share more about government demands for information. "We've never received a request like this, and were we to receive it we'd challenge it in a court," a Twitter spokesman said in a statement. "Separately, while federal law prohibits companies from being able to share information about certain types of national security related requests, we are currently suing the Justice Department for the ability to disclose more information about government requests." Microsoft has fought gag orders that would stop it from telling users when the government asks for their information. "We have never engaged in the secret scanning of email traffic like what has been reported today about Yahoo," Microsoft said in an emailed statement. Patrick Toomey, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an emailed statement that the government directive appeared to be "unprecedented and unconstitutional." Further, he criticized Yahoo for apparently complying without a fight. "It is deeply disappointing that Yahoo declined to challenge this sweeping surveillance order," Toomey said, "because customers are counting on technology companies to stand up to novel spying demands in court." The government's wide net Not everyone felt Yahoo deserved all the arrows it was receiving. Michael Sutton, chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Zscaler, said it's highly likely other companies received the classified directive. "Such a broad directive suggests that the intelligence community needed to cast a wide net, which likely included other providers," Sutton said. "Unfortunately, the very process of such directives precludes transparency and prohibits others from even revealing the existence of such a request." Stewart Baker, who served as the general counsel of the NSA from 1992 to 1994 and who critiqued privacy advocates in his book "Skating on Stilts: Why We Aren't Stopping Tomorrow's Terrorism," said it's not surprising that intelligence agencies would ask Yahoo for assistance like this. As companies encrypt user communications more, it becomes harder for the US government to intercept internet traffic and search it on its own. Baker said he prompts the governments to tell companies, "Well, you still have this information and you're capable of going through the selectors, so we're going to give you an order to do that." Baker is now an attorney at law firm Steptoe & Johnson who focuses on national security, privacy and computer security. Yahoo previously lost a court battle that forced it to comply with a secret surveillance program called Prism. That program, later revealed by Edward Snowden, let the NSA grab emails, video chats, photos and documents. Yahoo fought that court order before Mayer became CEO in 2012. The company is still recovering from a 2014 data breach, revealed in September, that affected half a billion Yahoo users in the world's biggest hack. Verizon in July announced plans to buy the internet pioneer for $4.8 billion. Verizon declined to comment for this story. Fatemeh Khatibloo, a privacy analyst with tech research firm Forrester, said she thinks the news of the email scanning combined with the news of the hack could give Verizon a reason to back away. "It changes the calculus around the Verizon acquisition," Khatibloo said. "Taken together, the asset is the users as Yahoo services. And, are there going to be any users left after this?"

A public beta of iOS 10.1 for non-developers is also currently active. tvOS 10.0.1 beta 2 for Apple TV and watchOS 3.1 beta 2 are also available for developers. Portrait mode is a feature that was demonstrated at Apple’s keynote earlier this month, but the major new feature wasn’t ready for primetime when the iPhone 7 Plus initially launched. Portrait still isn’t in the release versions of iOS, but developer and public betas released last month include a beta version of the feature which works well already. Aside from Portrait mode, we noted the changes includes in the first beta last month: There’s a new toggle setting in Accessibility called Auto-play Message Effects. This is related to Reduce Motion disabling Messages bubble and screen effects but the functionality does not seem to be implemented yet. According to the developer release notes, iOS 10.1 includes a fix for motion handling. Developers will be able to access barometric pressure data for iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro. For the impressive new Portrait mode in Camera, we went hands on with the new feature using the beta in our initial walkthrough. I also wrote about the new feature here.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 Comment: Google just couldn’t leave Apple out of its iPhone competitor keynote Zac Hall - 1 month ago @apollozac iPhone Google View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Google’s keynote today was knocked by some observers for having a similar style to Apple keynotes: a funny video to start things off, an intro from the CEO to set the stage, and product leaders announcing new products that they work on. I don’t really buy into that as a critique. Apple usually does an impressive keynote; they use a format that other companies should copy. Something else that stood out is Google’s habit of using subtle references to Apple critiques to pitch its products. That’s just not very Apple. There was a reference to ‘bumping phones’ a few years ago when Apple introduced AirDrop, but Apple tastefully avoided any combustion jokes when it introduced the iPhone 7 last month. Google, on the other hand, just couldn’t leave Apple out of its keynote. Google’s Apple dings weren’t just limited to the easy headphone jack reference either. Three things I picked up at the start: Google said customers want “more than 1,000 songs in your pocket” now; that’s a reference to Steve Jobs’ iPod introduction Google said “our products just work” which sounds like a play on Jobs’ “it just works” line about Apple products Google described its Pixel smartphone as having “no unsightly camera bump” which iPhones do have (and a lot of Android phones too) The ‘1,000 songs in your pocket’ line seemed to be in the context of technology changing, but it didn’t come across as especially necessary considering the availability of streaming music services from a variety of companies not named Google. Describing products that “just work” is surely meant to be a slight against Apple services, and the camera bump line is odd considering how unattractive so many Android camera bumps are. Speaking of the camera, Google’s new Pixel phone touts a DxOMark score of 89, which it says is the highest ever for any smartphone. For context, the iPhone 7 recently scored an 86 and the rating for the dual-camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus is “coming soon.” Clearly Google and DxOMark coordinated the test and slide as it was included before the phone’s official announcement and included in the keynote, but it seems highly possible that the iPhone 7 Plus could also score an 89 if not higher. It’s unclear if DxOMark will wait for iOS 10.1 which includes the DSLR-like depth effect feature too. DxOMark seems to be ignoring the iPhone completely when describing the quality of the Pixel camera: “Overall, the Pixel did extremely well in capturing our natural test images, typically performing as well or better than other current flagship models. However, on our greenery test scene below, it didn’t perform as well as some of the other flagship phones, as it lost details in the shadows.” It used the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 (both rated 88) for reference, but Pixel seems targeted in part at iPhone switchers with its premium price. Google even touts how easy it is to switch from iPhone. Then there’s the cheesy color names to discuss. We expected these but it’s even more cringeworthy to see on stage: Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver. Contrast that with Apple’s iPhone 7 color lineup: Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. You can joke that Jet Black and Black is silly, but Quite, Really, and Very come across as self-parodying or self-deprecating, not serious. What’s wrong with black, silver, and blue? Speaking of not serious, I can’t help but think that Android phone makers are going to regret mocking the iPhone 7’s lack of a headphone jack in a few short years. For starters, iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone to drop the headphone jack, it was merely the first to popularize it on smartphones. Motorola beat Apple to the punch in 2016. It also seems plausible that most if not all smartphones could drop the headphone jack in a few years. USB-C audio is positioned to do what Lightning is doing on iOS, and wireless Bluetooth audio is cross-platform. But Google is using ‘3.5mm headphone jack’ as a feature on a spec sheet now. This wasn’t even worth a mention before the iPhone 7, right? Headphone jack is the new “runs Flash!” — Zac Hall (@apollozac) October 4, 2016 It reminds me of the situation with Adobe Flash several years ago. iOS never adopted Flash support due to performance, battery life, and security; Android touted Flash support (with the aforementioned issues) on mobile as a feature in ads and Flash still died. Listing the headphone jack on a spec sheet and advertising it as ‘surprisingly not new’ will look just as dated in a matter of years. (So will pitching your new phone as being so new it doesn’t have a version number. I’m waiting for the Pixel 2.) You could nitpick at the Pixel design too: it has the antenna lines that Apple just hid, the front has the chin of an iPhone 5 with the Touch ID-style fingerprint scanner moved to the back, and there’s no premium curved display like Samsung phones despite its premium price. It’s also not immediately evident that Google Assistant is superior to Siri. I use Siri a lot and noticed that most if not all of the demos for Google Assistant would work just as well using Siri since 2011. Sending a message, booking dinner with OpenTable, playing a song. Google’s contextual awareness of what’s on-screen is different but not new to Pixel. One thing Google does get right is unlimited photo and video storage in the cloud when you buy its Pixel phone. By comparison, iPhones come with 5GB of free iCloud storage with paid accounts for up to 2TB available. I really wonder what stops Apple from using unlimited photo and video storage as a reason for customers to buy its iPhones. Surely there’s not a significant amount of revenue from iCloud storage upgrades from photo sync alone. Google couldn’t pitch this feature either without reminding us of Apple. Google Photos ads are especially fond of the iOS ‘storage is full’ dialog box. It costs $2.99 a month to access my iCloud Photo Library on my 256GB iPhone 7 and I’m inching closer to needing the $9.99 a month 1TB tier. I’ll give Google that one.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 PSA: The Apple Watch Series 1 is just as fast as Series 2 [Video] Jeff Benjamin - 1 month ago @JeffBenjam Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There seems to be a bit of confusion about the differences between the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2. To be sure, there are several differences between the two. We addressed these in our previous Apple Watch walkthrough, but speed isn’t among those differences. The point is, if you’re just looking for a faster, more agile Apple Watch, then you’ll be happy with any of the watches that you can currently buy from Apple. The company has discontinued the original, notoriously slow Apple Watch (Series 0), so anything you purchase in store or online will be one of the new, faster models. If you’re looking to see some of the things that the Apple Watch Series 2 offers over the Series 1, then check out our previous post. If, however, you’re solely interested in seeing how the Series 1 compares against the Series 2 from a performance perspective, then have a look at the video that follows below. As you’ll see, the performance between the two are the same. That’s because they both sport the same dual core processor. While it’s true that the Series 1 SiP (system-in-a-package) is called the S1P and the Series 2 SiP is called the S2, the differentiating factor is the presence of built-in GPS in the S2 SiP. The presence of GPS in Series 2 has no bearing on processor speed, and both watches are just as fast. Here’s what Apple’s Jeff Williams said about Apple Watch Series 1 during September’s iPhone 7 keynote: “We’ve added the same dual core processor that’s in Series 2, so it’s just as snappy…” So there you have it, a confirmation from Apple itself that both Series 1 and Series 2 feature the same dual core processor. Granted, Williams was extremely brief in his description of Series 1 — he spent about 20 seconds describing it — so it was easy to miss the fact that both devices share the same dual core processor. Apple no doubt wants to keep most of the attention fixed on the more expensive Series 2 model, instead of focusing on Series 1. Apple Watch Series 2 vs Series 2 speed test Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel for more Despite performance being the same, there are still reasons why one might consider Series 2 over Series 1. If you want GPS or any of the other benefits (50m water resistance, brighter screen, Pool Swim workouts, or Digital Crown wake, then check out the Apple Watch Series 2. Zac does a great job of reviewing the Series 2, and puts some of the features that set it apart to the test. If, however, you want a watch that’s just as fast without having to pay for features you probably won’t use, then the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 (starting at $269) is the perfect Apple Watch for you.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV, removes it from online store Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The gradual death of the third-gen Apple TV is continuing this evening, as Apple has officially discontinued the device. In an email sent out today to employees and education partners, obtained by 9to5Mac, Apple confirmed that it is discontinuing the device, shifting its focus entirely to the fourth-gen, tvOS-powered model and possibly a new model. In the email, Apple explained that it would fulfill order backlog for the device, but pointed partners towards the other available products for new purchases. Effective immediately, Apple TV (3rd generation), MD/199LL/A, has reached end of life and is now discontinued. The Apple Supply team is going to fulfill all shippable backlog. The death of the third-gen Apple TV has been gradual. Last month, Apple made it more difficult to locate the device on its online store, while retail locations began pulling the device from shelves. You can still get them if you look around. The best price currently is $59 at Staples new matching Apple’s refurb price. Apple has still not commented on its phasing out of the third-gen model, though it’s not surprising. The third-gen model was introduced in 2012 and was quietly updated a year later. Since then, Apple has shifted its focus to the tvOS-powered fourth-gen Apple TV. Currently, Apple is still selling refurbished models of the third-gen Apple TV for $59, but supply of refurb devices is always incredibly limited, so they probably won’t be there for long. After the refurbished models disappear, Apple will seemingly have stopped sales of the third-gen Apple TV all together. It’s unclear if the third-gen Apple TV will receive any additional software updates, but the device was last updated in February with a variety of security fixes. It remains to be seen if Apple will officially comment on the discontinuing of the third-gen Apple TV, as it has done with other products, or if it will be a silent process. Nevertheless, the fourth-gen model is now the company’s primary focus and we should expect updates there for a long time to come. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

October 5 AAPL: 113.05 0.05 Comment: Apple’s rescheduled earnings call could suggest new Mac announcement around October 27 Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro Mac View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When the largest company in the world changes the date of a quarterly earnings call, there has to be a good reason. It’s not the sort of thing you do on a whim. Apple has done this once before, and there was indeed a very good reason, which it shared with us: to allow senior Apple execs to attend the memorial service of long-standing board member Bill Campbell. This time, however, no explanation has been offered, and enquiries by reporters have received no response. I’m with Philip Elmer-DeWitt in thinking that there’s one very plausible explanation … That explanation is that Apple has brought forward its quarterly earnings call to make way for a keynote two days later. And the event we’re all expecting this month is the launch of new Macs. Why would Apple change the date, and not simply have the Mac keynote on the Tuesday and the earnings call on the Thursday? I don’t think there’s any great mystery there: Apple doesn’t want its shiny new Mac launch to be overshadowed by what are likely to be disappointing iPhone sales. While iPhone 7 sales appear to have been better than expected, with average selling price boosted by the greater popularity of the larger model, the smart money is still on another year-on-year decline. Apple’s own guidance calls for revenue between $45.5B and $47.5B – substantially down on the previous year’s $51.5B. Steve Jobs used to love giving very conservative guidance: under-promise, over-deliver. Tim Cook, in contrast, aims for realistic guidance. So it’s unlikely that we’ll see revenue so far above top-end guidance that it exceeds last year’s number. So, a Mac keynote on the Tuesday followed by the announcement of declining sales on the Thursday would lead to a brief celebration followed by gloom. Doing it the other way around presents a story of challenges followed by the excitement of what we all expect to be a significant revamp of the MacBook Pro, perhaps accompanied by a new MacBook Air, iMac and 5K display (and maybe a new Apple TV for good measure). On the MacBook Pro front, we’re expecting a sleeker form-factor, OLED touchscreen, Touch ID power button, Skylake processors and the option of AMD’s Polaris GPU. The only remaining mystery would be why Apple didn’t have the Mac date firmly in the diary long before this. My best guess here is that there’s been a component shortage of some kind, and Apple had to be sure this was resolved before announcing the date. That OLED touchscreen is a likely candidate. Another possibility is a delay to a macOS update needed for the new hardware. Do you agree? Or do you have an alternative theory? As Elmer-DeWitt observes, we can discount one possibility: that it allows time for more iPhone sales. Changing the date of the earnings call doesn’t change the reporting period, so revenue will be the same either way.

Yesterday we reported that Apple Pay launched in its 10th country this week with the addition of Russia through support from local Sberbank. That followed previous launches in Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and U.S. In addition to the 26 new banks for the US and Desjardins in Canada, Apple this month also added support for The Co-operative Bank and Metro Bank in the UK, bringing the total there up to 22 banks, and introduced support for British territories Guernse, Isle of Man, and Jersey. The next stop for Apple Pay could be Taiwan, as earlier this month a report noted that the country’s four big banks are making preparations to support the service soon. A full list of the newly supported banks and credit unions for Apple Pay in the US is below. As always, Apple maintains an updated list of supported banks on its website. American Heritage Bank Bank of Gravest Bank of Zachary Chain Bridge Bank Citizens Bank of Kentucky Citizens State Bank of Paola City National Bank of Colorado City First Bank of Missouri First Community National Bank First Credit Union First Flight Federal Credit Union First Guaranty Bank First National Bank (IA) First National Bank (MN) First National Bank (SD) First Savings Bank Grandpoint Bank HomeTrust Bank Merrimack Valley Federal Credit Union New Resource Bank Philadelphia Federal Credit Union Settlers Bank Shift Financial, Inc.

October 5 AAPL: 113.05 0.05 Apple ecosystem key to company remaining world’s most valuable brands, says Interbrand Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Interbrand’s annual brand value report lists Apple as the world’s most valuable brand for the fourth year running, estimating the total worth of the brand at $178B, up 5% on the previous year. Apple first knocked Coca-Cola out of Interbrand’s top slot in 2013. Apple is a technology company that leads innovation with their products and software platforms, providing seamless experiences across devices, and empowering people with breakthrough services. The company says that Apple’s ecosystem is the biggest contributor to the value of the brand … The fastest growing businesses in the world, and the strongest brands, are those with the most cohesive business systems […] Apple shows how ecosystems drive value. Analysts have often pointed out that “Apple has superior products.” While true, this opinion undersells the brilliance of Apple’s functionally- integrated model. Its software, hardware, and touchpoints are connected not just by beautiful design aesthetics, but by a level of interoperability that justifies the Apple premium and discourages defections to another platform. And the more data you share, the more personal it becomes— adding new devices is painless and the thought of switching increasingly unpromising. Apple is the Alpha of Cohesiveness in full effect. Interbrand says that tech companies like Apple have helped to redefine the meaning of branding. While the traditional view is concerned with image, identity and marketing campaigns, what companies like Apple deliver is ‘deeply integrated and connected experiences across their products or services.’ Apple regularly tops similar rankings, such as Fortune‘s Most Admired Companies.

By Dave Snelling / Published 10th October 2016 APPLE/GOOGLE RIVALS: Google has just announced its new Pixel smartphone Google is pretty confident that its new Pixel phone is going to be a big hit. With a AMOLED HD screen, decent camera, fast processor and premium design it's certainly got plenty going for it. Google is also including an easy way for iPhone owners to transfer their digital life from iOS to Android and is hoping Apple fans will jump ship. The Pixel is available for pre-order now with prices starting from a hefty £599 but before you make the switch here's seven things the Pixel can't do over its Apple rival. HERE'S 7 THINGS THE iPHONE CAN DO THAT THE PIXEL CAN'T Google major announcement in pictures - all the gadgets coming from Google Wednesday, 5th October 2016 GOOGLE has announced a host of new products including its new Pixel smartphone. 1 / 8 GOOGLE Google Pixel phone 1. TAKE IN THE BATH Google's Pixel can survive the odd splash of rain but dropping it down the loo could cause you a tech headache. Apple recently made their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus water resistant and it can now cope with a thorough soaking. In fact, Apple says users shouldn't have any issues with a 30-minute dip with their iPhone. .................................. 2. CAMERA ZOOM Google made a big song and dance about the Pixel's new camera including boasting that it's scored the highest marks ever from the famous DXO image tests. Daily Star Online hasn't tested this new camera yet but we do know one thing it doesn't have that the iPhone does. The new iPhone 7 Plus includes a dual lens which allows users to zoom when taking pictures. And we're not talking a pixel-busting digital zoom as the iPhone 7 Plus features a 2X optical zoom. This dual lens is also capable of taking pictures with depth of field making your smartphone snaps look like they've been taken on a pro camera. GOOGLE ON DISPLAY: Google's Pixel doesn't feature a Force Touch display DAILY STAR ONLINE Apple iPhone waterproof test 3. iOS 10 Android is getting much more user friendly and the Pixel features Google's very latest version of its Nougat software. However, Apple's iOS is still the easiest operating system to navigate and if you've got a Mac or an iPad you'll find it hard to switch to Android. Apps and games such as Nintendo's Super Mario Run often launch on iOS first, which is another reason to stick firmly with the iPhone. .................................. 4. FORCE TOUCH Apple introduced its Force Touch display last year and it's still one of the only smartphones on the market with this technology. Force Touch allows you to apply pressure to the screen to get quick access to features within apps and the iPhone's settings. Although the Pixel includes a super-sharp AMOLED display it doesn't feature any pressure sensitive tricks. APPLE GOOGLE/APPLE FEATURES: The iPhone will go head-to-head with Google's new Pixel 5. HUGE STORAGE Google is offering unlimited free cloud storage for anyone buying its Pixel but, unlike some of its Android rivals, it hasn't included expandable storage on the actual device. Although Apple doesn't have anyway of increasing memory, it has launched an iPhone with a whopping 256GB of storage which is double that of Google's biggest Pixel. .................................. 6. STEREO SPEAKERS It may not have a headphone port but the iPhone does has an incredible pair of stereo speakers. GETTY FANS: The iPhone brand is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal followers 7. iPHONE FACTOR Google has priced its Pixel in direct competition with Apple's iPhone and this could be its biggest hurdle. The iPhone is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal fans. With A-list celebs often caught using Apple's smartphone it's also still seen as the must-have device to own. Google is taking a big risk by pricing their Pixel so high and convincing fans to switch could be a tall order.

And, in a clear sign it wants to lure users, Google showed off a new feature to move content such as photos, contacts and settings from an iPhone.   They are even including a lead in the box to connect a Pixel to an iPhone.   Crucially, Google and EE, the network selling the devices, plan a multimillion-pound marketing campaign that will see the Pixel splashed across adverts on TV, in print and on billboards. An insider said: “By Christmas everyone will have heard of these phones.”   Not only do the Pixel phones look like the iPhone 7, they have similar features — detailed screens, top-of-the-range cameras and powerful processors.   They don’t, however, have the dual-lens camera of the bigger 7 Plus. Pixel handsets also feature Google Assistant, a new voice­activated virtual personal assistant that promises to answer questions and help organise users’ days for them.   Google reckons it is smarter than Apple’s similar Siri service.   When demonstrated on stage, the feature let Pixel offer details on a restaurant mentioned in a text message conversation — offering contact details, photos and directions.   Google drew laughs when it announced the Pixel devices have a headphone jack.   They also come with unlimited “cloud” storage, a service where you can back-up your photos, videos, contacts and emails on Google’s computers.   It is similar to Apple’s iCloud but that has a charge once you max out your free allowance. Many say they don’t swap phones because of the hassle of moving settings between rival devices, which is a key issue when switching between iPhones and devices running Android.   To help make that easier, Google has come up with the new software and thrown in a cable adapter.   The Pixel, with a 5in screen, and Pixel XL, which has a 5.5in one, are out on October 20 and can be pre-ordered from EE.   On two-year contracts, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month deal and the XL on £55.99. They come with unlimited minutes, texts and 10GB of data.   The phone can also be bought sim-free from £599 with 32GB of storage up to £819 with 128GB from Google or from Carphone Warehouse, which will also offer the phone on contracts with other networks.   Google has been involved in handsets before, under the Nexus name, but these are the first the company has fully designed.   And they are first to come under the “Phone by Google” branding.   The Nexus devices were produced with manufacturers including LG and Huawei and were not sold or marketed widely.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Apple got its verdict back—£100 million against Samsung Federal Circuit judges revive Apple patents on "slide-to-unlock" and autocorrect. by Joe Mullin (US) - Oct 9, 2016 6:15 am UTC Login to bookmark 140 Court documents What looked like a solid defense win for Samsung in the second Apple v. Samsung litigation has suddenly slipped away, due to an opinion issued earlier today by the full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The second Apple v. Samsung trial led to a $120 million jury verdict in Apple's favor. Samsung appealed, and, in February, a three-judge appeals panel said that the jury got it wrong. The judges stripped away Apple's win, saying one patent wasn't infringed and the other two were invalid. Apple got the full court to take up the case, and the three judges who sided with Samsung didn't win a single ally. An opinion (PDF) issued earlier today restores Apple's win entirely on an 8-3 vote. (One of the 12 sitting Federal Circuit judges, Richard Taranto, did not participate.) The earlier opinion held that US Patent No. 5,946,647, which describes how to turn phone numbers and other software "structures" into links, wasn't infringed because Samsung products didn't use an "analyzer server" as the term was defined. The opinion also found that US Patent Nos. 8,046,721 and 8,074,172, which respectively cover Apple's slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, were invalid in light of prior art. Today's opinion by the full court, written by Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore, wholly rejects those earlier findings, saying the three-judge panel went too far in reversing "nearly a dozen jury fact findings" involving infringement, prior art, copying, and other matters. Only the three judges from the original panel dissented, holding fast in their view that Samsung should win the day. On the '647 patent, the eight-judge majority held that "substantial evidence" supported the jury's decision that the accused devices used an "analyzer server." The dispute was over where the shared library code performs its functions—Apple argued that Samsung's shared library code is "separate" from the client, while Samsung argued there was no separate server. "The concept that the analyzer server must be 'standalone' or 'run on its own'... has no foundation in the '647 patent, in our prior Motorola decision, or in the parties briefs on appeal to this court," Judge Moore's majority opinion states. On the '721 slide-to-unlock patent, the majority noted that the patent emphasized making phone activation "user-friendly" and "efficient" while still preventing pocket dialing. Apple didn't contest that two prior art references disclosed all the elements of their patent claim, but argued that a person would not have been "motivated to combine" the various references. (One of the references, the Plaisant patent, is pictured above.) "[A] skilled artisan designing a mobile phone would not have been motivated to turn to a wall-mounted air conditioning controller to solve a pocket dialing problem," argued Apple, and the appeals court agreed. "[S]ubstantial evidence supports the jury's fact findings that Samsung failed to establish a motivation to combine," writes Moore. The opinion also cites Apple executive Philip Schiller's testimony at trial, touting how important the slide-to-unlock feature was in Apple's advertising. "That one gesture... you get an instant idea of how multitouch works so that you're doing a gesture on the screen, and it does something simple and useful to you, and that it's easy to use," Schiller said during his 2014 testimony. "Finally, the video of the crowd 'burst[ing] into cheers' when Steve Jobs demonstrated the slide to unlock feature supports a conclusion that consumers valued this particular feature," wrote Moore. As to the '172 autocorrect patent, the earlier panel agreed with Samsung that the Apple patent wasn't a serious improvement over two previous methods, including the US Patent No. 7,880,730, entitled "keyboard system with automatic correction." AApple’s expert testified that the earlier system didn’t display text while the user typed, so it doesn’t have all the features disclosed by Apple’s patent. The same expert argued that another piece of prior art, by Xrgomics, involves "word completion" that offers alternative words, and is not directed toward spelling correction. A reasonable jury could have agreed with Apple on those points, Moore wrote in her opinion today. All three judges from the original panel filed sharply worded dissenting opinions, disagreeing not just on the merits of the patents but about the manner in which the case was heard. Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna, for instance, complained that the full court chose to overturn the case on narrow grounds and did so without additional briefing from the parties, amici, or the government—all standard practice in a full-court "en banc" case. "The en banc decision neither resolves a disagreement among the court's decisions nor answers any exceptionally important question," wrote Reyna in his dissent. "The court should not have granted en banc review in this case." Today's decision involved the second Apple v. Samsung litigation. The first Apple v. Samsung case, which resulted in Samsung making a payment of $548 million to Apple after losing a jury verdict, will go to the US Supreme Court next week. It will be the first design patent case heard by the high court in a century.

Opptrends Home Cars Technology Gaming Entertainment Sport Home Technology Gartner projects decline in shipment for Microsoft and Apple devices Technology Gartner projects decline in shipment for Microsoft and Apple devices By Ali Raza - October 8, 2016 0 1383 SHARES Facebook Twitter tweet Source:losangelesherald.com Gartner, a research firm this week said that at the end of this year, every device that has Microsoft’s and Apple’s OS powering it will stop shipping. However, that of Apple is expected to pick up next year, while that of Microsoft will still be struggling to grow. Apple’s combination of macOS and iOS in 2017 which is expected to power iPhones and Macs will come in second behind Windows in the category of devices that were shipped in 2016. The gap that exists between the two is expected to slightly widen in 2018. Gartner in a forecast it gave to Computerworld where it broke down operating systems said that 260 million devices will be powered by Windows and shipped before 2016 comes to an end, which results in 12% decline through the year. For the 260 million devices, it represents 11.2% out of the total 2.3 billion in devices that run Google’s Android overwhelmingly. Also Read: Samsung Foldable Phone - most recent patent Source:computerworld.com All through last year and this year, 2016, Gartner has made a point of duty to reduce the number of devices that has been shipped and the portion that Windows have in the shipment made so far. The firm in March this year made a projection that the total number of devices that will be shipped this year will be 2.4 billion out of which 283 million will be powered by Windows representing 11.7%. There has been a documentation of the Microsoft’s operating system that has been experiencing shrinking share. Windows made an improvement this year after Microsoft gave up on the fight it has with Google and Apple by stepping out the smartphones market. Both macOS and iOS will account for the 259 million devices shipped this year alone which represents 11.1%. This is a decline from last year’s 278 million and a further decrease of 14% from the protection made in March this year. The reason for this is due to the sale of iPhone which is the major device that Apple is concentrating its effort on.

On Windows part, it is projected to further drop by 3% resulting in 253 million in the year 2017, but will regain a little to 254 million in 2018. The projections made by Gartner for 2017 for all devices this year have been quite gloomy. They also added that smartphones category that has seen positive growth will witness decline in some segments. The smartphones, the firm projects a 1.1% decline of premium smartphones shipment, blaming it on Apple’s inability to maintain growth after the arrival of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Source:computerworld.com The firm says it is very worried about Microsoft being that the company has always depended on shipment of personal computer that has not been seeing a growth in recent times. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 Won't Be Revealed Until April? Gartner is of the opinion that there will be a continuous contract of PC-like devices and that they will shrink at the end of the year by 8%, but that it will pick up a little in 2017 with 0.4% gain and in will in 2018 see 3% gain. Gartner has been projecting for tablets, smartphones, PCs and hybrids but has not delved into such things as smart watches, Apple TV and streaming devices.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive 'Freedom of flight' Saturday Oct 8, 2016 at 8:47 PM Oct 8, 2016 at 8:47 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_Charity APPLE VALLEY — A welcome breeze carried the scent of jet fuel through the dry October air as pilots spun million-dollar vintage aircrafts above thousands of curious spectators, many of them children. The looping smoke trails adorning Apple Valley’s blue skies Saturday were products of the 15th annual Apple Valley Airshow, held at the town’s airport. While the show draws in a large crowd each year to be entertained by aerobatic displays, the event serves also to hopefully “infect young people with an interest in aviation,” Rob “The Tumbling Bear” Harrison said. “There is no freedom that a human being can experience better than the freedom of flight,” Harrison said. “(It’s) probably the most prototypical American attitude that I’m afraid we’re losing.” Harrison, an aeronautical engineer, has been flying for more than 60 years, describing the moment that a pilot pushes the throttle forward for the first time as “the moment that defines the rest of your life.” He and Dr. Frank Donnelly — aka "Dr. D" — are devotees of “old-time aerobatics” and were pleased that despite their struggle to keep today’s young people intrigued by aviation, most of Saturday’s attendees seemed to have brought along their children. Ricardo and Maria Gonzales, Hesperia residents, brought their family, saying attending nearby airshows has become a sort of tradition for them. “This one is a little smaller,” Ricardo Gonzales said, comparing the show to those he’s been to in Chino and Murrieta. “But it doesn’t get that crowded. It’s very family oriented.” Gonzales said he likes seeing the P51s and P40s— “the World War II planes ... that’s my thing,” he said. He said without as much technology, the older planes rely on more skill from the pilots, which makes it much more entertaining to watch. Saturday’s show was the last for Dr. D, who has been flying for more than 50 years and performing in shows for 12. “For me, it’s fulfilling a childhood dream,” Donnelly said. “My father took me flying when I was 10 years old, and I said ‘I wanna do that when I grow up.” Donnelly said that even though life got in the way, he felt even more fulfilled to be able to follow his dream after his retirement from being a professor of psychology. Finishing off at the Apple Valley show felt satisfying because of its hometown-feel, he said. “What I’ll miss most is the people,” Donnelly said. Last year’s air show drew more than 10,000 attendees, and this year seemed to have similar success, Marketing Coordinator Susan Harrison said. “We’ve had really good community support,” Harrison said. Support was also shown by attendees for the family of Mike Mangold, a world-champion pilot who died in a plane crash at the Apple Valley Airport last year, when announcers asked for a moment of silence in his honor. Rob Harrison said the town’s show is probably one of the most difficult because it’s “so hot and so high,” making it one for elite pilots only. “We are truly honored to have the guys we have here,” Harrison said.

Jonathan Tressler — The News-Herald By Jonathan Tressler, The News-Herald Posted: 10/08/16, 11:13 PM EDT | Updated: on 10/08/2016 # Comments Blacksmith Gary Barnhart of Southington explains some of the finer points of working with molten metal during a demonstration at the 68th Annual Apple Butter Festival at the Geauga County Historical Society’s Century Village in Burton Village Oct. 8. The event runs through 5 p.m. Oct. 9. Jonathan Tressler — The News-Herald For more than half a century, Century Village in Burton has been welcoming fruit fans from near and far to sample the sights, sounds and smells of a good, old-fashioned apple-butter cook-off. In its 68th year, the Geauga Historical Society’s annual Apple Butter Festival draws an estimated 3,000 people per day during the two-day event, according to Century Village site manager Terri McPeek. “The weather has been perfect,” she said. “And that’s always good for attendance.” Between the 60-plus vendors, new kid-friendly attractions and the new buildings on the property, McPeek said there’s plenty for everyone to do at the long-standing event. Advertisement Among the new attractions are the Century Village Carriage House, which houses some carriages rarely seen by the public until now, and The Apothecary, which pays homage to “everything Geauga, that’s medical ,” McPeek said. For Guy Lanzone, of Middlefield, who was at the event with his step children and their mother, Melissa Myden, also of Middlefield Village, it was a good day all around. “It’s actually our first time here,” he said. “But it’s been great weather and it’s fun.” Both agreed they’d recommend the event to friends and relatives. “It’s a great event,” Lanzone said. “It’s a nice, family-friendly atmosphere.” Volunteer apple butter-churners Bill and Jody Grzywinski, of Burton Village, said they’ve been active at the event for about four years and just plain enjoy the surroundings. “We live in Burton Village, and we were actually married here at Century Village,” Jody said. “And we just really like our town and this place.” The Grzywinskis said they get to the grounds of Century Village about 6 a.m. for apple-butter duty and basically just keep it moving all day long. “The big thing is not to let it sit,” Bill said. “You’ve gotta keep it moving. Otherwise, it’ll just burn and stick to the inside of the kettle.” But the butter wasn’t the only thing burning in Burton Oct. 8. There was a blacksmith demonstration, too, among lots of other attractions. Blacksmith Gary Barnhart of Southington said he gives his demonstration in front of hundreds of visitors to the event each year. “We always seem to draw a crowd,” he said. “People don’t get to see this done in person all that often, so there’s a lot of interest.” Barnhart is a member of the Western Reserve Artist-Blacksmith Association.

This will make it possible for Android and iOS users to communicate securely as iMessage features end-to-end encryption – even Apple cannot access users’ messages. Currently, iMessage is accessible through the Messages app on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 5 or later or on a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion or later. In February, Eddie Cue announced that the number of iMessages sent surpassed 200,000 per second. Apple is increasingly focused on services which means opening up certain avenues beyond its own iOS and OS X platforms, the source says, specifically noting reports of Apple adding person-to-person Apple Pay payments via Messages. The company released Apple Music for Android last November. The source notes that plans are constantly in flux leading up to Apple keynotes and the timing of the announcement could change, but that the iMessage instant messenger service would “definitely” be coming to Android this year. As this is a single-sourced item, it’s been filed under “rumor.” MacDailyNews Take: Such a move would be welcomed by those of us who have to communicate with those who’ve settled for a lesser, derivative platform and would love to finally be able to do so via Wi-Fi and without having to be subjected to those horrid green bubbles from the Hee Haw demographic.

I’m on android, most of my family and a lot of my friends are on iPhone. Realistically there is no one I can’t contact on Facebook messenger and I don’t need to know what kind of phone they have. I can do voice & video calls. The experience is pretty much the same in both but with messenger i can reach a lot more people and never have to think about what type of device they are using. To me the ideal situation would be if they all made gateways to each others service. genericnyguy Monday, June 13, 2016 - 3:32 pm · Reply Shockingly stupid rumor. Try to act surprised today when it doesn’t happen. jdr30 Monday, June 13, 2016 - 4:13 pm · Reply Ouch candy cusio Saturday, October 8, 2016 - 11:15 pm · Reply Excellent analysis .

The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show.

October 5 AAPL: 113.05 0.05 Apple’s new ‘Orchard’ program aims to discover the next best marketing talent [U] Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Update: The Orchard page has now been removed from Apple’s site and redirects back to Apple’s homepage. Apple has quietly created a new program called Orchard with the goal of seeking out the next best marketing talent. Job listings have been appearing gradually over the past few weeks for the program, but Apple this evening has launched a new Orchard page on its website that talks about the program. Apple explains on its jobs webpage the goal of Orchard is to “bring together talented and diverse group of up-and-coming creatives to learn and grow with professionals at Apple.” The program will consist of 10 participants: 4 Art Directors, 4 Copywriters, and 2 Strategic Planners. Apple writes that, in most cases, Orchard applicants will have a degree in creative communications or have around 3 years of experience. Once accepted, members of Orchard will be put through a set curriculum, receive mentoring from Apple employees and work closely with colleagues on Apple project. On the new Orchard webpage, Apple touts the challenges of the program and the strenuous process members will go through: The moment is now. Throw everything you know out the window. All in. If you’re lucky enough to make the cut expect to surround yourself with like-minded souls who are as terrified and excited as you are. Be part of a handpicked team with a plethora of talent. Kick ass together. Panic together. Grow together. Work alongside the brains behind all the iconic work you love from Apple. Watch and learn. Trust your gut. Challenge our ways. Have an impact on everything you touch. Be prepared to stumble and fumble and embarrass yourself. It will be messy, and it won’t be pretty at times, but if you stick together as a team, you’ll build a special bond and something truly great will come out of it all. Take it from us. It’s the only way. Does this proposal sound crazy to you? Good. We like crazy. Interested parties can apply via this link. Applications will be taken until November 4th, after which a selection committee will screen applicants. In December, one-on-one interviews will be held in Cupertino. The program will last from January 16th, 2017 to August 25, 2017. This isn’t the first time Apple has launched an internal program to train potential Apple employees. For instance, Apple University was created to train in management and management techniques.

October 6 AAPL: 113.89 0.84 Hands-on with TwelveSouth’s ‘New Mac’ scented candle [Video] Jeff Benjamin - 1 month ago @JeffBenjam Reviews View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I’ve long-admired the smell of new Apple hardware. I understand that not everyone gets it, but for those who do, it’s a distinct smell that can be instantly recognized. I first encountered this smell upon purchasing my first ever Apple product – a mid-2000’s Mac mini – and I’ve been hooked ever since. It’s not that I go around smelling Apple boxes, but the scent evokes fond memories of my first Mac experience. So when the Apple accessory makers over Twelve South introduced a new Mac-inspired candle, I was intrigued, as those of you who are reading this no doubt are as well. Does Twelve South’s New Mac candle really smell like a freshly opened piece of “Designed by Apple in California?” Twelve South states on the bottom of its candle that the scent is its own interpretation of what new Apple hardware smells like. Upon unboxing the candle, this much is quite obvious; its scent, like any scented candle worth its weight, proceeds it. The New Mac candle is a 100% hand-poured soy wax candle that contains a variety of scent notes in an effort to emulate the new Mac smell. The candle is contained within an opaque, black glass jar with a simple “New Mac” Twelve South sticker on the front. Opening the candle’s lid allows olfaction to completely take over as you’re immediately doused with a bouquet of mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin and sage. Mac-scent aside, it’s quite the pleasing smell on its own. The best way I can describe it is “clean” — it puts off a very clean-smelling scent. Hands-on video Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel for more videos Twelve South calls its fragrance an interpretation, and after comparing this candle with my just-opened iPhone 7 box, I’d say that’s a fair description. The candle doesn’t smell exactly like new Apple hardware, but I find that it evokes enough redolence to live up to its namesake. Lighting the candle brought out even more of the aroma, but just keeping the lid off is enough to fill a small room or office. The New Mac candle has a burn time of 45-55 hours, although I’m guessing that many of the people interested in this product will be in it more so for the novelty. But even if you do plan on burning it, you can always buy another when it runs out of wax. Twelve South is selling these candles for a reasonable $24, which includes free shipping in the US. Within a day of the initial post all of the initial batch of candles sold out, but stock will be available again soon. What are your thoughts on the New Mac candle? Do you plan on picking one up?

Anirban Ghoshal, Hindustan Times, New Delhi |  Updated: Oct 08, 2016 22:46 IST People wait outside an Apple store during the launch of iPhone 7 at Ambience Mall, in Gurgaon. (Parveen Kumar/HT Photo) Don’t be too disappointed if you couldn’t get your hands on the latest iPhone 7 after standing hours in queue outside a local Apple outlet on Friday evening. For one, thousands of fellow-Indians are in the same boat. The smartphone’s long-awaited countrywide launch was marred by complaints that Apple failed to provide enough units to Indian consumers, resulting in its black-coloured variants being sold for a premium of up to Rs 40,000 in the grey market. “There was a dire shortage of the product this time, and I had to cancel several pre-orders for customers who only wanted its black variants,” a retailer told HT on the condition of anonymity. “The demand for jet black editions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is really high. However, Apple has been able to provide very few units of that kind – the ratio of orders and units received in that regard is 100:1.” Grey market operators had been holding on to their stock in anticipation of Saturday’s sale, he said. “From early that morning, they began selling the products at a premium of anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 40,000.” This is not the first instance of Apple failing to meet the customers’ demand for its hottest product. Initial stocks of the iPhone 7 Plus were sold out globally just days after its launch. While every colour variant of the iPhone 7 Plus disappeared in a blink, it was the jet black version of its smaller cousin that was the first to be swiped off the shelves. Though all Apple stores have run out of stock, customers continue to place online orders for the models they desire. “We sincerely appreciate our customers’ patience as we work hard to get the new iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in a statement. But India seems to be a different ball game, with retailers alleging corruption in the allocation process. “Many units were deliberately moved to the grey market, so more profits could be reaped through the creation of a false demand. Meanwhile, customers had to return home empty-handed,” another retailer told HT. While police were reportedly summoned to a GK-1 store to control the mob of customers, large crowds were also witnessed at Apple outlets in Cyber Hub, DLF Promenade and Connaught Place. Another retailer said an Apple outlet was supposed to open at Nehru Place in tandem with the launch, but was forced to keep its shutters down owing to unavailability of units. “A second shop was forced open by the company, but it sold just a couple of handsets as a formality,” he added. Experts, however, discounted the conspiracy theory. “It may be part of a strategy shift. Apple is probably trying to sell more of its products in tier-2 and tier-3 cities through online partner Flipkart,” an analyst said. Retailers did not agree. “As far as we know, Apple had allocated 1.25 lakh units for India – out of which 70,000 made it here. However, only 10,000 units were shared with big Apple partners. So what happened to the rest of the stock? Did all of these go to the online partner?” one of the retailers asked. The Cupertino-headquartered giant plans to sell five lakh units in the first 15 days after the launch, he added. While Redington, Ingram and Beetel are the key iPhone distributors in India, Futureworld and iZenica are its top resellers. Apple refused to comment on the matter.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Big-Little Apple Festival helps rejuvenate Killingly Grange Saturday Oct 8, 2016 at 5:32 PM Oct 8, 2016 at 5:32 PM Francesca Kefalas For The Bulletin DAYVILLE — Aaron Brouillard had his own ideas of how to play the bean bag toss at Killingly Grange’s third annual Big-Little Apple Festival. Anyone else interested in playing Saturday was willing to let the 2-year-old use the toss as everything from a slide to a jump ramp and a secret hiding place for the bean bags. “He’s having a great time here,” said Aaron’s mom, April Phillips, of Canterbury. “I like to come and support the grange when I can.” Organizer John Bennett said the event was conceived as a way to highlight the grange during The Last Green Valley’s Walktober. The event featured live music from The Frost Brothers, accompanied by some friends and family, an apple pancake breakfast, cider donuts, apple sauerkraut hot dogs and vendors featuring canned and pickled foods and crafts. “This really is a way to help rejuvenate the grange,” Bennett said. “We may have recruited a few new members today.” Granges support the small, local family farm, Bennett said — “And the traditions those farms are carrying on,” he added. In addition to trying to revive interest in the grange, Bennett said the Apple Festival has also given the grange a platform to promote its other events, such as its Bluegrass Concert Series. The next concert is at 7 p.m. Oct. 22, he said. Doors open at 5 p.m. and dinner is served all night long. Stanley Zadora, of Rogers, said he enjoys coming to the festival as a vendor to sell his pickled items. “I like to support the grange,” Zadora said. “And I like to support my hobby.” Ilma Tikkanen comes from Rhode Island to sell her jams, jellies and canned items. “You start to see some familiar faces and you get to know people,” Tikkanen said. James Easton, of North Windham, not only comes to sell his carved wooden crafts, but to demonstrate how he makes them. “I like the people,” Easton said. “I love meeting the people who stop to talk.” Grant Bombia, of Norwich, was attending his first Apple Festival at the grange as a vendor. Bombia makes brooms the old-fashioned way, from sticks. “It’s been a very good day,” he said.

Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Monday 14th November 2016 | Cambridge, UK Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Jack-offs: the problem with the new iPhone earphones Apple veers off into the wrong direction by Christian Harvey Saturday October 8 2016, 10:00pm Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp The aux cord. The jack. The plug. Since 1878, there has been a universal standard for audio, shared by your headphones, your car stereo, your dad’s absurdly expensive liquid-cooled speakers – and you’re probably using it right now. The noble 3.5mm headphone jack has served generations of listeners, and it should continue to serve generations to come. But Apple, facing declining phone sales and increased competition, has decided to destroy literally centuries of tradition. They call it “innovative”, they call it “magical”, they call it anything other than what it is – a cash grab. Indeed, the decision to remove the headphone jack from their latest flagship phone, the iPhone 7, has caused some controversy among those with two brain cells. Not many companies could release a phone with the same thickness, and fewer features, and then call it an upgrade – but Apple is willing to wager that it can. They could be right. This is not Apple’s first controversial removal. When they removed the Ethernet port from the Powerbooks, users complained – similarly with disk drives from the MacBook. They have constantly pushed against the boundaries of existing technologies to create a sleeker future. Can they do it again? In short – no. Ethernet had been superseded by Wi-Fi. DVDs were making way for the now ubiquitous USB flash drive. What, then, can replace a connector that everyone already has? One of two choices that would make Pyrrhus flinch: either use the iPhone’s single lightning connector, or stick a toothbrush in your ear. Yes, the AirPods – yours for the low, low price of £159 – offer the exact same dreadful quality and terrible in-ear feel of the out-of-the-box EarPods, with the revolutionary feature of getting lost if you turn your head too quickly. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wImaGRkNY). And best of all, they have a battery life of five hours! No more long study sessions, movie marathons or, heck, picking up your headphones in the morning and assuming they’ll work – with this revolutionary new feature, you’ll never finish a Wagner symphony again. Apple's headphones are uncomfortable, overpriced and just sound badChristian Harvey Fine, but those are optional (very optional when you’re a broke student). Just use the included headphones and don’t complain, right? This option assumes that you will never need to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. That means no long road trips, blasting your summer playlist, no more falling asleep with your favourite ASMR channel, no more powerbanks. And it means that you have to buy Lightning headphones – and this is where the whole idea becomes a farce. Remember the last time you pulled your headphones out of your phone and plugged them into your laptop? Apple doesn’t make a single laptop with a Lightning jack. So even if you were fine with being locked into using Apple products forever, you couldn’t bend over if you wanted to. You may say that they will add Lightning jacks in a future refresh: but the new Macbook (yes, the one with only one port to do everything including charging) uses USB-C, which is basically Lightning without Apple getting licensing fees every time someone builds a device with that in it. Their lineup is fractured by design. This is perhaps Cook’s Machiavellian intention. By demanding its users buy Lightning headphones, Apple creates its own market. A market where they get a cut of every single pair of headphones sold. It is important to note at this point that Beats (which Apple owns) are the only third party that currently makes wireless headphones – and they are also suitably overpriced. Apple wants to control every single facet of the user experience – especially the wallet-opening procedure. It is this that is the only convincing reason to buy into this line of accessories – the somewhat utopian idea that Apple will create a world without headphone wires, with seamless pairing, and with an actual replacement. But that world is not the iPhone 7. Vote with your wallet.

In an 8-3 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone. Together, the two cases are the remnants of a global legal battle between the world's biggest makers of smartphones that began in April 2011 and at one point spanned four continents. In this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to make phone calls. The bulk of the award, $98.7 million, was for the detection patent that the earlier panel said wasn't infringed. The February decision also said the other two patents were invalid. That was a wrong decision, the court ruled Friday, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. The opinion was a surprise -- the court never announced that it would consider the case before all active judges prior to issuing the opinion. In a dissent, Circuit Judge Timothy Dyk objected to the full court opting to take on the case without allowing additional legal arguments, saying the majority opinion results in "profound changes" in the analysis of whether patents cover obvious variations of earlier ideas. The three judges who objected to the majority opinion were the same ones who had thrown out the verdict in February. Dyk said the panel "has continuingly expressed willingness, and indeed desire" to remove the information that the majority objected to, saying it wasn't necessary to the original decision. The Federal Circuit handles all patent appeals in the U.S., so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

October 8 AAPL: 114.06 0.17 Class action lawsuit against Apple over iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’ hardware flaw gains momentum Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller iPhone 6 AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit A few months back, we reported on a hardware flaw plaguing a growing number of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users, which garnered the name of “Touch Disease.” Shortly after the flaw was initially reported on, a trio of iPhone users filed a class action lawsuit against Apple, claiming that Apple refuses to repair devices affected by Touch Disease for free. Over a month later, Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge the issue. Now, Motherboard reports that the push to get Apple to respond to the issue is growing thanks to more backing behind the original class action lawsuit in California and a separate, new lawsuit in Utah… Touch Disease is a hardware flaw that causes the displays on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus units to become unresponsive and show a thin gray, flickering line along the top. Though the iPhone 6 is not immune, the issue seems to primary plague the larger-screened Plus model. The flaw affects the logic board’s “touch IC” controller chips, thus meaning that replacing the iPhone’s display is not an adequate fix. Because Apple will not perform logic board repairs on iPhones, the company’s solution to the problem thus far has been to purchase a new phone. Apple pushes users to pay $329 to replace their Touch Disease-ridden iPhone 6 Plus with a refurbished model, which according to today’s Motherboard report, is often hit with the same bug “within days or weeks of being replaced.” While Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge Touch Disease, today’s report claims that “five separate current and former Apple Geniuses have confirmed” that Apple is aware of the problem, but won’t tell customers about it. Apple has, however, at least acknowledged the issue in federal court. The company has requested an “extension of time to respond to the Complaint” in the more recent Utah class action, while in California Apple requested that the Utah and California cases be combined into one: “Given the similarity between the [Utah] and [California] actions, it would unnecessarily tax judicial resources if these actions were to proceed in separate class action lawsuits—especially where the [Utah] and [California] Plaintiffs purport to represent the same putative class of all consumers who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the filing. The California case is much larger than the Utah one, as well. One attorney in the case has been contacted by 10,000 people asking to join the suit. That same attorney, Richard McCune, filed an updated lawsuit against Apple last night, adding several plaintiffs and three separate law firms to the battle. In an email to Motherboard, McCune wrote: “Each of the firms (who had their own clients) brings strength to the case, including Stephen Larson of Larson O’Brien, who is a former Federal Judge. With these firms working with us, we believe it gives us the best chance of obtaining a positive result in the case for the owners of the phones.” With the growing push behind these cases, it’s unlikely that Apple will continue to ignore the problem, so it shouldn’t be long until the company issues some sort of response… Guides iPhone 6 View THe Guide AAPL Get the latest AAPL stock and company news View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft's Everyday Graphics 'Paint' App to Gain Enviable new 3D tools with Windows 10 Update | Main | Samsung Spits in the Face of Evidence that the Note7 Replacement is a Danger » October 08, 2016 Apple Files Patent in Australia Revealing Possible Future Apple TV Features   This week the European Patent Office revealed an Apple patent application filed in Australia that painstakingly walks through Apple TV with the new remote with Siri. More importantly, a few patent figures discovered in the patent filing present new Apple TV scenarios or options that may be realized sometime in the future.   Some of the new things the engineers discuss and describe in this Australian patent filing are obscure, such as how users will be able to get more information from an icon on the Apple TV interface. In one description it sounds as if they're describing the use of 3D Touch to peek at content or drill down further so that you could view a trailer or order content.   The second method therein describes how the Apple TV remote's touch area will be able to tilt an icon on your TV to reveal information about the content on the reverse side or to indicate the category of content being displayed in the "Watchlist" area that sits directly above the icons area as noted below.   The new Watchlist icon on the Apple TV Remote noted in the example above is currently occupied by the Home Button as noted below. Content Choice on One User Interface   Today, you can find content within individual content channels or apps such as iTunes, Netflix, Crave, CBS, ABC and so forth. In the patent figures illustrated below the user is working within a redesigned unified user interface where a user will be able to find content first and then click on the channel that they wish to watch it on be it Hulu ( shown as 'Oolu Plus') AMC, Netflix (shown as Movieflix), iTunes and so forth.   Possible 3D Apple TV Icons   In Apple's patent Figure 5NN illustrated below we're able to see that an icon is displayed using multiple layers (e.g., layer 5028 showing the text "Ping Pong Mania!!," layer 5030 showing a ping pong ball and 51 its trajectory, layer 5032 showing a racquet, and layer 5034 showing a net).   The sizes and relative positions of these layers are adjusted in accordance with a user input to provide an improved visual perception of the icon (e.g., providing a three-dimensional perception of objects shown in the icon).   Apple's patent filing was published this week in Europe and originally filed in Australia under application number 2016100650 on May 19, 2016.     Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleve, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Tesla is opening a 65,000 square foot store, its largest retail center to date. The facility will offer sales and service of Tesla's electric car line. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Interbrand just released this year's Top 100 global brands, and Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola take this year's Top 3 spots again.  Newbies who entered the Top 100 are Tesla and fashion empire Dior. This list is based on consumer influence and brand presence. Advertisement Apple and Google have consistently been the top two global brands for the past four years, and they are still growing. Both companies respectively have seen a 5% and 11% percent growth respectively in the past year. The brand consultancy agency has been curating this list for the past 17 years, and CEO Jez Frampton says that based on the topnotchers on the list, it can be told that "the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it, They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." Tesla is a welcome addition in the respected list of the Top 100 global brands. They have proven that it's possible to grow into a super company from scratch. Especially in the auto industry, that's pretty much an impossible feat. With Elon Musk's lead, Tesla is now one of the leading brands in its sector. There are qualifications for companies to take a coveted spot on the list. According to their official website, a company must be operating in three major continents and they must have a roadmap in emerging markets. Thirty percent of the revenue must come from other countries, and fifty percent of it shouldn't come from just one continent. The Interbrand way of determining who makes the list is ISO certified as well. The qualifications are pretty strict, which makes being part of the list an even bigger privilege. Will Apple and Google still reign supreme on next year's list? With many industries going up and down, it's anybody's guess who'll be the next game changers.

Then something extraordinary happened and I couldn't ignore it. Austin Yake shot a 14 on a par-3, effectively taking himself out of the running for a Division III boys golf district tournament and the lone advancing spot for next week's state tourney. I got to the tourney about halfway through it. I watched the Cardington senior play up No. 18 at Apple Valley then make the turn at No. 1, carding a 1-over-par 37 on the backside. After getting some shots on video, I went off to find the Ridgedale boys and Pleasant's Jason Joehlin. Later in the day, I stood at the eighth green waiting for him to play the last two holes. While standing there, I overheard a mother of another player say she "just wanted to give the Cardington kid a hug." What? And then she told me what happened. He hit into an unplayable area on the short par-3 fifth hole. He elected to take a penalty stroke and go to the drop zone. What followed was shot after shot after shot after shot into the water guarding the green. A kid who was within a shot of the lead suddenly was no longer. But as Yake came up No. 8, he looked no different than he did on Nos. 18 and 1 when he was very much in the mix for a championship. Incredibly, he showed no emotion in either circumstance, respectably playing out the round with a pair of pars and bogies. Afterward, I wondered how he and his coach would react. After 26 years of earning a paycheck covering high school sports, I know delicate situations. The last thing anyone wants moments after screwing up is a recorder in his or her face with questions about how it came to be. Cardington coach Troy King was candid and honest, but also heartbroken for his guy. As for Yake, I was stunned. He explained his plight and answered my questions. He was obviously hurting, but he offered no excuses and shed no tears. He handled his situation with a grace that belied his years. In my time on the preps beat, I've seen my share of poor sports. Usually, it's the coaches howling about how they were wronged, but I've seen kids melt down sobbing over less than what Yake experienced. I've had coaches pull the gutless I'm-not-talking-to-the-media after tough losses. I've watched kids kick benches, throw towels, strip off jerseys and refuse to wear runner-up medals. Yake and King could have done any of the above and I wouldn't have been surprised. Sadly, I was surprised by their good sportsmanship, which says a lot I think. Yake suffered through a 15-minute stretch where he lived his golfing nightmare and experienced something he never did before — a 14 on his scorecard after four ker-plunks. It would shake a pro, let alone a teen, but he never let on in the moments afterward. My final question to Yake was about what he learned of himself Wednesday afternoon, and he offered this bit of wisdom: "If I didn't lose it mentally here, I don't think I'll lose it later on." If you need someone who is unflinching in the midst of adversity, if you need someone who can keep it together in crisis and move on, if you need someone who can persevere after enduring a dark moment, if you need someone to show character and not become one, Yake is your guy. He may not have been crowned a champion Wednesday, but he certainly showed championship qualities. Yake didn't win a medal at the district golf meet, but he won a sports writer's respect. He may have seen his high school golf career come to an end, but with his class, dignity and demeanor, he'll do far greater things I'm sure. Austin Yake is just that extraordinary.

Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming introduction and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Direct competition Google’s introduction of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who spoke on anonymity. Verizon investment Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 introduction through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.Creative ads But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said noting the white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Unofficial Remixes and DJ Sets Are Coming to Spotify and Apple Music Anna Gaca // October 8, 2016 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Getty Images Spotify and Apple Music users can now use the services to stream unofficial remixes of some songs, and more remixed content, like hour-long DJ mixes, is soon to follow, TechCrunch reports. Until now, remixes not released under the auspices of the original artist were absent from both services. The library expansion comes via an agreement with Dubset, a distribution service focused on DJ releases. Dubset operates like a rights clearinghouse for remixed material, using file-scanning software to determine which songs were incorporated and thus who deserves a slice of revenue from a given track. Partnering with Spotify and Apple Music “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid,” Dubset CEO Stephen White told TechCrunch. As White notes, adding DJ content gives Spotify and Apple entrée to musical territory primarily occupied by SoundCloud. While some tracks on SoundCloud are covered by licensing agreements, other remixes, bootlegs, and DJ sets available on its platform are unlicensed, user-submitted uploads that record labels regard as a form of piracy. SoundCloud launched its own paid streaming service, SoundCloud Go, in March, but it hasn’t matched the success of its more established peers. A recent Financial Times report suggested that Spotify was looking to acquire SoundCloud, but that may be a less attractive proposition if Spotify finds it can secure its own access to music that distinguished SoundCloud’s catalogue with fewer legal headaches. As Variety notes, however, Dubset currently has a big limitation: It’s made deals with music publishers, but it hasn’t signed on any major labels. Unless Dubset can secure their cooperation, many of the most popular remixes won’t appear on paid services. Dubset’s Stephen White identified a DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of “Room in Here” by Anderson .Paak—who’s an independent artist—as being among the first unofficial remixes available on Spotify and Apple Music.

Today, the US Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's original 2014 verdict, awarding Apple $120 million (about £96.5 million, AU$158 million) in damages. The dispute all started over Apple's patents for swipe to unlock, autocorrect and quick links feature. Quick links allowed phone numbers and addresses to automatically be turned into links. Ironically, Apple's latest iOS 10 update got rid of slide to unlock. Victory... Today's decision reinstates a victory that was overturned earlier this year by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In an 8-3 verdict, the court said that the three-judge panel, the same panel that opposed today's verdict, was wrong to throw out the case in February of this year. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," said Judge Kimberly Moore in the court document. This decision is an important one, as it sets a precedent for Apple's smartphone patents. Some competitors might have to re-engineer their unlock methods, autocorrect systems and quick links, or risk a costly lawsuit with Apple. ...for now As we've come to expect with these two, the Apple vs Samsung battle isn't over yet. This latest court decision comes less than a week before the US Supreme Court considers Apple's case against Samsung for copying the design of its iPhone. In August, over 100 renowned designers from around the world, including Calvin Klein, Dieter Rams and Alexander Wang, filed an amicus brief in support of Apple. The designers claimed that a product's visual design has "powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes." The brief cites a 1949 study that showed 99% of Americans could identify a Coca-Cola bottle by its shape alone. Samsung argues that Apple's generic smartphone design shouldn't have been allowed to be patented in the first place. Tech giants including Dell, Facebook, Google and HP argued in favor of Samsung in their own amicus brief. This will be a seminal case, according to The New York Times, as the US Supreme Court hasn't heard a design patent case in over a century. Stay tuned for more on that verdict. iOS 10 tips and tricks Via Bloomberg Tags: world of tech Samsung Phones patent newstrack lawsuit Apple vs Samsung Apple Follow Techradar onfacebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to TechradarWrite for Us More from this author Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro V-Moda Forza Project Scorpio: everything we know about Microsoft's 4K-ready Xbox How to watch the 2016 US presidential debates Noontec Zoro II Wireless Related Stories Apple requests Samsung patent retrial over claim for billions, not millions Samsung will make more slim, metal phones to fight back against Apple Apple iPhone VR headset discovered in recent patent This new Apple Watch patent could upgrade your handshake Nvidia picks up patent infringement club, beats Samsung with it Apple files patent for a new ‘paper bag’ Patent row blocking Apple Watch sales in Switzerland Join the discussion with Techradar India Characters Remaining: 3000 Share on Twitter X Sort By:NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown Voted Be the first one to review.

When iQunix offered for me to try their Edin stand for MacBooks, I was eager to find out if I could welcome it into my life. Packaging Since iQuinix’s packaging resembles Apple’s packaging at a glance, expectations are set high from the beginning. After sliding off the tight white outer sleeve, a more unique black box is found with iridescent branding on every side but the bottom. This box opens to reveal the Edin stand, with a sleek presentation aided by the box’s platform-esque bottom piece. Materials & Construction If the packaging wasn’t enough, iQunix uses bead blasted aluminum with light gray silicone padding to match Apple’s iMac aesthetic. If you’re looking to buy a matching stand for your Space Gray MacBook, you’ll have to look elsewhere. However, it blends right in with a MacBook Pro connected to a Thunderbolt Display. A knurled thumbscrew tightens on what is essentially one half of a clamp, which can be adjusted to fit all of Apple’s MacBook offerings. In Use Setup is no problem: loosen the thumbscrew, lay your MacBook on its edge, adjust the Edin to the proper width, and tighten the thumbscrew. I found it easy to set the Edin to a width that securely holds my MacBook Pro, while it’s still a soft enough grip to pull the MacBook Pro out of the grip of the Edin’s silicone padding, which protects from aluminum on aluminum scratches. A generous amount of silicone padding on the bottom also keeps the stand stable, and keeps a nice buffer between the desk and the aluminum base. For a MacBook Pro with fan ventilation, I prefer to lay the MacBook hinge up, which gives access to all ports while giving a clear pathway for air to travel through the hinge vents. I would lay a standard MacBook hinge down to give the stand a thicker point to grip, and to orient the Apple logo properly. Conclusion If you’re on the hunt for a MacBook stand, you know what you’re getting from the iQunix Edin: a reliable, well made, adjustable stand that matches Apple’s iMac aesthetic. You’ll still have to manually manage your cables, and you’ll have to lay your MacBook the long way to keep access to all of your ports (and possibly keep your MacBook safe from breaking), but it’s hard to beat the price and quality of the Edin if you’re okay with those minor compromises. The iQunix Edin is currently available on Amazon for $39.99. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to send me a tweet @eriknordlund!

The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung's infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Friday's decision was made by the full slate of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow US Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California, which ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday's decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday's ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. "But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward - and it's a big win for Apple."   Andrew Chung Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 China moots midnight bans to combat internet addiction Business Standard Apple wins in appeals court against Samsung A federal court has reinstated the $120-million jury award to Apple Andrew Chung  |  New York  October 8, 2016 Last Updated at 21:29 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Polar M600 review: Top-notch smartwatch and fitness tracker fusion Chris Hall8 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended £269 For Solid design, sports takes priority over smartwatch, all of Android Wear's functions, Polar Flow does so much, respectable battery performance for a smartwatch, IPX8 waterproofing Against Design could be more exciting, swimming could be better served, heart rate can be a little erratic, price Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The explosion of smartwatches and fitness trackers has thrown up some real gems and thrown down some real turds, leaving us all to step carefully when choosing a new device. Polar is an established name in fitness devices, one of the oldest, perhaps, when dealing with heart rate monitoring. A widening portfolio from Polar has seen the birth of more lifestyle devices in the A family and stepping up in functions across the M (sport) and V (pro) devices, with a gradual increase in wider connectivity across the brand's offerings. The M600 is a rethinking, adopting a proper smartwatch platform and offering those fitness tracker functions the company is known for combined with a lot more on the watch side than you'd normally get. The result is one of the most considered sports devices we've seen and certainly one of the best Android Wear devices to date. Pocket-lint Polar M600 review: Design and build The Polar M600 mates the body module with a rubber strap and, like the TomTom Spark, the body slots into the strap meaning the two sections can be easily separated when you want to clean them. The design looks a lot like previous Polar watches, although it's pretty thick, meaning you need enough wrist for it to sit on. If you're of the thin forearm variety you might think it's too big, but we found it sat well on an average male arm. The chunkiness gives it some substance and it looks good, both from a sports point of view and as a smartwatch. Compared to other Android Wear devices, Polar's watch-making experience is apparent, as this is much nicer than something like the Moto 360 Sport and looks better and wears better than that previous attempt. As with other Polar devices the screen is square fitting Polar's family design. Pocket-lint On to the more serious stuff. There's proper waterproofing with an IPX8 rating so it supports swimming, the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass to avoid scratches and the metal detailing that frames the display left and right gives a premium look. There's the choice of black or white, although we'd like to see a choice of strap colours to give the design wider appeal. The rubber strap is easy to adjust and uses a conventional two pronged buckle, with two bands to stop the spare strap catching on things. Most importantly, the M600 is comfortable to wear and sweat through, and weighing 65g, it's not too heavy either. Polar M600 review: Sports features first Designed as a sports watch first, there are two buttons. The first button to the left side is the standard Android Wear button, letting you go home, wake the display or long press to access the menu. The second button on the front takes you straight to the sports side, opening the Polar app. This is very much sports territory and we really like that Polar hasn't been distracted by Android Wear: it's taken the platform and owned it, rather than skipping around Google's fancy smartwatch features. Pocket-lint The hardware tells a similar story. With an optical heart rate sensor onboard and its own GPS you're ready to run out the door and leave your smartphone at home. There is no compass or barometer, however, so direction and elevation is based on GPS. There's also support for accessories, so if you have an H7 Polar chest strap, you'll get the option of using that, which might be the preferred option for cyclists. One of the skills that Polar does adopt from Android Wear is the support for Bluetooth headphones and local storage for your music, meaning you can take your music with you on the run, again without your phone. TomTom Spark 3 offers this, as does Apple Watch 2, and it's a feature that is sure to be popular. The great thing is that this full feature set, supported by this hardware, makes for a great fitness device, before you even touch the smartwatch side of things.  Polar M600 review: Hardware specs and display The Polar M600 is powered by a MediaTek chipset with 512MB RAM and a standard 4GB of storage. The battery is 500mAh which is pretty good for this type of device and explains the thickness. Pocket-lint There's a 1.3-inch display on the front with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. This isn't the largest or sharpest Android Wear watch display, but as we said, the screen fits and we found it a good size for reading on the move. It supports always on functions, dimming in normal wear and brightening up when you move the watch to look at. As an LCD this is a backlit full colour display so it's illuminated, rather than using the lower power displays that some other sports watches offer. It looks great, which adds to the appeal, but does draw more heavily on the battery than the mono TomTom or Garmin displays, for example. It does have an ambient light sensor, however, so adjusts to the lighting conditions around you. Polar M600 review: Battery life and charging The 500mAh battery will give you about 2 days of use when connected to an Android device, including exercise time. You might be able to push it to a little more in casual wear. We've not tested the Polar M600 with an iPhone, but reports suggest this drops to about a day with Apple's phone. In reality, the Android Wear experience is much enhanced when paired with an Android phone and at least you have the option, unlike the Apple Watch. Pocket-lint Two days is good for Android Wear devices, but it does mean regular charging compared to many other sports watches which will often give you perhaps 5 active days or more - but without really offering any smart functions. That's the trade-off here: the Polar M600 doesn't have great endurance in sporting terms, but it offers a whole lot more in terms of functionality, meaning it does a lot more than just tell you the time when you're walking around.  Charging is via the magnetic connection point on the rear and over the past weeks that we've been using the M600, we've typically opted to charge every other day without it running flat. The charger neatly attaches to the rear of the watch without needing to clip anything on or fiddle around. Polar M600 review: Setup and connections To get the M600 up and running you need two things: the Android Wear app and the Polar Flow app on your phone. The first handles the connection to your phone, the second syncs with your Polar account and syncs the data from your watch. Using Android Wear on an Android smartphone makes for a fast and easy connection as the devices are designed for seamless cooperation. Once you're connected, you can use the Android Wear app to control many of the smartwatch functions, like deciding what notifications you want from your M600 and so on. Pocket-lint The Android Wear app will also then sync your apps, so anything you have on your device that's compatible with Wear will then move over - like Spotify, Play Music, Citymapper and even other fitness apps if you want to use them.  The Polar Flow app then handles everything else. This is where you'll view your stats and be able to get a good look at your activities you record using the M600. We like the Polar Flow app. It's very much a lifestyle app on your phone, firstly delivering a report on your daily activities, but it lets you dive into your runs, check out your heart rate and pace from an activity as well as your route and other essential details.  Taking things further, the Polar Flow app has a calendar in it too where you can schedule workouts, meaning you can tap the watch and dive into the workout that you've planned. If you're training against a plan, it means you've got the information on your wrist, ready to get going. You can setup intervals, distance or time targets. You can also sync Polar training results and targets into your Google Calendar if you want and share the data with a couple of other services - Strava and Training Peaks. Pocket-lint Information is synced from the app to the web version of Polar Flow which includes a few more options and has more in-depth information. However, you don't have to use the browser at all during setup: you can connect the Polar M600 to your phone and do everything there, without having to use a PC. There are a couple of bespoke Polar watch faces that will show you daily activity, so you can see where you are with your target at a glance, which help boost the fitness tracker side of the M600. Polar M600 review: 24/7 activity monitoring Before we get to actual sports tracking, the M600 wants to monitor what you're doing all the time. We mentioned that the Polar Flow has a lifestyle approach and this is has, breaking down your day into sleep, resting, sitting, low, medium or high activity. With this in mind, you're presented with your progress through your day on the watch face. One of the elements of this is steps, which we feel is a little too enthusiastic about awarding you a "step". It's a hard thing to measure, as when we measured physical steps, the results seemed accurate enough, but in an average day in the office, we seemed to accrue many more steps through other movements. Compared to Fitbit tracking, for example, it's a lot easier to hit your step target with the M600, suggesting that it's a lot more sensitive to movement than it perhaps should be. Steps isn't really an absolute measure, however, so if it's steps you're interested in, this probably isn't the device for you. If you're inactive for too long you'll get inactivity alerts and these aren't just reminders to move, they get logged in Polar Flow, so you'll feel the enduring shame. If that's not a motivator, we don't know what is. One of the nice aspects of Polar Flow is that it reports on your day, week and month assessing your activity and telling you what difference that has made to your life. Polar M600 review: Running and sports functions Press that button on the front and the Polar app opens on the M600. There are two sections, one to check your daily activity in more detail and the second to start recording a sport. Polar gives you freedom to choose your sport profiles to suit the activities. For many this will be running, cycling or swimming, but there's a full range of sports to choose from, like badminton, dance, football or plain old walking, for example. That's great, because you don't have to compromise on categorising your activity. Want to record your dog walking? No problem. Want to record your Friday rowing session? No problem. Pocket-lint For outdoor sports you have GPS tracking, so there are different profiles for pool and open water swimming for example, which we really like and you only have to have the sports on your watch that you actually need. Don't want "other outdoor"? You can remove it. Head into the Polar Flow website and you get to customise your sports profiles further, changing the information you see on your watch, which it really clever. Once you've selected your activity, the watch sensors fire up, looking for GPS and turning on the optical heart rate sensor on the rear. You can start the activity immediately, or wait for those things sensors to lock on, but again, with time being precious, it's sometimes good to get going without having to wait. We've found the GPS to lock on quickly, however, so there's never really been too much of a delay in getting started.  During your sport, you're presented with a number of screens with relevant information, based on the activity you're doing. For running you get a main screen that's similar to Polar's other devices, like the V800. The M600 has the advantage of colour, so as you move through different heart rate zones, the colour of the HR readout will change too, for at-a-glance information. There's also clear indiction of pace and distance when running. Swimming isn't as well served as it could be, with pool swimming lacking the option to detect lengths automatically like the Apple Watch 2 does. That leaves you with heart rate tracking and time, which is good enough. We also found that the flow of the water was able to swipe through screens, so we'd often stop a set in the pool with something different on the display. Pocket-lint With Android Wear automatically dimming the display, Polar has added the option to have the display always on. This means you can glance and see the stats without having to touch and avoids the problem of not being able to view the screen without an over exaggerated gesture. That will eat more battery, but if you're busting a gut trying to beat your 10k PB run, you won't care, you'll just need to keep an easy eye on your pace. If there was one thing we'd want to boost the watch's sporting credentials, it's another button. We'd love a start/stop button, rather than having to use the display, but that's a minor thing. There's also no automatic detection for your activities, but sitting closer to a serious running watch we think that's fine: it will differentiate between activity levels in the daily tracking anyway, so there's no harm in selecting the sport you're doing for detailed tracking. One of the great things is that the Polar Flow website provides a lot more information than you'll find on other platforms. It will give you an overview of your running progress, it will estimate how much fatigue you might be carrying over from earlier workouts as a guide to whether you're over or under training. You can also sign-up to training programmes, meaning there's a lot on offer, beyond your actual running stats. Polar M600 review: GPS and heart rate performance There's a wide degree of variation in performance with the latest crop of sports gadgets, something that's seen widespread reporting about accuracy. The Polar M600 performs well in tracking via GPS, with some really accurate route tracking and good distance recording. Polar has put six LEDs in the optical heart rate sensor on the back of the M600, aiming to ensure it's as accurate as it can be. Naturally, using the optional chest strap will give better results, but wrist measurement is all about convenience. The M600 performs fairly well, but we have seen some inconsistent HR results at times. Pocket-lint We've seen a fairly slow start at times, with the first 10 minutes or so seeing a slow build-up of heart rate, not quite reflecting the real rate increase. We've also had some runs where the watch would occasionally show a blank result, as though it wasn't recording, but it was. On checking the results afterwards, there's no sign of drop-out.  To verify what was happening, we tested it against a Garmin Forerunner 610 with chest strap. The Garmin was faster to respond to rate changes, more accurately reflecting the build-up of heart rate at the start of the run, as well as responding faster to some sprint sections we threw in. However, at the end of the run, both showed an average of 152bpm and both showed the same distance covered and same average pace. So, although there are some anomalies with the results, that overall doesn't have a huge impact on the bigger picture of runs when using the Polar M600. Outside of running we've found it to deliver some good results and we're impressed it manages to offer a consistent result when swimming, for example.  Polar M600 review: A full Android Wear experience That's where most sports devices would reach the limit of their functionality, but sitting on the Android Wear platform, the Polar M600 offers a whole lot more. You get a full range of alerts and notifications and if you have an Android smartphone, this really is a first class offering, especially compared to the arrangement on some other sports devices. It's something that's offered by other Polar watches and some Garmin devices, but here you're supported by the Android community for your functionality, not just Polar. Pocket-lint We've mentioned apps and one of the aspects that the M600 gets from Android Wear is Bluetooth headphone and music support. You can connect any Bluetooth headphones you like, but music support is limited to Google's Play Music service and you have to download and sync that from your phone, which is a bit of a faff so it's worth only syncing music for running, but we love not having to carry that vintage iPod on the run.  Expanding out into other Android Wear highlights, you have Google Maps for navigation while you're connected to your phone, support for Ok Google voice controls, so you can speak replies to messages and so on. Then you have all the fun stuff, like being able to pause your Spotify music from your watch, controlling Netflix over your Chromecast, or getting Citymapper directions right on your wrist.  Although Android Wear has a bad rep from lacklustre early devices, the Polar M600 isn't one of them. This is a sports watch that benefits from a huge range of extra functions enabled by Android Wear, resulting in something fun and functional. In many ways, the Polar M600 is currently without compare. Verdict The Polar M600 is a fusion of smartwatch and sports device. It takes Android's platform and laces in sports and fitness tracking functions, but maintains a balance that some devices don't manage. It succeeds in being both where others have failed. It feels like a proper Polar sports watch, boosted by the best of Android Wear. For an Android smartphone user, this is a device that's worth serious consideration. If you've been put off by Android Wear so far, this is how to do Android Wear right. It's not about bland presentation, it's about underpinning something more exciting. In this case, it's a fully-featured activity watch, especially good for running, that barely feels like Android Wear at all. The Polar M600 is currently rather unique. It's not only an effective sports partner, it's a great smartwatch too.

October 8 AAPL: 114.06 0.17 Review: Amber Watchcase Power Bank is hands down one of the best Apple Watch accessories [Video] Jeff Benjamin - 1 month ago @JeffBenjam Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With the recent release of new hardware, I’ve been in search of a better Apple Watch charging and storage solution. There’s no shortage of watch-compatible docks, but the Amber Watchcase Power Bank by ClearGrass is far and away one of my favorites. Have a look at our hands-on video walkthrough to see why this might be the best Apple Watch charging and storage solution yet. For starters, the Amber Watchcase Power Bank brings the following handy features to the table: Charging Apple Watch on the go Charging Apple Watch and iPhone/iPad simultaneously iOS app with charging notifications and battery status The biggest feature, at least for me, is the case’s ability to charge my Apple Watch on the go. This is possible because the Amber Watchcase Power Bank features a built-in 3800 mAh rechargeable battery, enough to recharge an Apple Watch six times. The inclusion of an internal battery means that you will have enough juice to power your Apple Watch for a full work week, even when not tethered to a power outlet. This makes the Amber Watchcase Power Bank perfect for traveling, or for using in locations where there isn’t a power outlet available. Amber Watchcase Video Walkthrough Subscribe to the 9to5Mac YouTube channel for more Apple Watch videos ClearGrass’ Amber Watchcase can also be used to charge an iPhone or iPad, as the 3800 mAh battery provides enough juice to recharge an iPhone 7 Plus from 0 to 100% with some leftover juice to spare. In fact, you can charge both your Apple Watch and your iOS device at the same time. Design The first thing that struck me about the Amber Watchcase was its design. This is a well-designed product, and it’s obvious from handling it that lots of thought and work went into its build. The Watchcase plays nice with third-party bands like this one from Monowear The Amber’s exterior is constructed out of aluminum, and the interior is comprised of a soft plastic material that won’t scratch your Apple Watch. Almost everything about the case, from the external aluminum, to the plastic interior, to the hinge, feels like quality construction. Molded indentations for the case and Digital Crown demonstrate a keen attention to detail Charging You’ll need to buy a separate Apple Watch charging cable, or sacrifice the cable that came with your Apple Watch, in order to set up the Amber Watchcase. Included in the package is a USB-enabled spool that you connect and wind the charger’s cable around. From there, it’s just a matter of mounting the magnetic puck neatly inside the front portion of the spool. The spool is then locked into the case and covered by a plastic housing that serves to hide and protect the charger’s wire. The spool features a female USB port to connect the Apple Watch charging cable On the rear of the Amber Watchcase is where you’ll find two USB input ports. One standard USB port is used for charging your iPhone or iPad, and another micro USB port is used for charging the Amber Watchcase. The spool with Apple Watch charging cable in place On the top of the device is where you’ll find a small button next to a set of five LEDs. These LEDs allow you to quickly see how much power remains on the unit’s internal battery. USB for charging iOS devices and micro USB for charging the Amber Watchcase If you’re the type of person that likes to keep the Amber plugged in next to your bedside, then you’ll be happy to know that ClearGrass designed it in a way to intelligently route device power. When the Watchcase is connected to a power outlet, it will directly feed that power to the Apple Watch and any other iOS device that’s connected via USB. By intelligently routing power, it prevents the unit’s internal battery from being drained as often, thus prolonging the battery’s lifespan. Five LEDs provide a glanceable battery indicator If the case’s internal battery is exhausted, it simply functions like a normal charger, with the ability to power both your Apple Watch and iPhone. It can even charge an iPad as long as you use a proper iPad charger, and not the standard 5w iPhone charger. Amber comes in four colors Color Image Space Gray Silver Gold Rose Gold Usage I was skeptical about the Amber initially, as it started off as a Kickstarter campaign and I’ve had my fair share of bad experiences with Kickstarter. Amber taught me that I should be careful not to lump every Kickstarter-backed product into a single pool, because this truly is a wonderful product. It’s probably my number one Apple Watch accessory, as it greatly improves the ownership experience. This Apple Watch is charging without any external cables Being able to charge the Apple Watch on the go, or on a whim when a power cord isn’t in sight, is truly a marvelous thing. I love the fact that the Amber is a case that completely hides your Apple Watch from view. Not only is the watch protected inside of the Amber Watchcase, but it’s actually being charged in the process. The Amber Watchcase Power Bank features a 3800 mAh internal battery And not only is this device easy to use, but it’s very well-designed. It’s the type of product that I wouldn’t be shocked to see on the shelves of my local Apple Store. ClearGrass contracted the folks at Foxconn to build these units, so it’s no surprise that the final product comes out looking as good and as polished as it does. The Amber app lends charging notifications and more granular battery level readings The free Amber app will help you discern how many cycles the battery has been through, allows you to locate the Amber via Bluetooth, and will send you push notifications to let you know once your Apple Watch is fully charged. Of course, you can also see the unit’s internal battery status in a much more granular way than is possible via the five LEDs located on top of the case. Potential negatives The main downside that I noticed while using the Amber was that the Apple Watch display is obscured behind the bottom half of the case while resting inside. This makes it hard to see the current time while the watch is in Nightstand mode. That’s not a huge deal, but it’s something that may potentially annoy some users. I also wish that the App provided more stats, such as the current battery status of the Apple Watch, although this could be an API limitation. You can receive a notification when your watch is fully charged, but you won’t know the status of the watch as it charges without opening the case’s lid and physically looking at the watch. The app also won’t send notifications after it’s killed by iOS, which is a definite weak point. The folks at ClearGrass state that they currently have no plans to update the app to support proper push notifications, which is a bummer. The micro USB cable that’s used to charge the Amber is way too short. For a device that’s designed to sit next to your bedside, you’d think it would come with a much longer charging cable. You’ll need to supply your own Apple Watch charging cable. If you only have one Apple Watch charger, then you’ll basically be sacrificing it to use in this charging case. The price, at $99 will be too expensive for some. If you just dropped hundreds of dollars on a new Apple Watch, I could certainly see being hesitant to drop another $99 on an accessory. Granted, it’s a very cool and nice to have accessory, but it’s certainly not a requirement to enjoy your Apple Watch. Conclusion If it sounds like I’m gushing over this product, it’s because I am. It’s really that good. I’ve always found charging my Apple Watch to be a bit of an annoyance. Now I can just place my Apple Watch in the Amber, and take the case with me wherever I happen to be. The Amber Watchcase Power Bank is available in four different colors on Amazon. Yes, it’s a little pricey, but it makes storing and recharging the Apple Watch so much more convenient that I think it’s a worthwhile investment for any Apple Watch owner.

In an 8-3 ruling, a US appeals court said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million (£96m) verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. In the case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to make phone calls. The bulk of the award, $98.7 million, was for the detection patent that the earlier panel said wasn't infringed. The February decision also said the other two patents were invalid. Apple has been fighting VirnetX over the patents for years Credit: Getty The court ruled that the previous decision to throw out the patent infringement was a wrong decision, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. The decision on Friday comes less than a week before the US Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone. Together, the two cases are the remnants of a global legal battle between the world's biggest makers of smartphones that began in April 2011 and at one point spanned four continents. At a glance | Smartphones compared The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record, Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. The opinion was a surprise - the court never announced that it would consider the case before all active judges prior to issuing the opinion.  The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, responsible for the reinstatement of the fine, handles all patent appeals in the US, so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the US Patent and Trademark Office. In a separate case, Apple was last week ordered to pay $302.4 million (£235.2m) in damages for infringing on patents awarded to VirnetX for secure computer and mobile communications.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « U.S. Phone Carriers Scramble to Offer a Second Note7 Replacement after Recent Fire on Airline | Main | Apple Files Patent in Australia Revealing Possible Future Apple TV Features » October 08, 2016 Microsoft's Everyday Graphics 'Paint' App to Gain Enviable new 3D tools with Windows 10 Update   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "The Day Before Apple Launches the New MacBook Pro, Microsoft will introduce their iMac Challenger." Beyond the hardware that will be announced at the event on October 26, Microsoft is to focus on sharing their vision of the future of Windows 10. One of the new things coming to a future Windows 10 update is a complete overhaul of the long standing 'Paint' app by introducing simple 3D tools. While Apple has been known to make easy-to-use software, Microsoft's new Paint is going to be wildly applauded by Windows users as you'll see in the video below.     Apple has been working on several 3D centric technologies as covered in our archives. While most of Apple's 3D projects are very high-end, they're also working on a few apps that will take advantage of creating quick 3D avatars and one for manipulating photos and videos to 3D. Apple will begin by delivering an iOS 10 update later this month that will allow iPhone 7-Plus owners the ability to use their new dual lens camera to produce/deliver a new depth enabled photography technique called the Bokeh effect.   Yet Microsoft's Paint has always been an amazingly simple app that delivers a basic set of drawing tools for everyday use. It's one of the most practical tools ever created and one that I use every day. Now that it's leaping into delivering simple 3D tools, it's only going to get dramatically better across all Surface products including their new all-in-one desktop arriving in weeks.     I can only hope that Apple will one day add such a tool for macOS and iOS users in the future. Then again, Microsoft's 'Paint' could be accessed by those using Windows 10 on their Macs today via Parallels, and so the updated version with 3D tools will likely be coming to a future Parallels update for Macs sometime in 2017. I can't wait to try it out.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsGoogle Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google-parent Alphabet Inc. says its flagship smartphone has the best camera ever made. October 8, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its newest flagship smartphone, the Pixel alongside Pixel XL, and boy, did the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made some bold claims. According to Google exec Sundar Pichai, the Pixel has the single best phone camera ever made. And to erase all doubts that Google is coming after the iPhone 7, the event was filled with savage burns directed at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is all about camera performance and it’s been one of the key features that’s consistently improving with every reiteration of the iPhone. To illustrate how deeply Apple cares about camera performance, execs say that over 800 engineers worked on the iPhone 7’s camera, piecing together over 200 components within the teeny tiny camera modules. And because of the improved hardware, the iPhone 7 featured a bump that most users are unhappy about. Google execs made not-so-subtle digs at the iPhone 7 camera bump during the launch. In a live demo, the bump has been mentioned one time too many, highlighting the fact that the Pixel does not have this much-maligned design. The execs added that Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC assembled the Pixel smartphones. Google also bragged about the Pixel’s camera performance, highlighting the fact that its newest smartphone scored 89 out of 100 in a DxOMark Mobile test. On the same test, the iPhone 7 scored an 86. DxOMark is known for rating cameras and lenses for smartphones and high-end DSLRs alike using sophisticated analysis software. However, it’s worth noting that DxOMark has yet to review iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. Google also slammed one of most common sources of frustration among iPhone users, the limited storage. As you know, photos and videos eat a lot of space and if you’re using an iOS device, then you might be familiar with the annoying storage full popups. According to Brian Rakowski, Google’s vice president of product management, Pixel and the Pixel XL users can kiss these “painful” Storage Full popups goodbuy because their flagship smartphones will come with “free unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.” Moreover, both the regular and the XL Pixels share the same features, which means, Google is not putting a premium on extra/special features, something that’s been a tradition at Apple. To top it all off, the Pixel smartphones will be the first to feature Google’s newest digital assistant, the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri. Other notable Pixel camera features include the ability to edit photos. Google’s Pixel smartphone features a sleek, aluminum and glass form factor. The smaller, 5 inch model – priced at $649 – comes with a storage of 32 GB, while the larger XL, features a 5.5-inch screen with up to 128 GB storage, just like the iPhone 7 Plus.

Lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit against the company in California earlier this fall have signed on three additional law firms to support their case, and an additional class action lawsuit related to the issue has been filed against Apple in Utah. For the last month, Motherboard has been following “touch disease,” a flaw in iPhone 6 Plus phones that causes the touchscreens to become unresponsive. Swapping out the screen itself doesn’t correct the underlying issue, which is caused by two “touch IC” controller chips coming loose from the phone’s logic board. The flaw is believed to be related to the phone’s larger form factor and unreinforced logic board, which can cause it to flex or bend even under normal use—you may remember “bendgate” from when the phone was first released. Read More: A technical explanation of 'touch disease' Apple will not perform logic board-level repairs for consumers, which require soldering and reseating of millimeter-size components. This means the only Apple-sanctioned “fix” for a touch diseased phone is to buy a new one. One of the major problems is that Apple has been replacing touch diseased iPhone 6 Pluses with $329 refurbished ones, some of which are showing symptoms of touch disease within days or weeks of being replaced. Over the course of my reporting, a total of five separate current and former Apple Geniuses have confirmed to me that Apple is well aware of the problem but will not tell customers about it. Image: Trent Dennison/YouTube Court filings by Apple show that the company is at least aware of the fact that it’s being sued in federal court over the issue in both Utah and California, (there is also a class action suit in Canada). A September 20th filing in the Utah case claims that “[Apple] has requested an extension of time to respond to the Complaint.” A filing submitted by Apple earlier this week in the larger California class action suit asked to combine the two cases into one, presumably so Apple can focus its legal resources to just one suit. “Given the similarity between the [Utah] and [California] actions, it would unnecessarily tax judicial resources if these actions were to proceed in separate class action lawsuits—especially where the [Utah] and [California] Plaintiffs purport to represent the same putative class of all consumers who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the filing. "With these lawsuits hanging over its head, Apple won’t be able to ignore the issue forever" Apple has still said nothing publicly about “touch disease” and has ignored five requests from Motherboard for comment spread out over the course of a month; no other media outlet that has been able to get Apple to comment on the issue, either. Since running my initial story about touch disease, I have gotten hundreds of emails from consumers who have had to buy new phones to replace their broken iPhone 6 Pluses and several Geniuses have told me about the internal protocol Apple requires its employees to use when a touch diseased phone is brought to the store. Richard McCune, an attorney at the California-based McCuneWright law firm who is representing plaintiffs in the California suit, told me that nearly 10,000 people have contacted his firm asking to specifically join the lawsuit (a form to submit information is here). Friday night, McCune filed an updated lawsuit against Apple that has added several plaintiffs and adds three separate law firms to the legal battle. The new complaint has been embedded below. “Each of the firms (who had their own clients) brings strength to the case, including Stephen Larson of Larson O'Brien, who is a former Federal Judge,” McCune told me in an email. “With these firms working with us, we believe it gives us the best chance of obtaining a positive result in the case for the owners of the phones.” For the time being, Apple continues to pretend like touch disease doesn’t exist. But with these lawsuits hanging over its head, it won’t be able to ignore the issue forever. iPhone Touch Screen - Amended Complaint [CONFORMED COPY] by MotherboardTV on Scribd Topics: iphones, apple, iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease, Touch Disease, iPhone Touch Disease, lawsuits, iFixIt, Right to Repair Contact the author by email or Twitter.

By Jason Snell October 7, 2016 9:00 AM PT Syncing feeling: iCloud Drive in macOS Sierra Documents and Desktop, nestled into iCloud. So many of macOS Sierra’s new features are about freeing up space from our fast-but-tiny solid-state drives. In addition, Apple has extended support for iCloud Drive to optionally include your Desktop and Documents folder, and mixed those two approaches together to create a third feature, called Optimize Mac Storage. I like what Apple’s going for, but both of these features have problems, and some of them bit me when I was writing my review of Sierra. Let’s take a much closer look at what’s going on with syncing and optimizing, including the bugs, the missed opportunities, and the workarounds. Syncing Documents and Desktop to iCloud Drive In Sierra, iCloud Drive finally gets to break out of its own protected folder and into the system at large. In reality, that’s not quite what’s going on—when you first install Sierra, you’re asked if you want to sync your Desktop and Documents folders with iCloud. If you turn this feature on, your Desktop and Documents folders are really moved inside iCloud Drive, with the old locations linked to your home folder so that everything behaves more or less normally. (Except when there are bugs—a few of my apps seemed to get confused when those folders changed locations.) iCloud syncing is pretty robust, and once I got up and running with this feature, it worked as advertised. However, the act of turning it on can be terrifying, especially if you’ve already turned it on while using a different Mac. If your Mac discovers that another Mac is already syncing its Desktop to your iCloud Drive, Sierra will create new folder called “Desktop - Your System Name” inside the Desktop folder within iCloud, and move your files inside. (The same thing happens with your Documents folder.) What this looks like in the Finder: All your files disappear off of your desktop. Maybe a few new files from your other Mac appear. If you keep your key files on your Desktop, it can be terrifying. However, if you look around, you’ll probably see that “Desktop - Your System Name” folder, and all your files should be in there. Apparently Apple didn’t anticipate this moment of terror, though it should’ve seen it coming. The right thing to do is probably to generate a warning for users, and maybe leave that folder open in a Finder window. Even better would be to give the user a few options when they turn on Desktop and Documents syncing on a different Mac—keep the two Desktops separate, merge them together, or set either one of the Macs as the “real desktop.” But right now, the first Mac wins and the next Mac stuffs its files into a subfolder and waits for the user to sort it out. Because I wrote a book about Photos, I bought a huge amount of iCloud space to sync my entire Photos library. As a result, I was able to sync everything in my Desktop folder—even huge audio files—to iCloud without difficulty. If you don’t have enough free iCloud space to sync your Desktop and Documents folders, Apple will offer you the exciting opportunity to buy more. If you decline, Apple won’t let you enable this feature. (Later, if your folders surpass the amount of space available on iCloud, you’ll get an alert and your files will stop syncing with iCloud. They’ll still be present on your Mac, safe and sound, but syncing will stop until you free up or purchase more iCloud space.) The trouble with optimizing iCloud storage Combine the concept of purgeable space and the ability to sync more files with iCloud and you get a third key feature of macOS Sierra. When you turn on syncing of the Desktop and Document folders, the Optimize Mac Storage feature is turned on. (You can turn it off in the iCloud Drive section of the iCloud Preference Pane, and probably should, for now.) Optimize Mac Storage is a feature that defines files that have been uploaded to iCloud as purgeable, more or less. Apple prioritizes your files so that things you’ve accessed recently will be kept around, but items you haven’t accessed for a long time can be removed. When a file is removed, it’s gone from your hard drive, but it lives on in the cloud, and can be downloaded again by clicking an icon in the Finder or when it’s demanded by an application. Scary, right? But again, if everything’s working perfectly, you’ve just granted that tiny SSD on your MacBook an extra few hundreds of gigabytes of storage, because it can offload your old junk to the cloud. And if it turns out you need it, you can get it back. If everything’s working perfectly. And if the system can truly differentiate between files you need and files you don’t. So something bad happened when I was working on my review of macOS Sierra. As a responsible reviewer, I need to use all the features of a new operating system. That comes with some risks, but that’s why I’m here. Risk (of losing data) is our business. Here’s what happened: While I was working on a podcast-editing project in Logic Pro X, a bunch of my audio files were removed by Optimize Mac Storage. I keep all my key files and projects on the Desktop, as many people do, and since this is a feature that’s designed to keep your work in sync, I decided I was not going change my workflow one bit. Apple has since told me that I absolutely ran into several different bugs, as well as a few quirks of the file-management process. Many apps store all of their asset files in a single package file—it’s really a folder, but all the important files are stuffed inside so that if you move the package, everything comes along for the ride. A Keynote presentation file is actually a package with a Keynote document and all of the images and movies you dragged in, all bundled together. Optimize Mac Storage works great with packages. It’s not going to delve down inside a package and get rid of your files—old projects can be optimized away, but new products will remain on your drive, and nothing gets plucked out of the inside of projects. The problem with some apps—and Apple’s Logic Pro X and Final Cut Pro X fit into this category—is that either they don’t use packages, or stuffing all your files inside a package is optional. My podcast template keeps audio files in the same folder as my Logic project files, but they don’t live inside a package. Now, it turns out that App developers can take advantage of file-coordination APIs to designate all the files that a given project is using, even if they’re not inside a package. If Logic Pro X used those APIs, perhaps my files wouldn’t have been touched, because iCloud would recognize that they were part of an active project. Alas, not even Apple’s own apps support all of Apple’s APIs. (Optimize Mac Storage apparently looks at the last time you opened a file in the Finder as a way to help determine the age of a file, but if you open a project file and that file then reads from other files, the feature doesn’t consider them actively used.) The setup of my project folders, Logic’s lack of support for file coordination, and the bugs that made my Mac think it was much more space constrained than it actually was—this was the situation that conspired to make Optimize Mac Storage look at a few 14-day-old 600MB audio files and decide that they were old junk. Pro tip: Turn it off or move key files elsewhere With any luck, Apple’s hot on the case of fixing the bugs. Perhaps the teams in charge of Apple’s pro apps are working on coordinating project files a bit more aggressively. And I suspect that I might be a little responsible for this new Apple tech note, which suggests that if you’re using a pro app, you should move your projects out of synced folders or turn off Optimize Mac Storage. Yep, that’s Apple saying that people who use pro apps should just turn off or avoid using a major new feature of macOS Sierra. It burns a little—what’s the point of making new productivity features if some classes of Mac user just shouldn’t use them? What’s worse, it points out the larger risk in turning on Optimize Mac Storage: If you keep key files outside of a package—images you’re planning on dropping into a Keynote presentation, for example, but haven’t yet—you risk them being deleted by Optimize Mac Storage. If your internet connection is permanent, fast and unmetered, this is no big deal. If you’re working on an airplane and discover that one of your files you were counting on is gone, welp… that sucks for you. Optimize Mac Storage offers no user interface, so there’s no way to designate certain files or folders as un-purgeable. It’s all or nothing. Either you take your chances or you walk away. For many classes of Mac user, the risks are low and the benefits are great. For other classes, the right answer is to do what Apple recommends in its tech note: walk away.

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

Cupertino described the removal of the headphone jack as an act of courage, pointing out that Apple has always been among the first to make changes that were eventually adopted by the rest of the industry. But leaving these changes aside, the iPhone 7 lineup brought few surprises after several months full of leaks and controversial debates on whether the iPhone can re-become the best-selling phone in the world or not. Samsung has improved a lot lately, and the Galaxy S7 posted record sales, finally challenging the iPhone and helping the South Korean company become the number one phone manufacturer in the world. The first half of the year was quite a bumpy adventure for Apple fans, with rumors even claiming that the company planned to launch this year’s iPhone as a variation of the iPhone 6, in an attempt to save the iPhone 7 name for next year when it celebrates 10 years from the first model. And yet, here we are using the iPhone 7, looking exactly like in the leaks that made the rounds before the launch and sporting the majority of features that we’ve heard about through unofficial channels. This is a little surprising given that Apple has always tried to keep everything secret prior to big launches, but leaks did happen, and many of them were quite accurate. The new phone series brought the same two models as before, despite rumors that a Pro version could be added as well. After reviewing the iPhone 7 Plus with a dual-camera system, we decided to take the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7 for a spin too and see if this is a worthy upgrade or not. Continue reading to find the answer to this question. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back view Hardware and performance Aesthetically, the new iPhone 7 features almost no changes as compared to its predecessor, and unless it’s painted in Black (matte) or Jet Black (glossy), those uninitiated might really have a hard time guessing which one is which. The most striking difference is the bigger camera cutout on the new model and the antenna lines that have been moved to the top and the bottom edges. Otherwise, the old and the new models are exactly the same. They have the same dimensions (138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm / 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in), but the iPhone 7 is lighter (138 grams versus 143 grams). And all these resemblances continue in terms of hardware as well. The display is the same 4.7-inch IPS LCD screen with 16M color support and resolution of 750x1334 pixels. The same pixel density is maintained - 326 ppi, and given that no difference in size has been made, it also has the same screen-to-body ratio - 65.6 percent. The biggest difference is that the iPhone 7 comes with wide color gamut support, which means that you can enjoy more natural colors on the display, especially when shooting photos. Every pic you take looks beautiful, and this is partially thanks to the camera, but also because the display manages to accurately reproduce more colors on its screen. “The yellow tint of the screen goes away after a while.” This doesn't mean that the display is flawless, though. The model we’ve tested was suffering from an issue that’s been reported on other iPhones as well, including older models, which led to a yellowish tint of the display. There’s no official explanation for this, but it’s believed that the glue that Apple has used to seal the screen and make the device waterproof is at fault because the first units were shipped without it getting dry. But the more you use it, the more the yellow tint is supposed to go away - we did see some changes during our two-week test, though, and the color indeed was gone almost entirely. Apple has obviously upgraded the CPU, and this is happening with every new iPhone model, so the iPhone 7 comes with the quad-core A10 Fusion, a worthy upgrade from the dual-core A9 clocked at 1.84 GHz. The same amount of RAM is being offered - 2 GB, as Apple decided to upgrade only the Plus model to 3 GB, most likely in order to deal with the necessary amount of extra processing power caused by the addition of a dual-camera system. Cupertino has also changed storage options and discontinued the 16 GB and 64 GB versions, offering instead an entry-level version with 32 GB and two additional configurations with 128 GB and 256 GB. This is clearly a welcome change since the OS itself and photos eat up more space on the phone, so 16 GB was no longer enough for the base model. The iPhone 7 no longer has a headphone jack, but comes with a Lightning connector that is being used for both charging and listening to music, and you probably heard all the controversy around this change. Apple is offering a Lightning set of headphones in the box, as well as a jack to Lightning adapter, but there’s no doubt that the transition is painful, to say the least. Speakers are now stereo, with a secondary one placed in the earpiece, but the quality of the sound is only slightly improved. We’ve noticed the same thing on the iPhone 7 Plus, and used the same tech on both models. The same is valid for call audio quality, as only small improvements can be noticed. iPhone 7 Home button The Home button has also been replaced with a touch-sensitive version that helps ensure waterproofing. To compensate for the removal of the physical button, Apple used a new haptic engine that emits a soft vibration to simulate a real press, and you can configure the intensity by choosing one of three pre-defined levels from settings. Other than that, you get the same features, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC for Apple Pay, GPS, and the rest of the package. There is no microSD card support, no fast and wireless charging, and no infrared port. Overall, the iPhone 7 is super similar with small exceptions here and there that are only supposed to improve the general experience with the phone. This is clearly a step in the right direction, but the similarities between the old and the new models are likely to affect sales, as many iPhone 6s owners can hardly find a reason to upgrade. And they really can't be blamed for anything, especially because performance is nearly identical and the new hardware doesn't make such a big difference given the excellent software optimizations in iOS. Camera Apple is trying to make the Plus a more compelling model for all buyers, and just like it did with the 6s series, the company is offering some exclusive features on the bigger version of the new generation. This time, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a dual-camera system that’s supposed to help you take higher quality shots, while the standard 4.7-inch iPhone comes with a single-lens configuration that at first glance isn’t offering the same performance. And yet, this is not true. And it’s all very simple. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a dual-camera system that includes the wide lens and a telephoto lens, while the iPhone 7 comes with the exact same configuration, but without the latter. So the only thing you’re missing is the optical zoom, which to be honest, you’re not going to use too often, so you’re safe. Dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus (left) and single-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Furthermore, the iPhone 7 now comes with OIS, as compared to the previous model which lacked this feature, as it was exclusive to the Plus, and has the exact camera specs as the bigger brother, without the telephoto lens. As a result, the iPhone 7 features a 12-megapixel unit with F1.8 and 1/3” sensor size, up from F2.2 on the 6s. This improvement allows the iPhone 7 to shoot better photos in low-light conditions and to make sure that performance here is better, Apple also equipped the device with a quad-LED flash, up from dual-LED on the predecessor. iPhone 7 camera performance in optimal light conditions The rest of the feature package is unchanged, as you get the typical features such as HDR, touch focus, face detection, and 4K video recording. The front-facing camera has also been upgraded and is now featuring 7-megapixel resolution and F2.2, up from 5 megapixels and F2.2. This leads to a small improvement in video quality during FaceTime calls, but otherwise, you won’t spot any huge difference. As far as real-life performance of the camera is concerned, here’s the thing. When comparing the iPhone 7 with the 6s, the improvements are more than obvious. The iPhone 7 shoots better photos in low light and takes more natural shots in perfect light. Compared to rivals such as the Note 7, it doesn’t offer the same detail quality, but it’s not far either, and it still has one of the best cameras on the market right now. iPhone 7 camera sample - zoom in to view detail sharpness Low-light shots are processed depending on the subject, and this is where the quad-LED flash is coming into play. The iPhone 7 uses a system similar to the one we’ve seen on the Lumia 950 XL, which also featured an RGB flash, and turns to the LEDs in the flash to compensate for the colors in the photo. Just like we’ve said for the Plus, there sometimes seems to be a larger amount of red in night shots, but otherwise quality is above average. All in all, the camera on the iPhone 7 is a worthy upgrade. And what’s also important, the rounded design makes more sense, aesthetically speaking, as the dual-camera system looks kind of odd on the Plus model and makes it feel clunky when trying to use on a desk. Note: all these photos feature no edits, so they're just copied from the phone and published in the article. For more camera samples, you can also check out the review of the iPhone 7 Plus, whose main camera is available on this model too. Battery life First and foremost, it’s worth noting that this time Apple has actually increased battery capacity, so no matter what, the iPhone 7 should last longer than its predecessor. This means that if you were pleased with the autonomy of the iPhone 6s, you should be pleased with the iPhone 7’s too. Cupertino used a lithium-ion 1960 mAh battery, up from 1715 mAh, with the company claiming that it offers better life, but without providing any figures. And truth be told, official figures are rarely accurate because they’re calculated in the perfect scenario, which is super different from real life. “It doesn't always get you through the day.” What we can tell, however, is that depending on how you use the iPhone 7, you can get anywhere between 18 hours to 30 hours of battery life. Yes, we know it’s not ideal, and sometimes you can get even lower than that, but you can always recharge it quickly, and you’re good to go with 100 percent of battery once again. Battery information in iOS 10 The problem here is that the iPhone 7 does not feature fast charging, and given that only the Lightning port is available, charging the device every few hours isn’t the most convenient thing to do, especially if you want to use it for listening to music. There’s no wireless charging either, and this is again a major drawback, because it could have helped overcome the lack of a headphone jack. In the end, the iPhone 7 provides decent battery life, but be ready to plug it in more frequently if you are a heavy user. If you’re not, then there’s no reason not to be pleased with battery life. Software iPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 and if you’ve already used it on a different iPhone model, you pretty much know what to expect. And truth be told, there’s nothing new you’ll get in terms of software when it comes to the iPhone 7, except for some small tweaks here and there, such as vibrations and a few extra options. These are nice refinements, but you can live without them just fine. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10 home screen iOS 10 offers the same feature package on the iPhone 7 as on any other iPhone, but you also get vibrations when changing keyboards, when toggling from ringer to silent, or when opening the notification center. The Home button also comes with three pre-defined vibration levels, which you can configure from settings, but that’s pretty much it. We’ve found iOS 10 on iPhone 7 to be exactly as fast as on the 6s, and just like we’ve said when reviewing the Plus, there might be a small improvement in terms of browsing speed in Safari. “Few iPhone 7-specific options” On the good side, iOS 10 continues to offer super advanced optimizations and it’s just amazing that Apple finds new ways to squeeze every little drop of performance from an operating system that doesn’t need an insane amount of RAM. Just think that Android devices have already reached 6 GB of RAM, but Apple is offering at least comparable performance figures with 2 GB, and this is impressive, to say the least. Furthermore, Apple keeps putting extra focus on battery optimizations with every new iOS update and the new version, coupled with a bigger battery on the iPhone 7, provides longer life than on the 6s. In the end, iOS 10 is a welcome upgrade, but once again, nothing that you couldn’t live without. It’s clearly nice to have, especially given the aforementioned refinements here and there, but we’re not so sure that many 6s owners would agree to pay that much just for having a new phone that does almost the same thing as their old one. The bottom line Let us put it this way: if you’re not pleased with the look of the iPhone 7, and the chances are that you’re not given the fact that it brings only little in terms of aesthetics, just try the black version. You won’t believe the difference it makes. It looks fresh, it looks luxurious, and it certainly looks smaller. On the iPhone 7 Plus, the black color makes such a big difference that you don’t even notice how big it is. Although on paper adding a new color to the iPhone lineup seems to be such an insignificant thing, after holding it in hand for a few minutes you can’t help but wonder how come that Apple didn’t do this earlier. And the iPhone 7 with its dimensions makes this even more compelling, especially if you’re no longer interested in big phones. We must be honest here: the Plus model is still gigantic and with those huge bezels, it kind of lost the design battle with its rivals. Just look at the Note 7 - it has a bigger display, but it's almost the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. But the standard 4.7-inch iPhone is easy to carry around, has a decent battery life, it has the same main camera as on the Plus model, runs iOS 10, and offers all the advantages that you get from the bigger model. You’re not losing anything except for the telephoto lens, which we guarantee you’ll use quite rarely anyway. This upgrade also brings OIS on the iPhone 7, so really, you won’t be losing anything. The 4.7-inch iPhone continues to be the iPhone, and even though Apple is trying to push more people to the Plus version, the smaller version is just not done yet. And by bringing it in line with the Plus, Apple’s making even harder for new buyers to ignore the 4.7-inch iPhone.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (42 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Plus#iPhone review#iPhone 7 review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it iPhone 7 (42 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 7 Plus Review BlackBerry DTEK50 Review Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review iPhone SE Review - Best Phone... of 2012 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background 42 photos    iPhone 7 in Black new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   iPhone 7 Plus Review more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

But not all data related to iMessage has that same level of protection -- and that information can still be turned over to law enforcement authorities. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Andrea Peterson The Washington Post     When a user sends someone a message through Apple's iMessage feature, Apple encrypts that message between Apple devices so that only the sender and recipient can read its contents. But a recent report from news site the Intercept is a good reminder that not all data related to iMessage has that same level of protection -- and that information can still be turned over to law enforcement authorities. That may be surprising to everyday users who view Apple as a privacy champion after its legal battle with the Justice Department this year over a court order that would force the company to break its own security measures. But to experts, it's just a fact of how communication systems work. For instance, as security expert and noted iPhone hacker Will Strafach notes, Apple needs to know things such as whom you're chatting with via iMessage so that it can deliver your messages. According to a document obtained by the Intercept, Apple logs information about whom you're contacting in iMessage while the app figures out if the person you are texting is also using an iOS device. If they are using iOS, the message gets encrypted and routed through iMessage, which is signaled by blue chat bubbles. If the recipient is not using an Apple device, the message gets routed as a standard text without that extra layer of encryption, and messages appear in green bubbles in the iMessage app. According to the document, which the Intercept says originated "from within the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Electronic Surveillance Support Team," these logs don't necessarily show that you messaged someone. Instead, they show when you opened up a chat window and selected the contact or entered a phone number. Apple says those logs are wiped every 30 days. But because that data exists at all, police can use court orders to force the company to hand it over. And, as the Intercept notes, in ongoing investigations it's possible to extend court orders to get new data, which would allow law enforcement to build a record that goes beyond just 30 days. "When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the requested information if it is in our possession," Apple told The Washington Post in a statement. "In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices." Apple emphasized that because iMessages are encrypted, the company is not able to give police access to the content of conversations. Nor do the message logs "prove that any communication actually took place." All of this seems consistent with Apple's legal process guide, which notes that information about your contacts is among the data it may turn over to investigators when served with a court order or subpoena. Of course, metadata can still be incredibly revealing, especially when analyzed over time: Knowing whom you're messaging (or even thinking about messaging) can reveal who's in your social network or expose personal data. For instance, if you're regularly sending text messages to a suicide crisis line someone reviewing your log could assume that you're having a serious mental health crisis. That type of privacy concern is among the reasons why civil liberties advocates pushed back so hard on the now defunct National Security Agency program that allowed the government to collect bulk metadata about Americans' phone calls, including the numbers they dialed and duration of calls. The Intercept also raised another issue about the logs: They appear to contain IP addresses, which can be used to determine a user's general location. Revealing that information, the Intercept argues, seems to run counter to a statement Apple made in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent of the NSA's spying powers. "[W]e do not store data related to customers' location, Map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form," Apple said in the June 2013 statement. But it's worth noting that the geolocation information that can be determined by IP addresses is typically less specific than what you'd get from GPS data or from looking up a specific address. And Apple's legal process guide also notes that IP addresses are among the information that police can request with a court order or subpoena.

Highs Excellent battery life Accurate sleep tracking Snappy performance Lows Wildly inaccurate heart rate monitor Dated design Primitive operating system Dim screen No Wi-Fi or GPS support Cannot compete with modern smartwatches DT Editors' Rating 4.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Wearable Reviews > Smartwatch Reviews > Pebble 2 + Heart Rate review By Kyle Wiggers Posted on 10.06.16 (updated on 10.09.16) Research Center: Pebble 2 + Heart Rate Pebble was a Kickstarter darling that started the smartwatch craze. Pebble’s low-power LCD (‘epaper’) display, weeklong battery life, and ability to work just as well with an Android phone as an iPhone attracted legions of fans. However, the small startup faces a market drastically different from the one it helped to pioneer. These days, it faces the Apple Watch, Samsung’s Gear smartwatches, and a veritable ecosystem of Android Wear devices. That’s not to imply Pebble has stumbled too hard. It still has its fanbase, an app store with thousands of apps, and a number of smartwatches on sale, including Pebble Time Steel, Pebble Time Round, and more. But it isn’t 2014 anymore, and the competition is not slowing down: analysts at Kantar Worldpanel estimate that this past fiscal quarter, Apple Watch commanded 33.5 percent of the U.S. smartwatch market. Related: Can’t wait to get a wearable? Here are the best smartwatches you can buy It’s formidable competition for the Pebble 2, a smartwatch that promises to track your sleep, steps, and heart rate; let you respond to messages and record notes via voice; and deliver up to a week of battery life. Unfortunately, the Pebble 2 only accomplishes a few of its goals. A clunky, dated design The Pebble 2’s design is definitely geeky and futuristic. It has big bezels and the small 1.26-inch, 144 x 168-pixel screen is super dim. Women and fashion-forward people need not apply. It’s a clunky, dated design that only true Pebble fans could possibly love. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends There’s a lot of plastic on the Pebble 2 — the watch’s entire body is constructed of it, in fact. It’s not going to feel premium like a Huawei Watch or an Apple Watch, but that is not the point. This is a basic, techy smartwatch that offers geek cred in place of style. It feels smooth, firm, sturdy, and durable. It’s exceptionally light and thin at 31.7 grams and just 9.8mm thick. The Apple Watch Series 2, for the sake of comparison, has a depth of 11.4mm. It’s not an all-plastic affair. Shielding the Pebble 2’s E Ink display is a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 covering that’ll easily withstand the occasional bump against a stairway railing and knock against a table edge. On its underbelly, you’ll find the Pebble 2’s heart rate sensor — a first on a Pebble smartwatch — and two metal contacts that connect to the Pebble 2’s charging cord. On either side are the watch’s hardware buttons. On one end, you’ll find the power button, and on the opposite end are two buttons that serve the dual purpose of navigating the interface and adjusting volume. A center button, meanwhile, acts as a “select” button, and on the top and bottom are 22mm lugs that’ll fit any compatible wristband with quick release mechanisms. The Pebble 2’s design is old school. Pebble devices in years past have received a fair share of criticism for designs that make them feel like they’re built for kids. This Pebble is no different, but it’s subtler and quieter. It looks less conspicuous than its predecessor and that’s a good thing. Related: Mobvoi TicWatch 2 review But those refinements don’t come without sacrifice. The Pebble 2 is not as water-resistant as the model before it — it can withstand pressure at depths of 30 meters versus the old model’s 50 meters. The Pebble 2’s display and processor also have not been upgraded: they’re the same 1.26-inch, 144 x 168 pixel always-on display and ARM Cortex M4 present on the Pebble and Pebble Time, respectively. The interface has improved On the whole, navigation on the Pebble 2 is relatively intuitive. The Pebble 2 ships running the company’s latest firmware, version 4.0, which launched in last August of this year. The company calls it the “Timeline” and it’s much better than earlier versions of Timeline we tried. It’s an ongoing, chronological stream of notifications, news, reminders, and events laid out like a menu and loaded as needed. The Pebble 2’s heart rate tracking is wildly inaccurate. Apps that you frequently access can be designated as “favorites” and doing so pins them to the timeline for easy access. You can scroll up to three days ahead in the timeline. A relatively new feature called Quick Views presents you with upcoming calendar appointments and notifications at a glance. When one appears, pressing the “down” button opens additional information for perusal. It doesn’t take long to get a handle on the software. You move through the list of running timeline entries with the side keys, tapping until you’ve reached an entry about which you’d like to learn more. Then, you press the “select” key to populate the screen with additional information. Selecting a timeline notification about the weather, for instance, opens a screen with the time of day, current temperature, location, and a succinct forecast. Hitting select a second time in any app summons a settings menu with options to remove the app from your timeline or “mute” its future notifications. Notifications from a paired phone also hit the Pebble just like they do on the Apple Watch or Android Wear. When you get a Facebook Message or Instagram update, your wrist will buzz accordingly. Some of those notifications are actionable. Play a song on your iPhone or Android and you’ll be able to start, pause, or skip through tracks from the Pebble 2, or change the volume. Incoming calls also show a number and caller ID, and can be answered, silenced, or dismissed. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends As the Pebble development team points out on the wearable’s support webpage, Pebble is the only non-Apple wearable that can send replies to received iOS messages. It recently gained the ability to reply to emails, too. It’s a seamless process: hitting the “select” button when a message arrives pulls up a list of options — Delete, Archive, Mark as Read, Reply All, and Star — which work just the same as they do on the Apple Watch. You can reply to a message using voice dictation, or send a canned response. The Apple Watch still offers more options, like emoji, scribbles, and digital touches, but it’s nice that Pebble added canned responses to its software. Highly customizable Perhaps the best thing about the Pebble 2’s timeline is the degree to which it can be customized. On the Pebble 2 itself, you can change the text size of notifications and the strength of vibrations. From the companion app, you can toggle the notification settings of individual apps like Hangouts, Instagram, Messages, Slack, and almost any other app that taps into the notification framework of iOS or Android. Each can be muted permanently or periodically — only on weekdays, for example, or weekends. The companion app is also where you can reorder apps in the Pebble 2’s timeline, access settings menus, and choose watch faces. When it comes to watch faces, you have tons of options. You can edit watch faces in the companion app, too. Watch faces range from cute playful ones to everything from nationalism and mathematics to sports and brainteasers. New apps are also downloaded on your phone through the companion app. The Pebble 2 boasts thousands of apps to choose from, and that’s no exaggeration. There’s a mood tracker that measures your demeanor by asking you questions over a week; travel app that show you flight alerts, reservations, and weather ahead of and during a trip; and business directories that present nearby restaurants, bars, and other attractions for your consideration. There is also a surprisingly robust selection of games including Fitcat, an app that rewards physical activity with currency to spend on an adorable feline, and Pixel Minder, a Dig Dug-inspired title that tasks you with digging for rare minerals. Popular apps like Uber, Evernote, PayPal, RunKeeper, GoPro, Misfit, and Dominos are also available. As with previous Pebble devices, each storefront page contains a description of the app, the date it was last updated, and links to the creator’s previous work and contact information. Installing an app is as simple as tapping the “add” button in the upper right-hand corner, and a heart icon lets you mark your favorites. More isn’t always better, though, and many of Pebble’s apps feel like siloed experiences. They can’t easily tap companion apps on a paired smartphone, access weather data, or sync certain data in real time. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Somewhat surprisingly, Pebble doesn’t offer a voice assistant to make the most of its built-in microphone, either. In an age of smartwatches with voice-powered assistants like Siri and the Google Assistant, it’s an odd omission. Pebble Health Apps and watchfaces are only one component of the timeline, though. The rest is dominated by typical activity tracking for your steps, sleep, and heart rate. All of these metrics are tracked in Pebble Health, a built-in service that Pebble developed in collaboration with Stanford University. When you set up the Pebble, you can select your weight, sex, height, and birth date as well as specify goals like “I want to be more active” and “I want to sleep more.” The app lets you choose whether or not you’d like your data fed to third-party services like Google Fit or Apple Health. From that point on, almost everything is automatic. There’s a Workout app that collates heart rate data, distance, pace and steps in a single screen, but otherwise, sleep, activity, and fitness tracking happen in the background. Pebble simply cannot compete with modern smartwatches. Sleep tracking is by far the most impressive — and consistent — of the three. Lay motionless for a while and the Pebble will automatically detect that you’ve gone to bed, after which it’ll begin recording distinct periods of restfulness: sleep, deep sleep, and the times when you fall asleep and wake up. On the watch, that information is shown as a succinct summary: the start time and end time of your last sleep session; the length of your last “deep sleep” period; and the number of collective days you’ve gotten a good night’s rest. Sleep is broken down by individual days, too, up to a week proceeding, and each overview includes a timeline indicating how frequently you’ve entered deep sleep. The Pebble 2’s step tracker is much the same. The metrics are different, but the interface is identical. You see an overview of calories you’ve expended, the distance you’ve traveled in miles, a 30-day average, and a day-by-day overview of calorie burn you’ve burned throughout the past week. Heart tracking lacks an expanded view altogether: an animated heart icon above indicates your current heart rate in beats per minute. The companion Pebble app provides a much more detailed overview. The dedicated “Health” tab splits biometrics into three graphs: Activity, Heart Rate, and Sleep. The green Activity graph provides a nifty visualization of the calories you’ve burned over the course of a day, week, and month, indicating physically intense activities in a darker shade of green and lighter activities in a light shade. The Heart Rate graph plots chronological changes in BPM. And the Sleep app indicates both the total number of hours you’ve spent — on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis — sleeping (in light blue), in deep sleep (dark blue), or napping. Heart rate and fitness tracking don’t … work The Pebble 2’s heart rate tracking, unfortunately, is wildly inaccurate. It fluctuates between sky-high readings (180 beats per minute) one minute and impossibly low ones (50 beats per minute) the next. It didn’t seem to much matter whether readings were taken during, before, or after exercise, or even during periods of inactivity, and adjusting the tightness of the band didn’t appear to improve readings. This is a basic, techy smartwatch that offers geek cred in place of style. That’s a huge problem. The heart rate monitor is supposed to be a big selling point. It should be accurate and help improve calorie burn and exercise metrics, too. An inaccurate heart rate monitor is useless, and you might as well buy the slightly better looking Pebble Time without a heart rate tracker for $30 less at $100. The Pebble 2 + HR starts at $130, and that’s a lot to pay for an otherwise base-level Pebble watch with a heart rate monitor that doesn’t work. Poor heart rate monitoring isn’t the Pebble 2’s only fitness fumble. It doesn’t keep track of workout data: once a month’s time has elapsed, the previous days’ and weeks’ data is lost forever. The Pebble team said it plans to address that limitation in a November software update, but right now, it makes discerning trends and insights an obvious challenge. Battery life The Pebble 2 is zippy, for the most part. Apps launch largely without delay, the timeline’s animations are consistently smooth, and notifications frequently arrive on the Pebble and your phone simultaneously. Related: 30 must-have Pebble Time apps, watchfaces, and games for your wrist Perhaps more impressive than the Pebble 2’s performance is the longevity of its battery. The Pebble team quotes seven days on a single charge, and our unit seemed on track to best that estimation. Even with sleep and activity tracking features enabled, our Pebble 2’s battery percentage meter dipped no more than a few percentage points each day.

If you want a wearable that tightly integrates with services from the likes of Google and Apple, the Pebble 2 is not for you. If you want an accurate heart rate monitor and activity tracker that’ll provide substantive fitness insights, the Pebble 2 definitely is not the smartwatch for you. What are the alternatives? The DT Accessory Pack Bigger Leaner Stronger $13.13 Thinner Leaner Stronger $13.49 HealthMaster Elite Food Emulsifier $75 There are better alternatives at the Pebble 2’s price point. Sony’s $130 SmartWatch 3, a Android Wear-based watch with built-in GPS, a full-color screen, and a two-day battery life, is worth considering. If you’re in the market for a smartwatch, money is no object, and you own an iPhone, we highly recommend you consider the Apple Watch. It’s $150 more and offers built-in fitness tracking, a bright screen, and a classy-but-functional aesthetic. If Android Wear is more your style, the Huawei Watch is one of the best options out there. If you’re strictly in wearables for the fitness features, you might entertain the $130 Fitbit Alta, a tracker that lacks apps and games but delivers one of the best activity-tracking experiences in its class. For $40 more, you can get the $180 Samsung Gear Fit 2 with a heart rate monitor, GPS, and several smartwatch features. Pebble simply cannot compete with modern smartwatches. How long will it last? The Pebble 2 is already out of date. Its black and white screen, old design, and poor heart rate sensor make it a bad buy when there are much more capable devices available for the same price or a bit more. Pebble is also likely to sell new smartwatches soon, and its other offerings, including the Time Steel, are more stylish and worth your consideration if you’re dead set on a Pebble. Should you buy it? No. The Pebble 2 fails on several key points: It is a horrible fitness tracker, its apps generally are not as capable as those on the Apple Watch and Android Wear, and its hardware falls behind on too many levels.
Home Industry Companies FBI-Apple showdown: Yet another attempt at hacking a terrorist’s iPhone FBI-Apple showdown: Yet another attempt at hacking a terrorist’s iPhone In yet another battle between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the tech giant Apple, the former has been trying to crack open a password-locked iPhone, belonging to Dahir Adan, the private security firm employee who stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall this September. By: FE Online | Published: October 8, 2016 6:06 PM In February 2016, the FBI had asked a court to ask Apple to help hack the encrypted iPhone 5c of another terrorist, San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook.(Website) In yet another battle between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the tech giant Apple, the former has been trying to crack open a password-locked iPhone, belonging to Dahir Adan, the private security firm employee who stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall this September. In February 2016, the FBI had asked a court to ask Apple to help hack the encrypted iPhone 5c of another terrorist, San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook. FBI director James Comey had then informed the public that the demand was just for a terrorist’s phone,instead of asking for the secrets of every iPhone owner. Now, what seems to be another legal battle between the two, another similar case has cropped up, where the FBI sought Apple’s help to unlock the iPhone of a killer. Dahir Adan, the man who stabbed 10 people in Minnesota was shot and killed by a police officer. Meanwhile, ISIS had claimed credit for the attack through social media. At a press conference, FBI special agent Rich Thorton said that the FBI was “in the process of assessing our legal and technical options to gain access to this device and the data it may contain.” However, the model of the operating system of the iPhone which was used by Adan was not revealed by Thornton, and it is important to note that, after iOS 8 that was launched on 2014, Apple devices have been encrypted, so much so, that not even Apple can decrypt the contents of the device. However, the Bureau has not filed a lawsuit against Apple yet, like the previous instance. Last time, which the case was going on, FBI abruptly withdrew the case and claimed that it had found a hack to enter the iPhone and also claimed to have had paid $1.3 million for it.

The option of pre-ordering iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the Internet does not seem to be enough for Apple fans in India as they waited in line – some for several hours – outside retail stores across the country on Friday evening to get their hands on the swanky new smartphones. Unlike previous years, when sales used to start at midnight, Apple this year started selling its new iPhone models at 7pm in India. But like every year, fans lined up and waited for several hours outside the stores to buy the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Many early buyers had placed offline pre-orders for the smartphones in order to be among the first to get their hands on the newest Apple gadgets.(Also see: Airtel's Rs. 19,990 iPhone 7 Offer: All You Need to Know) However, some people who had not placed pre-orders were apparently turned away by stores.

The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s latest flagship, and it’s a super-size version of the iPhone 7. It has a lot in common with its immediate predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, but still controversial because of design decisions Apple made; namely, leaving out the headphone port. We’ve extensively tested this high-end model. Is it any good? Read this Apple iPhone 7 Plus review to find out. Build & Design Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is not a significant redesign from its recent predecessors. This look premiered with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, and then was used again on the 6S series in 2015, and now here it is again. There are tweaks in the new version, but anyone looking at this new model could easily confuse it for one released two years ago. It’s a fine design with rounded corners and moderate screen bezels, but Apple is reportedly putting all its design efforts into next year’s model, and seems to be coasting a bit with this one. To demonstrate, the iPhone 7 Plus is exactly the same size as the 6 Plus: 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. Still, this has advantages, as some cases won’t have to be redesigned, though ones made for last year’s model will have a superfluous headphone jack (more on that later). The new device is actually just a hair lighter: 6.63 vs. 6.77 ounces, but that’s not a noticeable amount. There are a couple of new color options: black and jet black, in addition to silver, gold, and rose gold. Space grey is no longer an option, but it’s close to black anyway. The 5.5 inch screen is what makes this iPhone a “Plus,” but it brings drawbacks. This is undoubtedly a big phone, and makes a noticeable bulge in a front pocket. Anyone carrying one in a back pocket risks breaking it by sitting on it. It’s more hassle to carry around than most of its rivals. The iPhone 7 Plus is available in five different colors. It’s waterproof, and that’s a welcomed change. But don’t go overboard with it… literally. This model is IP67 standard, which means it is protected against dust and can withstand immersion in water up to one meter deep. Basically, that means there’s no worry about the iPhone 7 Plus getting rained on, and it will survive an accidental drop into the pool. However, it’s hard to use the touch screen when it’s wet, and no one should even try using this phone underwater. Display The Apple iPhone 7 Plus display is the same 5.5 inch size and 1080 x 1920 pixel specs as its predecessor. Apple typically keeps phone screen resolutions the same for several years so third-party application developers don’t have to modify their apps with every new model. And Apple did increase the maximum brightness by about 30%, and improved the color range. This makes it easier to see outside than any of its predecessors; we were even able to read an ebook in direct sunlight with no problems. Although Apple didn’t increase the pixel density past 401 ppi, one could argue that it didn’t need to. While the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has an even higher pixel density topping 500 ppi, Apple’s offering already has so many pixels per inch than the human eye can’t make out individual pixels viewing it from an average distance, and therefore sees text and images displayed as smoothly and evenly as possible. At nearly 13 square inches, the display in the iPhone 7 Plus has over 35% more screen area than the iPhone 7. We find the iPhone 7 Plus to be a better option for watching video or playing games. People who need reading glasses can turn on options that will increase font sizes without overcrowding the larger display. Those who use their phone as their only mobile computer, rather than sporting both a phone and a tablet, owe it to themselves to consider whether they need the extra room. No phone supports the Apple Pencil; that’s reserved for the company’s iPad Pro line of tablets. Ports, Buttons, & Speakers The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has two rear-facing cameras. Easily the most controversial change Apple made with the iPhone 7 series is removing the dedicated headphone port, with the Lightning port taking over. A set of Lightning earbuds comes with this phablet, as well as an adapter so older headsets can still be used. There have been some complaints about the audio quality of the adapter, but we weren’t able to discern a difference between an MP3 played on the iPhone 7 Plus and the same file played on an iPhone 6S. The Lightning port continues to be the only charging and data port. As Apple won’t put memory card slots in its phones or tablets, users will need to turn to third-party options, like the ones from SanDisk and Lexar. Continuing with the controversies, the Home button on this new device isn’t really a button; it’s a capacitive area on the front, so it doesn’t move when pushed. There’s a slight vibration instead. This takes a small bit of getting used to, but not much. That said, using the phone while wearing gloves just got a bit more challenging. This “button” still functions as a fingerprint scanner for the Touch ID security system, taking the place of passwords for many functions, including unlocking the phone. This is generally quite reliable, correctly identifying proper fingerprints, and rejecting others. The exception is when the fingertip is wet; almost any amount of water severely downgrades the performance of this biometric scanner. Apple used the extra space freed up by removing the headphone port to add a second speaker. This offers stereo playback, but the speaker separation is tiny. Still, it does mean this device is capable of putting out a lot more sound than its predecessors. We had no problems hearing a TV show in a moderately noisy area, or using the speakerphone while driving. Camera The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has two 12-megapixel rear cameras, while the smaller iPhone 7 does not. One of these has a wide-angle lens with an ƒ/1.8 aperture, while the second has a telephoto lens with a ƒ/2.8 aperture. The inclusion of the second camera allows for a 2x optical zoom, which results in sharper images than the digital zoom provided by just about all other smartphones. Dual rear cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus One of the best photo effects isn’t available yet. Apple demoed a portrait mode in which the person being photographed is in focus but their background is blurred out, an effect typical of more expensive DSLRs and interchangeable lens cameras. This feature has been promised in a software update coming later this year. The rear camera supports 4K video recording at 30 fps, and there’s optical image stabilization for video and still images. The iPhone 7 Plus’ shooter functions well in dimly-lit areas, even with the flash off. The new quad-LED flash is brighter than the ones in previous iPhones, and does a nice job of lighting up dark areas. The front-facing camera is 7 MP with an ƒ/2.2 aperture, which is better than most main cameras from a few years ago. It supports 1080p video recording. Sample Pics Performance The iPhone 7 Plus is built around the A10 Fusion, Apple’s first quad-core smartphone processor. This includes two 64-bit 2.34 GHz CPU cores, along with a second slower pair dedicated to less demanding software, extending battery life. We ran the just-released Geekbench 4 test, and the score was 5590 on the multi-core test. This is the highest score of any Apple product, solidly outperforming even the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s 4750. The iPhone 7 Plus also beat the new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 on this test. Real world use bears up the benchmarks: the iPhone 7 Plus offers as good a performance as anyone can expect from a mobile computer. One of the controversies surrounding this model is the reports that some iPhone 7 models have an odd hiss when performing demanding tasks. This might be emitted when the new processor when strained, but we haven’t experienced this on our test unit. The iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM, a fairly generous amount. The smaller iPhone 7 has 2GB, and the only iOS device with more is the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Apple offers the iPhone 7 Plus with 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB of built-in storage. This is another welcome change, as it’s twice as much as its predecessor for the same prices. We feel that 32GB is plenty for people who don’t want to carry around a lot of multimedia files, but those with many MP3s or videos should choose the 128GB one at least.

An in-depth discussion of all the new features in this version is outside the scope of this hardware review, but we will say that the iPhone 7 Plus’ 5.5-inch display makes it an outstanding platform for the new iMessage features, like stickers and hand-drawn comments. Apple bundles its iWork suite of productivity applications with all new models, as well its iLife suite. Battery The Apple iPhone 7 Plus includes a 2,900 mAh battery, which Apple says is good for up to 15 hours of web browsing over a Wi-Fi connection. We put this model through our own grueling battery test, asking it to continuously stream video from Hulu over Wi-Fi with the backlight on 50%. The 7 Plus lasted 7 hours 43 minutes before the battery hit 0% and the device shut down. This is a “torture test” and is close to the shortest amount of time one can expect this model to last with extremely heavy use. In our real world use, even on the days we heavily used our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review unit during the testing period, we never once ran out of of power, or even got below 38%.  Days with lighter use typically ended with the battery at about 60%, indicating to us that this phone could go two days without needing to be charged, as long as it was used fairly moderately. Apple still refuses to support wireless charging for its devices, so the only way to power up the 7 Plus is to plug in a cable. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t charge particularly quickly. In our testing, a hour of charging increased the battery level by approx. 35%, so a full charge takes about three hours. Value The retail cost of the iPhone 7 Plus is $769 for the version with 32GB of built-in storage. For comparison, last year’s iPhone 6s Plus with the same capacity is now $649. On the other hand, the list price for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with 64GB is between $850 and $880. Although the iPhone 7 Plus is about $100 less than one of its top rivals, this has to be regarded as a very expensive product. Still, it is Apple’s flagship, and the best iOS phone on the market. Those who want top-of-the line will usually be willing to pay for it, but there are more affordable options. Conclusion Apple’s decision to forgo the headphone port has drawn the most attention, and controversy. However, there’s a lot to like in this model, such as a long battery life with speedy performance, an innovative camera, and water resistance. The new Home button takes some getting used to, though. An unusual issue with the iPhone 7 Plus is it’s competing with a model that hasn’t even been announced yet. Rumors about the 10th anniversary iPhone are already making the rounds, and it is shaping up to be a more revolutionary model than this one, which is very evolutionary. Those who can wait might consider holding off until 2017 to see what Apple has to offer.

Google is making a greater commitment to hardware in unveiling new phones, a smart speaker and other gadgets. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google's "hardware" push is still really about its software. On Tuesday, the technology giant unveiled a raft of new gizmos it proudly proclaimed to be #madebygoogle, including two smartphones and a smart home speaker. The message from Google is that it's a new and gadgety dawn for the tech firm, which has floundered a bit in its hardware efforts. But based on what the company showed off, Google still seems far behind despite earlier serious hardware efforts. It's easier to think of the new gadgets as follow-ups to competitor products: a competitor for Apple's iPhone and for Amazon's Echo speaker. Yes, making products is hard; much harder, perhaps, than asking people to use your free websites or download your apps. So is it too late for Google on hardware? Why should it even bother, when the smartphone world, in particular, is so crowded already? It's true that even Google probably couldn't just make an iPhone clone and expect instant success. But smartphones are evolving into something new. After years of trying to make phones that are the fastest, thinnest and lightest, companies now need to deliver something more to draw consumers to stores. Smartphones have essentially become a commodity, albeit a valuable one that acts as the central remote control for everything else in your life. Google, in taking a leaf from Apple's playbook to design both hardware and software from the ground up, gives itself a chance to break through in this second leg of the hardware relay race and lead the next one. And for Google, the it-factor in this race is its voice-activated Google Assistant. Listening between the lines of the prepared speeches Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that Google wants to make Assistant an essential in everyone's life. Chief executive Sundar Pichai even said, explicitly, that he sees us moving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world. In what was ostensibly a hardware event, the real promise of the presentations was one of a personalized Google that can answer questions about your life rather than a general query. Type "What am I doing next week?" into regular Google search, and you might get weekend productivity tips -- but not information about your next work trip. Assistant, if Google pulls it off, should be able to crawl through your calendar and give you the answer that you really need. Its conversational tone should also be able to deliver the right information, no matter what words you use to ask. That extends beyond what Amazon's Alexa can offer -- smart as it is, that voice assistant still answers queries based on the general Web more than on your personal digital information. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) And Siri, while plugged into your calendar, often doesn't understand what you're asking. Plus, Assistant isn't designed only for the smartphone. Google's decision to pair its Assistant-powered Home speaker with its Chromecast streaming dongles makes old tech new again, and responsive to voice commands for far cheaper than a new "smart" sound system or a smart TV. Assistant's many forms promises a low buy-in for homes to have the "Star Trek" computer -- the voice-activated assistant -- that we've always wanted. For consumers, an assistant plugged into the products we already use to run our lives is a big selling point. If Google offers nice hardware that really outshine others when it comes to integration with its popular software products -- Mail, Maps, etc. -- it could maybe pull a reverse-Apple and lead people to their hardware through their services. (Arguably, this could also be called pulling an Amazon.) In that sense, this hardware push isn't about Google straying from its software roots, but rather making the right package for them. Will it succeed? That's a difficult thing to say, of course. But going after both an aging, changing market in smartphones and the nascent smart home industry simultaneously is smart. That means you may come into the Googleverse through the Pixel phone, but you may also fall in love with the Home and then have that lead you to the phone. And it's certainly true that one can lead from behind. Getting serious about a product late doesn't necessarily mean getting counted out. Look at Apple and the iPad. Or Apple and the iPhone, for that matter. Still, this is by no means a slam-dunk for Google. Looking at its much-anticipated Tuesday hardware event, the only thing that really stands out is still its software -- which may raise questions about why they didn't just release it as an app that works on all phones. But if Google can really make good, logical hardware, it stands a better chance than most at upending a hardware market that's gotten a little stale.

Major update is that Binny Bansal, CEO at the e-commerce giant turned himself into a delivery boy to personally give out iPhone 7 units to select pre-order customers. Deliveries of Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus began at 7 pm IST on October 7 and the highlight here was Binny Bansal who was advertised by Flipkart to hand-deliver iPhone 7 consignments to select buyers in Bangalore. Why advertise with us? Related Apple iPhone 7 hits stores in India on October 7; price, specifications details Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon Festival Sale: Worst mistakes you would be doing and smart solutions to avoid it "Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal will be one among the delivery executives who will be delivering the iPhone 7 today starting at 7 PM in Bangalore. Who will be first lucky customer who will get the first phone today?" Flipkart said in an earlier statement. Apple iPhone 7 customers, having pre-ordered their phones through Flipkart can let us know if they saw Bansal at their doorsteps on October 7. As of now, Apple has chosen Flipkart as an authorised seller of iPhones in India. However, what is notable at this juncture is the fact that rival e-commerce company Snapdeal has also started taking official orders to deliver iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets across India. As a promotional offer, , consumers can avail discounts on the new phones through Snapdeal's on-going exchange offer with zero cost EMI option. American Express credit card holders get an additional Rs 10,000 cashback on booking Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Nonetheless, Flipkart's promotion of advertising Binny Bansal as a delivery executive captures the eyeballs and beats rivals hands-down. If you are looking at purchasing Apple's newest flagships, you can do so, but it is not known whether Bansal would personally deliver it to you now. Cost-wise, the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will set you back by Rs 60,000 (price of a 32GB edition). If you have got money to burn, then try going-in for a 256GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus that is priced at Rs 92,000.

They take a deep look at the educational framework of the school,” said Stefan Eady, assistant head of school for academic resources. “Darlington’s project-based learning curriculum, focus on STEAM and makerspace integration, and our professional development approach were all considered.” The Apple Distinguished School program opens a number of opportunities to Darlington Community, including additional resources for teachers as well as increased exposure for the school. “Prior to implementing our Apple pilot program, I served on a committee of Darlington teachers, students, and parents,” said Rebekah Kinney, technology integration coordinator. “We visited a number of Apple Distinguished Schools to learn about their programs and it’s amazing to see that we are now achieving this designation and will be able to host visits from schools who are where we were six years ago.” As part of the application process, information technology staff members prepared an interactive e-book that outlines the school’s technology implementation program and integration of Apple products. This book will soon be trademarked and available for download in the iBooks Store. Chef Greg Paulson, and his wife Beth, stand in front of Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny, Ireland, with the culinary students that participated in the “Irish Food and Cuisine” course. Media release: Chef Greg Paulson, director of Culinary Arts at Georgia Northwestern Technical College (GNTC), has always brought international cooking techniques to his kitchen-lab to teach students the various cooking methods used in other countries.This summer, he exposed students to Irish cuisine by bringing them to Ireland. The ten-day course “Irish Food and Culture,” was taught at the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) in Waterford, Ireland, just outside of Dublin. Ten students took part in the chance-of-a-lifetime course which also included field trips to various markets, restaurants, butcheries, fromage (cheese) shops, famous landmarks, castles, and beaches. Georgia Northwestern was the first college in the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) to take part in the international agreement between the Waterford Institute of Technology and the TCSG. According to Paulson, one of the primary reasons GNTC was chosen was because TCSG officials were impressed by the culinary lunches that the Culinary Arts program offers to the public, which feature international cuisine. “Dr. Ian Bond, executive director of the International Center at TCSG, was very impressed with our ‘Fundamentals of Restaurant Operations’ course,” said Paulson. “As part of this course the students create the menu, prepare the food, serve it to the public, and interact with the customers.”         The Culinary Arts program is taught in the Woodlee Building on the Floyd County Campus of GNTC. The building is an early 20th century dwelling that has been renovated and updated to include a first-class teaching kitchen, commercial-grade equipment, and a refined serving area. Paulson says that he is entertaining the thought of doing a nine-day course in France and Germany in the future and hopefully making international experiences an ongoing part of the program.     Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Related Filed Under: Bartow, Education, Gordon, Polk ← Ware Mechanical forecast: Wind gusts up to 30 mph possible today from Hurricane, but no rain.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Apple  has a tough act to follow after the success of the iPhone 6, but sales are expected to benefit this year from the inclusion of the Chinese market, where the gadget’s debut was delayed in 2014 due to regulatory issues. With one of Apple’s largest markets in the fold, analysts expect the company to sell about 12 million to 13 million phones in the first weekend of availability, up from more than 10 million last year. Eager from San Francisco to London to Sydney have camped out for days prior to the release, and Apple said earlier this month that based on pre-orders, sales of its new phones were on pace to beat last year’s first weekend performance. “The stage is set for Apple to show year-over-year growth over the Herculean iPhone 6 sales,” FBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives said. Apple relies heavily on the sale of its flagship iPhones, which generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue in the latest quarter. First released in 2007, the iPhone is Apple’s best-selling device ever. After a dramatic redesign last year in which Apple enlarged the iPhone’s screen and added mobile payments, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus boast more modest improvements. The phones, which are the same size as last year’s models, feature improved cameras and 3D touch, a display technology that responds according to how hard users press their screens. Apple executives have said just a fraction of their customers have upgraded to the iPhone 6, suggesting they have plenty of room to grow this year. And lackluster offerings this year from rival smartphone manufacturer Samsung will help Apple’s stand out in the marketplace, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy wrote in an email. “Over the long haul, the 6s will eclipse the 6 as Apple is even more competitive versus Samsung in emerging regions and is gaining share in traditional regions,” Moorhead wrote in an email. “Samsung didn’t bring a whole lot of compelling features to consumers with their new lines of phones.” The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which start at $199 and $299 with a two-year contract with a mobile service provider, will be available on Friday in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Adam Howell, Phoneys' creator, says that he was told by Apple that: The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps... Howell was given until this Thursday to change his stickers. Howell decided not to change them and the stickers were pulled from sale. Today, Howell published a follow-up that provides interesting insights into the early iMessage App Store from the perspective of an app that sat in the #1 paid spot for eight days in a row. Phoneys, which cost $0.99, netted $23,206 in the eleven days it was available and drew nearly two million impressions. The high number of impressions were driven by Phoneys' spot in the Top Paid chart, but conversion rates were highest from customers who tapped a link to Phoneys from Howell's and other websites, highlighting importance of marketing outside the App Store. Howell makes a number of other interesting observations about selling stickers in the iMessage App Store including that: Right now, depending on the day of the week, 1,000–1,500 sales a day will make your app #1 Top Paid in the iMessage App Store. Around $2,500-$3,000 dollars in sales a day will make your app #1 Top Grossing in the iMessage App Store. Being featured on the iMessage App Store home screen will get your app around 150,000-200,000 impressions a day, but unless you’re on the top paid or top free chart, it won’t drive very many conversions (I’ve talked to several folks whose stickers are currently being featured that back this up). Howell's data reflects the performance of just one sticker pack that was available for less than two weeks, but given its success during that brief period, Phoneys is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the early iMessage App Store. I highly recommend reading Howell's full post.

Under this offer, the telecom operator will provide unlimited local and STD calls, free roaming, and free data (5GB, 10GB or 15GB, as per the plan you choose) under a new postpaid plan. The offer, however, is available only to customers in Noida and Karnataka, according to the Airtel website. An Airtel representative whom Gadgets 360 spoke to said that this plan is under “testing” in these regions.Update, 10 October 2016: Sources have reiterated to Gadgets 360 that the offer is available only in Delhi and Bengaluru, and added it's for select enterprise customers only. Meanwhile, Airtel has issued the following official statement with respect to the said plans: We understand that there is some confusion regarding two separate offers from Airtel on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.   There is a special 10 GB per month free additional data offer with any Airtel Infinity plan with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. The offer is open for all customers and is very much active. There is also a device lease plan, which is being piloted for employees of select enterprise customers, and this offer is also very much active. In the interest of customers and to avoid any further confusion, relevant changes are being made to the website. These will reflect shortly. As part of this plan, new and existing Airtel customers can opt for the ‘iPhone for Life’ plan by making a down payment to get their iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The remaining amount will be paid for by Bajaj Finance Limited. Customers can choose between either of three postpaid plans mentioned below, and can switch the plans when they wish to. They must remain subscribed to the ‘iPhone for Life’ plan for one year.(Also see: Top 10 Features of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus) During the one year period, customers will not be able to port to another network, switch to non-‘iPhone for Life’ plans (either postpaid or prepaid), terminate the services, or transfer ownership of neither the plan nor the iPhone to someone else. However, customers have the option to foreclose the loan from Bajaj Finance by paying the charges that the company levies. After the completion of one year, the iPhone 7 users will have two options: either to upgrade to the next version of the iPhone or to buy the handset they are using by making a balloon payment. Following are the down payment options as well as the corresponding balloon payments under this plan. Additionally, if a customer does not visit an Airtel store to return the iPhone 7 or upgrade it, Bajaj Finance will automatically debit the balloon payment amount from their bank account at the end of the thirteenth month. The users can then keep the handset with themselves. (Also see: Buying iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus? Here Are the Discounts You Can Still Get) However, Airtel has not mentioned the charges, if any, will be levied to ‘iPhone for Life’ subscribers who want to upgrade to next year’s iPhone. Moreover, Airtel has the option to refuse the upgrade to users who have damaged the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus units given to them under this plan. Users can be refused an upgrade if the iPhone unit given to them is returned with damaged or missing part, heavy wear and tear, or non-standard components. In order to upgrade or return the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, customers have to visit an Airtel store within 30 days of the completion of their year-long rental period. They can then also decide to go for another postpaid plan; if they do not state which postpaid plan they wish to subscribe to, Airtel will continue with their existing plan, but at a lower rate. According to Airtel’s website, the Rs. 1,999 plan would then cost Rs. 1,199, the Rs 2,499 plan would go down to Rs 1,599, and the charges for the Rs 2,999 plan will become Rs 1,999 per month. (Also see: Apple iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) The ‘iPhone for Life’ plan cannot be clubbed with other offers that Airtel is running. Airtel’s offer comes around the same time Reliance Jio announced that it will offer iPhone users free calling and 4G data a total of 15 months, or an extra year after the welcome offer expires for everyone else. Under this offer, Reliance Jio users will get unlimited local, STD and national roaming voice calls, 20GB of 4G data, unlimited 4G data usage at night, 40GB of Wi-Fi data at Jio hotspots, unlimited SMS, and subscription to Jio's apps. The company pegs the value of all this at Rs. 18,000. Enterprise customers get an additional discount of 25 percent. This year's iPhone models come in three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The 32GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 60,000, while the 128GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 70,000, and the 256GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 80,000. The 32GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 72,000, the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 82,000, while the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 92,000.

All new iPhone users on Jio network can avail this offer from January 1 next year after their ‘welcome plan’ expires on 31 December, 2016. Under this new scheme, the iPhone users on Jio’s network will receive one year of complimentary services, sources said. This means people who buy any iPhone device from Reliance Retail or Apple store and use Jio connection would get the ‘Welcome Offer’ completely free till December 31, 2016. From January 1, all these iPhone users will get the Rs. 1,499 plan completely free for 1 year, which equals value worth Rs 18,000. The Rs 1,499 plan includes unlimited local and STD voice calling and national roaming, 4G Data of up to 20 GB, unlimited 4G data at night, 40GB of WiFi data, unlimited SMS and unlimited Jio Apps subscription.

The Jio offer is not restricted only to newly launched iPhone 7 and 7-Plus and would also be valid on iPhone 6, 6-Plus, 6S-Plus, SE. Also, for the first time ever, enterprise customers will get a 25 per cent discount on the device and attractive tariff plans. Jio is a 4G-only network, as compared to all other networks in India that are 100 per cent 2G, 50 per cent 3G and 10 per cent 4G. Apple users on Jio network would get to enjoy 100 per cent 4G-data experience, High Definition voice calls (powered by VoLTE), High Definition Facetime calls, Buffer-free HD video viewing and 300 channels of Live TV. Reliance Jio’s rival Airtel is also offering 10GB free 4G/3G data per month for one year with any Airtel Infinity post-paid plan. The free data benefit will be over and above the plan benefits, it said. “We are delighted to roll out this exciting data offer for our users to allow them to get the most out of the amazing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus,” Bharti Airtel Director Operations (India and South Asia) Ajai Puri said. The latest edition of the iPhone has been launched in India on Friday across multiple platforms like Apple resellers, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Tata Cliq. Most of these companies are bundling in offers to woo customers in the world’s second largest telephony market. While Snapdeal has teamed up with American Express to offer the latter’s card members a discount of Rs 10,000 on the purchase of the device. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants in silver, gold and rose gold colours. The new jet black colour variant will come only in 128GB and 256GB variants. While the 32GB phone will be available for Rs. 60,000, the pricing of the other models has not been disclosed. iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D touch, while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 3D touch. Both the smartphones are powered by a new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor, which it claims is 40 per cent faster than the previous generation. The iOS 10-powered iPhone 7 sports a 12MP iSight camera and 4K video recording. The iPhone 7 Plus has dual 12MP rear cameras – one wide-angle and a telephoto lens. The handsets come with IP67 rating, signifying the fact that it is water and dust resistant, a first for the Apple smartphone. The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets.

Spotify and Apple Music get unofficial mixes, the best part of SoundCloud Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story Buying Washio’s assets, Rinse cleans up part of the on-demand laundry market SoundCloud’s big differentiator is its offering of unofficial, user-uploaded content that the major labels don’t release and that isn’t on Spotify or Apple Music. Or at least they weren’t. The first unofficial single-track remixes just went live on Spotify and Apple Music thanks to their partnerships with music rights management service Dubset. Apple struck a deal with Dubset in March, and Spotify did in May, BPMSupreme reported. But the remixes are finally beginning to stream today, starting with this DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of Anderson .Paak. We’ve reached out to Spotify and Apple for comment. [Update: Spotify confirms that short-form mixes are now available. This is apparently just a small part of its integration with Dubset. It says the bigger part is when long-form mixed content becomes available, but there’s no definite timing on that.] Still missing are the multi-song mixsets DJs often share from their gigs. But Dubset is also equipped to distribute royalties from those and its deals permit them. Dubset CEO Stephen White tells me “Mixes are coming next!” Dubset works by scanning an entire mix and matching every part of the track to its Mixbank of snippets of official songs based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. Dubset matches the samples in a mix to these snippets, then distributes royalties for the play evenly to the original rights holders. In this case, Anderson .Paak’s rights holders would get paid because his music is the basis of Jazzy Jeff’s remix. White says 700 million people a month listen to mixed content, making it a big opportunity. But record labels have historically fought against unofficial mixes because they considered them piracy since they weren’t getting paid. Dubset gives them a fair share, so they’ll permit remixes and mix sets to stream on the major platforms. Royalty revenue from the platform is shared with rights holders while Dubset gets a cut. “Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with,” White tells me. This “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid!” The fact that unofficial content is now going live on Spotify and Apple Music could reduce the acquisition potential for SoundCloud, which the Financial Times says is in late-stage negotiations to be bought by Spotify. TechCrunch’s sources confirm the two have recently been talking about M&A. But if Spotify can get the best of SoundCloud’s content without coughing up a ton of money for a broken company that’s been struggling for years… Without the legal grey area of music as a differentiator, Spotify and Apple Music will end up competing on product features like Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and Apple’s Beats 1 live radio station, as well as on exclusives and early access to big releases from top artists. The real winners here, though, are the artists and listeners. Original rights owners will get paid, remix producers and mixset DJs can share their creativity without being pirates and listeners can hear the music they want no matter how it got made. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Music Description All the ways you love music.

By Leslie P. Norton and Crystal Kim Biography Updated Oct. 8, 2016 10:58 a.m. ET For decades, the derision aimed at “socially responsible” investing was palpable. It was a style of investing that brought to mind visions of the Summer of Love and no-nukes sit-ins, earning the disdain of many on Wall Street. But the times they are a-changed, and investing with an eye toward companies with sustainable business practices is now considered, well, just good business. A company’s efforts toward sustainability, such as fair labor practices, good environmental stewardship, and diverse internal leadership, improves returns, according to research by index provider MSCI. And funds that invest in these sustainable companies are top performers themselves, Barron’s finds in our first annual performance ranking of the 200 most sustainable funds. (SEE THE FULL LIST HERE.) That shouldn’t be a surprise, though it might be to some—including the fund managers themselves. Of the 50 sustainable funds on our list that beat the market in the past year, all but one eschew the term. “Sustainability? What’s that?” queries Jack Murphy of Levin Capital Strategies, who co-manages No. 1 performer Transamerica Large Cap Value (ticker: TWQAX). Good question: What exactly is “sustainability?” It’s a broad term that encompasses corporate management that is ethical, efficient, and long-term focused. Also called ESG investing—for environmental, social, and governance factors—it has been demonstrated time and again that companies that embrace this type of good management outperform their peers. Companies that ignore ESG factors do so at their peril. Cutting corners on environmental issues, for instance, can lead to lawsuits, fines, and damages. Businesses that use less water and less power have lower costs and operate more efficiently. Good corporate governance plays a winning hand in capital allocation and is critical to corporate longevity. “If a company is being managed for the short term to maximize revenue, that’s not sustainable,” says Phil Davidson, co-manager of American Century Equity Income (TWEIX), No. 3 on our list. Sustainable practices, in other words, predispose companies to outperform. Some 80% of Standard & Poor’s 500 companies now issue sustainability reports, which provide information on their economic, environmental, social, and governance performance. In the 1990s, just a handful did. Campaigns led by sustainable investors helped break apartheid in South Africa and forced Nike NKE 0.7541178805318516% Nike Inc.

Apple changed its practices; Volkswagen was slapped with billions of dollars in penalties. A growing number of data providers are rating companies on metrics of sustainability. Indexes of sustainable companies have popped up, including some from Dow Jones, which owns Barron’s, and three from Morningstar. INVESTORS ARE EMBRACING this approach. From 2012 to 2014, sustainably invested assets in the U.S.—including mutual funds, separate accounts, and institutional assets with a sustainable mandate—rose 76%, to nearly $6.6 trillion, or one of every six dollars under professional management in the U.S., according to the Forum for Sustainable & Responsible Investment. That means there’s more money invested with an eye toward sustainability than there is in the entire exchange-traded fund industry and the hedge fund industry combined, according to Tiburon Strategic Advisors. The amount of money on the planet that is sustainably invested is an eye-popping $21.4 trillion. “This is one of the few segments of active management that’s not losing to ETFs” and where asset growth is still accelerating, says Tom Manning, CEO of Wellesley, Mass.–based F.L.Putnam Investment Management, a financial advisor that oversees $980 million in sustainable stocks and bonds. The prospect that sustainable funds will change society isn’t far-fetched. Tiburon found that 85% of millennials and 77% of women are very interested in such investing, versus 61% of men. Millennials are “more socially concerned and active than any generation of young people since the 1960s,” says Robert Zevin, regarded as the father of socially responsible investing and the founder of Boston-based Zevin Asset Management. “The mood of the whole country is much more concerned with environmental and economic-justice issues. People feel they can address these as investors and in other parts of their lives.” It’s not just investors driving the change. “It’s driven by consumers and investors, but there’s also internal interest—well-educated professionals who work for major companies take these issues seriously,” says Jon Hale, head of sustainability research for Morningstar. “It no longer feels cynical.” LIKE THE REST OF THE FUND UNIVERSE, sustainable funds come in all shapes and sizes. Morningstar’s database includes 225 funds with some sort of sustainable mandate; they have $182 billion in assets. But “sustainable” is an umbrella term for a variety of investment styles. The oldest and perhaps best-known carry the moniker “socially responsible investing.” SRI funds tend to exclude companies that negatively affect society.

Domini Social Equity (DSEFX), from the firm co-founded by Amy Domini, a doyenne of socially responsible investing, doesn’t invest in tobacco, alcohol, gaming, weapons, nuclear energy, oil, gas, or coal. That fund landed at No. 187. The next iteration, ESG funds, focus on what companies are doing right, favoring those with the best environmental, social, and governance practices across their industries. This is true stock-picking, and it has room for different philosophies. Some ESG managers will exclude entire industries, such as fossil fuel or nuclear power, whereas others will choose the best companies in such industries—an energy outfit that had nothing to do with BP BP.LN -2.2392457277548616% BP PLC ADR U.S.: NYSE USD33.18 -0.76 -2.2392457277548616% /Date(1478901703903-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 6580538 AFTER HOURS USD33.22 0.04 0.12055455093429777% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 17545 P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 103664273537.658 Dividend Yield 7.233273056057866% Rev. per Employee 2161480 More quote details and news » BP.LN in Your Value Your Change Short position ’s oil spill, for instance, or a semiconductor manufacturer that stands above its peers by recycling the water it uses. Other funds adhere to religious or political principles. The Amana funds follow Shariah principles in the Koran, which preclude them from investing in alcohol and tobacco producers and money lenders. The Catholic-oriented Ave Maria funds won’t invest in corporations that facilitate abortion or embryonic stem-cell research, ruling out most drug and biotech companies, hospitals, and health insurers. They also prefer companies that don’t offer benefits to same-sex couples. BUT WHAT IS PERHAPS most interesting is how mainstream sustainable investing is becoming—so much so that many funds that don’t wear the label still embrace the practice.

Research firm Sustainalytics evaluates the sustainability of 6,500 companies worldwide using more than 100 of ESG factors, as well as incidences of environmental accidents, fraud, or discriminatory behavior. Morningstar has partnered with Sustainalytics to use its data to assess 20,000 funds, giving them a sustainability score based on their portfolio holdings. Barron’s took this a step further. To see if sustainable funds—whether they call themselves that or not—can really outperform others, we used the Morningstar data to screen for large-company U.S. stock funds (the ones most widely held by U.S. investors) that had sustainability grades of “above average” or “high.” In comparison, an S&P 500 index fund has an “average” sustainability rating. We threw out any with assets of less than $300 million, and came up with a list of 200, with $1 trillion in total assets. We then ranked them by one-year performance. The list was top-heavy with value funds. But it also yielded some surprising findings. It includes well-regarded investors, such as Chris Davis of Davis Advisors, Bruce Baughman of Franklin Templeton, and the folks at Mairs & Power—none of whom you’d associate with even a faint whiff of patchouli. Indeed, our sustainable group performed better than most large-cap funds, returning 13.4% over the past 12 months, versus 11.9% for the category. True, that’s below the S&P 500’s blistering 15.4%, but even here these sustainable funds shone: 50, or 25%, did beat the S&P, compared with just 12% of all actively managed large-cap funds. Also startling: We had to go through quite a few funds before we found one that actually identifies itself as sustainable, and that is Jerome Dodson’s Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), at No. 7. Dodson, one of the great stockpickers of this century, unabashedly embraces the sustainable moniker. Perhaps his confidence comes from the fact that he’s one of just a handful of pros who has topped the S&P 500, year in and year out. (He was featured in a Barron’s cover story early this year, “The Market Beaters,” Jan. 9.) Some pillars of sustainability, however, such as Domini Social Investments and Calvert Investments, landed at the bottom of our list. Meanwhile, of the 44 sustainable large-cap funds, 25 didn’t make the list at all. Ten were eliminated because their portfolios weren’t sustainable enough—earning an average or even below-average ratings from Morningstar. In the accompanying article “Who’s Not on the List, and Why”, we explain further. Indeed, many fund managers on our list didn’t realize that their funds might appeal to sustainable investors. “This is interesting to hear—the fund is not marketed or positioned that way!” exclaims Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital, whose SkyBridge Dividend Value (SKYIX) was up 21% in the past year, placing it at No. 5. It owns 10 of the Dow’s highest-yielding stocks, and an additional couple of dozen that rank highly on profitability, valuation, and yield.

For a company to be considered for the portfolio, it must have had a 15% return on equity, every year for 10 years.

It has always been baked into our analysis.” And what happens when, as night follows day, blue chips fall from favor? In such periods, these funds probably will trail the market. But chosen well, stocks of sustainable companies will beat the averages over the long haul. So will the funds that own them.

Now we have* The Orchard, which was announced through a vague mission statement on Apple.com and through select Apple employee call-to-actions Tweets.

At best, it looks like a talent incubator for marketing professionals. The Orchard's special page on the website is was very odd.  Apple has taken down the description since I started writing this piece and one hopes someone wasn't just fired. But there are some Tweets to reference the oddness of the language.

In an 8-3 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Together, the two cases are the remnants of a global legal battle between the world's biggest makers of smartphones that began in April 2011 and at one point spanned four continents. In this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to make phone calls. The bulk of the award, $98.7 million, was for the detection patent that the earlier panel said wasn't infringed. The February decision also said the other two patents were invalid. That was a wrong decision, the court ruled Friday, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. The opinion was a surprise -- the court never announced that it would consider the case before all active judges prior to issuing the opinion. In a dissent, Circuit Judge Timothy Dyk objected to the full court opting to take on the case without allowing additional legal arguments, saying the majority opinion results in "profound changes" in the analysis of whether patents cover obvious variations of earlier ideas. The three judges who objected to the majority opinion were the same ones who had thrown out the verdict in February. Dyk said the panel "has continuingly expressed willingness, and indeed desire" to remove the information that the majority objected to, saying it wasn't necessary to the original decision. The Federal Circuit handles all patent appeals in the U.S., so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Trump plans to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants Oregon medical examiner identifies remains as daughter of Piano Guy George Pyle: By backing Trump, after all, Mormons blow their moral lead Utah football: After wild weekend, Utes have two 'Super Bowls' remaining to secure lofty goals Steven Pearlstein: Trump is about to face a rude awakening over Obamacare ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal wore delivery boys' hat to personally deliver the latest iPhones at the doorsteps of some customers in Bengaluru yesterday. The e-tailer claimed that it has made special arrangements to ensure delivery of the new iPhones at customers' doorsteps from 7pm onwards. Late last month, Apple tied up with the country's top e-tailer to sell the two new smartphones. Flipkart will source iPhone 7 directly from Apple, unlike previous years when it would source the phones from third-party sellers. This is the first time that Apple has partnered with Flipkart.

Picture by Terry Harris 07:00 Saturday 08 October 2016 0 Have your say While it might prove unlucky for some, the 13th annual Apple Day proved to have a wide a-peel to visitors. Stamford Community Orchard Group hosted its annual Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre and it proved as popular as ever to people from across the area - except for a short time in the afternoon when a heavy burst of rain kept people from coming in and those who were already in, from leaving! Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre. The East of England Apple and Orchards Project brought along many different varieties of apple for people to see and sample and experts were also on hand to identify some of the apples visitors brought with them. This proved popular with the experts run off their feet for most of the day. Members of the community orchard group also shared their advice on how to look after your own apple trees, while there was also lots of crafts and fun games for children - including of course, apple bobbing. Stallholders were also there selling a range of products. But for chairman of the Stamford Community Orchard Group Annie Hall, the highlight was seeing the look of pure joy on a youngster’s face when he realised he had won a competition to guess the number of apples in a basket. With guesses ranging from 20 to 79, it was nine-year-old Finley’s guess of 30 which meant he secured a book token and some delicious apples of his own to enjoy. Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre. Annie said: “It was once again enormous fun - we had a lot more people bringing in their apples so the experts were kept very busy identifying them all. In fact, they’ve never been so busy.” Annie also thanked all the volunteers without whom this day just can’t happen and to businesses which gave tombola prizes. She paid particular thanks to Stamford Arts Centre for hosting the event.

The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung’s infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Watch all our tech videos below Friday’s decision was made by the full slate of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow US Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.

Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday’s decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday’s ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. Related: Apple told to pay $302 mn in damages to US patent firm “But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward – and it’s a big win for Apple.” The case is Apple Inc v.

After receiving a stupendous response from 28 countries in the first phase, beginning from 16 September and additional 30 countries from 24 September, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus finally arrived in India and the mood was upbeat. “I want to thank Apple enthusiasts for breaking all records with the new iPhone 7 launch. This launch is beyond comparison in India. This is iPhone 7, after all,” Mikey Todd, managing director, iZenica, Apple Premium Reseller in India, told IANS. Available in silver, gold, rose gold and the new black finish (jet black), iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB models, starting at Rs 60,000. For Neha Rana, 24, holding her very own iPhone 7 was worth a long wait. “Getting an iPhone on the very first day before others means a lot. My heart skipped several beats as I held it for the first time. It’s like carrying the most classy brand in your pocket which speaks on its own,” Rana, who got the device from the iZenica Apple Store at GIP Mall here, told IANS. iPhone 7 has water and dust resistance, dual-lens camera (in iPhone 7 Plus), a pressure-sensitive home button, 7MP HD front camera and 12MP rear main camera. “For me, it is yet another repackaged iPhone 6s with a few bumped up specifications. New Apple products feel more like recycled ideas than innovation. Having said it, I am still buying an iPhone 7 because the black looks sleek,” Haroon Shergill, an Apple lover, told IANS as he waited patiently for his turn at the store. According to industry analysts, since the festive season is on and Diwali falls on 30 October, this is a strategic time for Apple to register better iPhone 7 sales in the country. “With this, Apple will have three-four weeks of solid festive momentum. Last year, Apple launched iPhone models on 16 October in India. This year, the company will have more time-frame to register better sales figures,” Tarun Pathak, senior analyst, Mobile Devices and Ecosystems at New Delhi-based Counterpoint Research, told IANS. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently announced to soon open retail stores in the country — a move that brings to the fore the global importance of the burgeoning Indian smartphone market. “India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51 percent year on year. We’re looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road and we see huge potential for that vibrant country,” Cook had said.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple should acquire Twitter Nate Swanner - Oct 7, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit With Google and Disney bowing out — and Salesforce throwing cold water on a deal — Twitter’s acquisition hopes seem dead on arrival. Though an internal struggle over any acquisition may be bubbling, there’s one company that remains a dark horse; a company that has every reason to want a news platform that moves at the speed of light, but has a social layer attached along with some streaming media add-ons. Yup, we’re talking about Apple. It’s not crazy Let’s break down what Twitter is in 2016. You’ve obviously got social, but that’s sputtering along. Twitter has gone so far as to rebrand itself as a news app in the App and Play Stores to distance itself from social. Still, social matters. Twitter has looped in several social tricks like contextual stickers and longer video playback to help encourage people to actually use it. Twitter is also a video streaming service. Remember that chatter about Apple wanting to start its own TV service, but having trouble striking deals with networks or entities like the NFL? There’s nothing wrong with buying your way in. Its main focus is now news, and Apple News could use something that makes it more real-time. Alerts might surface news items once a journalist hits ‘publish,’ but that’s a lot of obfuscation between ‘breaking’ and ‘happened.’ right now, Apple News is basically Flipboard — but it can (and should0 be more. Twitter fits that mold nicely. The rest of Twitter When we hear ‘Twitter may be acquired’ we narrow our scope to the streaming service we interact with (maybe?) daily. There’s more to Twitter, though. Vine is a good bit of fun, but also recently expanded its scope to become more than a six-second looping video feed. In letting users submit video that’s about two minutes long, there’s a lot of synergy between it and Twitter that the company hasn’t yet seized. Periscope is to video what Twitter is for 140-characters. It’s punchy, immediate and downright easy to master. Its real-time, contextual aim is a winning proposition for a company that wants to get into the news and streaming video game as Apple does. And there’s a heavy developer angle to Twitter. Fabric, the company’s dev-centric toolkit, would make a tidy home inside of Apple. While some of the third-party workarounds may be lost (unless Apple also buys Stripe, which lol no), the framework is there for Apple to re-position Fabric as internal tools for developers. Think TestFlight, which Apple bought and — more or less — left alone. You probably wouldn’t even know it was coming, either Do you know how many startups and companies Apple acquires in a given year? No, you don’t — nobody outside the company really does. While Apple couldn’t avoid a very Beats-like public spectacle in buying Twitter, it might be kicking the tires incognito. With Beats, Apple was poised to revamp iTunes into streaming, so all eyes were on its next move.Twitter, though — Twitter is unnecessary. Apple could very well build what Twitter has, it would just take time. The downside there is time itself. We don’t want to wait for Apple to figure out streaming deals and how to capture real-time news or if there’s a good social sharing platform it can think of (we blast it for trying social, but we still give it a shot when there’s something like Ping or Connect ). The time is now. And while Twitter stock is at an all-time low, I say but the company and keep the executives tweeting.
